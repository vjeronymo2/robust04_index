			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stepping Down of Prime Minister Hosokawa Is </F> Inevitable"]    [Text] On 8 April, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  officially announced his intention to resign as prime minister.    In explaining the reason for his resignation, the prime  minister revealed that a "new fact concerning a legal problem  has come to light" in connection with the management of his  personal funds which he had entrusted to one of his friends for  several years since 1981. He added that he would take moral  responsibility in his capacity as the country's highest-ranking  political leader.    The prime minister made bold to announce a new political and  ethical issue concern himself; this had not been mentioned in  arguments over the so-called "Hosokawa suspicions," which  include his 100 million yen loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin  company. He cited the new issue as the reason why he will  resign as top state leader. In a sense, this approach left a  clean impression.    However, let us think about this for a while. How many  people in Japan are satisfied with the reason the prime minister  gave for his resignation?    Over the past several months, Prime Minister Hosokawa  continued to refuse calls by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] for his cooperation in  revealing the truth regarding his 100million yen loan from  Sagawa Kyubin and the alleged purchase of shares in Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), which he reiterated was  conducted by his late father-in-law. Specifically, the prime  minister has rejected demands that new documents concerning the  suspicions be submitted to the Diet and that Masatoshi  Miyama--former secretary to the prime minister whom the prime  minister himself admitted was deeply involved in those  activities--be summoned to the Diet as a sworn witness.  <H5>  A Palliative Reason for Resignation </H5>   We had asked why the prime minister refused to cooperate  with  the opposition parties in summoning his former secretary if he  denied all allegations and had no qualms of conscience.  Moreover, we maintained that the prime minister should have  positively dispelled suspicions surrounding himself and put  state affairs, including budget deliberations, on the right  track as soon as possible.    Nevertheless, the prime minister had stuck to his refusal to  summon his former secretary to the Diet. When the prospects for  breaking the impasse in Diet business became quite uncertain, he  had no choice but to step down.    Judging from these circumstances, it is quite obvious that  the direct reason for the prime minister's resignation lies in  "Hosokawa suspicions" themselves, which have been discussed at  Diet sessions.    Nevertheless, the prime minister's stance of bringing up  another case, of which he cannot give clear details, and citing  it as the reason for his resignation is far from "clean"; it is  nothing other than palliative.    The prime minister is to resign. However, it does not follow  that suspicions regarding the prime minister have been cleared.  It is unforgivable to use the resignation for "concealing  suspicions." The prime minister bears political and moral  responsibility to cooperate in making public the truth regarding  all issues of concern, including the new item he has brought up,  in the future as well.    Amid the public outcry over corruption concerning  money-oriented politics under the LDP administration, the  Hosokawa coalition administration was established under the  banner of "political reform." Prime Minister Hosokawa is, so to  speak, a "child of political reform," whose largest mission is  the carrying out of political reform. The prime minister  gallantly emerged at the forefront of the political arena,  enjoying the expectations and trust of the general public, who  were quite disgusted at the LDP's tainted, corrupt politics and  maximized their distrust of politics.    We cannot help saying it is an irony of history that Prime  Minister Hosokawa himself stumbled due to his own problems  concerning political ethics, and that he has been forced to step  down, digging his own grave.    The prime minister himself probably feels regret. However,  for the people whose hopes have been disappointed, the current  situation is probably more than they can possibly bear.    Although it seems that we are trying to attack an already  overwhelmed prime minister who announced his intention to  resign, we have one more thing to say. His receipt of a 100  million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, alleged purchase of NTT  shares, and the new issue regarding management of his personal  funds are incidents which occurred several years before Mr.  Hosokawa accepted the offer to become prime minister.    At a time when the Sagawa scandal became a focus of  attention  and the scandal involving former LDP Vice President Kanemaru  gave a severe shock to the political world, why did he make the  decision to become prime minister before closely examining his  own private affairs?    Although the prime minister had a close relationship with  one  of the central figures of the Sagawa scandal involving persons  in the center of the political world, and he acknowledged the  existence of a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa, he became the  master of the "political reform administration." We are  completely baffled by the ethics of such a situation.    When looking at the matter from a different angle, we have  to  point out the questionable fact that the "political reform  administration" itself was formed centering on those who were in  the center of the LDP's money-oriented political world, and that  they still occupy leading posts even after the establishment of  the administration.  <H5>  Prime Minister Hosokawa's Last, Valuable Legacy </H5>   "The stepping down of Prime Minister Hosokawa" has proved  that the inverse logic of the situation--that as long as the  prime minister masquerades under the good name of "political  reform" and endorses "political reform," he is exempt from  responsibility for his past misdeeds--is unjustifiable.    The selection of a "successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa"  will probably face difficulties in connection with a struggle of  party interests among the coalition parties. The parties  concerned should decide on a new administration to replace the  Hosokawa administration while keeping the above in mind as Prime  Minister Hosokawa's valuable legacy.    Following the prime minister's declaration to step down, the  Hosokawa administration will come to an end only eight months  after its inauguration.    The administration has been generally regarded from its  inception as an interim administration for materializing  political reform. It was still unable to pave the way for  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget after enacting political  reform bills. The administration will go out of power after  truly carrying out its mission as an "administration that  carries out one task."    LDP-led administrations tackled political reform for the  past  six years, but failed to carry it out. Both the Kaifu and  Miyazawa administrations collapsed due to their failure to carry  out political reform.    While experiencing many twists and turns, Prime Minister  Hosokawa, at any rate, maintained the unity of a carriage being  pulled by eight horses [seven parties and one parliamentary  group of the coalition] under the banner of "political reform,"  and carried out the enactment of political reform bills, which  the LDP administrations were unable to do. We should  straightforwardly appraise this achievement.    There was little possibility that without Mr. Hosokawa,  seven  parties and one parliamentary group could have been united amid  complicated bargaining concerning party interests and policies  in the course of establishing the coalition administration.  Taking this into consideration, we are sure that Mr. Hosokawa  will leave his name in history as a person who brought about a  great change in postwar politics by putting an end to the LDP  administration which had enjoyed one-party rule for 38 years.    Among the achievements of the "Hosokawa administration," for  which the people could not cherish expectations under the LDP  administration, are the following: the opening of the rice  market; a new sense of history, which neighboring nations highly  evaluated; and the adoption of welfare policies which reflect  the voices of labor groups.    The Hosokawa administration, which has ushered in a new wind  of "change" in Japan's politics, is to close its short life.  However, a political vacuum and stagnation in state affairs are  no longer unforgivable. At this juncture, we would like to urge  each party and parliamentary group not to waste time by vainly  pursuing party interests and polices, but to make efforts to  establish a new administration as soon as possible.</p>

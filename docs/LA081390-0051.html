			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GENE MAY GIVE INSIGHT TO CANCER  </P> <P> Utah researchers have shown that the gene that causes neurofibromatosis belongs  to a family of genes that suppress tumor formation. The new discovery, reported  last week in the journal Cell, indicates that research on the gene will provide  not only information useful for treating neurofibromatosis but also new  insights into the mechanisms by which cancer occurs.  </P> <P> Neurofibromatosis is the most common nervous system defect caused by a single  gene defect. It affects one out of every 3,500 people, causing symptoms that  range from brownish skin lesions to massive, deforming tumors called  neurofibromas, seizures and fatal tumors of the nervous system.  </P> <P> The identification and cloning of the gene that causes the disorder was  reported barely three weeks ago. "We didn't expect to have the protein produced  by the gene for another 12 to 24 months," said Peter Bellerman of the National  Neurofibromatosis Foundation. "Now we have it. It's a tremendous leap forward."  </P> <P> Geneticist Ray White and his colleagues at the University of Utah found that  the protein produced by the gene suppresses the activity of certain oncogenes  -- naturally occurring genes that lead to cancer. Knowing its identity, he  predicted, would allow researchers to synthesize chemicals that could both  block tumor formation and prevent the growth of neurofibromas.  </P></p>

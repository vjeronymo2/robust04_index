Characteristics of China's Economic  Development in 1993    A. Characteristics of the overall position.    To judge the characteristics of the overall position of  China's economic development in 1993, it is necessary to observe  and study the background of China's macroeconomic fluctuations  to see what position the year 1993 occupied in this round of  China's economic fluctuations over the past few years.    The year 1990 was the trough of China's previous round of  economic fluctuations, with a 3.9 percent growth rate in gross  domestic product (GDP); China's economy began rising again in  1991, and entered a new round of fluctuations, with an eight  percent GDP growth rate; she saw high-speed growth in 1992, with  a 13.2 percent GDP growth rate; and the growth rate for the  whole of 1993 was 13 percent. Judging by the situation in each  month of 1993, the growth rate of total industrial output value  reached a peak of 30.2 percent in June compared with the  corresponding month of the previous year; beginning in July, the  temperature [of growth] declined moderately each month, falling  by an average of 3.45 percentage points each month.    Based on the above situation, we can draw the conclusion  that  the characteristics of the overall posture of economic  development in 1993 were: The year 1993 was the peak year of  the new round of fluctuations in China's economy, and was also a  turning point in which the economic growth rate began to decline.    B. Characteristics of macroeconomic regulation and control.    1. Characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic  regulation and control.    Fluctuations in China's economy are closely linked with the  macroeconomic regulation and control policies taken by the  government. In 1991 and 1992, until the first half of 1993, the  characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic regulation and  control were policies taken to comply with and promote economic  acceleration and expansion, and, especially after the important  talks given by Comrade Xiaoping in early 1992 during his  inspection tour to southern China, the strength of such policies  was further intensified, thus promoting high-speed economic  growth. Beginning in June and July 1993, the characteristics of  the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control changed  from complying with and stimulating economic expansion to a  policy of moderate contraction, which caused an excessively high  rate of economic growth to decline to some extent.    The reason why such a change took place in the direction of  macroeconomic regulation and control was that some problems  appeared in economic life with high-speed growth which merited  serious attention, and the outstanding problems were the "four  highs, four heats, four tensions, and one chaos." The "four  highs" were high investment expansion, high industrial growth,  high monetary issue and credit input, and high prices rises; the  "four heats" were stocks heat, real estate heat, development  zone heat, and fund-raising heat; the "four tensions" were  tensions in communications and transportation, tension in  energy, tension in some important raw and processed materials,  and tension in funds; and the "one chaos" was a chaotic economic  order, in particular a chaotic monetary order. To enable  high-speed economic growth to continue in a healthy and  sustained manner and to enable the system of a socialist market  economy to be built up successfully, the central authorities  introduced in time a number of measures to strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control, thus making economic  development in the second half of 1993 gradually become normal.    2. Characteristics of the means of macroeconomic  regulation and control.    The conspicuous characteristic of the means taken by the  central authorities in strengthening macroeconomic regulation  and control was starting by rectifying the monetary order. In  the past, in the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, to fit in with the  highly centralized system of the planned economy, macroeconomic  regulation and control mainly relied on financial means; after  entering the 1980's, to fit in with the transition to a  socialist market system, more and more monetary means were used  in macroeconomic regulation and control; in particular, in the  current macroeconomic regulation and control enacted in the  second half of 1993, the function of monetary means has already  risen to a key position. In the past, to fit in with the highly  centralized system of the planned economy, the department that  occupied a prominent position in macroeconomic regulation and  control was the State Planning Commission; now, to fit in with  the transition to a socialist market economy system, the  department that occupies a prominent position is the central  bank. This shows that banking and finance have already entered  their appropriate core position in China's modern economic life.    Such a special function of banking and finance is also fully  embodied in an important goal that macroeconomic regulation and  control is trying to achieve--control over the growth of fixed  assets investments. In the growth of fixed-asset investments,  in the years of high-speed growth since the 1980's, for example,  1984, 1985, 1987, and 1992; the rate of increase in state loans  reached 47 percent, 97 percent, 31 percent, and 66 percent  respectively, all higher than the margin of self-raised capital  investment in the corresponding period and far higher than the  rate of increase of state budgetary investments. Judging by  absolute amounts, state budgetary investment in 1988, 1989, 1991  and 1992 declined continuously. Therefore, in the expansion and  contraction of fixed-asset investments, the role of banking was  distinctly strengthened, and the role of state finance declined  remarkably.    C. Characteristics of demand push and internal structure of  industrial production.    In the 1980's, the characteristics of China's high-speed  economic growth in demand push were that the expansion of  investment demand and the expansion of consumption demand was a  two-way push. But since 1992, the characteristics of high-speed  growth have been expressed in a one-way push by the expansion of  investment demand, and consumption demand has been relatively  smooth and steady. Regarding the growth rate (calculated at  constant prices) of overall fixed-asset investments, the peak  year (1985) in the 1980's was 38.8 percent, it was 42.6 percent  in 1992, and it was estimated at 46 percent in 1993, which  turned out to be the year which registered the highest margin of  increase since the 1980's for overall asset investments. The  above characteristics were shown in the sectoral structure of  industrial production, and under the two-way push of investment  and consumption in the 1980's, light industrial growth was  faster than heavy industrial growth for several years running  from 1985 to 1988. In 1990 and 1991, light industry continued  to grow faster than heavy industry, but under the circumstances  of a one-way push by investment in 1992 and 1993, heavy industry  turned to grow faster than light industry. Total heavy  industrial output value for 1993 was estimated to grow by 25  percent, and total light industrial output value by 23 percent.    Before the 1970's, China emphasized one-sidedly the  development of heavy industry. From 1953 to 1978, the average  growth rate of total heavy industrial output value was higher  than that of total light industrial output value, with the  former at 13.8 percent and the latter at 9.3 percent.  Admittedly, such a situation had something to do with the  building of the initial industrialization system in the early  days after the founding of the PRC, and also with the need for  national defense construction, but the delay in the development  of light industry also seriously held back the development of  heavy industry and affected the enhancement of living standards.  In the 1980's, residents' consumption and light industry made  compensatory development. From 1979 to 1991, the annual average  growth rate of total light industrial output value (14 percent)  was higher than that of total heavy industrial output value  (10.6 percent). In 1992 and 1993, the growth of heavy industry  was again faster than light industry. We believe that such a  characteristics will be a long-term trend in the coming one or  two decades. It has something to do with the development stage  of China's industrialization. At present, China has entered an  intermediate stage of industrialization. According to the  experiences of industrialization in some countries, in the  intermediate stage of industrialization, it is necessary to take  heavy industry as the dragon's head to bring up the development  of the national economy. On the one hand, this is because a  large amount of growth in investment requires a large amount of  investment articles provided by heavy industry; on the other  hand, with the heightening of residents' consumption and changes  in the consumption structure, heavy industry will also be  required to provide more consumer goods directly and indirectly.  Moreover, proceeding from China's national conditions and also  for the sake of breaking bottleneck restraints in communications  and transportation, energy, and some important raw and processed  materials, the high-speed growth of heavy industry is also  required. Of course, it is not a one-sided development of heavy  industry, but the coordinated development of light industry and  heavy industry, and we cannot rule out the possibility that  light industry will grow faster than heavy industry in  particular years.    D. Characteristics of different types of industrial  enterprises.    After macroeconomic regulation and control in the second  half  of 1993 turned tight, different characteristics were expressed  in different types of industrial enterprises: State-owned  industrial enterprises again faced a difficult situation, but  there was a striking contrast with non state-owned industrial  enterprises, which continued to grow at high speed.    Since the 1980's, growth of state-owned industry has  always lacked strength. The output value growth rate of  state-owned industrial enterprises has always been in a low  range of 3 to 13 percent. In 1989 and 1990 in particular,  state-owned enterprises were faced with the difficult situation  of production depression, overstocking, declining performance,  and serious "triangular debts." With the high-speed growth of  the national economy as a whole in 1992 and the first half of  1993, the difficult situation of state- owned enterprises was  relieved slightly. However, after June and July 1993, once  macroeconomic regulation and control turned tight, the difficult  situation of state-owned enterprises again revealed itself  immediately. If we compare the growth rate of China's total  industrial output value for the same month in the previous year,  October was down by 2.7 percentage points from September, and  state-owned industry dropped by 3.2 percentage points. That is  to say, the decline in the growth of total industrial output  value was mainly borne by state-owned industry. Calculated by  cumulative totals from January through October 1993, total  industrial output value as a whole grew by 23.2 percent over the  corresponding period of the previous year, while state-owned  industry only grew by 8.6 percent, collective industry by 40.1  percent, and "foreign-invested" and other industries by 66.2  percent. At present, under the circumstances of tight  macroeconomic regulation and control, rapid market changes, and  an aggravation of tension in funds, a number of state-owned  industrial enterprises are basically in a state of production  suspension or semi-suspension.    Since the 1980's, the growth of non state-owned industry has  always been quite rapid. Output growth of non state-owned  industry has always been in a high range of 10 to 40 percent.  The proportion of output of non state-owned industrial  enterprises in total industrial output value had already risen  from 22 percent in 1979 (calculated by prices in same year) to  52 percent in 1992. Therefore, in the growth and fluctuations of  China's industrial production, state-owned enterprises have been  replaced by non state-owned enterprises as a source of growth  and leading fluctuations. Such a situation was shown more  obviously by the macroeconomic regulation and control of 1993.  <H5>  II. China's Economic Trends in 1994 and Relevant Policies </H5>   A. The overall posture of economic development and overall  policies for macroeconomic regulation and control.    1. The overall posture of economic development in 1994.    To forecast the overall posture of China's economic  development in 1994, we must similarly observe and study the  background of China's macroeconomic fluctuations to see what  position the year 1994 occupies in this round of China's recent  economic fluctuations.    We believe that in this round of economic fluctuations the  year 1994 is a year of sustained and high-speed growth after the  peak. Such a judgement has two meanings: First, compared with  the peak of 1993, the growth rate in 1994 will decline to some  extent; second, although the growth rate will decline, it will  maintain a high level. According to our forecast, the GDP  growth rate in 1994 will remain at about ten percent.    Why will the economic growth rate in 1994 decline to some  extent? Mainly for the following reasons: First, bottleneck  restraints. Successive high-speed economic growth in 1992 and  1993 made it difficult for communications and transportation,  energy, some important raw and processed materials, and other  bottleneck sectors to cope. If we force ourselves to do so, it  will inevitably lead to powerful fluctuations and big ups and  downs like slamming the brakes on. Second, restraints of price  rise. Continued high-speed economic growth in 1992 and 1993 has  already brought about big increases in prices. If the economy  continues to operate at high speed, it will be difficult for  society to bear price rises, which could affect social stability  and the lives of the people. Third, the moderate contraction  policies that started in June and July 1993 have just made some  achievements. At present, investment growth and monetary growth  remain too high and the situation of revenue and expenditure  balance and foreign trade still must be improved. Therefore,  such a contraction policy requires persistent implementation to  fulfill the task of the current readjustment and create  conditions for a successful transition to next round of new  growth. Fourth, a moderate decline in the economic growth rate  in 1994 will loosen the bow-string that has been drawn too tight  in economic life as a whole, which will be favorable to carrying  forward various decisions on reform made by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Congress and to speeding up the pace of  building the system of a socialist market economy.    Why does the economic growth rate in 1994 remain at a high  level?    First, investment will remain large scale. 1) Large numbers  of projects started in the past two years need to continue,  which makes the scale of construction large; moreover, some  important new projects are waiting to start. 2) Earmarking large  amount of funds to readjust and optimize the industrial  structure is still required, as is strengthening infrastructure  construction and basic industries. 3) Residents' savings  continue to increase by a large amount, and banking and  financial departments and affiliated organizations have also  gathered a considerable amount of funds after the rectification,  which has provided sources of domestic capital for investments.  4) Investment by foreign businessmen is at a second peak. The  first peak was from 1985 to 1988. In the growth of overall  fixed-asset investments, the growth rate of the use of foreign  investments reached 30 to 48 percent. Beginning from 1992, a  second peak appeared in investment by foreign businessmen, and  the growth of the use of foreign investment that year reached  44.5 percent. At present, the major industrialized countries in  the world lack strength in economic recovery, and large amounts  of capital are looking for new investment sites. China's  social, political, and economic situation are favorable, which  has created favorable conditions for attracting foreign  investment. In the current peak of foreign investment,  investments by foreign businessmen are not just limited to  coastal areas, but also go right to the interior, and they are  not just limited to processing industries but also extend to  infrastructure and basic industries.    Second, residents' consumption demand will grow steadily.  In the past two years, there were new increases in residents'  income levels, the consumption structure was up-to-grade, and  the selectivity of commodities purchased further increased,  which competition fierce in the consumer goods market and  reinvigorated what was once weak during the trough of economic  growth a few years ago. The growth of residents' consumption  will promote the growth of industry and tertiary industry.    Third, in the second half of 1993, contradictions between  supply and demand in communications and transportation, energy,  and some important raw and processed materials were somewhat  alleviated. In 1994, judged by the production capacity of these  bottleneck sectors and the readjustment of imports and exports,  it will be possible to sustain GDP growth of about 10 percent.    Fourth, maintaining a certain growth rate and allowing the  economic growth rate to decline steadily and avoid large drops  between years is beneficial to ironing out economic fluctuations  and preventing large chain reactions and shocks between various  links of social reproduction caused by excessive slumps.    2. Overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and control  in 1994.    The economic trends of 1994 analyzed above depend in actual  operations to a large extent on the orientation, strength, and  implementation results of macroeconomic regulation and control  policies. The overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and  control in 1994 are "soft landing" policies, that is, policies  of moderate contraction, neither powerful expansion nor overall  contraction.    We must be extremely careful about the strength of  macroeconomic regulation and control, because if the strength of  such contraction policies is not well controlled, if the  strength is too powerful, it will make an already declining  economy slide by a big margin; however, if the strength is too  loose, it will not bring a "soft landing" into position, which  will cause growth to rebound forcefully and lay hidden dangers  for healthy, sustained, and high-speed economic growth in 1995  and even in the second half of the 1990's.    Proceeding from the above considerations, major economic  indicators of macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 will  be controlled at:    1. GDP growth rate will be controlled at about 10 percent;    2. The growth rate of total industrial output value will be  about 16 percent;    3. Overall fixed-asset investment will be controlled at  about 1,360-1,400 billion yuan, about a 20-percent increase over  1993. With the price factor deducted, actual growth will be  about 12 percent, slightly higher than the GDP growth rate and  slightly lower than the growth of industrial production;    4. New loans will be controlled at about 550 billion yuan,  about a 20 percent increase over those of 1993;    5. New monetary supply will be about 100 billion yuan, about  a 17 percent increase over 1993.    B. Soft restraints by the system, hard restraints by  bottlenecks, and policies.    Since reform and opening-up, profound changes have taken  place, compared with the past in some aspects of China's  economic oscillations, but fundamental changes have not yet  taken place in other aspects.    The changes that have taken place include: 1) In the nature  of the oscillations, they have changed from classical type as  the leading factor in the past to growth-type fluctuations as  the leading factor. So-called classical type fluctuations refer  to the fact that during periods of economic contraction, major  economic indicators such as GDP, national income, total  industrial output value, and other major economic indicators  decline absolutely, that is negative growth. So-called  growth-type fluctuation refers to the fact that during periods  of economic contraction, no declines appear in the absolute  amounts of major economic indicators, but growth rates slow.  Such a change in the nature of economic fluctuations shows that  China's economic development has more powerful strength for  growth and against depression than in the past. 2) The amplitude  of the fluctuations has obviously been reduced. This shows that  steadiness has increased to a certain extent in China's economic  development and that the government has made greater progress  than in the past in controlling the direction and strength of  macroeconomic regulation and control. 3) In generating a  mechanism of industrial fluctuations, the role of state-owned  enterprises has been reduced and that of non state-owned  enterprises has been increasingly enhanced. In industrial  fluctuations, non state-owned industry has already become the  leading source of fluctuations. 4) In generating mechanisms and  investment fluctuations, with a multiplicity of investment  subjects, self-raised fund investments and bank loan investments  have become the leading waves of investment fluctuations. 5) In  the transmission of information on fluctuations, price signals  have started playing their role.    However, fundamental changes have not yet taken place in  the following two important aspects: First, soft restraints by  the system. If we make a comprehensive survey of China's  previous economic fluctuations, the source of expansion of the  investment scale exceeding national strength lay in the original  planned economy system which lacked a responsibility mechanism  and restraint mechanism. The problems brought about by  high-speed economic growth in the first half of 1992 found their  source in the delay in reforms of the investment, finance, and  taxation systems and in the delay of reforms in state-owned  enterprises. That is to say, the "overchaotic" economic order  caused by systemic factors was the source of the "overheated"  economy. Therefore, the fundamental way out is to speed up  reform and quicken the pace of building the socialist market  economy. The posture of economic development in 1994 is also  conducive to promoting various reform measures worked out by the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress. In this  respect, we believe that the emphases of reform in 1994 should  be: Enterprise reform for the purpose of building a competition  mechanism, an encouragement mechanism, a restraint mechanism,  and a risk mechanism and reform of government functions for the  purpose of building an improved system of taxation, finance,  investment, planning, and other macroeconomic regulation and  control systems. The reforms of 1994 are large in operations  and quick in pace, with extensive aspects involved, and they are  of a strong nature in storming heavily fortified positions and  are required to succeed in time to coordinate and complement  overall work. Whether or not a "soft landing" in 1994 will be  successful, and whether or not the economy can grow smoothly  will be an objective examination of whether or not these reforms  are successful.    Second, hard restraints by bottleneck sectors. If we make a  comprehensive survey of China's previous economic fluctuations,  beside factors affected by politics, systems, and policies, so  far as material factors are concerned, most economic expansions  finally cannot but be postponed because of bottleneck restraints  either in agriculture, or in communications and transportation,  energy, and important raw and processed materials. Therefore,  to readjust the industrial structure by vigorous efforts and  fundamentally break through the hard restraints of these  bottleneck sectors are important links in ironing out economic  fluctuations, improving the overall performance of the national  economy, and ensuring sustained and smooth economic growth.    A moderate decline in the economic growth rate in 1994 will  temporarily relieve bottleneck restraints. According to  historical experience, what merits mentioning is that such  relief should not be misunderstood as the fact that industry has  been well-restructured and that bottleneck restraints no longer  exist. There are two types of industrial restructuring: One  type is adaptive restructuring which only has short-term  significance, that is, after high-speed economic expansion, less  demand makes proportional relations achieve a temporary balance  at a reduced level of demand, but when the next round of  high-speed expansion appears, such a balance is soon broken  again. Another kind of industrial restructuring is fundamental  restructuring of long-term significance, that is, unremittingly  strengthen construction of bottleneck sectors, fundamentally  breakthrough bottleneck restraints, and promote the national  economy as a whole. Judged by historical experience, it is  often the case that after adaptive restructuring of only  short-term significance has achieved certain results,  fundamental restructuring of long-term significance slackens.  To restructure industry and strengthen the building of the  bottleneck sectors are issues of strategic importance in  economic development.    3. Trends in commodity prices and policies.    To forecast trends in commodity prices in 1994, it is  necessary to analyze the major causes of prices rises in 1993,  and then see whether or not these causes will still function in  1994 and to how large an extent they will still function.    There were four major causes of price rises in 1993:    1. Long-term and deep-level causes, i.e., price rises  inevitably brought about by the transition from the original  planned economy to a market economy. They include: 1) Under  the original planned economy, cost accounting was incomplete.  Now, as China is transforming from the original planned economy  to a market economy and from incomplete cost accounting to  complete cost accounting, this will inevitably bring about price  rises. 2) Many service trades in tertiary industry were looked  upon as welfare undertakings under the planned economy, and  prices were set very low. In the transition to a market  economy, prices will inevitably go up. 3) Under the planned  economy, state finances had to render price subsidies to the  production and circulation of important commodities that had a  bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood.  Now, this has changed from covert subsidies to overt subsidies,  which will inevitably give rise to prices rises.    2. The direct impact of the readjustment and release of  prices. From the second half of 1992 to the first half of 1993,  the state introduced measures to release and readjust prices for  a wide range of commodities. This was a stage in which the  largest steps were taken since price reform. During this  period, the readjustment and release of prices was mainly  concentrated on grain, energy, raw and processed materials,  communications and transportation, and on prices in other  tertiary industries. According to an estimate by specialists in  a state department in charge of prices, the state's readjustment  and release of prices in a planned way after the second half of  1992, plus increases in retail sales business tax, had an impact  of 60 percent on overall price level.    3. Demand push by investment expansion and excessive  monetary issuance. The years 1992 and 1993 had the highest  growth rates of overall fixed assets investments since the  1980's. Powerful expansion of investment demand led to big  increase in prices of building materials and the means of  production, which built up cost pushes for processing industry.  Moreover, expansion of the investment scale, high-speed growth  in the economy as a whole, and increasing financial deficits  during these two years compelled banks to issue money to excess.  In 1992, money in circulation grew by 36.4 percent, in the  first half of 1993 it grew by 54.1 percent, and 30 percent  growth was estimated for the whole year. Excessive growth of  money in circulation inevitably led to price rises.    4. The impact of a chaotic economic order, in particular a  chaotic monetary order on price rises. In the second half of  1992 and the first half of 1993, there was the phenomenon of  illegal bank lending of a large amount of funds that had not  appeared in over 40 years; some local banks directly  participated in stocks and bonds businesses and real estate  investments. In the "funds-raising heat," many fundraisers  competed with each other to raise dividends and bonuses. Under  the signboard of developing tertiary industry, some government  departments indiscriminately collected fees, increased prices,  and apportioned expenses. Chaos in economic order led to  "bubble"-type hotspots and helped increase prices of the means  of production, real estate, stocks, funds, services, and swap  foreign exchange prices.    In 1994, the fourth kind of cause mentioned above, i.e., the  impact of a chaotic economic order on price rises, is being  overcome. The first and the second causes, that is, various  kinds of cost push brought about by the readjustment and release  of prices during the transition to a market economy, are still  playing a great role in raising prices objectively. The  remaining third cause, demand push by investment expansion and  excessive monetary issue, will become the crucial link. This  will depend on the results of macroeconomic regulation and  control in 1994. In macroeconomic regulation and control in  1994, if investment expansion and excessive monetary issuance  can be appropriately inhibited to make the economic growth rate  drop to some extent, then it will be possible to reduce the  margin of price rises. However, if the investment growth rate,  the money growth rate, and the growth rate of the economy as a  whole rebound too soon and too drastically, then price increases  will also go up further on the basis of the first and second  causes.    In corresponding policies, besides continuing to carry out  the important policies of moderate contraction policies in  macroeconomic regulation and control, problems to which  attention should be paid and policies should be taken are: 1) In  all possible factors that affect prices rise, an impact which  cannot be neglected is the residents' psychology. It is  necessary to pay attention to and correctly explain the causes  of price rises and correctly analyze the price situation, and do  not arouse residents' psychological expectation of price rise,  far less stir up panic purchasing. 2) The situation of  agricultural production has a direct bearing on the stability of  prices. On the basis of intensifying rural reform, promoting  agricultural development, and increasing peasants' incomes,  further mobilize the production initiative of the peasants, and  try to reap a good harvest in agriculture in 1994. 3) In 1994,  affected by the lag effect of various cost pushes during the  previous period, the decline in the margin of price rises of  consumer goods and services may possibly be smaller than the  decline in the margin of price increase for investment goods.  Moreover, in the "rise amidst stability" in prices of consumer  goods in recent years, there were very rapid increases and  strong rigidity in prices of basic daily necessities and  services which were relatively small in income elasticity and  price elasticity. Therefore, for prices of consumer goods, in  particular for those basic daily necessities and services, it is  also necessary to give play to the role of guiding and mandatory  regulation and control by the state while the functions of  market regulation are brought into full play. Strengthen the  management of market prices and avoid artificial prices rises.  4) In enterprise reform, encourage competition, improve  performance, and strengthen enterprises' capacity to digest  cost-push factors.    Taken as a whole, through the various efforts being made, we  can expect to keep the overall price level at about 8 percent in  1994 and create favorable conditions for a further decline in  the margin of price rises in 1995 and the years to come.</p>

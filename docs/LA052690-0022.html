			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELSMERE DUMP 'MISGUIDED'  </P> <P> Are the people of Los Angeles willing to get ripped off, to the tune of $125  million paid to the owner of BKK landfills at taxpayers' expense, and at the  same time very likely pollute our air and water with methane gas and toxic  chemicals? Isn't water much too precious an item to be tampered with,  particularly during this terrible drought?  </P> <P> We must speak out against the misguided construction of a landfill at Elsmere  Canyon and the expansion of existing landfills.  </P> <P> The only safe and economically sound solution to our waste problem is to  recycle, now!  </P> <P> BEN BRONWEIN  </P> <P> Santa Clarita  </P></p>

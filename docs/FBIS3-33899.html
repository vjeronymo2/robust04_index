			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gulf sources have disclosed that a meeting was held  in London last Sunday [23 January] between Qatari Foreign  Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim and Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres and Minister of Energy Shahal [title as received].  They discussed ways to supply Israel with gas, an issue which  AL-ANWAR has mentioned before.    The sources said the talks took place without the knowledge  or consent of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, whose territory the  gas pipes must pass through to reach Israel.    Asked by AL-ANWAR of his view on these talks, a Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] official said he had not heard about  these contacts and meetings before. Any developments between  Qatar and Israel, he added, are absolutely not in accord with  GCC policy.</p>

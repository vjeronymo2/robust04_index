			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Observer: Fathom that Any offers for a second-hand ship from Greenpeace? Jeffrey Woodhead, of shipbrokers Derrick Holdings, hopes to get as much as Dollars 800,000 for the 18-year-old good ship Gondwana, which he says has had only two careful owners. They may have been careful; but let's consider under what conditions. Before Greenpeace, the Gondwana, which has an ice-resistant hull, belonged to the Swedish coastguard, so it probably saw risky duty chasing Soviet submarines. As for Greenpeace, its vessels spend a good deal of time engaged in highly dangerous activities, pursuing whalers and ships dumping toxic waste - that is when they are not being sunk by the French secret service. Still, think of the brownie points for political correctness; an anti-communist and ecologically sound ship.</p>

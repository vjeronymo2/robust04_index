			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> In a recent edition, you printed a letter from a reader supporting Proposition  140 and suggesting I also propose term limits on the Los Angeles County Board  of Supervisors and create an elected county executive.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, in fact, I did bring a proposal to the board in support of  term limits, but, not surprisingly, didn't even receive a second to the motion.  </P> <P> I am told by county counsel that the Legislature would have to impose the  limits, since state law precludes local boards of supervisors from establishing  their own terms. I am hopeful, with the passage of 140, I can get enough  support in the Legislature to impose such limits.  </P> <P> I support term limits for all levels of government.  </P> <P> I also agree that an elected county executive is needed. Again, I have not been  able to get the support of my colleagues on the board to put the proposal on  the ballot.  </P> <P> PETE SCHABARUM, Supervisor, First District, Los Angeles County  </P></p>

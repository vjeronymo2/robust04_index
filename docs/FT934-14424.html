			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Fidelity looks to new shores - At a glance Fidelity has added an emerging markets fund to its Luxembourg-based range of offshore funds. Emerging markets is the catch-all term for developing countries where economic growth (and therefore stock market returns) are expected to be higher than in the developed world. The initial asset allocation is likely to be Asia (52 per cent), Latin America (40 per cent) and Europe/Middle East (8 per cent). The minimum investment in the fund will be Pounds 1,500. The initial charge will be 5.25 per cent. There is a 1 per cent discount until November 8 and the annual management charge will be 1.5 per cent.</p>

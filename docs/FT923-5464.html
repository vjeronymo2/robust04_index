			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Builders set up teams to seek failed rivals' work BRITISH builders anxious to increase their revenue are establishing task forces to bid for contracts left unfinished by failed rivals. Contractors say competition among 'ambulance chasers' is growing, as opportunities to win work through conventional tendering have declined in the recession. Try Group, a contractor and housebuilder, estimates that about a third of its order book has been acquired from receivers of failed builders. The company last year generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m on sales of Pounds 114m. Tarmac has established a special team to pursue contracts on unfinished projects. It seeks to renegotiate terms with customers or financing banks rather than to acquire the original contract from the receivers. Construction companies that have competed against Try to acquire unfinished contracts from receivers include Amec, Wimpey, Beazer, Raine Industries, Sunley and Ward Group. Mr Peter Howell, Try's managing director, said: 'There are risks in pursuing this kind of work. You do not want to take over a project which was the cause of the original developer or main contractor going into receivership. 'Speed is important to maintain commercial confidence in a project. Decisions on whether to make a bid are usually made within two to three days.' Margins on unfinished contracts are often greater than on work from conventional tendering - mainly because any money owed by the client for previous work is paid to the company taking over the job, rather than to the re-ceiver. Mr Howell said: 'Most contracts won through normal tendering are lucky if they do much more than cover overheads in the present depressed climate. By comparison we would expect work from receivers to generate average margins of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent - provided you have got everything right.' During the past 12 months the company has paid Pounds 1.6m to acquire construction contracts worth Pounds 28m from receivers. This included Pounds 14m of work from the failed Isis and Pakefield construction companies. Mr Howell said that the company was very pleased with business it had won and would be looking to build on this success.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Cost threat to Drax seen BRITAIN'S biggest power station - Drax in North Yorkshire - may be forced out of business by the end of the century, according to National Power, the privatised electricity generator which owns the station. Drax, which supplies enough power for six cities the size of Liverpool, is on the River Ouse near British Coal's Selby colliery complex, and burns about 9m tonnes of coal a year. National Power argues that Drax could be priced out of the new electricity market if negotiations with British Coal over coal pricing cannot be resolved. 'It is a sign of how completely the whole electricity industry has been turned upside down that the biggest and newest station in the market is struggling to survive,' National Power commented. Mr Mike Grasby, manager at Drax, warned that the station might be switched off most of the time because of tough competition from gas-fired power stations. 'If the coal price is not attractive . . . Drax will not run baseload,' he said. A baseload station is one which runs most of the time. That could prove disastrous for National Power, since Drax - which cost about Pounds 2bn to build - supplies 25 per cent of the company's profits. Drax pays British Coal about Pounds 400m for fuel compared with the Pounds 300m it would pay on the world market. National Power's existing contracts with British Coal, which were put in place when the electricity industry was privatised, ensure that the difference is subsidised by electricity consumers. When the contracts run out in March next year, this subsidy will disappear - making British Coal uncompetitive - unless the government intervenes. Regional electricity companies, which buy power from the generators to supply domestic consumers, will choose cheaper gas-fired generation where possible. National Power has spent Pounds 700m on cleaning up Drax by fitting scrubbing equipment which cleans the emissions. It is spending a further Pounds 40m on burners that will halve other emissions from the station. The high cost of the clean-up means Drax is already struggling to compete with the new gas stations. Mr Grasby has set stringent targets. This will mean cutting jobs and changing working patterns. He is also fighting to improve the efficiency of the station, though he says it is running close to its full potential.</p>

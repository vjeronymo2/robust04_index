			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> HIRING PLAN MAY CUT ENGLISH CLASS SIZES  </P> <P> The size of 10th-grade English classes in Simi Valley could be cut nearly in  half under a plan scheduled to be considered by school board members Tuesday.  </P> <P> Using state funds, the district would hire five or six teachers to reduce the  size of the classes at all three high schools from 36 students to 20 students  each, Associate Supt. Allan W. Jacobs said. About 1,440 students would be  affected by the change that could be implemented with substitute teachers on  the first day of school Wednesday.  </P> <P> An estimated $228,000 for teachers' salaries would come from $31 million set  aside in the 1990-1991 state budget for reducing class size. District officials  anticipate they will receive $179,500 to $215,700 from the state and that any  shortage could be made up with state grant money.  </P> <P> Jacobs said the exact amount of state money will not be known until all school  districts have a chance to apply for funding.  </P> <P> The size of 10th-grade English classes was expected to jump from about 31 to 36  students as a result of budget cuts the school board made last spring, which  included laying off 32 temporary teachers. Seven high school teachers were  later rehired with surplus payroll funds.  </P> <P> School board member Judy Barry said the smaller classes will enhance learning.  </P> <P> "I'm thrilled about it," Barry said. "We've been stuck with large class sizes  for so many years, it's a great opportunity to reduce them. I'm disappointed we  can't do it in all classrooms."  </P> <P> Union officials said they were pleased with the proposal to add more teachers,  but vowed to pursue four grievances filed against the district last spring,  seeking smaller classes.  </P> <P> "Class sizes are still up, and we will be carrying through with the  grievances," Bill Davenport, president of the Simi Educators Assn., said.  </P> <P> In other business, the school board is expected to appoint an interim  superintendent to run the district after Supt. John Duncan leaves Sept. 16 to  become superintendent of a Northern California school district. It is estimated  the interim superintendent will serve for 50 days. STEPHANIE STASSEL  </P></p>

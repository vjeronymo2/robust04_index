			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries surge as unemployment figures surprise US Treasury prices jumped sharply at the long end of the market in the wake of a bigger-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims and comments from the Treasury hinting that it may cut back on long bond issues. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  31/32 at 105 7/8 , yielding 7.531 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  3/32 at 101 1/2 , yielding 4.166 per cent. The early buying was sparked by the Labor Department's announcement that weekly claims for state unemployment insurance had risen by 19,000 in the week ending July 11, more than double what analysts had been expecting. Continued weakness in the labour market, allied to later comments from Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, suggesting that the Treasury is looking at curtailing its sales of 30-year bonds in an attempt to bring long-term rates lower, prompted a rush of demand for longer-dated securities from retail and speculative players in the market. SPANISH government bond yields climbed yesterday after the Bank of Spain raised its key intervention rate from 12.4 per cent to 13 per cent. The financial markets had been expecting a rise in rates after the government announced a tough package of fiscal restrictions on Tuesday, but the increase in the intervention rate was bigger than expected. Bond yields rose during the day, with the 10-year benchmark bond yielding 12.39 per cent gross, against Wednesday's close of 12.3 per cent. THE announcement of lower-than-expected inflation in North Rhine-Westfalia boosted German government bond prices and sparked fresh buying of bunds by investors. Consumer prices were unchanged in the month to mid-July, and were 3.3 per cent higher year-on-year. By comparison, the year-on-year inflation rate in June was 4.3 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from its opening of 87.25 to 87.36 by late afternoon. UK government bonds ended slightly weaker, shrugging off yesterday's rise in Spanish interest rates. Dealers said the gilt market remained well-supported, with investors concentrating on the weakness in the UK economy and the fall in inflation. 'News that the government plans to tighten control of public spending helped to reassure gilts early in the day,' said one dealer, although gilts later slipped back following some of the European bond markets. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 98.28 and traded at 98.20 by late afternoon. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 slipped from 116 15/16 to 116 27/32 . The recent auction stock, the 9 per cent gilt due 2012, slipped from 101 13/32 to 101 3/8 . JAPANESE government bonds closed higher on expectations of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, and helped by a fall in short-term interest rates. News that top government officials will meet today to discuss measures to support the weak stock market fuelled speculation that the Bank of Japan may soon cut the official discount rate (ODR), currently at 3.75 per cent. The plummeting Nikkei stock index recently reached its lowest level in six years, touching the 15,333 mark. Bond analysts expect the central bank to lower the ODR by up to three-quarters of a percentage point in order to help shore up the troubled equity market. The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.055 per cent and moved to 4.99 per cent, corresponding to the highest price for the bond since February 1989. The bond's yield closed at 5.0 per cent. Dealers said the fall in the rate on three-month certificates of deposit, from 4.36 per cent to 4.32 per cent, encouraged domestic buying interest.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Tea There were 13,394 packages for the day, reports the Tea Brokers Association. Landed demand was selective. Better liquoring Assams sold readily at slightly easier rates, others declined by 5-10p. Bangladesh teas met limited support below valuation. Bright Africans were a strong feature and often dearer, but medium and plainer descriptions proved irregularly easier. Offshore: only fair demand with prices 2-4p lower. The highest price realised this week was 226p for a Rwanda PD. Quotations: quality 210, good medium 175p, medium 152p, low medium 110p.</p>

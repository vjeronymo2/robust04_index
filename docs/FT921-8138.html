			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: BMW director remains quiet on move to Porsche MR Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's research and development director and widely seen as potential successor to Mr Eberhard von Kunheim, management board chairman, yesterday refused to comment on a flurry of press reports that he was to become management board chairman of Porsche, the troubled German sports car maker. He is expected to issue a statement later this week. A spokesman for Stuttgart-based Porsche last night denied a Stuttgarter Zeitung report that a decision to appoint Mr Reitzle (pictured right) to succeed Mr Arno Bohn, whose contract with Porsche has almost a year to run, would be made at a meeting of Porsche's supervisory board tomorrow. The spokesman confirmed that the meeting was scheduled. BMW last night would not confirm nor deny the report. Speculation about both men's future has been spreading through the German media since the weekend. However, one of the latest reports, carried by Reuter last night, said Dr Reitzle had received 'an interesting offer' from Porsche, but had decided to remain with BMW after a meeting of BMW's management board yesterday. Speculation about the possible change of management board leadership has ranged from a power battle over the direction of the company between the controlling Piech and Porsche families, and the possibility that such a move by Dr Reitzle could mark a closer long-term relationship between BMW and Porsche.</p>

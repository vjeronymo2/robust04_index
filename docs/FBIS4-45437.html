Orlando da Conceicao, aka Orlando Jogador, who  was known to head the trafficking in nine shantytowns in the  outskirts of Rio de Janeiro--from Penha District to Olaria  District--was killed together with his brother Anderson da  Conceicao, aka Dilson, and 11 members of his gang. This is the  bloodiest battle ever fought in the shantytowns over drug sales  control. One Military Police agent--soldier Jose Carlos Castro  Pontes, 31--was also killed. He is believed to have cooperated  with Orlando Jogador in Nova Brasilia shantytown, one km from  the Alemao Hill shantytown.    Jogador and his gang were surprised by members of another  criminal gang, the Red Command, and others linked to the gang  headed by Ernaldo Pinto Medeiros, aka Ue; Fabio Pinto Soares,  aka Fabinho; and Marcelo Fonseca de Souza, aka Marcelo Xara.    The conflict began over the distribution of just over  $27,000  (nearly 60 million real cruzeiros) resulting from a bank hold  up. The criminals' bodies were later found in three cars dumped  in Sao Cristovao District, Maria da Graca District, and Barros  Filho District.    The money was stolen on 13 June from the Bank of Brazil  office in Tijuca District. Orlando Jogador, who owned an empire  of 500 drug selling posts, rented the rifles and revolvers used  in the hold up to the bank robbers. When the money was  distributed, however, he deemed his cut too small. The dispute  began when Orlando Jogador was speaking on one of his cellular  phones with another drug trafficker--probably Ue--complaining  about his share. The gang's cook, who was only shot in the left  ankle, reported that the shooting then began--using the rented  guns.    He told policemen of the 23d Police Precinct (in Meier  district): Orlando Jogador was on the phone and had no time to  defend himself.</p>

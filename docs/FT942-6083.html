			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bastion of discretion speaks out  -Mediobanca has reacted angrily to allegations Not much moves Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, to make a public statement. In a financial community which leaks like a pasta-chef's colander, Mediobanca is a bastion of discretion, opening up only twice a year to emit an elegantly printed annual and half-year report. However, on Monday evening Mediobanca came as near as it has ever done to losing its temper in public. The trigger was the formal decision by Ravenna magistrates to warn four top Mediobanca executives - including its 86-year-old honorary chairman, Mr Enrico Cuccia - that they are under investigation for allegedly conspiring last year to falsify the accounts of the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group. In an uncharacteristically angry statement, the bank expressed its 'bitterness' that it was being 'criminalised' for its efforts to save Italy's second-largest industrial group from disaster. In particular, it said the magistrates' decision was based on 'elements which seem to have been deliberately supplied by some of those who bear the greatest responsibility for that disaster'. The magistrates' decision has electrified the Italian media. This is not because it was particularly momentous. It is a formal move which is far from implying any guilt on Mediobanca's part, and the allegations are mainly based on a supposed technical lapse by the bank. But Mediobanca has an influence over the Italian financial and corporate community far greater than that of any other merchant bank in any other developed market. Mr Cuccia has cultivated clients which include all of Italy's most powerful industrial and financial groups. The network is so close that many of these groups, together with former state-owned banks, are part of the shareholder syndicate that controls Mediobanca. Under the circumstances, the restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison was a deal which could only have been worked out by Mr Cuccia and his team. This is the first time the bank has been caught up in the corruption scandals, in which the old Ferruzzi-Montedison group seems to have been a central player. But questions were already being raised about Mediobanca's role in the new Italy. The bank has come under attack for trying to extend its influence over the banks and industrial companies being privatised. The magistrates' investigation centres on how much Mediobanca knew about Ferruzzi-Montedison's L435bn (Dollars 257m) of undeclared bad debts in offshore companies. If it was aware of this hole in the 1992 accounts, then under Italian law it had an obligation to declare its knowledge, or face criminal charges of 'false communication'. The old board of Ferruzzi-Montedison approved the 1992 accounts at a meeting on May 28. Mediobanca was given the mandate for a restructuring of the group on June 4 and the accounts were deposited with the regulatory authorities on June 12. Shareholders only learnt about the hole at their assembly on June 28. Mediobanca says it has submitted 'incontrovertible' evidence to the Ravenna prosecutor that it had neither the power nor the duty to vet the accounts. The most prominent dissenter from this view is Mr Carlo Sama, the former chief executive of Ferruzzi-Montedison who is facing corruption allegations. He claims that Mediobanca knew more than it is letting on. In a television interview on Monday night, he went further, claiming Mediobanca had 'taken away our property and our honour' in an attempt to gain control of a large chunk of Italy's industrial economy. Mr Sama believes the merchant bank deliberately scuppered an alternative plan for the restructuring of Ferruzzi, prepared by the directors. The new board of Montedison issued a statement yesterday deploring the fact that ex-directors - 'responsible for having led the group to disaster, with a legacy of L31,000bn of debts' - were trying to undermine the credibility of their replacements, struggling to put in place Mediobanca's rescue plan. Mr Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat chairman who is probably Mr Cuccia's closest ally, described the magistrates' decision as 'a serious matter and an annoying obstacle' at a moment when Italy needed all the instruments at its disposal 'to revitalise its industrial groups and expand'. Mediobanca's rivals believe the move could have positive repercussions for a financial system notable for its lack of transparency. This would be welcome at a time when there is intense scrutiny of the possible conflict of interest between Mr Silvio Berlusconi's role as prime minister and as owner of one of Italy's largest private companies. Market reaction suggests the reputation of the bank has only been dented by the Ferruzzi-Montedison affair. Shares in Mediobanca, which had fallen nearly 20 per cent ahead of Monday's decision, yesterday recovered slightly. Mr Cuccia is likely to be happier about this than yesterday's show of support from many of his allies: Mediobanca is preparing for a L1,500bn rights issue which could have been put in jeopardy by a continued fall in its share price.</p>

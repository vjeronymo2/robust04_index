			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Conde criticises Bank for intervention in Banesto Mr Mario Conde, the former president of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, yesterday criticised the Spanish authorities for imposing a new management on the bank, and claimed he had been restoring it to financial health. In his first public statement since he was ousted two weeks ago, Mr Conde told a press conference that he believed a rescue plan which he had presented to the Bank of Spain days before the intervention would have been successful. Separately, it was learned that the Bank of Spain tried to persuade Mr Conde to sell his personal 4.5 per cent stake in Banesto, Spain's fourth largest bank, just days before dismissing him and his board. At a meeting with Mr Conde on December 22, the Bank's deputy governor, Mr Miguel Martin, is understood to have asked Mr Conde if he would sell his stake in the bank but did not name a buyer. The Central Bank declined to comment on the conversation but it indicates that the authorities may have been trying to arrange a quieter departure from Banesto before a run on deposits and the suspension of its stock triggered the Central Bank's official intervention on December 28. Mr Conde yesterday evaded questions about pressure to sell his stock. Without referring to any particular meeting, he intimated that 'out of loyalty' to other shareholders, he had had occasion to refuse to sell his shares in Banesto. Mr Conde said he still believed that the plan developed with the advice of J. P. Morgan, the US bank, 'was the best solution for Banesto, for its shareholders, and the domestic financial sector'. However, Mr Conde said he did not intend to take legal action against the authorities, although he had been advised that he had grounds to do so. He would merely lodge a routine appeal against the intervention. Mr Conde said he had decided against legal action because he wanted to respect the image of Spain and of its banking supervisors. 'Banesto's situation on December 28, did not require any emergency action, particularly from the point of view of its liquidity and its solvency,' Mr Conde said. He added that the bank, under the plan that he had presented to the authorities, did not require any write-down of equity. The intervention followed an inspection by the Bank of Spain which identified a potential Pta503bn (Dollars 3.5bn) over-valuation of its Pta7,000bn assets. Banesto and J. P. Morgan estimated the over-valuation at Pta372bn. Mr Conde disputed in detail the estimate by the Bank of Spain that Banesto's loan portfolio was over-valued by Pta223bn. Banesto and J. P. Morgan estimated the loan over-valuation at Pta166bn. Mr Conde said the loans had been examined and were in the process of being provisioned for. 'Our plan was exhaustively analysed by J. P. Morgan which estimated that our projected balance sheet was sensible and reasonable,' Mr Conde said. Mr Conde rejected outright the Bank of Spain's estimate of a Pta66bn pension fund shortfall saying that a prior inspection by the Bank of Spain in December 1992 had put the shortfall at Pta30bn and had been given eight years to make provisions for it. He said that a Pta81bn over-valuation estimated by the inspectors last September for Banesto's industrial holding company was unwarranted as there were no legal or accounting rules that called on the bank to provide for such assets.</p>

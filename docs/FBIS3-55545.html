The participants in the meeting focused on the political  situation in the country and tasks of the communist faction in  the State Duma, the lower house of the new parliament, the  constitutional crisis in Russia, issues concerning the formation  of the apparatus of the Federal Assembly and ways to resolve the  economic and political crisis on the country, the Federal  Assembly press service said.    The meeting was attended by party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov,  Valentin Kuptsov, Anatoliy Lukyanov, Vladimir Isakov, Sergey  Glazyev, as well as representatives of other parliamentary  factions and some independent deputies.    The Federal Assembly will convene for its first session on  Tuesday, January 11. Both houses, the State Duma and the  Federation Council, will seat separately since the new  Constitution does not provide for joint sessions. However, the  lower and the upper houses may get together in several cases,  including to hear out presidential addresses and messages of the  Constitution Court, speeches by leaders of foreign states and  witness the inauguration of a new president.    The Federation Council, the upper house, which is comprised  of two representatives from each subject of the Federation, is  expected to convene at 10:00 in the former house of the press at  Pushkinskaya Street, 26.    Simultaneously, the State Duma will gather at Novyy Arbat  street, 36, in the former Comecon headquarters. For the first  time in the history of Russia, the 450-seat lower house will be  represented not only by independent deputies, but also election  blocs and parties which have cleared the five per cent threshold  as required by the law on elections to the State Duma. The  political spectrum is very diverse and represents practically  all forces from democrats- reformists from the Russia's Choice  election bloc, on the one hand, to the Communist, the Agrarian  and the Liberal Democratic parties, on the other hand.    In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian  Federation, the first session of the upper house will be opened  by the president. Well-informed sources in the Kremlin that  there will be no "big opening address." Most likely, the  president will give a brief speech laying the guidelines for the  Council's future work.    The source said that Yeltsin is preparing a big speech which  he will deliver at a joint session of the two houses some time  after the Federation Council begins working. The speech will  touch upon the economic, political and social aspects of reform  in Russia. So far it is unclear whether the president will  address the parliament personally or send a message.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / The mysteries of the grouse moor: The grouse season starts on August 12. The economics and politics of the sport THE BEST use of heather moorland is grouse shooting. An outdated assertion? No: it is now firmly agreed on by all who twin ecology and employment as desirable land use aims. Grouse shooting generates more income from heather, consistent with good conservation, than any comparable upland activity. The 450,000 UK grouse shot annually have a commercial value of Pounds 35m. For those who like shooting fast-swerving birds, the grouse is a uniquely testing quarry worth paying for. Against a background of decline in many British bird species, how is the red grouse faring? Grouse are the primary economic resource over some 4m acres, spread across about 480 moorland shoots. About 100 are in England, the rest in Scotland. Based on game bags, numbers are high in England and low in Scotland. Grouse have been studied for many years and have proved as notoriously hard to understand as they are to shoot. Although the species is better known biologically, management practices for guaranteeing a good grouse stock have only edged forward. There are still examples of moors where conscientious management results in inexplicably falling grouse numbers, while across the way, on rival shoots, birds pack in masses to hurtle over lines of marksmen. The Game Conservancy, an independent conservation agency, started its Scottish grouse research project in 1984. In spite of the eccentricities of grouse moor performance, the Game Conservancy's exhaustive analysis of different moors has allowed the expression of several generalisations. For example, where moors are game-keepered, there are more grouse. Grouse-keepering involves management of the heather, usually by controlled rotational burning, elimination of predators (foxes and crows), and provision of facilities to benefit grouse, such as 'dew-pans' (excavated springs) and quartz grit (used for breaking down woody fibres in the grouse's heather diet). Climatic influences, recognised by shooting people for a long time, are confirmed by scientific study. Dry and warm conditions which suit the growth of heather, and are commoner on the eastern slopes of British hills, produce more grouse. June is a key month, both for grouse chicks emerging from the egg and requiring insects, and for heather growth. Over-grazing of the heather plant has eliminated grouse in viable numbers from much of their western range. Tackling over-grazed moors is a study area in which the Game Conservancy has taken steps. Removing sheep during winter and reducing grazing in summer allows heather to grow back and shade out competing grasses. Where the land is more degraded and the heather seed-bank has gone, radical measures, such as the Conservancy's heather re-seeding machine, are called for. This home-made utensil cuts slots in the ground, prepares them for heather seed, drills in the seed, and presses it down for eventual germination. By cultivating strips of heather it is hoped that the plant will naturally spread outwards and finally re-create the old moorland cover. Early trials promise success. The restoration of moorland for its own sake would be a whimsical extravagance were there not an important species to inhabit it. Fortunately, advances in disease control may be able to resuscitate grouse moor economics by eradicating the population crashes which play havoc with sporting managers' finances. Until now, good grouse stocks and big game bags were often followed by the virtual disappearance of the bird and the abandonment of shooting. One reason was sickness caused by strongylosis. Using medicated grit to kill off parasitic worms, which burrow into the grouse's gut, researchers hope that the boom-and-bust cycles of grouse populations may be broken. Results to date are encouraging. The research which arouses controversy, even before it starts, is the Game Conservancy's study of raptors. Particularly on Scottish moors, raptors have a reputation as significant killers of grouse. For golden eagles, hen harriers and peregrine falcons, grouse are simply the largest and most available protein in an environment which in winter is almost devoid of life. Modern bird books - sensitive to all the implications - have frequently suggested that raptors' reliance on grouse is negligible, a finding contradicted by the experience of gamekeepers. The Conservancy's raptor study, at present focused on hen harriers, will determine what impact predation has on grouse populations - a scientifically different matter from observed instances of predation. The climate of opinion today makes restricting the spread of raptors to protect grouse moors a politically unlikely expedient. But the gradual disappearance of heather moorland is not popular, either. In any case, grouse moors have the advantage of being able to run un-subsidised balance sheets. Gamekeepers are the custodians of the hills from which others have departed, protecting them from egg, flower and fish thieves. In order to run commercial businesses, shoot managers have to maintain grouse at artificially high levels. Over and above breeding stocks, there must be a surplus to shoot. This artificial level, a manipulation of bird numbers by man, introduces ethical, ecological and philosophical questions. Euro-greens are moving to outlaw all gamebird rearing. It is conceivable they will succeed. Wild birds are for the time being seen as an acceptable sporting quarry. But if pheasant, duck and partridge rearing were ever outlawed, the next domino to fall would be wild game managed for sport. The shooting man would then be left patrolling hedgerows and swamps waiting on the chance gamebird taking to the wing. Or perhaps, by then, everything will have been protected. The gamekeeper will have passed into history, a tweedy rustic skulking in the woods, waiting only for Lady Chatterley.</p>

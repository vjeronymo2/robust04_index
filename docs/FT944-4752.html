			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Trouble brewing over sewage plan - A look at controversy in California over recycled water The idea of beer brewed from recycled sewer water might deter even the most dedicated beer drinker, but it could become reality in drought-prone southern California. In August, the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District decided on a Dollars 25m (Pounds 15m) plan to pipe reclaimed water from a nearby sewage treatment facility to an area near the Irwindale plant of the Wisconsin-based Miller Brewing company. The US's second-largest brewer responded by filing a lawsuit, expected to be heard early next year, in an attempt to halt the project, citing potential pollution of the area's water supply. 'We believe we have an obligation as a corporate citizen, on behalf of our employees and consumers throughout California, to voice our strong concern about the safety, feasibility and overall public benefits of the project,' said the company. Robert Berlien, general manager of the water district, argues that the recycled water will meet all state health standards. Water is a precious resource in southern California, where it is often imported hundreds of miles from its source to thirsty urban areas. The San Gabriel Valley now imports about a quarter of its water from other regions. The proposed reclamation project would save about 10bn gallons each year, reducing the valley's dependence on imported water by about a third. 'We pump more water out of the ground than nature puts back in,' Berlien says. 'And the imported water supply is becoming less and less reliable and more and more expensive.' He points out that water from the same sewage treatment plant has been transported to other areas for the past three decades, where households have used it with no apparent ill effects. California has more than 200 such recycling plants, supplying about 5 per cent of the state's water. First, solid wastes are removed in settling tanks. Next, bacteria are added to consume organic impurities. The water is then filtered through sand and charcoal, and finally mixed with chlorine, to kill anything that remains. The water is then ready for industrial use and irrigation, but before being supplied to households it is taken to 'spreading grounds' where it is released to naturally seep back into the underground water supply. State regulations mandate that the water must remain in the ground for at least six months before it can be drawn up and used. The Miller plant turns about 680m gallons of water into 170.5m gallons of beer each year. The Irwindale site was chosen, the company says in its lawsuit, for its proximity to an ample supply of 'high-quality' water, essential to the production of beer. 'When 90 per cent of your product is water, you want to make sure that water is pure,' says Miller spokesman Michael Brophy. Miller is concerned that some of the recycled water will contain industrial waste, which could contaminate the ground water. The soil of the proposed 'spreading ground' is coarse and rocky and therefore unsuitable to filter out contaminants adequately, says Brophy. The water authority counters by saying that the soil is adequate to take the water. Miller's suit challenges not just the proposed project but the overall safety of recycled water. It says no conclusive data exist to prove that people who have been consuming recycled water are unaffected. It cites a study carried out on recycled water in nearby Orange County, which found a significant amount of chlorine-resistant bacteria. Local environmental groups are split on the issue. Some favour more impact assessments before recycled water is put back into the ground. Other groups insist reclamation is a necessary part of responsible water use. 'We have some very serious questions about this project, about its technology and, ultimately, its effects,' says Brophy. 'What's wrong with second-guessing what a water district is doing? It is something we're going to keep fighting for.'</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> REDISCOVERY OF JESUIT-GUARANI INDIAN WORKS  </P> <P> When a Catholic school presents a show of religious art, one doesn't expect  revisionist history to be written. And not surprisingly "Paradise Lost" (on  view at Loyola Marymount's Laband Art Gallery through Saturday) is presented as  living testimony to the auspicious legacy of the Jesuits. The survey is of art  made in South America during the 17th and 18th centuries by Guarani Indians  under the tutelage of Jesuit missionaries.  </P> <P> Those who caught Roland Joffe's 1987 film "The Mission" should have a passing  familiarity with the Guarani, who were first colonized by the Jesuits, then  enslaved by the Spanish. Your basic Christianity-versus-paganism epic, the  story of the Guarani is in some respects more interesting than the art in  "Paradise Lost," which looks for the most part like standard-issue sacred art  of the Baroque period. The sweeping Baroque style promoted by the European  Jesuits was broad enough to assimilate -- and upstage -- regional idioms, and  it is the dominant voice we hear in this art.  </P> <P> The exhibition is accompanied by an exhaustingly thorough catalogue that is  fascinating and troubling. Including six essays by various scholars, the text  is riddled with such comments as, "in the history of the Conquest there was  nothing more beautiful than the image of the Jesuit, his prayer book under one  arm and no other aim but to bring these primitive people to the bosom of Mother  Church." Nowhere is it suggested that the Jesuits may have been a bit bossy,  misguided even, in their missionary zeal.  </P> <P> And zealous they were. No one can question the devotion of these men who  succeeded in colonizing 100,000 Guarani from 1609 to 1767. Before the arrival  of the Jesuits (who traveled to South America from all over Europe), the  Guarani lived throughout Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The Jesuits rounded  them up and settled them in 30 communities known as Reductions (a synonym for  "a place of teaching"). Text posted in the exhibition informs us that "it was  thought the Guarani couldn't be human, much less Christian, if they were  dispersed through forest and field without any political organization."  </P> <P> Often cited as models of colonization, the Reductions created dictionaries  preserving the Guarani language, protected the Indians from slavery (Spanish  soldiers bent on conquest were lurking about South America at the time),  introduced them to astronomy and sewage systems, enforced a strict separation  of the sexes and taught them how to make art. European art. While the catalogue  states that the Jesuits "were liberal in permitting local traditions to  survive," you really have to look for the regional stamp on this work.  </P> <P> Only 1% of the works created in the Reductions has survived two centuries of  Paraguayan political upheaval and religious reformation, so these pieces are  exceedingly rare and of high quality. Drawn from private collections, none of  the works are signed or dated. In fact, historians have been unable to discern  whether a given work was made by a Jesuit or a Guarani. It is known, however,  that all the artists were men who toiled in workshops located near the Father's  quarters -- "in order to facilitate the Father's necessary continuous  vigilance," the catalogue explains.  </P> <P> Needless to say, Jesus Christ is the star of "Paradise Lost." For centuries the  repository of the deepest longings and fears of the human race, the Christ  figure is depicted here as we've seen him countless times before: on the cross;  with his Virgin Mother; ascending to heaven.  </P> <P> Executed for the most part in polychromed wood, the works occasionally reveal  discreet traces of the Guarani's native voice. Faces on a few figures, for  example, are broad, flat and recognizably Indian. Embellishment and trim on  architectural fragments look vaguely Aztec, and a few oddball works look more  folk than Baroque. A sculpture of Christ at the pillar has a crude, schematic  simplicity typical of folk art, while two small sculptures of Jesus seated in a  chair passing time in a manner reminiscent of Rodin's "Thinker" have an  engaging playfulness rare in religious art. It's impossible to know, however,  whether these comparatively awkward pieces represent a respected style, or are  simply the work of an unskilled apprentice.  </P> <P> While some viewers may take issue with the ideology behind the Reductions and  the art it produced, this is nonetheless a beautifully executed show. Installed  with lush tropical orchids, traditional Guarani music, explanatory text and  photographs of missionary ruins, it succeeds in conveying a sense of the mood  of the world that produced these pieces.  </P></p>

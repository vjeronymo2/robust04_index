			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de  Rubio stated the two nations approved an agreement to legalize  the immigration of approximately 15,000 citizens who have not  processed their documents during the fifth meeting of the  Neighboring Commission between Panama and Colombia.    Sanin de Rubio stressed "that this agreement will be in  effect for citizens who arrived in Colombia or Panama two years  ago." She also noted that "in the next two months, authorities  will clearly demarcate the boundary stones on the  Colombian-Panamanian border," which have not been inspected for  years.    The border between the two nations is 263 km long and it  only  has 14 boundary stones. At the meeting, it was agreed to  increase the number of stones to improve the border area. The  work to establish the boundaries will be conducted by a joint  commission, but the date has not yet been set. It was learned  that the work might take place in the summer of 1995 when the  two governments will verify the limits.    The meeting between the two governments included several  agreements in which COPA, Avianca, and SAM airlines agreed to  several exchanges. Colombian and Panamanian hotels signed a  similar agreement.    Meanwhile, the Kuna Yala and Embera-Wounaan general  congresses criticized the Neighboring Commission meeting because  Indian representatives were not invited to discuss the opening  of the Darien Gap.    The Indian population will be affected by the construction  of  the Inter-American highway, the railroad, drug trafficking,  health issues, biodiversity conservation, and the environment.    The Indian chiefs questioned the meeting of the governments  of Panama and Colombia because the rulers of these nations are  not familiar with the situation of the Darien and Kuna Yala  region. Only the Indian population, which has lived there for  more than 500 years, know it.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL PITCHING IS NO RELIEF TO THE ROYALS, WHO LOSE, 5-1  </P> <P> We've seen Chuck Finley and Kirk McCaskill throw back-to-back shutouts in  Fenway Park. We've seen Jim Abbott outduel Roger Clemens. But did we ever  expect the day when Angel starting pitching might be too good?  </P> <P> In the aftermath of another near shutout and another Angel victory Sunday  afternoon, this by 5-1 over the Kansas City Royals, Manager Doug Rader said it  is reaching that point, which is one reason why stopper Bryan Harvey was  pitching in the ninth inning with a four-run lead.  </P> <P> "We're not getting enough people work," Rader said. "We're at a point where  we're going to have to start expanding roles, where we have to put people in  slightly off-center roles to get them some work, like Harvey.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, we can't possibly expect him to be ready to do his assigned job."  </P> <P> Harvey's assigned job is to save games, to face the potential tying run with  two out in the ninth inning and to pump three pressurized strikes past the  batter. His territory is close games, his mission is to close them.  </P> <P> Lately, however, Harvey's right arm has done little more than fill one sleeve  in his warmup jacket. And on those rare dates when he does pitch, Harvey has  been worse for his lack of wear, blowing his last two save opportunities along  with a 2-0 lead May 10 at Detroit.  </P> <P> The inactivity has led to rustiness, Rader said, which is why Harvey has only a  total of five saves, a figure on which he has been stuck for a month.  </P> <P> "Absolutely," Rader said. "Especially when we had that real good run (in early  May), when our starters would go into the seventh and eighth innings every game  and we'd be working with big leads. Many games, the lead would call for Moonie  (set-up reliever Greg Minton) and he did so well, you tend to go with the hot  hand."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Harvey would remain on the shelf, getting cold.  </P> <P> Sunday figured to be another day of Harvey sitting idly by, watching Bert  Blyleven polish off the staff's latest complete game. Through eight innings,  Blyleven (6-2) had a shutout intact, yielding only four hits and striking out  Bo Jackson three times.  </P> <P> But Bert-Bo IV saw the other side of all-or-nothing, with Jackson delivering a  Blyleven change-up into the right-field seats for his 13th home run of the  season.  </P> <P> Then, Blyleven walked Pat Tabler.  </P> <P> Then, Rader decided to call in Harvey, who had pitched only one inning in the  previous nine days.  </P> <P> There was no save to nail down, but, Rader thought, three crisp outs would be  nice.  </P> <P> Harvey came through, sandwiching strikeouts of Danny Tartabull and Mike  Macfarlane around a routine fly-ball out by Bill Buckner.  </P> <P> "Phew," Harvey said. "That's the best I've thrown probably since the first  month. It's been a long time. Finally, I was getting prepared in my head and  getting people out, instead of worrying about everything else."  </P> <P> Such as?  </P> <P> "Maybe just sitting so long," he said. "And, having a couple bad outings. After  a while, you start worrying."  </P> <P> And, for a relief pitcher, Harvey notes, worrying is a bad thing.  </P> <P> "This game gets you in trouble if you start thinking about it," he said,  grinning.  </P> <P> Until the ninth inning, Blyleven had turned this one into a no-brainer. Just  send the 38-year-old out there and let him throw curveballs until the Royals  drop.  </P> <P> Through seven innings, the only solid hit allowed by Blyleven was a line-drive  single by Kevin Seitzer in the first inning. Two others never left the infield  -- a ground ball to third base that Tabler beat out and a high chopper to first  by Buckner.  </P> <P> Kurt Stillwell stroked a double with two out in the eighth, but Blyleven came  back to retire Seitzer on a ground ball to take the shutout bid into the ninth.  </P> <P> A historic shutout it would have been, too. With it, Blyleven would have moved  into a tie for 11th on the all-time list -- Pud Galvin also recorded 57  shutouts -- and it would have given the Angels their 12th shutout of 1989,  tying their single-season high for this decade.  </P> <P> Blyleven was working with a 5-0 lead, courtesy of a few major league debut  jitters from Royal starter Kevin Appier, who allowed a run-scoring single to  Chili Davis and bases-loaded walk to Brian Downing in the fourth inning, and a  two-run home run by Jack Howell in the sixth. Blyleven opened the ninth against  Jackson, who had gone 0 for 3 -- getting caught twice on curveballs and once on  a fastball.  </P> <P> So what does Blyleven show him on the first pitch?  </P> <P> A changeup.  </P> <P> All it wound up changing was the final score.  </P> <P> "It was some kind of pitch Bert tried to invent," Rader quipped.  </P> <P> Professor Blyleven said he thought it wasn't a bad idea, at least for a few  seconds, anyway.  </P> <P> "I'd struck him out three times," Blyleven reasoned, "and I knew he'd be  looking for a curveball. I had a 5-0 lead, why not try something?  </P> <P> "Mentally, I outsmarted myself. I took something off a fastball and he smacked  it."  </P> <P> With the shutout spoiled, Rader moved as quickly as it took Blyleven to walk  Tabler, the next batter he faced.  </P> <P> "The guy has pitched I-don't-know-how-many shutouts and I'm sure every one  means something to him," Rader said. "With a big lead, I'm going to give him a  shot.  </P> <P> "When (the shutout) is no longer reality, that's when you've got to go with  other people."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Jack Howell, hitting .201 entering Sunday's game, came up with a two-run home  run and single in three at-bats. Howell admitted the Angels' quick start has  helped camouflage his own struggles and for that, he said, he is grateful.  "Instead of being that real big obvious weak link in the lineup on a mediocre  club," Howell said, "we're winning and, hopefully, you get overlooked so you  can fight through some things. Basically, we've had such great pitching and  we've been winning (so many) games that it's allowed me to be able to stay in  the lineup and fight through it. Thank God for that."  </P> <P> Kansas City rookie Kevin Appier, making his major league debut as a replacement  for the injured Bret Saberhagen, lasted 5 1/3 innings, allowing four runs on  eight hits and four walks. His opponent, 19-year veteran Bert Blyleven, chalked  it up to nerves -- and the lineup he had to break in against. "I knew going  into the game that he was going to have a lot of adrenaline going," Blyleven  said. "I think he's got good stuff and he threw pretty well. He just ran into a  ballclub that's hot right now."  </P> <P> (Orange County Edition) * HOT HOWELL  </P> <P> Jack Howell hits a two-run home run and hopes he's coming out of an  early-season slump.

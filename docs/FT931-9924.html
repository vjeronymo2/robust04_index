			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japan's discounts safeguarded JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission has ordered the sales subsidiaries of four leading electronics companies, Matsushita Electric Industrial, Sony, Hitachi and Toshiba, to allow retailers to discount their products without fear of losing supply contracts. An investigation by the FTC, the anti-monopoly body, found evidence that the four companies had ordered large retailers not to discount the prices of electronics goods below certain specified levels. FTC investigators also said that at least one of the companies is believed to have offered incentives to retailers who complied with the pricing orders and threatened to cut supplies to retailers who dared to discount deeper than the recommended level. The case highlights the close relationship between each of the four companies and their extensive network of small dealers, who are believed to have complained to the companies that their sales were hurt by discounting by larger retailers. A recent flurry of activity by the FTC follows past complaints by US trade officials, who alleged that the Commission was unwilling or unable to enforce Japan's anti-monopoly laws. They demanded that the Commission's investigative staff be strengthened. The Commission's investigations have almost doubled in the past two years, but US officials have continued to suggest that the FTC is unwilling to tackle the country's better known companies or unravel the often complex relationships between large manufacturers and retailers. The present case is linked to an FTC order to Japanese manufacturers in July 1991, making clear that retailers were free to set their own prices. Last year, sales arms of the four electronics companies indicated to the FTC that they would abide by the advisory, but investigations into their trading practices continued. If the electronics companies defied the FTC's order, they could be fined, but they indicated yesterday that executives would 'study' the order to see how it affected their business practices. Sumitomo Chemical of Japan and Rhone-Poulenc, are forming a joint venture company to develop and market agricultural chemicals in France, Michiyo Nakamoto adds from Tokyo. Sumitomo, which has a worldwide agrochemical business worth about Y6bn (Pounds 31.9m) to Y7bn and is a leader in the field in Japan, will own a large majority share of the new company, the company said. The joint venture, to be staffed mainly by Rhone-Poulenc employees, will mostly market the French company's products, but is expected to to develop and market Sumitomo's agrochemicals in future.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Insurance giant in probe on policies - Unsuitable products may have been sold / Problems at Scottish Widows MORE than 20,000 policyholders with Scottish Widows, the life assurance company, are likely to have received a letter in the past fortnight telling them they may have bought an unsuitable product. The policies were sold by its tied agents - financial advisers who sell the products of one company exclusively but are not employed by it directly. Scottish Widows has been obliged by Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation) to recheck them after a compliance check in April disclosed that some agents had gathered too little information on policyholders to be able to offer 'best advice.' The problem centres on client Factfinds undertaken by Scottish Widows' 130 or so tied agencies. A Factfind is a questionnaire detailing the financial circumstances of an individual (the adviser is required by the Financial Services Act to obtain a completed Factfind from a client before being able to recommend an insurance or any other investment product). In the case of a subsequent dispute, the Factfind can be used as evidence to show, for example, that a client was sold a commission-rich, whole-of-life policy when a building society account might have been more suitable. The preliminary review, completed by Scottish Widows in August, was of just under 27,000 Factfinds carried out by tied agents since February 1989. It revealed that only 6,200 were totally satisfactory; hence the requirement for further, more detailed checks. The review showed that well over 20,000 policies sold by tied agents may not comply with Lautro rules. Of these, 17,500 are cases in which Scottish Widows is unable to decide whether a suitable product has been sold because of incomplete information on the policyholder's Factfind. People in this category are being asked by the company to fill in a mini-Factfind form. Another 3,240 people are likely to have been sold an unsuitable policy and have been asked by Scottish Widows to contact one of its sales consultants. If an unsuitable product is found to have been sold, Scottish Widows will try to replace the policy. But if it does not have a suitable policy available, or if a life product was not the best form of investment for its policyholders, the company will be obliged under the Financial Services Act to restore them to the financial situation in which they would have been had they not taken the contract. Affected policyholders should, therefore, make sure that they are happy with any alternative new arrangements before agreeing to them. Scottish Widows, which sold just under 129,000 policies last year, is one of the UK's 10 top-performing life insurance and pensions houses. It said this week: 'Our immediate objective is to ensure that our customers have been given the correct advice. 'If they have not, then we will act fairly and quickly to ensure any problems are resolved effectively.' It has promised Lautro that complete Factfinds will be carried out by November 30. Scottish Widows is now making big changes. 'To ensure this does not happen again, we have reviewed all our systems and procedures,' said the company. 'We are also introducing a redesigned Factfind and a revised and more exacting training programme.' Meanwhile, Scottish Widows has reduced steadily the number of its tied agents - from 184 at the end of last year to 130 today. Lautro official Mike Abrahams said many life companies had met problems with tied agents because of 'separateness.' He added: 'Tied agents are not a part of the company's direct sales force and are separate in terms of management and work ethos.' Scottish Widows gets 90 per cent of its sales through IFAs, who can recommend the products of any company. It is, therefore, vulnerable to a fall in business should its performance falter. The company is now concentrating on creating a direct sales force, which is scheduled to be in place at the beginning of next year.</p>

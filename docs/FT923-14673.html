			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Asda The steadiness of the Asda share price yesterday in the face of write-offs totalling Pounds 452m is a tribute to the market's faith in the new chief executive. In other respects, shareholders have plenty to complain about. The Pounds 350m they stumped up in rights money has been more than cancelled out, leaving asset value lower than a year ago. The dividend promise at the time of the issue has been kept, but only for the year in question. This year the payment will be cut by perhaps a third, with no guarantee of full restoration in 1993-94. It is hard to escape the sense that Asda is still living close to the wire. Net tangible asset value after the write-downs exceeded the limit set by Asda's banking covenants by only Pounds 30m or so. Interest cover was under 2.2 times, the covenanted limit being 2.0. This year the pressure should ease, if only because of the Pounds 73m of cash from the MFI flotation and the fact that the rights issue money will be in for the full year. But the projection of cash neutrality for the year must be viewed in the context of murderously competitive expansion from such as Sainsbury and Tesco, which Asda reckons will cost it some Pounds 250m in sales. Assuming pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m this year against last year's pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 86m - the improvement being due wholly to lower interest charges and loss elimination at Allied Maples - the multiple at yesterday's 29.5p is over 10 and the yield perhaps 6.3 per cent. Given that next year is going to be tough as well, that scarcely seems enough to compensate for the risks.</p>

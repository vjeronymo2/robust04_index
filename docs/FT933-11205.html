			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Foray leaves buyer poorer but wiser: Andrew Adonis charts STC's fate since its takeover by Northern Two years ago Northern Telecom of Canada hailed its Dollars 3.61bn (Pounds 2.42bn) purchase of the telecommunications side of STC, the UK electronics group, as a decisive European breakthrough. Last week the Canadian equipment manufacturer announced a second quarter loss of more than Dollars 1bn, a Dollars 500m write-down of the Dollars 1.8bn goodwill acquired with STC, and the Dollars 900m sale to Alcatel of France of what many see as the jewel in the STC crown - its submarine systems division. Mr Jean Monty, Northern's new chief executive, said the write-down and disposal were needed because STC 'had not lived up to expectations in the short-term'. The former STC business is not at the heart of Northern's problems. Mr Ted Larkin, telecoms analyst with Bunting Warburg in Toronto, says it plays 'only a small role in the big picture at Nortel'. The North American central office switching business, accounting for half of revenue, is 'centre stage'. However, the fate of STC, which until its sale to Northern was the UK's second largest telecom equipment supplier, is a commentary on the undiminished enthusiasm in the industry for cross-border alliances and acquisitions. And the particular fate of STC Submarine Systems puts in question future UK research on the leading edge of advanced fibre-optic technology. Even in 1990, Northern's purchase of STC for a sum equivalent to more than half its own value got a lukewarm reception. Northern was widely thought to have paid too much; the fit between its Canadian and UK businesses was far from close; and the rationale for the purchase as an entree into 'post-1992 Europe' was questioned. Last week's events appear to bear out all three concerns. After two years of retrenchment in the STC business and the disposal of nearly 10 of its divisions, the acquisition is hardly a model for future overseas advances. Company sources in the UK say that Northern expected the synergy between the Canadian and UK transmission businesses to yield more than it has. Expectations of its value as an entree to the continent were also overblown, with the continent far less welcoming to overseas suppliers than the '1992' hype of the late-1980s led Northern to expect. 'In retrospect, Northern's main gain from STC was a UK base with a sales force they can use to sell their own product lines,' says Mr Larkin. He points to Northern's joint venture with Matra, the French electronics group, and its current negotiations with Bosch for a similar arrangement, as showing that it now views direct investment in local partners as the best way into individual EC markets - yielding the advantages of access and local facilities without the up-front cost or the hassle of managing unfamiliar businesses as part of an acquisition. Mr Ian Craig, Northern's European director, implicitly accepts this, stressing partnerships as the way of the future. 'We have 20 partners across the continent, five in joint ventures, and we intend to build on that.' Northern insists it has no plans to withdraw further from the UK. The switching, transmission, radio/microwave and integrated networks divisions of the former STC are now 'fully integrated' into Northern's product divisions. Mr Craig says earnings from the UK operation are about 25 per cent up on last year and orders nearly a third ahead. For Alcatel, which already has a thriving undersea cable division, the purchase of STC Submarine Systems exemplifies the policy of 'niche' acquisition to bolster existing strengths. STC's success in the North American market, in which AT&amp;T is a powerful competitor, will complement Alcatel's position in the Mediterranean region and leave the new alliance well placed to dominate the undersea cable market. For the UK, however, Alcatel's move puts in the balance the survival of an undersea cable business with an integrated R&amp;D and manufacturing capacity. At present, STC Submarine Systems makes laboratory prototypes and carries out basic research at an R&amp;D centre in Harlow; component engineering takes place at Paignton; and systems engineering and manufacture of advanced prototypes take place at its Greenwich base in London. Only Greenwich goes with the sale to Alcatel. To keep access to the fibre-optic research for its transmission products, Northern Telecom is retaining the Harlow and Paignton facilities. The submarine cables division will be given continued access to them through an arms-length service agreement, but of necessity that arrangement can only be short-term. What then? 'I only hope that Alcatel will keep an integrated research and manufacturing capability in the UK, otherwise they will get nothing for their investment,' says Dr Saul Lanyado, STC Submarine System's managing director. Alcatel has yet to decide what to do, but such a course is far from certain, given the company's R&amp;D capacity in France and the fact that the sale itself destroys the integrated UK capability. Meanwhile, a share in GPT, the last of the main UK-based telecoms suppliers, has been sold by GEC, its parent, to Siemens, the German electronics group, which is thought to be keen to buy the remainder. If that happens, and STC Submarine Systems is broken up, Britain's telecoms equipment industry will be predominantly a manufacturing outpost for overseas companies. That would be perverse, given the UK's position at the forefront of the international telecoms services industry. And it is only four years since STC was toying with joining a consortium to buy GEC - from which it would have got GPT.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          STC'S EVENTFUL HISTORY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1982: ITT of the US relinquishes majority control of Standard       Telephones and Cables  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1984: STC takes over ICL, Britain's largest computer manufacturer, for       Pounds 411m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1985: Pounds 168m rights issue at 190p - shares subsequently sink to       low 86p as company warns of loss; Sir Kenneth Corfield resigns as       chairman and chief executive; Lord Keith of Castleacre becomes       chairman; Arthur Walsh, ex-GEC, chief executive; workforce cut       from more than 50,000.

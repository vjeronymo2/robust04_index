			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: English &amp; O'seas Props cuts deficit English &amp; Overseas Properties cut its losses from Pounds 554,000 to Pounds 438,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. Turnover improved from Pounds 575,000 to Pounds 792,000. Profits were struck after taking account of property write-downs totalling Pounds 659,000. Directors said they hoped to avoid the need for further provisions at the year-end. They pointed out, however, that as a consequence of the first-half provision distributable reserves were not sufficient to enable payment of the interim dividend - 0.6p was paid previously. The company, together with its advisers, was investigating ways to reorganise its capital and reserves to overcome this problem. It hoped to be 'able to re-address the payment of a dividend' at the year-end. The cash position was described as 'very strong,' with balances of some Pounds 5m. Losses per share were cut from 9.46p to 1.88p. Exceptional provisions for the corresponding six months accounted for Pounds 675,000.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / 150 days' jail for bootlegging driver A truck driver who admitted six charges of cross-Channel bootlegging was yesterday jailed for 150 days. Portsmouth magistrates heard that Mr Peter Roberts, of Melyn, West Glamorgan, had brought in 'a very large quantity' of wine, spirits, beer, tobacco and cigarettes by ferry on a number of occasions. He was caught at Portsmouth ferry terminal after an operation by Customs officers from the city and Southampton. Mr Roberts' activities were said to have cheated Customs out of more than Pounds 10,000. He sold the goods in the UK and used Pounds 7,000 from the proceeds to renovate his house.</p>

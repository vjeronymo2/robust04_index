			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 11 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Croats are  on Wednesday using grenade launchers to shell the Moslem-held  centre of Mostar, Moslem Sarajevo radio said citing Bosnian  Moslem army sources.    The shells are falling close to the U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) tent, the radio said.    Provocations and ceasefire violations are on the rise in  Mostar, city in southeast Bosnia, despite the negotiations which  started five days ago in Vienna between the Bosnian Moslems and  Croats on their joint federation in this former Yugoslav  republic.    Sarajevo radio said in a program, monitored in Belgrade,  that  Bosnian Croat snipers on Tuesday fired from the Mostar airport  on the southern suburb of Gnojnice.    Bosnian Croat Army Chief-of-Staff General Milivoj Petkovic  said in Mostar that a joint Moslem-Croat army command for  Sarajevo will shortly be set up and that in time it would be  transformed into a federal command of the joint Bosnian army.  He added that the deadlines for this remain undefined so far  because this issue is as delicate as is the defining of the  borders of the cantons within the future Moslem-Croat federation.    Petkovic urged the forming of a joint, but not single  federal  army, the Croatian radio said.    Following year-long heavy fighting in central and southeast  Bosnia, the Bosnian Croats and Moslems on March 18 succumbed to  U.S. pressure in Washington and signed an agreement on setting  up a federation in Bosnia and a subsequent confederation with  the neighbouring ex-Yugoslav republic of Croatia.    Central Bosnia and the cities of Mostar and Stolac (both in  southeast Bosnia) remain the stumbling block of the Vienna  talks. Both sides claim they are entitled to these territories  with a mixed population and neither show the least wish for a  compromise.</p>

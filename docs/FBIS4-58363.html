			<p>BFN     [Text] A military spokesman in Aden today accused northern  armored forces of encircling a southern brigade and of taking up  fighting positions in an area adjacent to the southern 1st  Brigade in Yarim.    The southern Yemeni spokesman warned of the consequences of  involving the country in a destructive civil war, particularly  after last week's clashes between southern and northern military  units in the 'Imran area which left more than 200 soldiers  killed or wounded and caused heavy losses of equipment.</p>

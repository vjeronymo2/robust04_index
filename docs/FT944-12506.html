			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Foods continues recovery Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted cake and biscuit maker, continued its recovery with an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 104,000 to Pounds 355,000, and may return to the dividend list once a group reorganisation is completed. The recovery was helped by a continuing improvement in the manufacturing side, further growth in the distribution business and a five months' contribution from Jesse Oldfield, the cake maker NFF bought for Pounds 2.56m in April. Operating profit for the six months to September 30 was ahead at Pounds 586,000 (Pounds 288,000), with Pounds 221,000 (nil) from acquisitions. Turnover was up at Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 8.09m), with acquisitions contributing Pounds 3.76m (nil). The company is reorganising its structure to increase efficiency and reduce costs, said Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman. This will also enable it 'to resume dividend payments when appropriate earnings and gearing levels allow'. Earnings were 0.58p (0.28p).</p>

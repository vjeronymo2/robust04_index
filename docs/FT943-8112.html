			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Bosnians seek Greater Serbia In defiance of intense pressure from Belgrade and the international community, Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday called for the creation of a Greater Serbia. The speaker of the makeshift Bosnian Serb parliament in Pale, near Sarajevo, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, said he would ask the parliaments in Serbia and Montenegro, which together comprise the remnants of Yugoslavia, to unify with self-styled Serb states in Bosnia and Croatia. Unification is unlikely to succeed but the move will put pressure on Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic by appealing to nationalists in Serbia who have criticised his trade embargo against the Bosnian Serbs, imposed after they rejected an international partition plan. Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb parliament has proposed a new prime minister, Mr Dusan Kozic, a technocrat who promised to clamp down on black-marketeering.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Restructure behind 40% fall at Bunzl REORGANISATION costs dealt a heavy blow to profits at Bunzl, the paper and packaging group which has been struggling to repair the damage of an acquisitive binge in the 1980s. The pre-tax return fell by 40 per cent to Pounds 31.7m, after exceptional items. The final dividend is cut from 3.3p to 2.2p, for a total of 4p (5.9p), just covered. Earnings per shares were hit by a higher tax rate and fell from 7.4p to 4.1p. Mr Tony Habgood, chief executive, said Bunzl had now unwrapped all of its peripheral or loss-making activities and was ready to make progress with its core businesses. The cost of reorganising the core businesses resulted in a much higher than expected exceptional charge of Pounds 12.9m. This was trimmed back, however, by an exceptional gain of Pounds 4.2m on the sale of a laser instrumentation business, involved in cigarette and filter making. COMMENT Bunzl has a steep hill to climb, although under Tony Habgood it has made encouraging progress. Not least in the decision to make accounting practices on disposals much clearer than in recent years, resulting in the sharp jump in interest payments from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 9.3m. The jury is still out, however, on the potential of the remaining businesses, which combine distribution and manufacturing. Forecasts are for Pounds 45m, hopefully without exceptionals, and a prospective p/e of about 12. The shares are likely to advance in the short term, fuelled by those happy to see a determined management. But in the medium to long term, the current premium of 10 per cent looks unjustified.

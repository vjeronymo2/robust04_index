			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RAGTIME WINS: COURT RULES HORSE CAN STAY HOME  </P> <P> Ragtime, the 28-inch-high miniature horse, has cleared what appears to be the  last hurdle in a two-year-long fight by its owner to keep the animal as a pet  at her Thousand Oaks home.  </P> <P> Ventura Municipal Judge John J. Hunter on Wednesday found Ragtime owner Patty  Fairchild not guilty of charges that she violated a city zoning law prohibiting  horses and other livestock in her Oakbrook Village neighborhood. Following a  two-day trial, the judge ruled that because of its size, Fairchild's American  miniature horse should be considered a domestic pet, such as a cat or dog.  </P> <P> "I was speechless," Fairchild said in a telephone interview. "I was crying and  hugging my attorney."  </P> <P> The judge's ruling is the latest in a series of court battles fought by  Fairchild, who was first told by city officials to remove Ragtime in December,  1986. After appointing a citizens committee to study whether Ragtime was a  horse or a pet, the City Council voted in May, 1987, to press efforts to have  Ragtime evicted. Since then, attorneys for the city have lost two other court  cases against Fairchild.  </P> <P> A judge had ruled in September, 1987, that the city zoning code regarding  horses was poorly worded and unenforceable. The law at the time prohibited the  keeping of two horses on properties that are smaller than 20,000 square feet,  such as Fairchild's.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the city appealed the decision. But an appellate court upheld the  ruling in July. Two days after the appellate court ruled that the city law  could not be used to prosecute Fairchild because it did not mention  restrictions against a single horse, the city issued a new citation under a law  revised to close that loophole.  </P> <P> Fairchild, who faced fines of up to $160 a day for keeping Ragtime at her home,  said the animal made a good impression before the judge during a court  appearance Tuesday. "He was compared with a Great Dane that weighed the same as  Ragtime but came in panting and knocking things over," she said.  </P> <P> Fairchild said she hopes that this is the last time she hears from the city  about Ragtime. Officials from the Thousand Oaks city attorney's office did not  return telephone calls for comment. "I just hope that they don't waste any more  taxpayers' money," Fairchild said.  </P> <P> In the past, City Atty. Mark G. Sellers said he could not calculate how much  the city has spent trying to evict Ragtime.  </P></p>

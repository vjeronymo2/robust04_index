Dzakula, who had appeared on NTV Studio  B [independent television station] two nights ago, was kidnapped  by "three skinheads."    In the statement for BORBA, Vesna Pesic, chairman of the  Citizens Alliance of Serbia and a deputy in the Serbian  Assembly, said that she immediately sent a telegram concerning  this incident to Minister Zoran Sokolovic and President  Milosevic. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Imprisoned for Negotiating </H5>   Veljko Dzakula, an engineer and former vice president of the  Republic of Serbian Krajina; Dusan Ecimovic, former information  minister; and adviser Mladen Kulic were in prison until 21  September last year -- first in Knin and then in Glina -- for  signing an 11-point agreement with Ivan Milas, leader of the  Croatian delegation, after the meeting on 18 February in the  village of Doljani near Daruvar.    "To sign a secret agreement in times of war is an act of  treason," Goran Hadzic, the then president of the Republic of  Serbian Krajina said, while Dzakula claimed that he had "the  authority to negotiate, since the talks with Croatia concerned  local problems -- reconstruction of the infrastructure, delivery  of water, electricity..." The interesting thing is that the  other three members from the negotiating team not only avoided  any blame (and prison) but also remained at their posts in the  government of the Republic of Serbian Krajina.</p>

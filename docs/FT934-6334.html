			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scots are developing the power to invade England - The current expansion plans of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric Opinions may differ on whether a line of new pylons through the hills of southern Scotland near the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle road enhance the scenery. They will certainly enhance the business of Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish electricity companies. The recently-completed pylons are the upgraded interconnector, the transmission line taking Scottish electricity exports to England. Scottish Power, which reports its interim results today, gets the lion's share of the 350MW increase in the interconnector's capacity, which is rising to 1,200MW, though Hydro-Electric's export capacity will rise slightly. Total capacity should rise to 1,600MW by 1995, following improvements in the English grid. Last week Scottish Power received another boost when it concluded an agreement with British Coal to take more than 2m tonnes of coal a year for the next five years on terms similar to those reached by the two English generators in the spring. The deal involves a backdated reduction in the price which will cut the company's fuel costs by Pounds 10m this year, and a more rapid drop in world coal price levels than planned under the previous contract. Hydro-Electric, which generates most of its electricity from gas and hydro power, will get one sixth of the coal. Unlike the regional electricity companies and the two English generators, the Scottish companies are vertically integrated, both generating and supplying electricity. Apart from the Northern Ireland company they were the last to be floated and the only ones where the government got the price about right, permitting a small premium for investors but a sluggish aftermarket. From the start in 1991 the two companies pursued different strategies. Scottish Power, with a market capitalisation more than twice that of Hydro-Electric, concentrated on its much bigger domestic market, while exporting power to England via the interconnector. It also developed some generating projects in England and studied the possibility of supplying power to the Isle of Man, but none of these schemes materialised. Hydro-Electric was nimbler in signing up to supply individual customers south of the border. With Norweb it pushed ahead on a project to build a 680MW gas-fired power station at Keadby on the Humber. Analysts considered Hydro-Electric more dynamic and the market established a premium for its shares over Scottish Power. However, in September Hydro-Electric dropped out of the FT-SE 100, and since October has stood at a slight discount to Scottish Power, which is now making a bigger effort to explain where it is going. Mr Ian Preston, Scottish Power's chief executive, put achieving greater efficiency as a primary objective. It is now bringing itself up to the benchmark standards of the best US utilities, and has shed 30 per cent of staff in its core business since privatisation. Other aims are to make the most of its generating assets and 'to diversify prudently in utility-related businesses'. It has plans to build a 250MW interconnector to supply Northern Ireland. The original route for the pylons across Ayrshire ran into opposition but the company will seek planning consent for a revised line next year. When that comes onstream towards the end of the decade, and taking into account the interconnector upgrade to England, 30 per cent of Scottish Power's output should be going outside its own territory at prices outside the control of the regulator. The present level is 9 per cent. In diversifying, Scottish Power has reorganised its retailing business, which claims 30 per cent of the Scottish white goods market and is expanding in northern England. It has a joint venture in gas with Utilicorp, named Caledonian Gas, which already has 2,000 customers. 'It's a low risk business,' says Mr Preston. 'Caledonian gets the customers, Utilicorp supplies the gas and British Gas delivers it.' Like other gas suppliers he is urging the government to liberalise the gas market to embrace most domestic customers. At present only consumers who take 2,500 therms a year, giving an annual bill of more than Pounds 1,100, can choose their supplier. Scottish Power is also spending Pounds 7m on a fibre optic telecommunications network between Glasgow and Edinburgh for use by other companies. For Hydro-Electric, with a much smaller domestic market and a share of the interconnector that will only reach 490MW in 1995, the priority has been to develop generating capacity south of the border. That policy is now coming to fruition. The Keadby plant will begin operating in January 1995, and last month it formed a joint venture with BNF called Fellside to own a 157MW gas fired combined heat and power plant opening early next year at Sellafield. With the enhanced interconnector and a 7MW combined heat and power plant at Dover, Hydro-Electric should be supplying 820MW of power in England by 1995. The north of Scotland company recently formed Vector Gas, a joint venture in gas with Marathon, which intends to market gas all over Britain under the HE Energy label. Rather more than Scottish Power, Hydro-Electric has its sights on becoming an all-purpose energy utility.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (3): New transport links planned - Paul Cheeseright assesses moves to improve communications SHROPSHIRE is not in the fast lane. The M54 which links the county into the national motorway network, peters out at Telford and turns into the A5. British Rail Inter City electrified services from London stop near the county border at Wolverhampton and passengers become subject, for the journey to Telford and Shrewsbury, to diesel locomotives. Change is at hand, however. Over the next decade, Shropshire should become more firmly embedded into the national transport system. In economic terms, arguably the biggest boost will come from the extension of the M54 motorway to Shrewsbury. Work started in July 1990 and should be completed by summer 1992. The extension is taking place in two sections: the eastern section will cost Pounds 38.6m, the western section, Pounds 25.8m. Experience elsewhere in the UK has shown that the completion of a motorway adds economic vigour to the surrounding areas. The M4 from London to Swansea is a case in point. In the cases of the M11, between London and Cambridge, and the M40 extension, between Oxford and Birmingham, planners have sought to channel development into specifically designated areas. Given the largely rural nature of Shropshire, with its few urban growth points, a similar policy is likely to be adopted. Locally, some pressure has been brought to bear on British Rail to electrify the line between Wolverhampton and Shrewsbury, thus speeding communications to the south east. But British Rail has not made its mind up. It does acknowledge that the diesel locomotives currently in use are aged and unreliable and that a decision on their replacement will have to be made soon. Electrification is just one of three choices and carries the financial caveat that, under British Rail's present funding arrangements, any electrification investment must return eight per cent on capital employed. The other choices before British Rail are to put on to the line high speed diesel locomotives of the sort used on the North Wales coast line or to have brand new diesel passenger trains which would be attached to the existing Inner City service and then detached at Wolverhampton. Any decision will be made against the background of complex business calculations on likely traffic flows and within the terms of British Rail's business organisation: most of the rail traffic in Shropshire is regional traffic and Inter City services, in effect, buy from the regional services a share in the track. Over the longer term, most significant communications developments will largely be outside the county but will, nonetheless, have the effect of improving links to the rest of the UK. The only motorway exit from the county at the moment is through the M54 which joins the M6 north of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. The M6 then provides direct access to the north west and, through its junction with other motorways, to the south east, the rest of the Midlands and the south west. But there are plans to build around the conurbation a northern relief road and and a western orbital road. Plans is perhaps too strong a word. In fact, both projects are being out out to private tender. Both have to define in detail their routes. Both have to run the gamut of the planning process. Although the Department of Transport is clinging to a schedule of completion within five or six years, historical experience suggests this is optimistic. Should the roads be built, however, access from Shropshire to the south west through the western orbital road and indeed to the south east through the more easily reached M42 and the M40, and to the north through the northern relief road, will be made much simpler. And simpler still if yet another private sector road, from Birmingham to Manchester, is ever built.</p>

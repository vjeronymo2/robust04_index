On this  auspicious occasion, I would like to thank you, Your Excellency,  for the kind words filled with a sense of profound and intimate  friendship, courtesy, and affection in your speech. Those  profoundly meaningful words serve to ensure the further  development of the relations of friendship, cooperation, and  mutual assistance between the peoples and legislative  organizations of the two countries. At the same time, we are  extremely impressed by the warm welcome extended to our  delegation during our official friendship visit to the LPDR,  especially the arrangement of facilities and itinerary for our  visit, thus making our first visit to Laos a brilliant success.  On this occasion, I would like to express our profound thanks to  Your Excellency and the National Assembly for your hospitality  and to extend our wholehearted welcome to you for your future  friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia.    As neighbors sharing a long border, Cambodia and Laos have  maintained the fine relations of friendship and cooperation  since ancient times. Our two peoples have shared not only water  from the Mekong River but similar languages, traditions,  customs, and Buddhist principles. Our characteristics are also  very alike. All this has become a factor serving to further  strengthen our mutual friendship, affection, understanding, and  cooperation.    Lao and Cambodian peoples always share a common aspiration,  that is to live in peace and happiness with beloved and  respected friends. Such an aspiration has become a basis for our  people to maintain close relationship in all periods of our  histories. In particular, in the new period when Cambodia and  Laos are in the stage of development, the consolidation and  enhancement of the relations of friendship and mutual  cooperation have become even more important.    The exchange of visits by delegations from the two sides,  such as the friendship visit to the LPDR by Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively, first and second  prime ministers of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the recent visit  to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Lao Prime Minister His Excellency  Khamtai Siphandon, has opened new pages in the history of  friendship and cooperation in all fields between Cambodia and  Laos for the common interests of the states and peoples of the  two countries.    Aside from instituting a chapter of cooperation between our  two legislative organizations by paying this friendship visit to  the LPDR, our delegation has also brought with us the goodwill  and fine friendship of the Cambodian people to the Lao National  Assembly, government, and people, thereby reaffirming the  solidarity and sincerity of the Cambodian people toward our Lao  friends. I would like to express my confidence here that in the  future, this spirit of friendship will be further strengthened  and multiplied with every passing day.    Respected Mr. Chairman and beloved ladies and gentlemen,  having suffered a bitter destiny for more than 20 years,  Cambodia has encountered numerous unprecedentedly serious  dangers. At present, the Cambodian people are entering a new  period of peace and national reconciliation under the  clear-sighted and talented leadership of His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk. This is an important turning point for the  Cambodian people, who will cooperate with one another in  rebuilding our country and doing away with the bitter past. As a  matter of fact, the Cambodian people will still be encountering  certain difficulties and obstacles in the future in our efforts  to rebuild public utilities and various other infrastructure  facilities, to develop our human resources, and to enact and  enforce many laws and regulations for the equitable management  of our state, economy, and society in accordance with the  democratic principles so as to ensure stable and lasting  national development in the future.    Though encountering numerous monumental difficulties, we,  the  Cambodian people, are still very proud of and confident in our  bright future. This is because we have strong determination, are  confident in our unity, cohesion, and unification, and receive  support and assistance from various international organizations  for the reconstruction of our country.    The new Cambodia will strive to develop the relations of  friendship and cooperation wilh all countries regardless of the  differences in our poltiical systems and on the basis of respect  for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial  integrity, and noninterference, especially with the neighboring  countries and countries in this region. We pledge to further  strengthen our relations of friendship, solidarity, and  cooperation with these countries in the interest of peace,  stability, and development in the region. That is why we are  confident that the relations of friendship between Cambodia and  Laos will become exemplary in the development of ties serving  the invaluable interests not only of Cambodian and Lao peoples  but also of other peoples in this region. This development will  become an encouragement for the countries in this region to  further broaden regional cooperation.    In conclusion, I would like to extend wholeheartedly my best  wishes to the Lao National Assembly, government, and people. We  wish you greater victories in building the LPDR.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Here Comes Tagging"] </F>   [Text] The costly war with Iraq is primarily responsible  for our chronic economic difficulties. No right-thinking  Iranian had expected life to be comfortable after the guns fell  silent in 1988. The common masses, who are the supporters of the  Islamic Revolution and sacrificed their near and dear ones in  the 8-year-old war, knew that the post-war era would be  problematic.    As is the case in such circumstances, the poor and middle  class are always called on to make concessions. They have been  ready to do their share every time and in many instances, much  more than would be normally expected of them.    Speaking strictly of the economic health of the majority of  our people, almost six years after Iraq's military aggressions  ended we can at best say the situation has been deteriorating.  To say the least the government of President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani seems to have entirely put the fate of the  economy in the hands of `market forces'. Our economic planners  have generally been unsuccessful and this bitter reality is  clearly visible in the market itself.    Prices of goods and services have jumped to between 50 to  250  percent in the past few months. Chaos rules supreme in the  bazaars to the extent that the business community refuses to  acknowledge even the basic principles of trade not to mention  the frontiers of human relations, ethics and respect for the  rule of law. One lady shopper says of the retailers and  shop-owners "they have full freedom to raise prices". In an  area of a few hundred meters, prices differ as much as 20 to 30  percent `depending on the conscience and justice' of the seller.    For years, we have heard our statesmen talk about the need  to  build a society on the foundation of social justice and economic  morals. There is no death of seminars, conferences and  gatherings where economic and social planners stick to the  rhetoric of directing and sustaining our Muslim society, free  from discrimination and injustice. But, whether we like it or  not, the fundamental truth is that rhetoric has far outstripped  reality. People with fixed incomes are doomed as their  purchasing power declines every day and along with it their  morale and tolerance.    This week the minister of commerce announced that it is  compulsory to put price tags on commodities. It's a too little  and too late a move. As far as our information goes, this  measures also does not carry enough weight and was reportedly  not coordinated with other related institutions and ministries.  The tagging is no relief at all. Experience teaches us that  this move is yet another gimmick to `stabilize the market', will  have the same fate as hundreds of its predecessors.    Looking at the way ministries have functioned in the recent  past, observers feel the government is equally to be blamed for  the frightening confusion, as the middlemen and opportunists.  They believe the government has exacerbated the already high  inflation rate and slow economic growth--all of which have  worsened the country's socio-economic problems and eroded the  financial stability of the middle class.    Then there is the dollar disease. Everything from pin to  plane is calculated on the `$ price'. Education, housing and  medical services are gradually getting out of reach for the  ordinary working class, as our policymakers are increasingly  forgetting that these three basics are rights and not privileges.    We are always given sermons about falling revenues due to  the  drop in oil prices. Of course the oil argument cannot be  regarded as total nonsense. No doubt that too is a factor, but  let's not forget that all developing countries do not survive on  oil. They select and elect the right people for key positions.  Honesty, efficiency and merit are the criteria of appointments  in majority of the states if not all. Thank God, most of our  officials are certainly honest and God-fearing persons and some  are competent too. In view of the current socio-economic  problems in the country effective action should be taken to find  similar people for the middle and lower ranking government  positions also.    Nevertheless the people would like to see what the Commerce  Ministry's tagging will bring in its wake. It has become  apparent that the government's influence in maintaining economic  order is slight to almost non-existent.</p>

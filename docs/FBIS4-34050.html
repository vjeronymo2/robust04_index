			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Chief of Police General Luis Rocha Martinez: </F> "Bolivian Police Wants To Project New Image"; in La Paz, date  not given]    [Text] La Paz 2 (LOS TIEMPOS) -- As he condemned views  critical of the Ministry of Interior and General Staff of the  Bolivian Police, expressed by several "self-styled  institutionalist police chiefs," General Luis Rocha Martinez  stated in an interview granted to LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz, that  the institution has begun carrying out "irreversible actions"  aimed at projecting a new image to the country's population.    Expressing "profound concern that illegal interests have  embedded themselves in the institution, with obscure aims,"  General Rocha spoke of several modernization projects that are  under way in La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and other districts  of the country, and "that can be expected to come to fruition  soon."    The police chief referred to the "plans, programs, and  strategies" that have been drawn up by his staff in the short  time he has been in command, designed to modernize the Bolivian  police. Following is the dialogue held with General Rocha  Martinez:    [LOS TIEMPOS] General Luis Rocha, the modernization plans  announced by the police have been so severely criticized that it  is now said that these good intentions have been postponed  indefinitely. Is there any truth to what is being said?    [Rocha] No. Very much on the contrary, my staff has taken  definite steps in recent months toward improving the police  institution's infrastructure, academic training, and modernizing  the institution's equipment.    The Bolivian police's current change of attitude exists and  is permanent. The steps it has taken in its pursuit of renewal  within the institution include the creating of an Honor Tribunal  made up of former commanding generals of the police; the  purchase of equipment to provide improved security services to  the public; and the drawing up of plans to improve qualitatively  the carrying out of their assigned tasks by the institution's  future officers.    [LOS TIEMPOS] Just what are the improvements to which you  refer?    [Rocha] For example, we have accelerated the work on  remodeling the police units in the city of La Paz and  Cochabamba. Evidence of this is the very recent remittance of  approximately 40,000 bolivianos to the city of Cochabamba's  Departmental Command, enabling it to proceed with the remodeling  of what were once the criminology offices and are soon to be the  sections of the Judicial Technical Police [PTJ].    The little that is available to the institution to improve  its means of providing service to the Bolivian population is  being put to use. As part of these plans, legally established  businesses in Bolivia have been invited to bid on supplying  typewriters and new office equipment for the offices of the PTJ.  During the first phase, these PTJ offices will operate in La  Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz.    With respect to its improvements program, the institution is  currently awaiting the release of the Bolivian police budget  funds that were approved this year by the government, so as to  issue further calls for bids on the supplying of police  reconnaissance cars, modern vehicles to augment our pool of  radio patrol cars, and motorcycles for use by the Citizens  Assistance and Cooperation Patrol [PAC] in La Paz, Cochabamba,  and Santa Cruz.    [LOS TIEMPOS] Will the PAC operate only in La Paz,  Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz?    [Rocha] No. The plan will be implemented throughout Bolivia.  Specific phases of the program are being drawn up for this  purpose. In this respect, we are planning an initial purchase of  120 motorcycles for the three departments of the country.    Upon completion of these projects along the central axis,  the  program will be extended to Oruro, Sucre, and Potosi, and in a  third phase to the departments of Tarija, Beni, and Pando.    [LOS TIEMPOS] To what other areas has your staff assigned a  modernization priority?    [Rocha] My staff has also accorded attention to the police  training system. Over the past few weeks we have entered a new  period of extended police training.    Under this program, substantial transformations are under  way, beginning with the National Police Academy in La Paz, the  Officers Post-Graduate Institute, the Noncommissioned Officers  Training School, and the Basic Training Schools.    After many years, competitive examinations have been opened  to women. Women are a very real necessity especially in police  units connected with the PTJ [Judicial Technical Police], and  the narcotics and other services that are part of the  institution. This year, we are going to begin by increasing the  female police component by 50 persons. The component will  operate in parallel with the Police Basic Training School.    Thus, and as borne out by these general examples I have  cited, the process of modernization and institutional change  within the Bolivian police is well under way.    The institution fully intends to improve its image  qualitatively in the minds of the citizens. It is to this end  that we are implementing a program of reequipping the police  with new reconnaissance cars, radio patrol cars, and ambulances  to provide emergency assistance to the citizens.    Concurrently, we are redistributing our institution's best  police personnel -- personnel who have been fully trained,  including training in Europe as well -- to more effectively  perform our task of serving the Bolivian people.</p>

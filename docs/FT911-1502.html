			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Motoring: Determined to be a ruler of the road EIGHT YEARS ago, Mitsubishi's Shogun was the first import to loosen Range Rover's stranglehold on the posh end of the four-wheel drive, on-off road market. Range Rover, aristocratic elder statesman of recreational 4x4s, is now in its 21st year. It looks much the same as it did when launched in 1970, although there have been many changes below stairs. That is not the Japanese way of making motor cars. At five years, a Japanese car is getting long in the tooth and at eight, it is overdue for replacement. So this week, a completely new Shogun went on sale in Britain, some months after it had made its debut back home. Or rather, two Shogun estates; a short wheelbase 3-door and long wheelbase 5-door. Each comes with a choice of a 3-litre V6 petrol engine with catalyser or a 2.5 litre turbocharged and intercooled diesel. A 5-speed manual gearbox is standard, a 4-speed automatic optional on the petrol V6 versions. Only the engines, suitably uprated, have been carried over. Everything else, from the curvy styling to a unique transmission offering the benefits of both two-wheel and four-wheel drive, is new. Having tried all of them on and off road, I rate the new Shoguns clear class leaders for all-round performance, comfort and value for money. Prices, which include a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, start at Pounds 17,989 for the 3-door diesel and go up to Pounds 22,349 for an automatic 5-door V6. The diesels are cheaper than their petrol- engined equivalents. If I have any reservation about the Shoguns at all, it is their styling. The original one had fairly sober, straight up and down lines that quickly gave it a Range Rover acceptability in the country, both as a puller of horse trailers and a grandstand at hunt races. The new one is a bit bulgy in a transatlantic kind of way. Not as de trop as the vast new Toyota Land-Cruiser, you understand, but perhaps not quite as Badminton as it used to be. Potential owners of on-off road four-wheel drives (especially those to be used mostly on-road) should look beyond the rotund styling and flash alloy wheels. They will find the Shogun as light to drive, as refined mechanically and almost as comfortable to ride in as a car. Yet off road, it makes light of terrain not one owner in 100 would dream of driving over. The secret of the Shogun's elegance on-road is its independent front suspension. All its class rivals, bar the Isuzu Trooper, have beam axles front and back. These are fine - arguably better - for the most severe off-road driving but they can't provide really car-like handling on road. Immediately after testing the Shogun I drove its closest competitor, the Land Rover Discovery. This admirable machine is relaxed on a motorway and almost unstoppable across y ride on winding roads disconcerting. It is less urbane (the turbo-diesel in particular) than the Shogun when used as a car substitute. Shoguns used to have a simple, selectable transmission. For normal roads, they were rear-wheel driven; for driving across country, on snow-covered roads or muddy tracks, you put them in high or low range four-wheel drive. They can still be used in rear wheel-only drive on the road. This makes them quieter and more economical because it puts out of use two sets of gears, one in the transfer box, the other in the front axle. But four-wheel drive can also be engaged or disengaged at up to 100 kmh (62 mph) and, if you wish, left permanently in use, as it is in a Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery or the latest Mercedes Benz G-Wagen. The new Shogun has a central viscous coupling. This allows four-wheel drive to be used full time on hard, dry roads without straining the transmission, making the steering feel peculiar or wearing out the tyres. It can be locked for extra off-road traction. All these functions are under the control of a single, easy-to-use lever that also selects high and low range in the transfer gearbox. For the ultimate in off-road grip, pressing a button on the fascia locks the rear differential, providing your speed is less than 10kph (7mph). I drove the Shoguns in Spain, where a dry spell ended the day I arrived  - it always does. On traditionally awful Spanish minor roads through the mountains - even the patches are patched - they went exactly where I pointed them in comfort and security. On the autovia, they cruised quietly at the sort of speeds British business drivers are accustomed to use on motorways. The impression I had - may Mitsubishi forgive me - was of driving an abnormally high-slung Volvo estate car. The engines are quiet, the transmission literally noiseless and wind noise subdued. Shoguns are equipped and have interiors furnished to executive car levels. The long wheelbase ones have a large power-operated glass sunroof over the passenger part. Even the 3-door models - now genuine 5-seaters - have electric windows, headlamp washers and rear window wash-wipe. The back door is side-hinged and stays open when the Shogun is parked on a steep slope. Among the instruments is an exterior thermometer and an inclinometer. All big, bluff four-wheel drives become thirsty when driven fast because the air cannot flow smoothly around their bodies. Still, the new Shoguns are not so bad as the originals, with drag coefficients (an indication of their wind resistance) of 0.48 compared with 0.55. Cars that cruise quite economically at 80mph (128kph) have drag coefficients of around 0.30. The official figures suggest the Shogun turbo-diesels should average about 25mpg (11.3l/100km) and the petrol V6s, whether manual or automatic, around 20mpg (13.5l/100km) when used on roads in rear-wheel drive. But if you cruise at more than 80mph (128kph) and drive them as though they were hot hatchbacks, all bets are off.</p>

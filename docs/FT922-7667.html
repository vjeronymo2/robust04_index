			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: The world in your pocket THE NEW Horizon series will fall like manna from heaven into the hands of eager self-improvers. This encyclopaedic series, new from Thames and Hudson, consists of remarkably well-designed, alluring little books. They fit into a pocket, take a mere hour or so to read, and cost Pounds 6.95. Eventually, New Horizons will encompass every subject which might reasonably excite a late-20th-century autodidact. The launch has brought us a dozen volumes on such curiously miscellaneous subjects as Beethoven, dinosaurs, Van Gogh, the history of polar exploration, Vikings, alphabets and elephants. Many, many more titles are in the pipe-line; as the blurb puts it, 'this is a truly ongoing global venture.' Seekers after modest enlightenment in no less than 14 countries are able to gorge on their versions of New Horizons, which is being simultaneously published in 12 languages. Its country of origin, however, is France, where Gallimard's very popular Gallimard Decouvertes now runs to several hundred titles. It will make an interesting comment on the intellectual culture of our times to see which titles are translated for whom. British readers, one imagines, are most unlikely to be given Carpeaux, Berlioz, or the Fronde. But will Voltaire be deemed of sufficiently general interest to make it across the Channel? A New Horizon book is written in a bland, anonymous style with rather irritating come-on headings in heavy type. Nonetheless, the content, which for the most part is written by French academics, is eminently respectable. Perhaps the best value book-buy I made last year, was one of the Decouvertes series on French encounters with 19th century Japanese culture. Each book includes short bibliographies and an 'archive' selection of documents - although its French origins can make for selections which strike a British reader as peculiar. The design of these books is masterly. They are printed on high-gloss paper and are crammed with a wealth of remarkably good colour photographs. Often there is a run of full-page photographs; scenes from the Bayeux Tapestry, Van Gogh self-portraits, portraits of Beethoven's lady-loves. Exceptionally industrious picture-research has made New Horizons not only extremely tempting, but surprising, too, even when one thinks a subject is completely familiar. Viking: Lords of the Sea, for example, is full of hilarious 19th-century history-paintings of Valkyries and pillaging characters in cow-horn helmets. Beethoven, too, appears in truly dreadful guises, playing The Mooonlight as bosomy female wraiths ascend from the piano-strings.</p>

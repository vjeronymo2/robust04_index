Hata is scheduled to have talks with  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev on Monday.    All indications are that Tokyo and Moscow will achieve no  major breakthrough on a territorial row during Hata's three-day  visit, since the new Russian parliament is dominated by  ultrarightists and conservatives opposed to returning the four  disputed islands to Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Afrikaner Freedom Front [AVF] has mixed feelings  over the international mediators who have just arrived in South  Africa. The AVF says the presence of British and American  mediators, Lord David Carrington and Dr. Henry Kissinger, will  put the Boer-Afrikaners and other whites in South Africa at an  even greater disadvantage.    Similar interference in the old Rhodesia led to the forcing  of former premier Ian Smith into a settlement, and the action  held nothing good for the whites of Rhodesia.    The AVF trusts that the mediators are in South Africa to  find  a solution rather than force the Zulus into surrendering to the  ANC and communism. According to the AVF, the mediators, with  the aid of former prime minister John Vorster, forced Mr. Ian  Smith to surrender. The Lancaster summit saw to it that the  whites of Rhodesia received nothing, the AVF said. The AVF  contends that the mediators' first task should be to see to it  that the National Party-ANC alliance is convinced into  postponing the election. Thereafter, they could play a more  meaningful role in negotiations.    They should also see to it that the violence in  kwaZulu/Natal  comes to an end. The military presence and the state of  emergency in the region create an intimidating climate. The AVF  said a settlement in the self-determination of a free Zulu  nation will not be found in this way.</p>

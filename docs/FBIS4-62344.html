			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Selivanov report under the "Dniester Region" rubric: </F> "Into Whose Hands Does the Withdrawal of the 14th Army Play?  Attitude to Russian Troops in Moldova May Change in the Most  Unpredictable Way"]    [Text] During festivities held in Tiraspol on the occasion  of Victory Day, the Dniester Region leaders pointedly distanced  themselves from the command of the 14th Army. Igor Smirnov,  president of the Dniester Region Moldovan Republic, departed  from the city's central square after laying flowers and making a  brief address to the veterans, leaving it to General Aleksandr  Lebed and his subordinates to take charge of the conduct of the  celebration -- something the Russian soldiers did a good job of.    This public demonstration of hostility has effectively been  precipitated by the general context of relations between the  Dniester Region leaders and the 14th Army command, which have  recently been described as woefully bad. Judging by some  indicators, the Dniester Region leaders, having soberly weighed  all the "pros" and "cons" regarding the presence of the Russian  troops in the region, are inclined to think that their  withdrawal will only be welcome. After recent political  breakthroughs toward the final settlement of the Dniester Region  crisis, the Tiraspol authorities, who formerly prayed for the  14th Army as their sole guardian, are no longer attaching  crucial importance to this function of the Russian troops.  Moreover, the republic itself presently has its own armed  forces that are fully capable of dealing with the potential  adversary -- the Moldovan Army. The decrease in the 14th Army's  strategic importance in the view of Dniester Region leaders has  brought its political role in the region to the foreground.  This role, given the well-known stance of Gen. Aleksandr Lebed,  who, as people here believe, has powerful circles in Moscow  behind him, does not suit Tiraspol at all. The line pursued by  the 14th Army commander during the past 18 months has been aimed  at replacing the current ruling elite of the Dniester Region  Moldovan Republic with more liberal leaders capable of striking  a compromise with Moldova. The peculiarity of the political  situation in the Dniester Region is that the 14th Army command  is the sole serious opposition to the Tiraspol regime. Its  political satellites from among local opposition figures wield  little clout and do not pose any independent threat to the  authorities. This is why the removal of Gen. Lebed from the  Dniester Region is seen by some Tiraspol politicians as a fairly  acceptable option. Moreover, the issue is precisely the  withdrawal of the army, not just the replacement of its  commander, because in the latter case Aleksandr Lebed will be  replaced by another general with similar instructions.  Suggestions that the 14th Army commander's 18-month revolt  might be an independent action have long lost credibility with  anyone here.    What is interesting in this situation is Chisinau's stance.  They are fully aware there that as of today Gen. Lebed is the  sole force that can weaken the current orthodox Tiraspol  authorities, if not topple them altogether. Upon the withdrawal  of the 14th Army from the Dniester Region, the chances of the  local opposition will be brought to nil, and the positions of  Igor Smirnov and Co. will receive a significant boost. The  latter is unlikely to please the Moldovan leaders, particularly  on the eve of an extremely difficult and prolonged stage of  detailed negotiations on the final settlement of the Dniester  Region problem. Therefore, the current political alignment  suggests that they in Chisinau are objectively interested in  having the 14th Army stay on. That this is not idle talk was  proved by the fact that in the recent Moldovan-Dniester  Region-Russian talks the question of withdrawing the 14th Army  was not even raised.</p>

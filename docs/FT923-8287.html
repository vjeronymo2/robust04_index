			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Observer: Glad-handing An unusual example of munificence from the tight-fisted people at the Treasury. Three years ago, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry suffered a humiliating rejection when it tried to join Iosco, the international grouping of securities regulators. It was eventually fobbed off with 'affiliate' status. But now the Treasury - which has since taken over financial regulation from the DTI - is planning to stump up Pounds 100,000 of the Pounds 600,000 cost of Iosco's annual bash, which this autumn takes place in London. Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, will also be hosting a jolly at the Royal Academy for the 700 regulators, spouses and other hangers-on. Presumably it's all meant to reinforce the City's standing as an international financial centre, though goodness knows why the City couldn't have put up the cash itself.</p>

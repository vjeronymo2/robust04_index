			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Ansaldo secures order from Taiwanese ANSALDO, the engineering arm of Italy's state-controlled Finmeccanica engineering group, has won a L250bn (Pounds 109m) order for two refuse treatment and electricity generating plants in Taiwan. The order, for the group's Ansaldo Volund subsidiary, is for units in the cities of Chiay and Tainan. The new plants will be capable of handling 300 tonnes and 900 tonnes of urban refuse a day respectively. The order was won in conjunction with a local partner, Chung Sing, part of the Taiwanese Kuang-Hwa group. Ansaldo's Volund-Ecology division will be responsible for the combustion and energy recovery aspects of the plants, while Ansaldo Energia will supply electricity-generating steam turbines. The group diversified into the waste treatment and environmental sectors after Italy's 1987 decision to block the development of nuclear power. In April 1992, the group bought Volund, a Danish company specialising in incinerators, boilers and heat recovery systems, as part of its push into waste management. Belleli, the Italian specialist engineering group, has won orders worth L60bn for oil and petrochemicals plant from Statoil in Denmark and Shell in the US, along with Ssangyong Oil of South Korea</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755): "Another Year of </F> Ups and Downs in the Annual Upsurge of Migrants"; passages  between slantlines published in boldface]    [Text] The annual upsurge of migrant workers was even  worse this year. According to information from various  localities, tens of millions of surplus rural laborers left home  to find jobs elsewhere after the Spring Festival. Many of them  left home to find urban jobs for the first time and became new  members of the migrant community.    The most striking feature of the migrant upsurge is that  tens  of millions of peasants travel here and there to find jobs after  the Chinese New Year, at a time when urban residents return home  after visiting relatives in the countryside, and the two groups  of travelers create a "spring travel tide." On the crest of the  tide are the migrant peasants, who are particularly noticeable  because of their large numbers.  <H5>  What Causes the Upsurge in Migrant Workers </H5>   The flow of large numbers of rural laborers began in the  second half of the 1980's with the readjustment of the rural  production structure and further economic development in the  coastal regions. The migration reached its first high tide at  about the time of the 1988 Spring Festival. Some of the rural  laborers who worked in urban and coastal areas went home as a  result of the economic retrenchment over the next three years,  but the general trend of migration did not decrease. Since  1991, the annual exodus of rural laborers has become larger and  larger, causing concern among both the government and the people.    In a certain sense, the upsurge of migrant workers is a  concentrated indication of the problems of rural areas,  agriculture and peasants, showing fully the impedance caused by  an excessive population to China's economic and social  development after the opening up of the market.    The household contract responsibility system, which links  remuneration to output, has solved the problem of feeding the  rural population, but a growing surplus labor force has been  created due to limitations on the availability of land. New  village and town enterprises have created nearly 1 million jobs  for the surplus rural labor force. However, job creation has  been uneven from region to region and the problems of the  surplus rural labor force are becoming worse and worse in  central and western regions and in some of the less developed  areas in coastal regions. In these regions peasant income has  increased slowly and they lack development opportunities. Some  of these peasants, not content with the situation, were the  first to leave home and look for opportunities elsewhere.  Following their lead, other villagers left home for coastal  regions and cities. As a result, the exodus of rural laborers  after each Spring Festival has become the biggest social news  every year.    Generally speaking, the flow of the rural labor force from  one province to another is part of the great historical process.  Such spontaneous regulation and balancing of the labor force  has, to a certain extent, helped some less developed rural areas  become better off sooner, and has greatly supported economic  development in the developed regions.    In Jiangsu's Wuxi County, which has the greatest economic  strength of any county in China, migrant workers yield an annual  output value of more than 5 billion yuan.    The leaders of some northwestern provinces and regions  have openly pointed out: "After one person leaves home, the  entire family will be freed from poverty." We should send  surplus rural labor force to work elsewhere and deem the action  an important way or even a strategic measure to free the people  from poverty.    The peasants of Sichuan and Hunan Provinces working in other  provinces send home their earnings of more than 10 billion yuan  a year, and they are the major source of increased income of  peasants. In many places where village and town enterprises are  of weak foundation and poor economic efficiency, the total  earnings of peasants working away from home are much greater  than the total earnings of those enterprises. According to a  most conservative estimate by the department concerned, the  total annual earnings sent home by peasants across the country  amount to 50 billion yuan. According to another estimate, the  social wealth created by migrant workers across the country  exceeds 3 billion yuan a year.    Of course the upsurge of migrant workers also poses a series  of problems concerning urban and rural political affairs,  economy, culture, and population. The Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee has unequivocally pointed out  that the existing household registration system will be reformed  in the near future. How to guide, coordinate, and organize such  a large flow of migrant workers among provinces is a social  problem demanding prompt solution.  <H5>  Useful Exploration and Trial </H5>   Guangdong Province was the first to disperse, guide, and  manage migrant workers. Since as early as 1988, Guangdong has  stepped up the management of the inter-provincial labor service  market and promoted labor service cooperation. Now, some major  labor-export provinces have set up labor service management  offices in Guangdong. In this regard, Guangdong has found out  some effective labor control methods. For instance, it  invariably stops hiring migrant workers during the peak spring  travel period -- January and February -- and migrant workers  from other provinces must carry at all times in their person  three certificates -- ID card, permit to work away from home  issued by a labor department at the county level or above, and  single status certificate or family planning certificate.    Through the establishment of a labor service market base,  Beijing since 1991 has effectively managed migrant workers from  other parts of the country. The municipal labor department has  successively established a cooperative relationship in labor  service with Hebei, Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and  Gansu; and has gradually formulated rules and regulations which  standardize the procedures for hiring migrant laborers to work  in the construction, textile, and environmental protection  fields.    Sichuan, a major labor export province, has adopted concrete  measures. The provincial government has stipulated that each  migrant worker group must have a leader or coordinator. If it  is a very large group, the government will assign a cadre to  travel with it and manage it. The province has set up labor  service development leading groups and offices at and above the  county level and established labor service training bases and  labor service exchange markets.    Five million migrant workers from Hunan are working in other  provinces. The provincial labor department has already joined  Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and five other southern provinces  and regions in establishing a labor service cooperation  information network. It has also set up labor service offices  in Guangdong and Zhuhai. More than 60 percent of the counties  in Hunan have had offices in coastal regions. Those offices are  responsible for collecting information, issuing certificates and  registrations, arranging transportation, and providing escorts  to travel with migrant groups. In this way, large numbers of  laborers are organized to leave for labor service markets in  coastal regions.    Tianjin Municipality in the past tried to expel and block  migrant workers and imposed fines on them, but none of those  efforts worked. In recent years, it has shifted its efforts from  "blocking" to "dispersal" and the new efforts prove remarkably  effective. For instance, Tianjin's Hongqiao District used to be  the gathering place of a large number of rural laborers. The  district labor department has set up an employment agency which  can accommodate several hundred job seekers and even provide  food and lodging service to some of them.    Tianjin Municipality has also built labor service bases in  Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, and Anhui Provinces so that the job  seekers can wait there for employment opportunities. Since the  employment is through the labor service market, the blind flow  of migrant workers has decreased.    While various localities were actively exploring ways for  managing labor export, the Ministry of Labor in October 1993  published an "urban and rural employment coordination plan."  The plan specifically calls for organized efforts to guide  rural labor exodus through legitimate channels, for the hiring  regions to formulate necessary labor market rules and management  system to manage incoming laborers, and for offering and  improving services to migrant rural laborers during the entire  course of their trans-regional travel. By implementing the  plan, the Ministry of Labor expects to ensure an orderly labor  force flow in all localities by the end of 1996.  <H5>  Get at the Root of the Problem </H5>   While it is necessary to organize and guide the flow of  migrant workers at present, the permanent solution of the  problem is to accelerate the economic development in the central  and western regions so that more jobs will be created for the  local surplus labor force.    Village and town enterprises are a large "container" to  accept rural surplus labor force. They created 9.72 million  jobs in 1992 and more than 7 million jobs in 1993. However,  they are still far from being able to accept all the rural  surplus labor force which is in hundreds of millions. The  places of origin of migrant workers should consider local  realities and make more efforts to develop economic projects  that need smaller investment, yield quicker results, and hire  more workers. Developed coastal regions should accelerate the  relocation of their labor-intensive industries to less developed  regions and absorb more surplus labor force into the secondary  and the tertiary industries.    The development of "three-dimensional agriculture [li ti  nong  ye 4539 7555 6393 2814]" and high-yield, high-quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture can refine the division of labor  within the primary industry and absorb more rural labor force.    In recent years, there have been a number of townships and  towns with quite developed secondary and tertiary industries in  the central and western regions. They are like "sparks"  illuminating the local economy. We can expect that with the  rise of those industries, most of the central and western  regions will be like coastal regions where some peasants leave  crops field but not the village as they work for factories  without having to go to cities.</p>

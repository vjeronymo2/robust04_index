			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Clinton refines economic policy: Strategy seeks to create jobs through Dollars 50bn-a-year investment GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, yesterday returned his campaign to policy specifics, in which he excels, with a detailed reformulation of his economic programme. Refining the policies he endorsed during the four-month Democratic primary campaign, Mr Clinton called for an economic strategy that would create jobs by investing Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27bn) a year in education and infrastructure, while cutting the federal budget deficit by half over four years. Mr Clinton, the Arkansas governor, launched his programme at a meeting of the US Conference of Mayors in Houston. He emphasised proposals for 'Dollars 20bn a year of hard, federal dollars' to invest in transport and information technology infrastructure, as well as the creation of urban enterprise zones  -a policy pressed by Mr Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development in the Bush administration - and more community policing. His programme also calls for 'lifetime learning' with investment in education all the way from kindergarten to adult retraining, as well as healthcare reforms embracing the 'play or pay' approach, by which employers would either have to provide health insurance for their employees or pay a levy into a state-run health insurance fund. Mr Clinton still supports shifting the tax burden away from middle-income families towards the wealthiest taxpayers, but he has weakened his proposal for a middle-class tax cut, which drew from his principal Democratic opponent, Mr Paul Tsongas, the charge of pandering for votes. The Clinton programme would now allow middle-income families either a children's tax credit or a reduction in their income tax rate - but not both, as he had previously advocated. Higher income tax rates for the richest 2 per cent of the population, coupled with a surtax on millionaires, would raise Dollars 17.8bn of additional revenue in 1993, the Clinton plan says, rising to Dollars 23bn in 1996. 'I believe that during the 1980s the rich got richer and the middle class took it on the chin,' Mr Clinton said. The other main sources of revenue in Mr Clinton's programme are additional cuts in defence spending totalling Dollars 37.5bn over four years, and measures to tax foreign subsidiaries operating in the US more heavily by clamping down on their transfer pricing arrangements with their parent companies. Mr Clinton estimates that this could raise an additional Dollars 45bn over four years. This measure, along with a plan to discourage companies from moving manufacturing operations to other countries by no longer allowing them to defer paying tax on overseas earnings, echoes a package put forward in Congress by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House of Representatives ways and means committee. Shying away from the politically sensitive issue of tackling entitlement programmes such as social security and Medicare, which are the fastest growing component of the federal budget, Mr Clinton expects only Dollars 4.4bn of savings from entitlement reforms. Mr Clinton projects a federal budget deficit still totalling Dollars 141bn in 1996 if growth remains moderate, compared with an expected deficit of Dollars 400bn this year - a more modest claim than that of Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate, who said he could eliminate the deficit 'without breaking a sweat'.</p>

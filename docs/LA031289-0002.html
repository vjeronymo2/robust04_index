			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> In an age of television programming that concentrates on the sensational and  short interest-span production, it was indeed moving to see "The Fulfillment of  Mary Gray," a heartfelt story shown on CBS. The acting was superb, as was the  photography. Most rewarding was the attention paid in great detail to authentic  dance music of the period, costuming, old-time outdoor picnics and the actual  use of old farm implements, wagons, cornhusking machines, plows and even an  antique hat pin holder on the dresser. This attention to detail will stay with  us forever.  </P> <P> Charles and Sigrid Bausback, La Crescenta  </P></p>

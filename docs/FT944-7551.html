			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / People: HSBC's Dick Peterson moves to New York Good news for the over-fifties. Dick Peterson, a 59-year-old ex-Chase Manhattan banker, has just been appointed chief executive of HSBC Holdings' New York corporate banking business. In an industry which sometimes seems to worship youth, Peterson has survived longer than many of his contemporaries. He worked for Chase in Los Angeles, London and New York, and joined Midland Bank in 1983 at the behest of Herb Jacobi, another ex-Chase banker. Although Midland Bank's US ambitions were cut short by its disastrous acquisition of California's Crocker Bank, and Midland was itself acquired by HSBC in 1992, Peterson opened Midland's branch in New York in 1983 and has soldiered on when others have opted for early retirement. Peterson has no plans to do the same because he still enjoys the business. A former colleague at Chase describes Peterson as a 'tremendously experienced guy' who has very good interpersonal skills, sound judgment and is 'very good with clients'. Peterson would be the first to admit that he is not the only banker with 30 years' experience under his belt with these attributes. But he is one of the last to be still climbing the promotion ladder. His new job involves integrating the New York corporate banking businesses of Midland and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation into a new unit called HSBC Corporate Banking. It will work closely with HSBC's Marine Midland Bank.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar dealt double blow THE DOLLAR made a remark-able recovery in late European trading yesterday after being dealt the double blow of dismal US employment data and a cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, writes Emma Tucker. The US currency fell nearly two pfennigs to a 16-month low of DM1.4995 on the news that non-farm payrolls dropped 117,000 in June, confounding market expectations of a 90,000 rise. However, a combination of rumours that the Fed was intervening and the fear of going too short with the currency at such low levels rescued the dollar from further losses. It ended in London at DM1.5135, after Wednesday's close of DM1.5170. Dealers said the dollar's resilience indicated that the bad news had been, to a certain extent, anticipated. But the dollar later slipped in New York to a DM1.5075 finish. The sharp drop in employment was spread broadly across the economy, apart from a small rise in government employment, and followed a string of poor economic data last week. Within an hour of the employment news being released, the Fed announced a half-point cut in discount rate to 3 per cent, its lowest level since the summer of 1963. Most of the big banks followed the Fed governors' unanimous decision to lower the discount rate by cutting their prime rates  1/2 point to 6 per cent. Some analysts said they now expected the dollar to head towards its all-time low of DM1.4460, set in February 1991. Mr Nicholas Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International, the Japanese Bank, said: 'The Fed will probably respond to further weakness with more rate cuts, so the dollar is likely to go even lower - it could even go into free fall.' However, others said they thought the US currency would find support at DM1.50. Mr Gerald Holtham, chief international economist at Shearson Lehman, said: 'There is an incredibly strong feeling in the market that the dollar is fundamentally cheap at these levels, and people do not want to be too short when the inevitable rally comes.' With the dollar hogging most of the attention on the foreign exchanges, there was little scope for action on the EMS currencies. In the morning the Italian lira came under pressure as rumours of a devaluation swept the market. One trader said the lack of confidence overseas was increasing. The currency was also affected by the weakness of the dollar and worries about the political and economic outlook in Italy. Dealers said the Bank of Italy had intervened to temper downward pressure on the currency. The pound had a good day, although it remained at the bottom of the EMS grid. It edged above DM2.90 to finish at DM2.9025.</p>

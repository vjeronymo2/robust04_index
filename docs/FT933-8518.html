			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Records: Play up to the keyboard - Should pianists be musicians? Haefliger's Schubert Impromptus: SONY SK 53 108 Vogt PICTURES etc.: EMI CDC 7 54548 2 Tan's Beethoven: EMI CDC 7 54526 2 Lively/Gielen Busoni (etc.): Koch CD 311 160 H1 Kikssin/Giulini Schumann: Binns/Lloyd-Jones Balakirev/Rimsky: Hyperion CDA 66640 Lively/Gielen Busoni: Koch CD 311 160 H1. THE QUESTION is not utterly stupid; for if 'No' is an impossible reply, there is still healthy room for a 'Yes - within limits]' The limits will depend upon how much you include within 'musicianliness'. If that takes in everything that makes for an effective performance, there can be no argument; but as pianists become more and more reluctant to be identified as 'brilliant technicians' - thought to be a glut on the market, though I would not agree - the recognised marks of the Serious Musician become ever more austere. The trouble with that is that the best part of the piano repertoire makes knowing room for virtuoso magic on its unique instrument. Composers are well aware that each note on a piano is unalterable, once struck, though it can be allowed to die away more or less quickly; not being a true 'sustaining' instrument, it can only mimic a singing legato. On the other hand, with its multi-fingered attack, its damper-pedal and its rich octave-resonances, the piano can conjure up sounds like nothing else. Figuration is the name of the game, the art of titivating music for the keyboard. Too many performances on my current batch of piano CDs make too little of that, especially where the composers expected pure pianism to carry the day without extending the musical argument by very much. On Sony SK 53 108, for example, Andreas Haefliger offers as searching and purposeful readings of eight Schubert Impromptus - the wonderful late sets, D899 and 935 - as I have heard in some time; I shall return to them often. And yet: these pieces contain some of Schubert's most memorably pretty piano-writing, passages of inspired delicacy that no music-lover can forget  -and Haefliger is resolutely un-charming with them ('charmless' would be unfair). Lesser pianists often capture the authentic shimmer better. Melvyn Tan's EMI programme of mostly lesser Beethoven (CDC 7 54526 2) makes an intriguing comparison. On Beethoven's own Broadwood piano (much restored, I think), he plays Bagatelles early and late, and the G minor Fantasia, with the basically silly variation-sets on 'God Save the King' and 'Rule Britannia' fore and aft. There is any amount of quirky charm here, just as required. Nothing over-fanciful, but Tan's clever rubato - and the chunky, sinewy appeal of the instrument - bring the music immediately to life; and he is equal to the visionary last Bagatelles, op. 126 (virtually contemporary with those Schubert Impromptus). The remarkable Yevgeny Kissin, who is still young enough to count as a prodigy, is immaculate - if a touch sober - in solo Grieg and Liszt on Sony SK 52 567. The main offering, however, is the evergreen Schumann Concerto, where Kissin is unsuitably yoked with the veteran conductor Giulini and the Vienna Philharmonic. There are exquisitely realised passages, but too often the pianist is audibly struggling against Giulini's moody tempi: a fresh, buoyant performance is half-stifled amid all that leisurely reverence. On EMI (CDC 7 54548 2), Lars Vogt - distinguished second prizewinner at the last Leeds competition, after Arthur Pizzarro - underplays the salon charms of his Tchaikovsky fill-ups, the Dumka and three of the 'Seasons' pieces. A sonata by his Russian wife, Tatiana Komarova, is sweetly Skryabinesque, and leaves no great mark. In Mussorgsky's Pictures from an Exhibition, however, he has any number of subtle ideas, deeply musical and always respectful of the text. All that one misses is a sense that the chicks' 'Ballet', the 'Marketplace at Limoges' and 'Baba Yaga' are tremendous pianistic fun: Vogt is excellent, but excessively polite. We have needed a proper account of Balakirev's posthumous Piano Concerto, and Malcolm Binns - with David Lloyd-Jones conducting the English Northern Philharmonia, thoroughly idiomatic - has now supplied one (Hyperion CDA 66640), along with Rimsky-Korsakov's less substantial concerto. Binns is fully equal to Balakirev's athletic demands, as also to his twinkling charm. Just here and there, one would like harder fingers: some of Balakirev's best pianistic trouvailles trade upon the effect of an unstoppable mechanism. In Busoni's monster Concerto with male chorus (Koch CD 311 160 H1), the American pianist goes through the hoops with tireless panache - which is all he needs to do, for his is essentially a noisy concertante role. The music, broad but not very complicated, rests in the safe hands of Michael Gielen, conducting the Sudwestfunk Symphony. Busoni fans will have to have it.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Brahms piano trios - Royal Festival Hall Brahms wrote five altogether, but two include a horn or clarinet. The other three employ the canonical violin and cello, and they add up to a solid programme, not least because they range so widely over the composer's career  -in fact the early B major Trio of 1854, op 8, was extensively re-composed some years after the far later Second and Third Trios had been published. To deliver the programme, who better than Vladimir Ashkenazy, Itzhak Perlman and Lynn Harrell? - all distinguished Brahms players, and keen collaborators as well as notable concert soloists. On Saturday, however, the Festival Hall seemed the wrong place for them. The hall was crowded; but human bodies soak up sound. Though one can hardly speak of 'the' Festival Hall acoustics, because they depend upon concert-by-concert adjustments to a great many concealed amplifiers, I can say that on Saturday the acoustics granted to the Ashkenazy team were dry and severely distancing. One wished the whole affair transplanted to the Wigmore Hall. In the op 87 Trio at the start, the strings' bald unison declamation - a device much used by piano-trio composers for forceful effect - seemed frail and remote. Then the piano-entry, which should be a rich revelation of the harmonic context, seemed just as wan. It was understandable that the ever-tactful Ashkenazy should choose to keep his piano lid half-closed - Perlman's violin is invincibly sweet, not aggressive, and Harrell's forte is introspective, quasi-vocal musing - but it didn't flatter Brahms's robustly impassioned piano-parts. The pianist allowed himself a few ringing outbursts - much of a muchness, actually, in whichever Trio - at sound, unarguable places. Otherwise he was content to supply sympathetic accompaniment to the strings well in front of him, who looked deeply into each other's eyes and played like a committed duo. The net effect was of performances excellently prepared en gros et en detail but probably much-recycled and by now polished to routine. At least there were properly fiery moments in the heroic C minor Trio, op 101; and in the B major work, which was their anti-chronological conclusion, there was enough imagination in the rapt Adagio and the Finale to let us conjecture how they might have sounded close-up. Must this repertoire go the way of the new maxi-audience operatic ventures - with similar musical losses? Why should subtle musicians find themselves delivering serious, narrow-gauge Brahms to a huge audience in the wrong kind of place? The gilt-embossed front cover of the programme-book said it all: 'celebrity chamber recital' (italics mine) - in the Festival Hall] If there are big concert halls that can offer friendly accommodation to chamber music, this one is not among them, except when performers have a Russian knack for enlarging chamber-gestures to an operatic scale. From a distance, I admired these performances sincerely; but I have heard much more exciting accounts of each Trio by less famous virtuosi - in halls of the right size.</p>

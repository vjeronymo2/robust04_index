			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Babic ignores pressure from Serbs IN DEFIANCE of mounting pressure from Serbia, Mr Milan Babic, the president of Krajina, yesterday summoned the parliament of the Serb enclave in Croatia to consider a referendum on the UN plan to despatch 10,000 peace-keepers, reports Laura Silber from Knin. As deputies in Knin, the capital of Krajina, assembled yesterday, Mr Babic accused the federal army of blocking roads to prevent them from reaching the parliament. Mr Babic has consistently opposed the UN plan, pitting him against Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his former patron. Mr Babic objects to the plan, saying it lacks sufficient guarantees for the region's 250,000 Serbs. Krajina's Serbs in August 1990 began their uprising against Croatia, fearing their fate in an independent Croatian state. Serbia claims the UN plan has full support, ignoring the objections of Krajina's leaders. But the UN has never before deployed peace-keepers to a country unless all sides have agreed to their despatch. The UN is expected today to despatch an additional 25 unarmed liaison officers.</p>

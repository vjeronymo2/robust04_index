			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella today confirmed the dispatch of Argentine troops to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina region. He pointed out, however, that it  still must be determined if the troops will travel from Buenos  Aires or if some of the troops serving in Croatia will be  transferred.    Therefore, Di Tella confirmed that Argentina will provide  military cooperation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina region, accepting  a petition made by UN Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali, who  also asked for a special $10 million financial contribution for  the peace operation there.    Before opening an OAS-sponsored seminar on the security  issue  at the Alvear Hotel in this capital, the foreign minister  admitted today: "We are studying if the troops deployed in  Croatia will be transferred, new troops will travel, or a mixed  contingent, involving these two alternatives, will be deployed."    For his part, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion said Argentina  "will not be squandering money" by dispatching a 150-man  contingent to the Bosnia region. He said: "It is a reasonable  contribution to the peace of a country whose fate has caught the  world's attention."    Thus, Camilion challenged the criticism leveled by some  political leaders over Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella's  compromise with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. These  political leaders understand that there are other priority  issues.    In this regard, Camilion admitted that "there are other  pressing needs," but championed the governmental decision to  dispatch troops to Europe's most conflictive region because "it  represents a medium-term interest in the existence of a global  situation of good relations."    The defense minister summarized: "Argentina will play a  small role in this peace process, because there will be  thousands of troops there and Argentina will merely contribute  150 soldiers."    The Argentine compromise was established on 14 March after a  meeting between Argentine President Carlos Menem and the UN  secretary general, who also asked for a special financial  contribution for the funds allocated to the peacekeeping  operations.    Argentina has more than 800 troops deployed in Croatia, a  region in the former Yugoslavia where there are virtually no  more armed clashes. Therefore, Butrus-Ghali sought to guarantee  Argentina's presence in Bosnia, where the United Nations plans  to deploy between 10,000 and 15,000 Blue Helmets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] At a briefing for journalists in the Kremlin  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary,  disclosed that the treaty on civic accord would be signed at a  ceremony in St. George's Hall on 28 April. The final drafting  work was completed yesterday and it was forwarded to the  president and State Duma deputies for their attention.  Vyacheslav Kostikov said the criticisms and proposals of all  factions, including the Communists and the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia], had been heeded in the treaty. The  press secretary said that although President Yeltsin believes  that the treaty will succeed, he also realizes that not  everybody will support the document.    Vyacheslav Kostikov dwelled on the situation in the Black  Sea  Fleet. In his words, the Russian president is relying on Leonid  Kravchuk's common sense.    Relations with the United States were also touched on at the  briefing. During his telephone conversation with Bill Clinton  last night, Russian President Boris Yeltsin confirmed that  Russia's policies towards the United States remained unchanged.  President Yeltsin noted that our states were striving for  democracy. In the process Russia was mindful of both sides'  interests. Kostikov quoted Boris Nikolayevich as saying that  nobody would succeed in driving a wedge between himself and Bill  Clinton and rejected claims that a crack had appeared in the  Russo-U.S. relationship because of the Bosnian crisis.    Referring to Russia's attitude towards the Balkan situation,  the press secretary said that the president regards our  country's position as being unchanged. Russia has always  objected to air strikes in Bosnia and we are continuing our  attempts to persuade Serbia to cease fire and hold consultations  with all interested parties.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> KTLA reporter/anchor Minerva Perez was in the right place at the right time  this week. In Puerto Rico to attend a Latino media conference, she sprang into  action after an explosion occurred in a gun turret on the U.S. battleship Iowa,  killing at least 47 sailors. The dead and injured were ferried to hospitals in  Puerto Rico. Her reports on a press conference concerning the tragedy were to  air Thursday night not only on KTLA's 10 p.m. news here but also worldwide on  Cable News Network. Aleene MacMinn  </P></p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Russian productivity falls 24%: Moscow acts to curb price rises amid more grim economic data RUSSIA'S productivity showed a dramatic and accelerating decline over 1992 in line with a sharp fall in industrial output. Productivity fell by 24 per cent over the year, according to figures released yesterday by the independent Russian research centre Macroecon-Link. This compares with a productivity drop of 8 per cent in 1991. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, yesterday reiterated his promise to try to halt the country's industrial collapse. The government's main task was 'to brake, and then halt, the fall in production', he said. But the depth of Russia's industrial decline means he is unlikely to be able to increase output as he promised on taking office in mid-December. The already low productivity rate has worsened over the past year as output plunged in nearly every sector - while relatively few workers have been laid off. Macroecon-Link estimates that in all main spheres of industrial and energy production, except gas and electricity, production fell on average by 15-20 per cent in 1992 compared with 1991, and by around 25 per cent against 1990. The Russian government also moved yesterday to curb price rises on basic goods. The state price committee said company profits would be restricted to between 10 and 25 per cent of sales value. Profits are currently restricted to 25 per cent. Tass, the Russian news agency, said the decision expands controls to include non-monopoly producers. The decree affects companies producing bread, milk, meat and other foodstuffs, but it did not mean the country was abandoning its move to a market economy, said Mr Vladimir Safonov, deputy head of the price committee. In some sectors - such as fabrics and shoes - the decline in output over the two years 1990-1992 was between a third and a half. According to Macroecon-Link: 'Production fell most in branches which are directly dependent on imports of raw materials and component parts (non-ferrous metals, electronics, light industry, chemicals and petrochemicals), and in the food industry due to the absence of effective demand and strict limits on the use of raw materials.' The figures underline the deepening economic crisis confronting Mr Chernomyrdin's new cabinet. The premier is surrounded by ministers and advisers who oppose his plans, and the depth of the falls in output and productivity would render attempts to lift output very costly. Nonetheless, senior staff appointments now being made confirm that the reforming team of ministers put in place by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, is largely retained. Mr Boris Feodorov, the new deputy premier for the economy and finance, is seen as a potentially powerful figure in the control of credit and money supply - areas where the Gaidar government compromised and allowed inflation to rise to near hyper-inflationary levels. In the last quarter of 1992, however, Mr Gaidar was able to bring credit and budgetary spending under greater control - taking inflation down from 33 per cent a month in November to 25 per cent in December.</p>

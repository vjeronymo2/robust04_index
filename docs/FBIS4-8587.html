			<p>BFN     [Text] The economic, technical, and scientific  cooperation, the achievements attained so far, and the concrete  possibilities to strengthen them in the future were the main  theme of the talks held today between Prime Minister Meksi and  Klaus Kinkel, German deputy chancellor and foreign minister, in  the presence of Ministers Xhaja, Halili, and Belortaja.    Relations with Germany occupy an important place in our  entire policy, Meksi said at the beginning of his speech. This  is based on the special economic assistance and the full  political support that your country has rendered to Albania so  far and in the good wishes and will of both sides further to  strengthen our friendly relations.    Talking concretely about the present level of cooperation in  the economic, political, technical, scientific, and cultural  spheres, Meksi considered these to be successful and stressed  that, nevertheless, there exist more favorable possibilities so  that these relations be more intensively developed in other  fields as well. Important positive factors are the good progress  of the economic reform in Albania in its main indices and the  completion of the fundamental legal framework to attract foreign  investment. Overall production has increased and there is a  decrease in the budget deficit and inflation. Stability can be  noticed in the lek's exchange rate with foreign currencies. We  can say that we have left behind the most difficult period. We  have approved the main laws on investment, business, and the  banking and credit system, and the civil and penal codes are in  the process of being approved.    Meksi further stressed that the completion of a series of  bilateral agreements that are in the process of being drafted,  such as the abolition of double taxation, tourism, road and  maritime transportation, and scientific and cultural  cooperation, will create a more facilitating legal framework to  expand relations between our two countries.    Focusing on the problem of foreign investment, Prime  Minister  Meksi said that German capital is involved in Albania in special  investment, such as that of Siemens for Rinas Airport, and in  the form of joint ventures. However, he said, we expect German  investment to grow considerably during 1994 and beyond and to  include such fields as infrastructure and telecommunication,  road constructions, such as the east-west road, aqueducts,  energy, etc.    We greatly appreciate Germany's role both on the bilateral  level and within the framework of the European Union [EU], in  which Germany is the main contributor.    Mr. Meksi also dwelt on the problem of the foreign debt of  our banks and discussed ways of settling it, as another  guarantee for attracting foreign investment. He stressed that  contacts with German partners have been strengthened and hoped  that with the Paris Club Agreement, this problem will find the  way to solution in the framework of the general debt.    For his part, Mr. Kinkel said that Germany understands quite  well the difficult problems that you are encountering during the  transitional period and that Germany is committed to help as  before on the bilateral and the EU level. Albania is a country  that has suffered the most in the past. That is why you fully  deserve special assistance on our part, Kinkel stressed.  Germany will fully support you in your goals for an the  quickest possible political and economic approach to the EU,  membership into the Council of Europe, the cooperation with BEP  [expansion unknown], and the strengthening of the security of  your country, both with the NATO integration and the bilateral  level.    For this reason, we are ready to exchange high-level visits  and sign a joint statement to display our very good relations  and the goals of cooperation in the future.    In the economic level, our assistance will be increased and  will be concentrated on the system of energy supplies, the  construction of roads, economic development, etc. Though we  have to face our problems with eastern Germany, our attention  toward Albania will be increased. I also agree to abolish visas  for diplomatic and business trips.    Further on, Kinkel appreciated the achievements in the  sphere  of the institutional and legal reform and expressed his pleasure  that the judicial system is functioning well. He was ready for  assistance in this direction as well.    To conclude, Meksi said that Albania is a small country and  with a little investment, it can overcome this situation. We  have understood that the main factor of development is within  us, our work, which, with your assistance, can give rapid  positive results.    They also discussed German assistance in education, culture,  and science, the problem of Albanian refugees, and the situation  in the region.</p>

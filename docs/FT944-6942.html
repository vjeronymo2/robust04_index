			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Creamy notes from Vienna The Vienna Philharmonic's visit on Wednesday invited comparison with the splendid Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican two days earlier. But comparison would have been easier if both orchestras has played in the small hall. Whereas the Bavarians' resounding, vastly spacious account of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony under Lorin Maazel had room to breath, the analytical dryness of the South Bank did little to flatter those famous Viennese strings. Still, they came out of it pretty well, and gave us a real helping of whipped cream in the Brahms Hungarian Dance which they played as their second encore. Originally, Giulini had been billed to conduct, but he had cancelled some time ago, and James Levine made something very different of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony and Brahms's Fourth from the kind of performances we might have expected to hear from Giulini. Levine kept the Schubert on the move - quite rightly so, for the Symphony is often taken too slowly, with both movements too close in tempo and too much alike in character. Levine himself stayed unusually still, his baton travelled merely a few inches except when he wanted to rouse the orchestra. His overall view was serene, and though the playing was lovely, it was well on the way to being bland. You got the feeling the orchestra could have played as well on automatic pilot, for they certainly play as an ensemble. Brahms's Fourth Symphony was given a lot more impulse - as well it should. The first movement took on such momentum, it seemed likely to run away with itself. But it did not, and the closing moments were thrilling: rather too thrilling for the impact of the work as a whole, for the great cumulative structure of the variations in the finale lacked a certain tension, despite many beautiful moments, including a gorgeously rounded flute solo. One of the individual features of the Vienna Philharmonic is the elegantly burnished sound of their horns: they played like a dream in the trio section of the scherzo, whose rumbustious outer sections were much more refined than usual. As a whole, the performances seemed too suave to be heroic. Sometimes the best of a concert comes once the official programme is over, and so it was here. For the first encore, the orchestra teased and pampered the final ballet of Schubert's music for Rosamunde as if it were their favourite child. The tiny gradations of pianissimo on the strings, the mellow blend of the woodwind, the gently pointed phrasing - this is why we have come to hear the Vienna Philharmonic.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Why food figures are getting fatter A casual observer of the retail sales data published yesterday might deduce the British were becoming very fat. As the figures show, food shops have been performing strongly in recent months and account for most of July's retail sales growth. Between June and July food retailers' sales volumes rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 per cent. Volumes were 5.2 per cent higher in the three months to July, compared to the same period last year. One reason for this growth, according to analysts, has been growing demand for soft drinks and fruit and vegetables in the hot weather. Mr Hugh Clarke, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, says: 'Right through the recession food and drink showed good growth. There is no doubt people have got used to eating well.' But another reason may lie in the changing nature of the retail sector itself. Under the current system for producing the retail sales data, the CSO classifies its retail outlets into three main categories - food, non-food and 'mixed'. But 'food' stores such as supermarkets are increasingly selling non-food goods such as petrol and clothing. The CSO admits it is hard to tell just how much these non-food items are affecting the index. In response to demands from retailers for more detail, the CSO started a commodity based index last year, which breaks down sales from 44 retailers. These figures show, for example, that the value of food sales in these shops grew by 7 per cent in July, compared with the year before - slightly up from June's figure, when food sales were running 5 per cent higher, measured year-on-year. But deducing how much growth there is in the non-food category is difficult because the CSO does not yet produce figures showing comparable growth in volumes. Instead, it points out that in 1991 - the last available data - food was calculated to represent 70 per cent of 'food' retailers' sales values, and 10 per cent among 'mixed' retailers. As Mr Philip Gooding, CSO statistician, says: 'The problem with separating it out is that we would have to ask businesses for a detailed breakdown of sales and it would impose a heavy burden on them.' But although the CSO itself has little statistical evidence, the trend among retailers does suggest a rise. Tesco, which has 442 stores, opened its 200th petrol station this month, and says its beauty and pharmacy products are now a 'big growth area'. J Sainsbury has almost 150 petrol stations, up from 90 four years ago. Meanwhile Safeway points out that a significant part of its business stems not only from non-food items, but also from the provision of services such as post offices. And though the group argues that growth in these non-food sectors has been matched by growing food sales, the increasingly significant role played in retailing by the superstore means that petrol and perfumes could fatten up the CSO's 'food' data even further.</p>

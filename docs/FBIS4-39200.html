			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Karen Topchyan report: "Armenia-Iran: Ties Broaden"] </F>   [Text] Armenia and Iran have signed an agreement on border  trade between Armenia's Megrinskiy Rayon and Iran's Marand  Province. This document envisages opening in the next few days  a permanent market on the Armenian-Iranian border which will  sell mainly clothing and foodstuffs duty-free.    This agreement is by no means the first joint document.  Today over a dozen treaties are being implemented between the  two neighboring countries in the sphere of politics, the  economy, culture, and sport. Iran is Armenia's second most  important economic partner after Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Yi Tong-sik from Beijing] </F>   [Text] While additional inspections of North Korea are  smoothly coming to an end, a working-level negotiation team of  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] arrived in Beijing  this morning. The two-man negotiation team led by Inspections  Bureau chief (Perry Corse), will leave for Pyongyang at 1520  tomorrow afternoon [0620 GMT 24 May] via Koryo Airlines after  staying in Beijing today. While there, the team will conduct  negotiations with relevant North Korean officials over the  replacement of nuclear fuel rods.    The three inspectors, including chief of Inspections Section  (Heinonen), who have been watching the replacement of nuclear  fuel rods while conducting additional inspections in Yongbyon  after entering North Korea on 19 May, will conclude its  additional inspections today and leave Pyongyang tomorrow.  However, the possibility remains that the three-man inspection  team will present to the working-level negotiation team a report  on the comprehensive status surrounding the replacement of  nuclear fuel rods and join the negotiation team.    It is expected that the working-level negotiations will  proceed for at least four to five days this time. There is  concern, however, that if both sides should stand up to each  other tensely by sticking only to their previous positions, the  negotiations will directly stalemate like last August's nuclear  negotiations.</p>

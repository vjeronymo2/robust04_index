			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Russian government in state of disarray The Russian government is displaying disarray at the highest levels, resulting in serious misunderstandings and even panic both within its own ranks and abroad. A disputed presidential order on the establishment of Russian bases in the territories of the former Soviet states was yesterday the most recent of three incidents within a month which demonstrate either great disorganisation or malign meddling, or both, within the top administrative structures of the state. These were, in reverse order: The official notification by Tass, the state news agency, of a decree said to have been signed on Wednesday by President Boris Yeltsin, establishing 30 military bases in neighbouring states, including Latvia  - a decree whose existence was denied yesterday by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. A statement on March 31 by Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the presidential press secretary, that Mr Yeltsin would not be ready to sign the Nato-inspired 'Partnership for Peace' plan for six or seven months - which was flatly denied the next day by Mr Kozyrev, saying it would be signed later this month. The publication last month of a 'coup plot' caused investigations of top ministers and is supposed to be the subject of continuing investigations. The disarray becomes more obvious as pressure increases on the Russian president. The Federation Council, or parliament's upper house, refused on Wednesday to confirm the resignation of Mr Alexander Kazannik, who left his post as state prosecutor in February in protest against pressure from Mr Yeltsin not to agree to the freeing of those jailed for their part in the parliamentary coup last October. Mr Yeltsin says he will continue to regard Mr Alexei Ilyushenko as the acting state procurator, while the upper house points to the clause in the new constitution which gives it the right to appoint and release prosecutors. The confusion over the bases came when Tass put out a statement on Wednesday that the president had signed a decree on the establishment of military bases, including in Latvia. The Latvian government immediately went into emergency session, and a statement saying that the decree was in 'sharp contradiction' to agreements between Russia and the Baltic state was read out on TV by Mr Georg Andreevs, the Latvian foreign minister. Yesterday, Mr Kozyrev denied that the decree existed and likened it to the coup plot. He said it was a 'provocation'. However, Mr Kostikov said that the decree did exist, but that 'technical problems' with its phrasing had given the wrong impression to the Latvians, and that apologies had been made. He said the base referred to was Skrunda, a radar installation which both sides have agreed will be rented by Russia. A similar announcement was made by the defence ministry. The issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics is a highly emotive one on both sides. The Estonian government yesterday accused Russian negotiators of reneging on their word to withdraw troops from its territory by August 31 - saying Russia had demanded that Estonia pay social security to the ex-servicemen and provide houses for the returnees in Russia.</p>

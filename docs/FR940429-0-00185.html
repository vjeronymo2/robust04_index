			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of this requirement, which is based on a California law,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to curb abuses by institutions. Some institutions have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received significant amounts of Federal Pell Grant funds for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who have not attained an adequate proficiency in written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and spoken English to use already existing knowledge, training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and skills. Because this testing requirement is limited to ESL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs that are ancillary to an institution's academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, the Secretary does not believe it is an intrusion on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's internal academic affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggestions to add a pre-test requirement or to extend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the testing requirement to vocational programs that include ESL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courses were not adopted at this time. However, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to monitor reports of abuse in these areas to see if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation is necessary. Institutions are encouraged to test all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students before and after they enroll in ESL courses to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the students need to improve their proficiency skills and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine whether the students have attained the desired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proficiency skills after completing the courses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Standards for Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.11&blank;Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters opposed subjecting a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer to proceedings under subpart G of this part, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governs emergency actions, fines, and limitation, suspension, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination of participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters felt that since the Secretary has noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are ultimately responsible for any liabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred that the institutions should be responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring the activities of the organization with which they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenters who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that third-party servicers should not be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings under subpart G of this part. The statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically requires the Secretary to apply subpart G  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings to third-party servicers. The Secretary agrees with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters that institutions have a duty to monitor the actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their third-party servicers, and that an institution is always  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately liable for any violations caused by those servicers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but, the Secretary believes that Congress clearly intended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to directly hold third-party servicers accountable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any program violations through the use of all sanctions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary is able to impose. The sanctions under subpart G  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this part are an appropriate recourse to use to correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program violations because a third-party servicer, as an agent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution, contracts with institutions to provide services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that parallel an institution's responsibilities under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's program participation agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.12&blank;Application Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has  received at his office the UNRWA [United Nations Relief and  Works Agency] high commissioner and heads of delegates  participating in the unofficial meeting of the representatives  of the major donor countries for UNRWA and the refugees hosting  countries currently held in Amman.    During the audience, the premier has underlined the  importance of work at this stage to guarantee the continuity of  UNRWA to work and promote its services offered to Palestinian  refugees until a permanent and just settlement for their cause  is reached.    Dr. al-Majali urged the donor countries to increase their  donations, provide more support for UNRWA, and increase their  contribution in its budget to enable it carry out its role.    The prime minister said that all refugees should receive the  same treatment in the hosting countries without any  discrimination as their cause is one and their basic needs are  identical regardless of their location.    He urged the UNRWA to provide more services for the  Palestinian refugees as Jordan is hosting the biggest number of  Palestinian refugees and incurring heavy financial burdens,  especially in the fields of health and education.</p>

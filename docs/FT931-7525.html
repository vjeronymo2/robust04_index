			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley outlines plan for NHS ranking MRS VIRGINIA Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday announced a range of measures aimed at enabling the National Health Service internal market to operate freely while maintaining sufficient overall control. The government also intends to start publishing league tables of health service performance next year, based initially on indicators including hospital waiting times, numbers of cancelled operations and ambulance response rates. Other indicators, based, for example, on waiting times for consultations with specialists, will follow later. Ministers have spent many months trying to devise a structure for regulating the reformed service without stifling it. Under the proposals announced yesterday both regional health authorities and regional outposts of the NHS management executive - set up to monitor trust hospitals - will be retained. Some trust hospital managers had argued for the abolition of regional health authorities, fearing that they will challenge the independence of trust boards. Mrs Bottomley said regions must remain to handle such issues as resource allocation, financial control, and ensuring that comprehensive services were available for patients. They would, however, be slimmed down from an average of 560 staff to about 200. The health secretary, speaking at a National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in London, emphasised the importance of purchasing authorities and GP fundholders in targeting resources, obtaining value for money and monitoring quality. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, is to visit all regions later this year and assess progress on purchasing and contracting in the market. Mrs Bottomley regards publication of the performance information, being developed by the NHS management executive and the Audit Commission, as a means of involving and empowering patients in the internal market. Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS, said yesterday that hospital waiting lists were a rather 'crude and one-dimensional' way of monitoring performance. At present there was no way for the public to see which hospitals were meeting standards set in the government's Patient's Charter, he said. Labour accused Mrs Bottomley of 'dithering' over the best way to control the internal market and described her speech as a combination of muddle and fudge. Calling for a 'far more radical redirection of policy', Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, said yesterday's statement did nothing to improve NHS accountability or make the service more responsive to patients. He later pressed home his attack in the Commons, saying the speech was an admission the market had failed. Why pay Pounds 8m a year to members of English NHS trusts when central control was now to be exercised, he asked.</p>

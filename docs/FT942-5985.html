			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Algeria in Paris Club deal: Creditor countries reschedule Dollars 5bn of debts Algeria's foreign official creditors last night agreed to reschedule some Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) in debt principal and interest that the beleaguered north African government was due to repay over the coming year. The move by western governments to give Algeria relief on its official debts follows its agreement last month with the International Monetary Fund to devalue its currency by 40 per cent and to liberalise trade and prices, in return for an IMF credit of Dollars 1bn. Officials of the Paris Club of creditors said last night's accord was expected to pave the way for Algeria to get similar debt relief terms from commercial banks and to unblock a credit from the European Union as well as fresh trade credit from France. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said this week the aim was to 'play the economic card' in Algeria's favour in the hope that a boost to the economy might prevent political 'destabilisation' by the government's hardline Moslem fundamentalists who have been involved in a violent campaign of opposition. With its total Dollars 26bn debt having an average maturity of only three years, Algeria has faced a crunch in debt servicing that consumed 86 per cent of its export earnings last year. The Paris Club is expected to halve this debt service burden in the year up to May 1995. Some Dollars 5bn of the total Dollars 8bn due in that period is to be repaid over 15 years after a grace period lasting until 1998. Algeria had requested - but failed to get - a rather longer repayment period, perhaps because its official creditors remain unsure of the long-term survival prospects of a government that two years ago had to annul elections the fundamentalists were winning. Its largest creditors are France, the US, Italy, Germany and Japan, while its main commercial creditors are Japanese banks. The Paris Club deal was much delayed by the reluctance of the Japanese to grant rescheduling and Algeria's reluctance in seeking it.</p>

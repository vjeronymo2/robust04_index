			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Approach from suitor dismissed by Borden The possibility of a bid battle for Borden, the troubled US food group, yesterday appeared to have evaporated following the company's decision to dismiss an approach from Mr Paul Kazarian, a would-be suitor. Borden, which has already agreed to a Dollars 2bn takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, said Mr Kazarian's plans were neither realistic nor credible, and accused him of publicity-seeking. It cancelled an invitation to Mr Kazarian to meet representatives of the company at its Manhattan offices and said it had no intention of attending a meeting that Mr Kazarian planned to stage in New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel late yesterday afternoon. The company's rejection of Mr Kazarian's overture increases the likelihood that shareholders will accept KKR's tender offer, which expires on December 20. The offer is worth Dollars 14.25 a share, payable in RJR Nabisco stock. Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster consumer products group, had proposed a complex restructuring of Borden under which he would invest Dollars 430m in the company in return for 20 per cent of its stock. At the meeting in the Grand Hyatt Hotel he increased his offer to Dollars 560m.</p>

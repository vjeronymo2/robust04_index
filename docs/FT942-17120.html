			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Dutch toy workers protest in UK Closing a plant in the Netherlands can be a notoriously complex and expensive process, but it does not normally involve all employees travelling abroad to demonstrate. Yesterday morning all 162 employees of the Hasbro toy factory in Ter Apel in the Netherlands arrived at the doors of the Hasbro International headquarters in Stockley Park, near London, to stage an orderly protest. The world's biggest toy company knew the visit was planned and had earlier turned down employee requests for a meeting with Mr Norman Walker, president of Hasbro International. But when the Hasbro executives saw the Dutch workers - mainly members of the CNV general union and the FNV print union - shivering outside, their hearts melted. 'Some of them looked as if they were suffering from hypothermia so we invited them in for coffee and sandwiches', said Mr Peter Waterman, a spokesman for the company. Once inside, they also met Mr Walker who explained that he could not discuss the proposed closure until the Ter Apel employee works council had produced its alternative plan, with the help of consultants whom the company has to pay for. The Dutch employees of the nearly Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) turnover toy and games company feel aggrieved that Ter Apel has been selected for closure despite its being, on Hasbro's own admission, a modern, efficient and profitable plant. The trouble is, says Hasbro, that worldwide over-capacity requires the closure of one of its three European plants and the Dutch plant is smaller than those in Spain and Ireland and it also is not equipped to produce both games and toys. 'As a publicly quoted company on the New York and London stock exchanges, the company has an international responsibility to run its business in the most cost effective and viable way possible,' said a press release from Hasbro. If this is the modern face of European industrial relations, it certainly seems civilised. The Dutchmen and women chartered a Boeing 737-300 to fly from Eelde to Luton on a public holiday but Mr Waterman said that the company would have given them a day off to protest anyway. The protest itself will change nothing but the 162 jobs may nonetheless be 'locked in' by Dutch employment legislation. If no agreement is reached between the company and its employees on the alternative plan, the issue will go to a local labour court where a judge may require Hasbro to keep the plant open.</p>

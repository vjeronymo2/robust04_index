			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Former Cigna man takes top job at AMP Mr George Trumbull from the US insurer Cigna has been named managing director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, Australia's largest life insurance group and one of the country's biggest institutional investors. Mr Trumbull, 49, was president of the individual financial services division of Philadelphia-based Cigna. He will join the AMP - which also owns the Pearl and London Life insurance companies in the UK - in June. Mr Trumbull will take over as managing director and chief executive when Mr Ian Salmon, the current AMP chief executive, retires in September. The AMP declined to comment on the salary package being offered to Mr Trumbull. The appointment of a US executive to one of Australia's largest institutions marks a growing trend. Westpac, the large commercial bank which suffered badly from the property market's collapse in the early-1990s, appointed Mr Robert Joss, a former vice-chairman of Wells Fargo, as managing director in January 1993. Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group, recently brought in Mr Frank Blount from AT&amp;T as its new chief executive. Mr Trumbull has held management positions with Cigna for the past 24 years, and has previously been the group's chief investment officer. Six months ago, Cigna took a Dollars 244m after-tax charge to cover asbestosis and environmental claims and a further Dollars 107m charge to cover 1,400 redundancies in its health and property/casualty businesses. Further job losses are expected. The AMP has been losing some ground to aggressive competitors in its home market, and Mr Salmon has suggested that growth will have to come from building a presence in Asia.</p>

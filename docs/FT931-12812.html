			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Workers from the New World uptight - Tate &amp; Lyle faces a stormy AGM because of a dispute in the US COULD Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, which acquired AE Staley, the Illinois-based corn syrup producer, for Dollars 1.48bn five years ago, face a stormy annual meeting today in London? Some of its US workers are threatening just that. They are representatives of Local (branch) 837 of the Allied Industrial Workers, which counts 800 Staley employees - mainly process-workers, technicians and mechanical operatives - at the Decatur plant among its members. Last September, the union's three-year employment agreement with the company expired, and management's proposed new contract is encountering stiff opposition. The fight is not, in itself, about money. The company is offering about 10 per cent, spread over three years, for the average employee, which squares with labour demands. What has distressed the union are Staley's demands for changes in working practices - including the subcontracting of some work, a restructuring of holiday rights, insurance concessions, 'flexibility' on assigning shifts, erosion of union seniority rights, and changes to the grievance procedure. Management says these concessions are needed to keep the plant competitive. As with so many labour disputes, the contract battle seems to have exhumed other festering concerns. Union officials, for example, claim that Staley has fared increasingly badly in terms of safety standards and environmental issues since Tate took over. They point to one employee - a 44-year-old maintainence worker called James Beals - who died after being overcome by toxic fumes while repairing a processing tank, and to a Dollars 1.6m fine levied by the federal Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration against Staley in 1991. Staley replies that it has spent Dollars 10m on safety matters alone since 1990. Another bone of contention is a pipeline, built recently, between the Staley corn mills and those of Archer-Daniels-Midland, the big neighbouring agribusiness which holds a 6 per cent stake in Tate. The pipeline has never been used, but employees believe that starch slurry could be shipped through this, making it easier for Staley to operate if it faced a strike or lock-out. (Staley/Tate says the pipeline is designed to transfer surplus slurry between the two companies and was not built with an eye to a labour dispute.) The present state of play is stalemate. Management and union last met in the late-autumn, and nothing further is planned. Staley has imposed some aspects of its proposed contract, although these would be adjusted for any final contract. 'Collective bargaining never began - it was always dictatorial,' says Dave Watts, president of the local, who is leading a delegation to today's AGM in London. But what makes the Staley dispute noteworthy is the strategy being adopted by the union - typifying the way the wind is blowing in the organised labour movement at present. It is important to realise that Decatur, in terms of US geography, is a near-neighbour of Peoria. Here, a bruising five-and-half-month strike at Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment company, collapsed last year when management threatened to replace the strikers. With workers' resolve apparently waning in face of this pressure, the powerful United Auto Workers union called off the strike, and the company imposed its desired terms. The Staley local, painfully aware of the Caterpillar strikers' humiliation, made a conscious decision to tread more delicately. Realising that it is neither large nor wealthy, it eschewed the strike weapon and, after consulting various labour academics, has called in Ray Rogers, a New York-based labour activist, to advise. Mr Rogers, who operates from Greenwich Village, has a reputation for applying hard-line, but less conventional, pressures. These may range from an attack on a corporation's financial links - thus dragging banks and insurance companies into a dispute - to spotlighting its environmental practices. Mr Rogers counts labour campaigns at JP Stevens, the textile company, American Airlines and International Paper among his trophies. He is currently working for the Newspaper Guild in its battle with Mort Zuckerman, new owner of the New York Daily News. His approach at Staley has been true to form. Local mail shots, for example, have urged a public boycott of First of America Bank Corporation, a sizeable Midwest bank, which has cross-directorships with both Staley and Caterpillar. This prompted Mr Robert Powers, Staley's chairman and a Tate director, to resign from the bank's board earlier this month. Mr Rogers says he has only begun. 'We will continue to go after First of America, but there will be another target, a major financial target - a bank or insurance company - of our own.' Other leaflets and publicity materials have made much of the safety issues, including Mr Beals' death, and a second line of attack is threatened, namely consumer pressure. Here, the likely target would appear to be Tate's Domino Sugar, which is a household name and is stocked on the shelves of any US supermarket. This business has labour problems of its own. Its New York City plant, a prominent feature on the Brooklyn waterfront, has faced a 15-week-old strike by the Longshoremen's union. Again, the dispute is principally over work-rule concessions, and workers continue to strike after voting last weekend against revised proposals. Tate, meanwhile, has been shipping sugar into the north-east from Maryland and Louisiana instead. And there are clearly attempts to step up the attack outside the US, both through British unions, and, perhaps, investors in Tate. Mr Rogers claims that a trawl is being done of pension fund shareholders with ethical investment guidelines who might be susceptible to pressure. Meanwhile, the Tate annual meeting looms large on the calendar. Mr Rogers says that eight union members have shares and would be entitled to attend. 'We'll take the fight wherever necessary,' adds Dave Watts. Whether any of this rattles Tate's cage, an ocean away from Decatur, is another matter. But with its members still getting paid, local 873 thinks it has a better chance than it would on the picket-lines, in the post-Caterpillar world.</p>

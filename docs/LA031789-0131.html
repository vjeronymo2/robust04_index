			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> ITC Ruling: The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled 4-1 that Japanese  firms were dumping microdisks on the U.S. market, paving the way for the  Commerce Department to levy anti-dumping duties. The commission, which monitors  compliance to U.S. trade law, ruled the imports sold at less than fair market  value were injuring American firms making the disks that are widely used in  portable computers. It acted on a complaint filed on behalf of the U.S.  industry by Verbatim Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. Domestic manufacturers have long  complained that the Japanese have violated U.S. trade rules. The disks are big  sellers for use in the increasingly popular laptop or travel computers.  </P></p>

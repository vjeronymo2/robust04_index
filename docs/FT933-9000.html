			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Japan US trade negotiators will hardly like Japan's latest trade surplus. True, when expressed in yen the surplus is not rising. But neither has the yen's appreciation this year significantly dented export performance. On purchasing power measures the yen is very uncompetitive. But political pressure and the failure of Japanese companies or banks to recycle the current account surplus into overseas investment will continue to force the yen higher. Those funds parked in Japan are now flowing into equities at a time when manufacturers are being hurt by recession at home and squeezed margins overseas. The stage is being set for another overvaluation of the Japanese equity market.</p>

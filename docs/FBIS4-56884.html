			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with presidential candidate </F> Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party  by James Aparicio at the International Hotel in Panama City on 8  May; all quotation marks as published]    [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, virtual president-elect of  Panama, has appealed for the building of a future Panama  "united, without hate, rancor, or revenge," and he announced  that the country is entering a new stage of national life in  which one must prepare to enter the 21st century.    Perez Balladares, 47, was proclaimed the Panamanian  presidential candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party  [PRD] on 31 July 1993. He will govern for the next five years,  with his two Vice Presidents Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque and  Felipe Virzy, all founding members of the PRD.    "The time of electoral confrontation has passed and we must  enter the 21st century with a vision of the future, with a  commitment to our children and grandchildren, "without returning  to the past or linking with the past," Perez Balladares said in  an exclusive interview with LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA.    From the opposition PRD campaign headquarters in the  International Hotel, Perez Balladares said his election "is a  very big challenge which we gladly accept."    "We foresaw it a long time ago, as it was predicted by the  polls," Perez Balladares stated.    "We want to do what we pledged during the campaign, by  appealing to all Panamanians for national harmony so that  tonight we can close the electoral chapter and join together to  work for the best national objectives," Perez Balladares told LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, after learning the results of the exit poll."    Perez Balladares said political banners will return again in  five years, "when we have elections again, when the democratic  process will again be respected and the winner of the elections  will be recognized."    Regarding the composition of his council of ministers, once  his victory is confirmed, Perez Balladares said he is inviting  an undetermined number of "those who have been our adversaries  and some independent forces" to join us.    "We are sure that very soon we will be able to count on the  participation of these gentlemen and on members of our party  (the PRD) in a cabinet that will work in harmony for national  interests," Perez Balladares added.    Regarding relations with the United States, Perez Balladares  said that his election "closed the black chapter of military  intervention" that began on 20 December 1989.    "The election of my government has made it clear that this  sad page in the history of both countries has been turned,"  Perez Balladares stressed.    "We hope our relations (with the United States) become  better  every day because we must cooperate to meet the timetable from  now until 31 December 1999," he said.    He added that Panama wants "closer" cooperation with the  United States on drug trafficking and money laundering, as well  as with other countries "which see in the scourge of drug  trafficking a national problem as we do."    Commenting on the future of the Canal and U.S. military  bases, Perez Balladares said that it is best for both countries  "to comply with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties."    "This means that on 31 December 1999 the Canal will be  Panamanian and will be managed totally by Panamanians."    According to Perez Balladares, on that day (31 December  1999)  there should be no more U.S. troops in Panama, adding that if  the United States wants to renegotiate an extension of their  presence beyond the year 2000, "they must state that desire."    He warned, however, that his government would have to be  convinced "that there is a common enemy and that U.S. military  interests coincide with Panama's."    Perez Balladares said he hopes Panama will return to the  times of General Omar Torrijos, when the country was "respected  for our dignity and our serious and straightforward attitude."    In terms of the country's economic future, he said he will  begin a dialogue to introduce Panama into areas that are most  appropriate for the country in order to be directly included  --without going through regional integration blocs -- in the  NAFTA signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.    "If we do not manage to do this directly, we will begin  integration contacts with the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur)," he noted.    On the subject of banana quotas imposed by the EU since  July,  Perez Balladares said that the measure "is very harmful" for us  and should be resolved through the GATT.</p>

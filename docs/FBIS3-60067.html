A total of 160 agents from  the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], the  State Judicial Police, and the Army participated in the rescue.    Tonight, in a communique, the representative of the Office  of  the Attorney General of the Republic, Marco Antonio Baez  Cardoso, announced that seven other individuals escaped during  the confrontation. They include an adult female and two minors,  probably the wife and children of one of the criminals.    The Federal and State Judicial Police from Veracruz, backed  by the Army, are advancing in the area and intensifying their  efforts to capture these individuals.    The report explained that, as a result of the operation, in  which there were no casualties among the Amry forces or police  personnel, three of the presumed drug traffickers, including the  so-called "Commander Rojo," were killed, and four others  arrested. One of the latter sustained serious wounds. Two  Federal Judicial Police agents, Miguel Barajas and Oscar Ortiz,  who had been kidnapped, were rescued, and three vehicles were  confiscated.    Tonight, the PGR announced that, on 6 December, Veracruz  State Judicial Police personnel began the operations aimed at  capturing 14 very well-armed persons, apparently under the  influence of some drug. Wearing uniforms similar to those of the  Army, they were staying at the El Pueblito Hotel, located in the  municipality of Fortin de las Flores.    On the previous Saturday, those 14 subjects had put out of  commission a small plane with Venezuelan registration, on which  they may have been carrying drugs. The plane landed  clandestinely in the vicinity of the El Palmar Experimental  Center in the municipality of Tezonapa on 16 August of this  year, and was subsequently confiscated.    Since those individuals had registered at the hotel as  members of the Armed Forces of Mexico, "on a high-level military  intelligence mission," an operation was mounted with the aid of  the Veracruz State Judicial Police.    When the building was surrounded, in order to prevent injury  to the guests occupying it, the police had to allow the alleged  members of the military to escape, because they threatened to  explode several grenades that they were carrying in a "poncho."    The office reported that four Federal Judicial Police agents  were forced to accompany them, as virtual hostages. Later, using  force and threatening to blow up everything around them, the  criminals also abducted four other members of that corps.    After both the Army and Navy had been queried, a report was  received indicating that no group had been commissioned, as  those individuals claimed. The latter included Jorge Alberto  Vazquez Gallardo, better known as "Comandante Rojo," and wanted  for nearly 12 years because of his known connections with  individuals engaged in drug dealing.    The operation was intensified on the afternoon of 6 December  when, after pursuing those who pretended to belong to the  military, the agents spotted them in the border zone between  Veracruz, Puebla, and Oaxaca States: specifically, in the  vicinity of the Tonto River. On the same night, six of the eight  members of both corps who had been taken hostage were released.    The PGR noted that, owing to the conditions prevailing in  the  area, and the fact that these subjects are extremely dangerous,  it was decided to postpone their action and to reinforce the  operation. Hence, this morning, with the aid of a helicopter, 30  Federal Judicial Police agents, reinforced by 60 Army troops and  70 members of the Veracruz State Judicial Police, tightened the  cordon and prepared for the attack.</p>

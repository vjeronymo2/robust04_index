			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Lutoslawski celebration WITOLD Lutoslawski turned 80 in January. He is a composer widely and justly admired, since he has achieved a creative synthesis - between unfailing 'progressive' concern for form and content and equally unfailing knack of 'approachability', between experimental boldness of sound-invention and strict probity of craft - matched by very few in this turbulent, stylistically heterogeneous century of ours. He continues to compose (the Fourth Symphony had its premiere in Los Angeles earlier this month); each new work arrives at some fresh reconciliation of new and old, sounding peculiarly fresh, exact and 'personal' the while and lasting not a note longer than necessary. This last week it has fallen to Manchester to host a Lutoslawski birthday festival: eight days and nights of concerts, educational projects and talks. The Royal Northern College, Manchester University (whose Professor of Music, John Casken, has strong links with Lutoslawski from his student days in Warsaw) and the Halle Orchestra have all joined in - and so has Radio 3, broadcasting three of the events live. Lutoslawski himself conducted the Halle's Thursday concert (final of the three broadcasts). This brilliant event, crackling with vitality and bursting with exuberant sonorities in sharp-cut outlines, seemed to sum up everything that makes Lutoslawski worth celebrating. There was no new work in it (no doubt there is a good reason why the festival was not permitted to give the British premiere of the Fourth Symphony, but it seems a pity nonetheless). Nevertheless, Chain 3 (1986), the Piano Concerto (1988), and the Third Symphony added up to a uniquely satisfying programme. The first is a virtuoso orchestral movement whose parts sparkle in separate, then intricately overlapped patterns. The second works up a genuine revival of the grand romantic piano-and-orchestra confrontation without ever sacrificing its 'modernist' orchestral manners. (The piano part, written for Krystian Zimerman, was here superbly taken by Paul Crossley.) The third is an exploration of a set of three- and four-note figures achieved with Haydn-like rigour, energy and wit, a 'concerto for orchestra' symphony exhilarating in its parts and in their sum. As, indeed, was the concert itself - diverse in its individual parts, compact and compelling as a whole.</p>

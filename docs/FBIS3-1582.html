The station will be able to provide satellite channels,  connect any other ground station of a very small calibre in  China and international satellite channels.    Customers will be able to enter the main station at any  point  in Shanghai and set up data communications channels with any  other user in China.    Shanghai Petroleum Exchange has become the first user of the  station.    The satellite ground station system with a very small  calibre  sprung into being in the 1980s and their construction costs half  that of ground stations in popular use now.    There are now more than 100,000 such systems in the world.</p>

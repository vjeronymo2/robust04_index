			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Senator acquitted Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas was yesterday acquitted on charges of misusing a previous state office after the prosecution asked that the charges against her be dropped, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. The case almost certainly means that Ms Hutchison, a Republican elected last year to fill out the unexpired term of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now treasury secretary, will be easily returned in November to a full six years in the Senate. She was only the 10th sitting senator in US history to face criminal prosecution. The state withdrew its case after the judge had refused to rule on the admissibility of certain evidence concerning the charges that Ms Hutchison had misued her previous office as Texas treasurer for personal and campaign purposes.</p>

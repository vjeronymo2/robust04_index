			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A MARRIAGE TEST FOR OPPOSITES  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My fiancee and I love each other very much, but we worry  because we're so opposite in many ways. I know that opposites attract, but can  they survive in a long-term relationship? -- G.K.  </P> <P> DEAR G.K.: There are no rigid rules about the necessary ingredients to make a  marriage last. Spouses who have different temperaments and different interests  can have happy, successful marriages. These differences may be responsible for  the stimulation -- the spice -- that keeps the marriage interesting and alive.  </P> <P> If one partner is an introvert and the other an extrovert, if one enjoys sports  while the other prefers concerts or going to art galleries as a form of  entertainment and relaxation, this is fine if both are flexible and  independent. However, if one or both of these spouses tends to be the jealous  type or if either thinks the only good marriage is one that stresses total  togetherness, there's going to be trouble.  </P> <P> The best way to guard against trouble is to recognize and discuss your  different interests and views before you marry. Play let's-pretend games:  Rehearse how you'd react if each were to spend evenings doing his or her own  thing. Discuss attitudes about money, raising children, household tasks and  responsibilities, as well as preferences on holidays and vacations. If such  discussions produce tension and arguments, you might reconsider.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son and his live-in girlfriend talk about "family." Yet  I've discovered, much to my regret, that when they speak of family in such  glowing terms, they're not always talking about relatives, but friends. This  makes me hurt and angry. Even though my former husband and I may have made a  lot of mistakes, I feel we're still the only "family" that counts. -- F.F.  </P> <P> DEAR F.F.: Definitions of family have been changing over the years. The closely  knit, old-fashioned family we used to know has become something of a rarity. I  see nothing wrong with a larger definition of the word. To me, "family" means  love and caring. In other words, one can have a family of friends and unrelated  members. To be "family" it isn't necessary to be a blood relation or an in-law.  </P> <P> The old-fashioned concept of family as you know it is far from dead, however.  In a recent study of family and family values, Dr. Albert Solnit of the Child  Study Center at Yale University reported that people cherish the family, even  when their experience has been less than perfect.  </P> <P> By 3 to 1, those surveyed defined family as a group that loves and cares for  each other. Perhaps your son includes you and his father in this group.  </P></p>

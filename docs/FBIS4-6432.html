			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the  successful launch of Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority [MTJA],  marks another milestone in the bonds of traditional friendship  between the two neighboring countries. The arrangement for  cooperation in exploration and exploitation of the resources of  the seabed in the joint development area is one of the few of  its kind in the world. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said this in a  message in conjunction with the launching of the MTJA in Kuala  Lumpur this afternoon by the prime ministers of the two  countries.    Datuk Mahathir said good neighborly relations and  understanding had been the prime mover in resolving the  overlapping claims made by Malaysia and Thailand. He was  confident that the activities to be undertaken by MTJA would  contribute towards the development of the petroleum industry in  Malaysia and Thailand.</p>

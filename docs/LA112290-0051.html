			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> UC San Diego Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson has approved plans for a  controversial six-acre recreational complex on the La Jolla campus that, with  more than 200,000 square feet for parking, intramural, athletic and concert  activities, would become UCSD's largest structure. Campus faculty members,  through their Academic Senate, had asked Atkinson to require revisions because  of concerns over noise and traffic factors caused by the concert portion of the  facility.  </P> <P> But Atkinson said environmental concerns can be adequately handled, especially  since most events would take place during night or weekend hours, when few  competing academic activities would be taking place. The center, planned for  the north campus area next to the Institute of the Americas, will cost $28  million. It would be funded through a combination of students fees and  donations from private individuals. State tax money cannot be used for such  facilities.  </P></p>

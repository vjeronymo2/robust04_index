			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS CONCLUDE WORST SEASON WITH 13-10 LOSS;  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE: GIANTS HAND NEW ENGLAND TEAM-RECORD 14TH CONSECUTIVE DEFEAT.  </P> <P> The New England Patriots' worst season ended with one of their best drives of  the year -- and a team-record 14th consecutive loss.  </P> <P> The Patriots looked as if they were on the verge of scoring the go-ahead  touchdown or tying field goal Sunday against the New York Giants, but they came  up empty as usual and the playoff-bound Giants escaped with a 13-10 victory.  </P> <P> "It was the last game of the year, and I think we had something to prove," New  England nose tackle Tim Goad said. "They're one of the league's best, and I  think we handled them pretty well."  </P> <P> Despite their strong performance, the Patriots finished 1-15, scoring only 181  points -- the fewest in the NFL since the 16-game schedule was adopted in 1978.  Buffalo's 200 points in 1985 was the previous low.  </P> <P> The Patriots broke the previous team mark for the worst record, set by the 1981  club that was 2-14. For the first time in their 31-year history, the Patriots  were winless at home. For the seventh consecutive game, they never held the  lead.  </P> <P> The Patriots' final drive began at the New England five-yard line with 9:31  left and stalled at the Giants' 24 when John Stephens was stopped by Leonard  Marshall for no gain on third and two.  </P> <P> The Patriots' hopes ended when the usually reliable Jason Staurovsky pulled a  42-yard field-goal attempt wide to the left with 1:30 remaining.  </P> <P> "The wind was blowing right to left," said Staurovsky, who kicked a 19-yard  field goal with 6:02 left in the first half to tie the score, 10-10. "For some  reason, I closed my hips. There is no reason to do that. I can make that kick  20 out of 25 times."  </P> <P> A 27-yard field goal by Matt Bahr with six seconds left in the first half  proved to be the difference for the Giants (13-3), the champions of the NFC  East who have a bye in the first round of the playoffs.  </P> <P> "It was a struggle," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said. "New England played very  well. We've got to be happy. We got out of here with (13) wins."  </P> <P> Linebacker Lawrence Taylor said the Giants' difficulty in handling the Patriots  was not indicative of the way they will perform in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "We have no reason to believe that when the playoffs come, we can't be back on  line," Taylor said. "It's what you do in the playoffs that count."  </P> <P> Jeff Hostetler, replacing the injured Phil Simms at quarterback, completed 12  of 23 passes for 123 yards and led all rushers with 82 yards in 10 carries.  Hostetler is 4-0 as a starter since he joined the Giants in 1984.  </P> <P> "I think we've got to pull things together," Hostetler said. "Everything is not  together right now."  </P> <P> The same might be said for Rod Rust's future as coach of the Patriots.  </P> <P> Rust is in the first year of a four-year contract, and Sam Jankovich, the  Patriots' new chief executive officer, has said he will decide on Rust's future  soon after the season.  </P> <P> "I would have to wonder a little," Rust said.  </P> <P> The Patriots nearly avoided a halftime deficit for the first time in five  games, but a fumbled snap by quarterback Tommy Hodson gave the Giants the ball  at the New England 25 with 16 seconds left in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Hostetler's 15-yard completion to Mark Ingram set up Bahr's 27-yard field goal  that gave the Giants a 13-10 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> The Giants had built a 10-0 lead on their first two possessions on a 17-yard  touchdown pass play from Hostetler to Dave Meggett and a 44-yard field goal by  Bahr.  </P> <P> On the possession after Bahr's field goal, Hodson capped an 81-yard drive by  connecting with Irving Fryar on a 40-yard touchdown pass play.  </P> <P> The Patriots tied the score on a 19-yard field goal by Staurovsky with six  minutes left in the half.  </P> <P> Hodson completed 12 of 23 passes for 118 yards.  </P> <P> Stephens gained 81 yards in 19 carries for the Patriots.  </P> <P> The Giants, who began the day in second place in the league in yards allowed  (358.2 yards a game), held the Patriots to 258.  </P> <P> That performance came one week after Phoenix rolled up 452 yards, the most  against the Giants this season.  </P></p>

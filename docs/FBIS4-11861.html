			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Apr (MENA)-- Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has emphasized that Arabs need peace  among themselves and to bring about accord as soon as possible.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM published today, 'Abd-al-Majid  said that it is not possible to reconcile Arabs and Israelis and  establish Arab-Israeli peace so long as the Arab nation remains  fragmented and riven by conflicts. He said this when referring  to the fact that although three years have passed since the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the repercussions of that crisis still  reflect negatively on the Arabs' active march. He said he fears  Arab disputes might grow worse in the coming period,  particularly border disputes.    The Arab League secretary general called for speeding up the  amending of the current Charter to permit the adoption of  decisions by majority vote rather than by consensus. He also  called for setting up an Arab court of justice.    Touching on the call for an Arab summit to mark the 50th  anniversary of the establishment of the Arab League,  'Abd-al-Majid hoped this call will be received favorably.  However, he stressed the need for a favorable climate for this  and emphasized that good preparation for such a summit would be  inter-Arab candidness as a basis for reconciliation.    Commenting on the Lockerbie crisis involving Libya and some  Western states, 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the Arab League  Council has called for trying the Libyan suspects in the  International Court of Justice with the participation of  Scottish judges. He reiterated the League's support for Libya's  right to exercise sovereignty on its territory and to refuse to  hand over its citizens.    The Arab League secretary general added that he will  continue  his efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Lockerbie crisis.</p>

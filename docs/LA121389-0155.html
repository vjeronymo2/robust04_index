			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> AQUINO VOTED EMERGENCY POWERS  </P> <P> The Philippine House of Representatives today voted President Corazon Aquino  emergency powers for 90 days to help her rebuild the economy and thwart further  coup attempts.  </P> <P> The Senate, expected to approve a similar bill, postponed its vote for a day  after the opposition sparked a marathon debate on a provision that would allow  Aquino to take over public utilities and related businesses.  </P> <P> The two chambers are to present a joint bill to Aquino, who is expected to sign  it into law this week.  </P> <P> The law would grant Aquino, who this month survived the sixth coup attempt  against her, powers to seize firearms, take over public utilities, fix prices,  regulate power supplies and confiscate hoarded food.  </P> <P> The lower house denied Aquino some of the wider authority she had requested,  including the power to ban strikes and suspend labor laws and an open-ended  provision that some legislators said would have given her lawmaking powers.  </P></p>

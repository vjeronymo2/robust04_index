			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: WMGO issues warning Shares in WMGO Group fell 3 1/2 p to 14p yesterday after the business communications company issued a profits warning following the unexpected cancellation of three big projects. Pre-tax profits for the year to February 28 were revised down from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.35m by Beeson Gregory, company broker. WMGO was transformed from the MMI sponsorship and financial marketing group earlier this year and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 254,000 for the half year to August 31. Two contracts were lost by Park Avenue, the exhibitions promotions business, and the third was cancelled over a fee dispute between its advertising agency and Sun Life.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBANIANS STREAMING INTO GREECE; JEWS ALLOWED TO GO  </P> <P> Hundreds of Albanians streamed into Greece on Sunday in the biggest one-day  exodus since their country's Communist rulers began a reform program, and  Albania announced it is also allowing Jews to depart.  </P> <P> Thirty-seven Jews, all related, flew to Rome from the Albanian capital en route  to Israel, said Shula Bahat, a spokeswoman for the American Jewish Committee in  New York.  </P> <P> She said Sunday's flight was the first in a planned operation dubbed "Flying  Carpet" to whisk an estimated 500 Jews out of Albania.  </P> <P> Vladimir Prela, head of the Albanian Foreign Ministry's press office, said the  Jewish emigration is part of a new government policy to allow people to leave  Albania.  </P> <P> "If they want to live in Israel, they can do so," Prela said in a telephone  interview from Tirana, Albania's capital. He estimated Albanian Jews number  about 1,000.  </P> <P> Tirana newspapers Sunday published a new draft constitution that enshrines  freedom of movement, as well as freedom of religion and private ownership,  according to Albanian Radio.  </P> <P> The government station, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London,  said the draft establishes multi-party elections. Under the new constitution,  the president would be selected by Parliament to a five-year term and could be  reelected only once.  </P> <P> Despite the reforms, many Albanians appear set on using their newly won  mobility simply to bolt the country.  </P> <P> A police spokesman in the Greek border village of Filiates said it appears that  the Albanian government has opened its mountainous frontier with Greece.  </P> <P> "There can be no other explanation," he said on condition of anonymity. "A  mosquito couldn't get across the border before."  </P> <P> At least 500 Albanians arrived Sunday, and all were seeking political asylum,  he said.  </P> <P> In the southeastern Albanian city of Korce, thousands of Albanians joined a  rally of the country's newborn opposition Sunday to urge the Communist  authorities to postpone Feb. 10 parliamentary elections and free political  prisoners, an opposition official said.  </P> <P> Genc Polo, spokesman for the 18-day-old opposition Democratic Party, quoted  rally organizers as saying about 40,000 people attended the peaceful gathering.  </P></p>

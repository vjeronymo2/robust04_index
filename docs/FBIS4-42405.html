			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Martino Reports to </F> Foreign Affairs Committee"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 1 -- Italy will pursue work  towards an initiative for the pacification of Rwanda under the  aegis of the United Nations to avert the spread of that nation's  crisis to neighboring states, beginning with Burundi, Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino said today in a statement to the Lower  House Foreign Affairs Committee.    After providing background on ethnic massacres in the  African  country and actions undertaken by the UN, the Western European  Union [WEU] and Italy's humanitarian efforts, the minister  announced further allocations of six billion lire (3.77 million  dollars) in addition to the nine billion (5.66 million dollars)  already earmarked for Rwanda.    The initial funds, said Martino, were set aside by the  government "to heighten the operational capabilities of  international agencies working in Rwanda and neighboring  countries" and the six billion will go to help finance  international aid agencies.    Responding to criticism that the Rome government "has not  done enough," the minister said, "Whoever puts forward this  accusation does not take a fundamental factor into account: the  extreme difficulty of working inside a country shaken by a  ferocious civil war, with precarious lines of communications and  without the possibility of benefitting from local points of  support."    With a view to appointments coming up in the near future in  the UN, the Organization of African Unity and WHO quarters,  Martino said Undersecretary Franco Rocchetta will visit Rwanda.    On Italy's past activities in the country, the minister said  the Italian military evacuated 216 Italians from Rwanda plus a  number of other foreign nationals and that Rwandan children have  been brought to Italy. At present, he reported, still in the  country are only five Italians who have decided to stay on to  manage their communities.    In this connection, Italy has briefed the head of UN peace  operations in Rwanda on the "precarious conditions" at  orphanages in Nyamata and Nyanza.    In Brussels, said Martino, studies are under way on  providing  WEU logistical support for the UN peace force taking shape. He  also spoke of the defense minister's affirmative response to  "make a military transport plane available to UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda], the UN contingent in Rwanda."  Also under examination is the prospect of setting up a hospital  on the border between Rwanda and Uganda.    At various points in his statement to the committee, Martino  underscored that, "A careful analysis of the political and  military framework leads to the thinking that only actions of  international organizations designed to achieve humanitarian  interventions can be solidly successful in this phase of the  emergency."</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Maxwell report to be kept secret THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, said yesterday that it would not publish the text of a long-awaited report on regulators' responsibilities in the Maxwell affair. 'SIB has been advised that publication of the full report could prejudice pending legal proceedings,' the watchdog said in a statement yesterday. Instead, it would eventually publish a statement setting out its assessments of regulators' roles and outlining actions it is taking. It will also publish conclusions of a report by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, about its own role in the Maxwell affair. Imro authorised and supervised two Maxwell-controlled companies which managed nearly Pounds 800m of pension funds. Fund managers lent securities from pension funds and those securities were later used as collateral for loans to Robert Maxwell's personal interests. Imro's report is believed to accept some of the blame for failing to spot the theft of more than Pounds 400m from pension funds controlled by Robert Maxwell, and to be critical of some of his professional advisers including the auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Coopers is said to have protested vigorously to SIB about Imro's characterisation of its role.</p>

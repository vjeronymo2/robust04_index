			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals active Chemical stocks outflanked the bears yesterday with the help of a recommendation from one leading UK securities house which highlighted their exposure to a pick-up in mainland Europe. Sentiment surrounding the sector also benefited from a strong set of figures delivered by Du Pont of the US. The chemicals research team from Smith New Court stood up at the morning meeting to highlight Courtaulds - which has a 30 per cent exposure to the continent, and Laporte and ICI - which both have a 25 per cent exposure. Analyst Mr Philip Morrish said: 'We have been speaking to companies which are seeing a surprisingly buoyant start to the year particularly in Germany but also in France and Italy.' ICI was up 11 at best before closing 3 better at 832p. The shares have risen sharply over the past week and some dealers said that the company's first quarter figures on Thursday could prompt a small setback as the company tends to adopt a cautious stance when it reports. Courtaulds, which reports in mid May, settled 2 weaker at 545p after 550p earlier and Laporte improved 7 to 797p.</p>

The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic, and peaceful relations between the United States and other countries of the world.'' Programs shall also ``maintain their scholarly integrity and shall meet the highest standards of academic excellence or artistic achievement.'' Pursuant to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. It should be noted that a greater emphasis is being placed on promoting diversity in Bureau programs. Diversity should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to ethnicity, gender, religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle throughout the proposed program and within their own operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Notice (All Categories) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Please be advised: Proposals submitted by the same institution under Categories A, B, and C for this or previous years' competitions may not be duplicative or identical.

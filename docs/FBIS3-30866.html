At a  press conference that concluded Yerin's three-day visit to  Poland, Milczanowski added that the Polish police is considering  the purchase of Russian arms.    Both ministers said they want to intensify cooperation in  combatting organized crime, especially drug smuggling. The  scope of such cooperation is determined by the inter-ministerial  agreement signed in November 1992, which was reviewed during  Yerin's present visit.    Reporting on the possibility to carry out joint actions  against organized crime, Milczanowski disclosed that during the  coming month, the Russian Interior Ministry will make a  catalogue of crimes associated with Russian citizens in Poland  which will be made available to Polish policemen. A similar  catalogue will be made by Polish police to help Russian law  enforcement.    Russians were second (after Ukrainians) among foreigners  suspected of committing crimes in Poland last year when their  number reached 667.    Victor Yerin said that both countries are ready to exchange  liaison officers but that the decisions must be made by both  governments. Asked whether foreigners are safe in Russia he  replied that "their security is guaranteed if they behave  normally."</p>

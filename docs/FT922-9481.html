			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech (Analysis): Generators hold key to size - British Coal THE PRIVATISATION of British Coal was confirmed, although no timetable was given. Civil servants said yesterday that the sale could take place by the end of next year. The announcement provoked fresh criticism from the Labour party and mining communities, which believe that the controversial privatisation could lead to the closure of more of British Coal's 49 remaining pits. The government itself says that the size of the company will be determined not by privatisation, but by the contracts agreeing how much coal British Coal sells to the privatised electricity industry. The Queen's Speech announcement will intensify pressure for these contracts  -which represent the bulk of British Coal's revenue  - to be renegotiated within the next few months. Existing contracts expire in March 1993. But they are proving difficult to settle, because the two big electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, believe that British Coal's product is too expensive. The signs are that they are reluctant to buy more than 50m tonnes - possibly falling to less over the life of the contract - compared with 65m in the old contracts. But this would force British Coal to close more pits. The electricity companies accept that the government will have to intervene to forge a deal that is acceptable to all the parties concerned. There are still many obstacles. The generators need to back their contracts with sales to the regional electricity companies, which supply domestic consumers. And the regional companies are waiting for the regulator to give them a sign of the kind of deal he thinks would be fair on domestic consumers. But the regulator said yesterday that the negotiations between British Coal and the generators were a matter for them alone. The government will have to resolve this issue before it can proceed with the privatisation. It can, however, proceed with legislation. The first stage, the Queen's Speech indicated, would be a 'paving bill'. This bill, which is expected shortly, will simply give British Coal powers to restructure itself in preparation for the sale. This will be followed, probably in the autumn, by the privatisation bill, or Coal Bill, itself - clearing the way for the sale late in 1993. A white paper, or policy document setting out the government's approach, would precede the bill, said officials at the Department of Trade and Industry, which is now responsible for energy. So far, the government has given few clues about how the privatisation will be structured, and ministers are still studying reports from N M Rothschild, the merchant bank advising on the privatisation. But a likely option is that the company will be split into two or more parts, and sold to trade buyers. One prospective buyer is the Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM), which, with Lloyds Bank, is planning an employee-led buy-out of the company.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 1, RIA -- "Morally the people of the  Crimea are ready for any situation that may develop on the  peninsula," the Crimean president's military adviser Petr  Chernyatevich declared in conversation over the telephone with a  RIA correspondent. A plenary session of the Supreme Soviet of  the Crimea is opening today to discuss questions relating to the  present situation. The reaction of the Crimean parliamentarians  will depend on what decisions the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet  passes today, believes Chernyatevich.    The Crimeans hold a wait-and-see position which can be  described as the state of civil readiness, according to  Chernyatevich. He expressed the confidence that the people  would allow nobody to violate its Constitution. "Kiev must  reckon with the fact that we have a nationally elected president  and a nationally elected Supreme Soviet, and the will of the  people is something that one has to reckon with," said the  Crimean president's adviser.    Right today Petr Chernyatevich intends to meet with the  commander of the Ukrainian National Guard, Colonel Aleksandr  Kostyukov in order to find out the reasons and aims of the  continuing movements of the units subordinate to him.</p>

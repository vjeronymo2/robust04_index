			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: First Italian investment trust Fondigest, the Italian mutual fund manager, is to launch the Italian Renaissance Investment Trust, the UK's first single-country investment trust specialising in Italy. Fondigest said that economic conditions in Italy were ripe for recovery, and the election of the pro-free market right wing coalition would also support economic growth. The fund will have a bias towards smaller and medium-sized companies, which it said were under-researched but would be helped by new tax incentives. A placing of the trust with institutions was under way; the public offer will run from July 8 to July 22.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney chairman has heart surgery Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney and the prime engineer of its strong growth record over the past decade, underwent quadruple coronary bypass surgery at the weekend, raising a question mark over the depth of management at one of the world's most successful entertainment companies. Mr Eisner, 52, is expected to leave the Los Angeles hospital in several days and return to work in a few weeks. In a statement released by Disney, his surgeon said the operation was a 'normal by-pass procedure without any complications'. The illness comes at a delicate time for the company. Mr Eisner has been operating without a number two since April when Mr Frank Wells, president of Disney and Mr Eisner's closest associate, was killed in a helicopter accident. Disney is rumoured to be considering a bid for CBS, the television broadcasting network which made itself a potential takeover target by agreeing to merge with home shopping channel QVC, a deal now abandoned. Many analysts think CBS would make a strong fit with Disney, which already owns a cable television channel and makes programmes for the broadcasting networks. Disney is also locked in battle with a group of eminent US historians over its plans to develop a historical theme park, called Disney America, on a civil war site in Virginia. Mr Eisner's condition will likely lead to calls for him to appoint a number two quickly. One candidate is Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who heads the company's film studios. He came to Disney with Mr Eisner from Paramount Pictures and has built the studios into one of the most successful in Hollywood. Disney shares were little affected yesterday by the news of Mr Eisner, rising Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 42 on the New York stock exchange.</p>

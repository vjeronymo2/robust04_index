			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche guaranteed there would be no  expeditious elimination of tariffs in sectors whose  representatives reject such a measure. "If any sector in Mexico  opposes the expeditious elimination of tariffs, this will not  occur," Serra Puche emphasized within the framework of a  revision that will be carried out by the North American Free  Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiation teams. These teams will  analyze a possible modification of the timetable for various  production sectors.    The official warned: "None of the NAFTA members are duty  bound to modify the timetable for the elimination of tariffs,"  so "they will only carry out changes that are advisable for the  Mexican production sector and economy."    During a brief interview upon the conclusion of his  participation in the Conference on North American Business  Outlook, the commerce secretary said there is also enough time  to carry out the necessary consultations to determine the  approval or rejection of the nation's industrial community. He  said if there is any objection from the production groups  concerning the elimination of specific tariffs, the Mexican team  will not bring those products to the negotiations.    Jaime Serra emphasized the importance of conveying to the  nation's production sector the guarantee that, although NAFTA  considers the possibility of expediting the previously agreed  upon elimination of tariffs, provided the involved parties  previously agree to this, the measure will only be implemented  in the areas that request it. The authorities will impose no  advance measures to abate the tariffs, the commerce secretary  insisted after his speech at the event, which was organized by  the Conference Board and the private sector's Center for  Economic Studies (CEESP).    After various Mexican industry sector representatives  rejected the expeditious elimination of the tariffs on their  products, Serra urged production sector representatives to  participate in the consultation process and determine in which  areas a change should be requested. The goal was to guarantee  -- as it was done throughout the NAFTA negotiation process --  agreements with the full support of those directly involved.    He said the necessary consultations are being carried out  through the Coordinator for Foreign Trade Business Organizations  (COECE) to detect support for an expeditious elimination of  tariffs, or the denial to renegotiate the deadline for trade  opportunities in each sector.</p>

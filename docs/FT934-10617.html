			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Search ends for new Clark chairman THE SEARCH for a new chairman to head C&amp;J Clark, the private UK shoe company whose shareholders narrowly rejected a Pounds 184m takeover bid earlier this year, ended after four months yesterday with the appointment of Mr Roger Pedder, a non-executive director and Clark family member. Mr Pedder's appointment, replacing Mr Walter Dickson, is expected to alleviate some of the tensions which have riven the family-owned company for some time and culminated in an attempt to sell C&amp;J Clark earlier this year. Family members rejected suggestions that his appointment had been fixed before the selection process began. 'It was as fair and open as possible,' said one. 'It was just considered he had the (appropriate) retailing experience.' There remain some, however, who appear to be unhappy with the decision to appoint an insider. Mr Daniel Clark, a non-executive director and family member who argued vehemently for a sale, announced his resignation yesterday. The role of the chief executive, Mr John Clothier, a family member who aroused considerable controversy by backing efforts to sell the company, now appears somewhat more secure since Mr Pedder's appointment. Mr Pedder was one of five candidates. It is believed that one of those shortlisted was Mr Rudolf Agnew, former chairman of Consolidated Goldfields and now of TVS Entertainment. The company is still searching for two non-executives, while a further two will be nominated by a shareholder council representing family interests. Clark's is 80 per cent owned by more than 500 family members. The company, which has in recent years been hit by recession and hefty reorganisation costs, returned to the black for the first half with pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 4.1m loss). Sales grew from Pounds 300.7m to Pounds 322.1m.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (2): Paperwork expands - Forest products fight for survival in the electronic age The spectre of a paperless society has hung over the forest products industry for decades. As people turn from newspapers to television, from letters to phone calls, and from office memos to electronic mail, paper should be going the same way as quill pens, copper kettles and buggy whips. Yet paper consumption continues to grow. Even in North America, where the electronic age has progressed furthest, demand grew by an average of just over 2 per cent a year between 1971 and 1990. Jaakko Poyry, the Helsinki-based consultancy, forecasts that consumption in North America will rise by 1.6 per cent a year to 2005, with average personal use climbing from 300 kg to 309 kg. 'There's still a psychological desire for the feel of paper,' says Mr Dick Storat, chief economist at the American Forest and Paper Association in Washington DC. The growth of electronics has brought some comfort to paper makers. Computer suppliers have yet to find a substitute for their bulky manuals. Computer magazines have mushroomed. Products such as uncoated freesheet, otherwise known as plain white paper, have gained a new lease of life. As personal computers become just another household appliance, the paper used for printers has become a value-added consumer product, complete with brand names and fancy packaging. Could forestry industry leaders be lulling themselves into a false sense of security? Mr Henrik Ehrnrooth, Jaakko Poyry's chief executive, cautions that forestry has traditionally been a capital-intensive rather than a technology-driven industry. Research and development spending is low compared to many other sectors. The forestry industry's conservatism is reflected in a widespread assumption that future growth in paper consumption will come mainly from incremental improvements to existing products, rather than an exciting breakthrough that could dramatically broaden paper's horizons. Pressure from the environmental movement has diverted much of the industry's R&amp;D and new capital investment towards conserving and recycling paper, rather than finding new uses for it. Some companies are going even further by experimenting with materials other than wood as an ingredient in fresh paper. Weyerhaeuser, the US forest-products group, is using pulped wheatgrass from fields in central Oregon as a supplement to woodpulp. Other US producers are working on ways to revive the old Chinese practice of making paper from hemp. A process similar to paper-making has been developed to produce lightweight 'spunbond' fabrics from natural and synthetic fibres. These fabrics are increasingly used for diapers and sanitary towels. In Japan, scientists are said to have found ways of producing synthetic cellulose fibres, the basic ingredient of paper. For the moment, none of these alternative materials seems likely to displace wood entirely as a raw material. But everyone acknowledges that technology is moving at a rapid and unpredictable pace. Paper makers' confidence in the future rests mainly on the assumption that fast-growing demand in newly-industrialising countries, especially China and south-east Asia, will more than make up for slackening consumption in the developed world. Consumption in China is currently only about 20 kg a person every year, about 5 per cent of the level in North America. Most paper companies' efforts to broaden consumption centre on producing new grades with a combination of improved brightness, printability, smoothness and strength. Paper is now used in such diverse products as hospital gowns and heavy bags that store animal feed or heavy automotive parts. Each producer hopes that its own new grade will find a niche where competition is minimal and margins high. SCA, the Swedish group, measures its managers' performance partly by the number of new products they launch. Not surprisingly, some new products are more successful than others. Extra-smooth and bright newsprint has enabled newspapers to improve dramatically the quality of their colour reproduction. But demand for coated kraftliner - thick cardboard with a glossy white finish, designed as a packaging material for items such as fine glassware - has been disappointing. Forest products companies are also seeking new uses for their raw material. The popularity of engineered wood products, which share many attributes of building materials such as steel and aluminium, has grown enormously in recent years. Wood components are increasingly being assembled into entire roofing and flooring systems. Canfor Corporation of Vancouver puts grass seed and wood-fibre residues on a textile base to make lightweight 'take-home' lawns, which can be rolled out in a garden like a carpet. Another Canfor product, known as Woodmat, is formed into interior car door panels, dashboards, kitchen cabinets and packaging trays. Much of the industry's effort is directed at replacing increasingly restricted supplies of high-quality, old-growth timber with smaller, lower-quality trees. Mr Chip Dillon,an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, predicts that North American production of oriented strand board, which is made from multiple strands of low-quality timber, will grow by 6bn sq ft over the next four years. Plywood capacity will shrink by at least 2bn sq ft. Some questions about forest products' future may be answered by an ambitious US task force which was set up in August 1993 by the Environmental Defence Fund and six big paper consumers, including McDonald's (fast food), Johnson &amp; Johnson (healthcare products), Time Inc. (magazines), Prudential Assurance and NationsBank. The participants plan to consult a wide range of groups involved with paper, including producers, environmentalists, investment bankers and graphic designers, in the hope of learning how paper can meet world demands. The taskforce is expected to complete its work in early 1995.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- World paper and board per capita consumption  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Per capita consumption (1)  10-year         1990 Region                1994 (2)     1984        CAGR (%)   population (3)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- European Union       162.0        158.1         0.2          328,183 Scandinavia          230.0        225.6         0.2           17,650 Eastern Europe        33.0         34.3        (0.4)         427,250 North America        310.0        302.1         0.3          276,216 People's Rep of  China                18.0         12.6         3.6        1,143,330 India                  4.0          3.1         2.6          843,000 Indonesia              9.5          7.7         2.1          179,140 Japan                230.0        228.3         0.1          123,600 Brazil                30.0         27.6         0.8          150,367 Chile                 38.0         31.7         1.8           13,131 Mexico                39.0         36.4         0.7           82,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Thousands of tonnes; 2 Salomon Bros estimate; 3 Thousands  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: PPI European Factbook and Salomon Bros  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

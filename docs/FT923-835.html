			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / EC move over attacks on aircraft EUROPEAN justice ministers meeting in London next week are to consider legal action against Yugoslavia over the shooting down in January of an Italian helicopter attached to the EC monitoring force. The Yugoslav federal air force was blamed for the attack, in which six people were killed. The proposal, under discussion by ministers at the request of Italy, is for the Community to sue what remains of the Yugoslav state for damages in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. There is no precedent for legal action by the Community as a whole in this type of case, and ministers have to decide whether the EC has the right to launch legal proceedings in the International Court. It is thought the Italians may also want to widen the scope of the action to include the shooting down at the beginning of September of an Italian relief flight to Sarajevo, in which four crew were killed. Ministers also hope to reach agreement on extending the jurisdiction of the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. The CFI, which was set up in 1989 to ease the workload of the mother court, the European Court of Justice, deals only with competition and EC staff cases. Several member states, including Britain and Germany, want to cut delays in the EC's legal machinery by transferring jurisdiction over anti-dumping, state aid and agricultural quota cases from the ECJ to the CFI. The move is opposed by Italy, Spain and to a lesser extent by France and Greece, largely, it is believed, because they do not want the handling of anti-dumping cases speeded up. Challenges to the imposition of dumping duties by the European Commission can take up to two years to be dealt with by the ECJ. This delay offers considerable protection from competitively-priced imports from outside the EC during that time. The two-day meeting will also discuss an initiative from Britain to set up an independent EC law reform body to undertake the consolidation and clarification of Community legislation, much of which is inaccessible and unnecessarily complex. The Commission is expected to oppose this initiative because of fears it could threaten its role as EC policy maker.</p>

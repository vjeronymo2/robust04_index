			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Thailand sets out on path to freer market The Thai government plans a series of economic reforms in the coming months, with the emphasis on liberalising the financial sector and reducing import tariffs to improve the competitiveness of Thai commerce and industry, Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister, said yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Tarrin said the first step was to expand the scope of operations which can be undertaken by the 47 banks granted offshore banking licences under the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF). The plan was to allow BIBF licence holders from early next year to open additional branches outside Bangkok and start lending in local currency up to specified limits, although they would not be permitted to accept local deposits and would have to raise funding from the money markets. 'The BIBF would be upgraded into restricted branch operations.' Later, foreign banks would be allowed to open additional conventional branches and more such institutions would be granted access to Thailand. Now, foreign banks are allowed only one branch and cannot have electronic banking outlets except on their premises. The hope was that the Uruguay Round of world trade talks would be successfully concluded this year. Thailand was planning 'massive' customs tariff reforms, involving lowering those on raw materials imports, making tariffs more logical, and cutting the number of rates to six from 31. Import tariffs would be progressively reduced, independent of reductions due under the Asean Free Trade Area and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to expose Thai business to competition. 'This is a big move for Thailand. What you will see in the longer term (say three years from now) is a much freer market, much more vibrant imports; you'll begin to see more investments taking advantage of this and turning it around to exports,' Mr Tarrin, former president of Siam Commercial Bank, added. Although the five-party coalition government of which Mr Tarrin is a member is unstable, economic reform plans are at an advanced stage and generally supported by technocrats in the bureaucracy, if not by industrialists in protected sectors such as petrochemicals. The Thai economy continues to perform robustly despite the weak state of Thailand's export markets in Europe and Japan. Export growth is expected to reach only 10 per cent this year, compared to a forecast 15 per cent, but this is mainly the result of weak agricultural commodity prices; electronics exports are still rising sharply and the domestic market remains strong. Mr Tarrin said he expected real gross domestic product to increase 7.5 per cent this year and 7.5-8 per cent in 1994. Inflation this year has fallen to about 3.6 per cent, but inflationary pressures next year would probably prompt a rise in interest rates.</p>

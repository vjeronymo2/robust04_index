			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Reorganisation costs leave Woodchester halved at IPounds 17m Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, has reported a halving of 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 35.4m to IPounds 17.1m (Pounds 16.4m), after an exceptional charge of IPounds 15m to fund restructuring. Excluding the exceptional charge pre-tax profits showed a 9 per cent drop. The charge is 'deemed fully adequate and of a once-off nature' and once complete, the restructuring plan 'will lead to a significant improvement in the long-term profitability of the group'. Woodchester, in which Credit Lyonnais has a 47.97 per cent holding, has grown rapidly in Ireland in recent years, through eight acquisitions, and despite rationalisations the company says there remained 'an unacceptably high cost base' and a number of 'unprofitable product lines'. Its core car financing business grew by 16 per cent in the period. In the UK the group reported a doubling of its motor finance business to Pounds 173m, but decided to discontinue two non-core activities, a commercial mortgage company and a trade finance subsidiary. Reorganisation is also taking place in CLLE, the leasing subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, in which Woodchester has a 30 per cent stake. Middle-ticket and small-ticket leasing is to be split into two divisions, the middle ticket section being managed through Credit Lyonnais bank network, while the small-ticket leasing and business equipment and vehicle finance is to be managed separately. Woodchester is to take direct responsibility for the small-ticket leasing business in Denmark and Portugal. Total assets improved over the year from IPounds 1.4bn to IPounds 1.5bn with a Tier one capital adequacy ratio of 20 per cent. The drop in interest rates made this surplus capital earnings dilutive, the company said, and the board regarded its prudent investment as a key priority. Earnings per share were 8.25p (15.1p). A final dividend of 3.09p is proposed for a total of 5.17p (4.5p). COMMENT Woodchester's rapid expansion and diversification into banking through its strategic alliance with Credit Lyonnais has not gone as smoothly as expected. The company's strong balance sheet however, together with its decision to clean out unprofitable lines of business and tackle its cost base, would seem to justify the increase in dividend as a means of maintaining shareholder loyalty, albeit that Credit Lyonnais will be the main beneficiary. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 32m in 1994 would seem to be attainable, giving earnings of 11.9p. A prospective p/e ratio of 10.5 is higher than Ireland's two main clearing banks, suggesting that any upturn is already priced in to the company's shares.</p>

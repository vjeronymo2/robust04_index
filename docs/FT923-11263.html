			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Hard tale in Bronte country - Nick Garnett visits two beginners in the restaurant trade who have found the going tough but rewarding WHEN the bank manager asked Muriel Jordan what things she would have done differently with her tiny business, she replied: 'Everything.' Well, it is not quite true, but running her Bronte Birthplace restaurant has proved a chilling eye-opener. 'It has been tough. Hundreds of people wouldn't have done it. If we'd had experience of running a restaurant, we might not have tried it, either.' Muriel was (and still is) a full-time nursing officer when she and her husband, Malcolm, decided to buy a single 'lot' of derelict properties in the hilly village district of Thornton, a few miles from the centre of Bradford, West Yorkshire. It included two small, single-storey cottages, a larger house that was once Thornton parsonage and, nestling behind, a courtyard inhabited by a large, crumbling stone barn. The original idea, four years ago, was a spot of property speculation. The whole lot cost Pounds 90,000 to buy. Both cottages were then converted and sold. The Jordans then decided to transform the old parsonage into a restaurant. This was opened a year ago. The Bronte family lived at the parsonage for five years early in the 1800s and Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell all were born there. It is, therefore, a structure with historic pulling power and for which the former kitchen and front parlour provide extremely pretty and interesting eating rooms. The third phase of the project is the conversion of the barn, for which planning permission has been obtained for a house. An application to convert it to a six-bedroom guest house is in the pipeline. Developing this cluster of buildings probably is giving the Jordans some long-term capital growth. But it is not generating income. So far, in fact, the project is being kept alive partly through tapping into Muriel's salary and Malcolm's income as a joiner. Selling the two cottages for about Pounds 45,000 each failed to cover renovation costs. The buildings were in a more gruesome condition than the Jordans thought. 'Apart from that, the actual costs charged by the builders exceeded their quotations by 25 per cent,' Muriel says. On one occasion, a builder who, at the request of the Jordans, mounted a second inspection of the roof of one building, withdrew his quotation and submitted another one three times higher. The Jordans will not proceed with the barn conversion until the restaurant starts making a profit. At the moment, it does not. It deserves to, though, in an area not over-burdened with recommendable eating places. A three-course Sunday lunch, including dishes such as home-made pate, chicken in pastry and bread-and-butter pudding, costs a fixed Pounds 8. 'It does not sound much but that's all the area will probably stand on prices,' says Muriel. A more expensive week-day a la carte menu incorporates braised ox-tail in Yorkshire Bitter with dumplings, roast duck in home-made plum confit, and rabbit pie with cider sauce. The wine list is long and the bar cosy. Staff don Victorian clothing and Good Old Days once a month form part of a range of special evenings. Customers can visit the room the Brontes used as a nursery and a collection of Victorian shoes is being added. In spite of all this, the restaurant is not making money. It can cater for 40 at once with a break-even at 25 per cent full but it is failing to achieve that. 'The accountant told us not to expect to make money in the first two years." The Jordans are learning some tough lessons about catering. They possessed no experience of this kind of business. Because they are locked into other permanent jobs, problems of staffing and cost control are even more difficult than they would be normally. One restaurant manager lasted just three weeks and Muriel then decided to do without one, saving the Pounds 12,000 salary. She thinks this was a mistake. 'What I could probably do with now is a younger, go-getting manager who can help with marketing and look for business.' Retaining chefs has also proved difficult. The restaurant usually employs a head chef and a commis chef but is now seeking a new head chef. The last one departed to set up his own restaurant. 'We've been advertising for two months. An advert in the Yorkshire Post brought just three replies.' This underlines the crucial issue of location which probably cramps the Bronte Birthplace's ability to attract professional staff. The restaurant is 10 miles from Haworth, the centre of the Bronte tourist trade. Tourists come to Thornton but hardly in droves. The restaurant's mid-week trade is largely made up of businessmen but Bradford, like so many industrial cities, no longer possesses the depth of industry it did. 'We have had a dilemma about whether we principally cater for tourists or for locals, says Muriel.' The venture was funded initially by selling two houses the Jordans owned (they now live in the same building as the restaurant) and by a bank loan. The loan has been reduced - but would still be large enough to cover the cost of a detached house in the Yorkshire city. On the other hand, the Jordans say the restaurant building is valued at Pounds 150,000 and the venture is giving them some enjoyment. 'One of the nicest things is that you are responsible for people enjoying themselves. You feel responsible if something goes wrong, but you get pleasure when it goes right.'

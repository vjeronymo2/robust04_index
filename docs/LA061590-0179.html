			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONSUMER INFLATION HELD TO MODEST 0.2%;  </P> <P> 2ND MONTH IN ROW; VEGETABLE, FUEL OIL DECLINES CREDITED  </P> <P> Falling vegetable and fuel oil prices in May held consumer inflation to a  modest 0.2% for the second consecutive month, the government said today.  </P> <P> For the first five months of the year, the Labor Department's consumer price  index has advanced at an annual rate of 5.8%. That's up significantly from the  4.6% rate for all of last year, but down sharply from the worrisome 8.5% rate  in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The good news was expected by most economists, who said prices are recovering  from a cold weather jolt at the beginning of the year.  </P> <P> "Just as first-quarter inflation was overstated, inflation (in April and May)  was understated," said economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington-based  consultant. "We're almost sure price increases are going to get bigger again  next month."  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that "despite the temporary  increase in the first quarter, over the last 12 months consumer prices have  increased 4.4%. Inflation remains low and under control."  </P> <P> The Labor Department said prices of fruit and vegetables fell 2.4%, the third  substantial drop in a row. Vegetables soared 29.2% in the first two months of  the year before falling 23.6% in the next three months.  </P> <P> Food overall in May rose just 0.1% after edging down 0.2% in April.  </P> <P> Dairy product costs fell for the third consecutive month in May while prices  were up for sweets, fats and oils and beverages.  </P> <P> Energy prices fell 0.7%, the fourth monthly decline after a large increase in  January. Fuel oil fell 1.4% and natural gas 2.7%. However, electricity charges  rose 1%.  </P> <P> Gasoline prices rose modestly, but less than usual for the start of the warm  weather driving season. Thus, after seasonal adjustment, gasoline prices were  reported down 1.6%.  </P> <P> Excluding the often volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a moderate  0.3% after a 0.2% rise in April. Economists consider this so-called core rate a  better indication of underlying inflation because it moves less erratically.  </P> <P> New car prices edged down 0.2%, the fourth consecutive decline in the face of  sluggish sales.  </P> <P> Apparel prices, which had been up sharply earlier in the year because a warm  February got spring sales off to an early start, fell 0.3% last month. The  price of men's clothing rose 0.4%, but women's and children's clothing fell 1%  and 2.2% respectively.  </P> <P> The price of medical care jumped 0.8% in May for the fourth consecutive month,  pushing those costs 9% higher than a year ago.  </P> <P> The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 129.2 in May. That  means a hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the  1982-84 base period cost $129.20 last month, up from $123.80 a year ago.  </P> <P> Wholesale prices, which rose 0.3% in May, have behaved more moderately than  consumer prices. The Labor Department's producer price index is up at only a 4%  annual rate so far this year, down from 4.8% for all of last year.  </P> <P> Economists point to the different composition of the two indexes as an  explanation for their divergence.  </P></p>

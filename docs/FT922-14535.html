			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Worries at White House denied THE White House is on the defensive about reports of an operational 'gridlock' over President George Bush's agenda and of rushing to publicise a Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) international aid programme for Russia for domestic political reasons before details of the package had been agreed. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, has denied a story in the Washington Post that frustration with a sluggish White House bureaucracy has driven him to the brink of resignation. He praised the 'strong management team' put in place by Mr Sam Skinner, Mr Bush's chief of staff. However, the Post and other press reports are describing a White House hampered by 'mini-bureaucracy' which has been unable to bridge differences with campaign officials to fashion themes for the president's re-election campaign. One political achievement - the Russian aid package - is now being criticised in Japan, where officials said the programme announced was larger than had been agreed. Canadian officials also seemed confused about the numbers, and the US State and Treasury Departments have each had different estimates of the American contribution. This has raised suspicions, denied by the White House, that the administration rushed through the announcement of the aid before details had been agreed by the Group of Seven industrial nations. Governor Mario Cuomo of New York said Mr Bill Clinton was likely to be the Democratic nominee for president, whether or not he wins the New York primary tomorrow. He urged the governor to meet congressional leaders to draw up a plan for the economy.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Tiny decides to put away the blunderbuss: A look at the ending of a long business battle THE LAST TIME the Fayed brothers offered to end their long-running dispute with Lonrho over their 1985 acquisition of the House of Fraser Stores, it elicited a blunderbuss response from Mr Tiny Rowland. In a reply to a 'peace letter' from Mr Royston Webb, legal director of House of Fraser Holdings, Mr Rowland said: 'The company you represent is now so sunk in debt that Harrods, the once proud flagship, can barely be said to be trading at all.' As recently as this summer Mr Rowland remained confident that court actions against the Fayeds would result in the award of massive damages to Lonrho. On Thursday it was Mr Rowland's turn to offer peace and the Fayeds were only too happy to accept. Mr Rowland's change of heart can be partly explained by his age - he will soon be 76 - and partly because he has a joint chief executive in Mr Dieter Bock, who has an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho. Mr Bock has been determined to settle the long-running dispute. By ensuring that Lonrho sued for peace he has further stamped his authority on the conglomerate which has in effect been run by Mr Rowland for more than 30 years. The main legal action, alleging a conspiracy between the Fayeds and Kleinwort Benson - which had been the brothers' financial adviser during the takeover - to deprive Lonrho of House of Fraser, began in 1987. The latest court action against the Fayeds and Kleinworts was due to start on January 30. In July Lonrho won the right to sue the Fayed brothers for financial loss over an alleged dirty tricks campaign fought since the brothers gained control of the House of Fraser. Each side would have been spending Pounds 1m a month during a court case that could have lasted for six months. Mr Rowland said last night that the peace had been brokered by Mr Hassan Yassim, a Saudi businessman and cousin of the Fayeds by marriage. Mr Michael Cole, a director of House of Fraser Holdings, said that Mr Yassim spoke to Ali Fayed. 'A meeting between Tiny and Ali then took place at the Saudi's London house on Thursday,' he said. Yesterday Mr Cole insisted that there was no monetary element to the settlement. The dispute was costing each side Pounds 10,000 a day in lawyers fees, Mr Cole said - but insisted that House of Fraser's expenses has been less than Pounds 10m. Mr Rowland said he thought that between them the two sides had spent up to Pounds 50m in legal costs and that he thought the Fayed's expenses had been greater than those of Lonrho. The pact was agreed 'without reference to the Lonrho board' by Mr Rowland and with no lawyers present. Mr Rowland has now instructed his solicitors, Denton Hall Burgin, to make the agreement legally binding - which should be done by lunchtime on Monday. Both companies have suffered from the dispute. When the three Fayed brothers  -Mohamed, Ali and Salah - paid Pounds 615m for House of Fraser, owner of Harrods, they incurred the deep enmity of Mr Rowland, who had first bought shares in the stores group in 1977. Mr Rowland unleashed a ferocious campaign to overturn the acquisition which led to many court hearings. The battle was described by Mr Justice Macpherson in his 1992 court ruling as 'a public, unpleasant and vitriolic vendetta'. Ordering a High Court action for damages by Lonrho against the Fayed brothers to be struck out, he went on to liken it to a 'prolonged public warfare with no holds barred'. Over the past eight years Mr Rowland has been intent on discrediting the Fayeds and has spared no expense. In 1984 Mr Rowland sold two large parcels of House of Fraser shares to Mr Mohamed Fayed, who had been an associate and Lonrho board member, in the mistaken belief that the brothers did not have the money to buy the group. Mr Rowland was also bitter that Lonrho's earlier takeover bid for House of Fraser in 1981 was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission but that the Fayeds' 1985 takeover was not similarly obstructed. Mr Rowland's persistent complaints about the Fayed takeover - and his allegation that the source of their fund for the bid was unclear - earned him a DTI investigation into the purchase. The DTI inspector's report published in March 1990 accused the Fayeds of dishonestly misrepresenting 'their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources'. The end of the feud marks a milestone in Lonrho's turbulent history and is an indication that Mr Rowland may have finally lost his appetite for long-running battles.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Danish centrists offer hope for SDP leader MR Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the leader of Denmark's opposition Social Democratic party, moved closer yesterday to becoming prime minister of Denmark when a pivotal centrist party said it would probably back him. The small Radical Liberal party, holding the balance of power in parliament, said after an all-day meeting it would support him if inter-party talks on a government programme were successful. 'We are now concentrating on creating the best possible government programme and if this is successful it would be natural that Rasmussen becomes prime minister,' Radical Liberal leader Marianne Jelved said after the party meeting in the town of Nyborg. Mr Rasmussen will resume talks today, seeking either a minority SDP government or a coalition of the SDP and the Radical Liberals. Mr Schluter, prime minister since 1982, resigned last Thursday when a judicial inquiry found that he had misled the Folketing (parliament) in 1989 over the so-called 'Tamilgate' scandal, in which Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, the former minister of justice, illegally ordered civil servants to delay issuing entry visas to the wives and children of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. There appears to be majority support among the parties in the Folketing for impeachment proceedings against Mr Ninn-Hansen. If such proceedings are instituted it will be for the first time since 1910. An impeachment trial is conducted by the 15 judges of the High Court, who sit together with 15 persons appointed by the Folketing, none of whom may be MPs. Tamilgate has not led to an increase in the popularity of the SDP, according to opinion polls. A poll published in Jyllands Posten yesterday showed the SDP sliding by four points to 33.4 per cent from 37.4 per cent in the 1990 election. The chief beneficiary of the scandal, which has seriously damaged the Conservative party, is the Liberal party of Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, which went ahead to 23.9 per cent compared with 15.8 per cent in the last election. The possibility of an SDP government has been accepted with equanimity by the financial markets. One reason is that the party's economic policy spokesman, Mr Mogens Lykkteft, has said that an SDP government would continue to pursue tight public spending policies and would maintain the fixed exchange rate policy through continued participation in the European exchange rate mechanism. Among the tasks for a new prime minister is running the rotating European Community presidency, in Copenhagen's hands since January 1. Denmark also faces a crucial second referendum in late April or May on the landmark Maastricht treaty on European economic and political union, after Danes said No in a first vote last June. Mr Rasmussen is a staunch supporter of a revised Maastricht deal exempting Danes from the treaty's long-term aims for a common currency and joint defence policies. Danish news media predicted that if the government programme was accepted by a majority Mr Rasmussen could replace Mr Schluter by the middle of this week.</p>

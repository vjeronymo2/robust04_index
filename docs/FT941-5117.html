			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lyonnaise sells stake in McAlpine Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, one of Europe's biggest construction companies, yesterday severed a five year link with Alfred McAlpine, with the sale of its 11.3 per cent stake in the UK group for an estimated Pounds 19m. Lyonnaise is believed to have placed the 6.4m shares with about six UK institutions at a price of between 300p and 304p. McAlpine's shares closed down 5p yesterday at 311p. The stake dates from 1989 when Dumez bought 4.7 per cent of McAlpine. Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive of McAlpine, said the share sale did not mean that the original joint venture plans would be scrapped. He was pleased with the broader shareholder base, which the company had been seeking.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA'S STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> As one of the participants in the April 11 White House conference with  Baltic-American leaders, my impressions were somewhat different from those  conveyed by your story of April 12 (Part A).  </P> <P> The meeting itself was a signal that the Bush Administration is seriously  considering various options that go beyond present rhetoric in responding to  Soviet escalation of the Baltic situation.  </P> <P> The fact that Secretary of State James Baker, National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu attended the meeting along  with President Bush helped emphasize this. The further fact that a meeting  which was scheduled to last half an hour continued for more than an hour  indicated that the proposals which were made were not dismissed out of hand.  </P> <P> No one in the Baltic delegation expected President Bush to announce a major  policy shift based on our discussions. What we hoped for and received was the  President's unequivocal endorsement of the right of the people of Estonia,  Latvia and Lithuania for self-determination. We also received an invitation to  continue providing input into the Administration's Baltic policy  decision-making process.  </P> <P> JAAK TREIMAN  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

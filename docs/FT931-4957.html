			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welcome for rail franchise interest MORE THAN 70 private-sector groups have expressed an interest in operating rail passenger services under the franchise arrangements planned by the government, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told the Commons yesterday. He said it was 'extremely encouraging' that they included more than 20 management-employee buy-out teams. Mr MacGregor confirmed that British Rail would decide by Easter how to spend the Pounds 150m allocated to it to lease new rolling stock. British Rail would decide the lines on which the new stock would operate, he said. Denying Labour charges that passenger services were being run down prior to privatisation, Mr MacGregor stressed that investment was at levels not equalled since the 1960s. Investment would continue at a high level next year, he stressed. The transport secretary also ruled out any plans to use British Rail pension cash to subsidise privatisation, denouncing in the Commons what he called 'mischievous and quite unwarranted scares'. Shadow transport secretary Mr John Prescott said there was a Pounds 4bn surplus in the BR pension fund and sought an assurance that no subsidies would come from the surplus. Mr MacGregor pledged: 'I give a complete assurance that in no way would this government countenance the BR pension scheme fund being used for purposes other than paying BR pensions.' Dewe Rogerson, the public relations consultancy, has been appointed by the government to advise it on a marketing strategy for the privatisation of British Rail.</p>

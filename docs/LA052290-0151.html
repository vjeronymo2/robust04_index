			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN VALUE BUYS N.Y. BROKERAGE;  </P> <P> ACQUISITION: THE LARGE TUSTIN BROKERAGE AND FINANCIAL PLANNING FIRM HAS  ACQUIRED A WHITE PLAINS INVESTMENT BANKING COMPANY'S BROKERAGE BUSINESS.  </P> <P> Titan Value Equities Group Inc., a large brokerage and financial planning  company in Tustin, said Monday that it has acquired the brokerage business of a  White Plains, N.Y., investment banking firm for a price to be determined later.  </P> <P> Titan, formerly called Titan Capital Corp., said the acquisition of Jonathan  Alan &amp; Co.'s retail division gives it 1,400 agents and 360 offices in 42  states, primarily on the West Coast and in the Northeast.  </P> <P> "This is by far our most exciting acquisition to date," Frank L. King, Titan's  president and chief executive, said in a prepared statement. "No other national  firm has been able to balance its representation on both coasts."  </P> <P> Before the acquisition, Titan's offices in the East were limited mostly to  Georgia and South Carolina.  </P> <P> As part of the deal, Jonathan Alan's president, Mitch Feinglas, will join  Titan's board of directors. The New York company will continue to operate as an  investment banking firm.  </P> <P> The purchase price will be determined by Jonathan Alan's sales during the next  three to four years, said Allan Denton, Titan's chief operating officer.  </P> <P> Titan was founded in 1977 as a brokerage and built its business on providing  its agents with an array of financial planning products. For its fiscal year,  which ended April 30, Titan earned $250,000 on revenue of $23.2 million, Denton  said.  </P> <P> Though a brokerage, Titan concentrates on financial planning through such  products and services as annuities, limited partnerships and pension plan  administration.  </P> <P> Jonathan Alan entered the retail brokerage business in 1983 and provided  full-service financial planning. In 1988, the firm started its investment  banking division and recently decided to focus solely on that line of business,  Denton said.  </P></p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Guerrilla car bomb in Peru SHINING Path guerrillas detonated a car bomb with more than 150 kilos of explosives yesterday, damaging a police school and wounding four people, police said, Reuter reports from Lima. The car bomb, the first since the capture of Mr Abimael Guzman, Peru's Shining Path rebel chief, in September, also heavily damaged several homes near the National Police School of Advanced Studies in the southern district of Chorillos. About 25 army officers, three of them retired generals, have been arrested over the weekend after a coup attempt was foiled, Sally Bowen adds from Lima. General Jose Valdivia, the army's number two, has been placed under house arrest as 'a security measure', according to Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori.</p>

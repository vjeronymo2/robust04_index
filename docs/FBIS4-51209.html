			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, 6 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The migrant  population in Shanghai is increasing substantially. According  to a recent survey, three-quarters of the migrants in Shanghai  came to seek jobs or do business. This reflects Shanghai's  rapid economic development and benign environment for doing  business.    The survey showed that people moving into and out of  Shanghai  numbered 3.31 million in the past year. In particular, 2.81  million people moved into Shanghai and 0.5 million people moved  out. The total number of migrants increased by 1.22 million as  compared with 2.09 million in 1988. According to statistics,  74.3 percent of the migrants moved into Shanghai for various  economic purposes; 0.8 percent of the people came to Shanghai  for such cultural purposes as receiving education and training;  24.5 percent came to visit friends and relatives, make  sightseeing tours, or seek medical treatment; and visitors for  other purposes accounted for 0.4 percent.    The relevant department in Shanghai held that the increase  in  the migrant population brought economic and labor resources to  the city, but, at the same time, it also produced certain  negative effects on Shanghai's public security, transportation,  environment, and residents' daily lives. People of insight have  urged the authorities concerned to solve the new problems caused  by the inflow of migrants as soon as possible.</p>

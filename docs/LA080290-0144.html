			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> DIAL-A-RIDE VANS REPAIRED  </P> <P> The mystery of the malfunctioning Dial-A-Ride vans has been solved.  </P> <P> The city's six vans broke down in late June during the city's 100-degree heat  wave, forcing the operator, MediRide, to use rental cars.  </P> <P> The problem was engine heat, combined with high temperatures and reflected heat  from the asphalt, that caused gasoline in the vans to vaporize and the motor to  stop running, said Sarah Gallup, the city's Dial-A-Ride coordinator.  </P> <P> The solution was the welding of a metal plate between the undercarriage and the  gas tank to act as a heat shield. Since the plates have been installed, all the  vans have been put back in service and are operating without problems, Gallup  said.  </P></p>

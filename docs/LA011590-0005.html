At the  turn of the century, there were about 53,000 acres of coastal wetlands between  Morro Bay and Ensenada, Mexico, according to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. Only  about 11,000 acres remain. These tidal wetlands are explored in a new exhibit,  "Mud Flats: Cradle of Life," at the Cabrillo Museum in San Pedro.  </P> <P> More than 50 species of marine fish rely on this habitat for spawning and  nursery areas. In addition, the wetlands serve as important feeding and  wintering grounds for migratory and resident birds, including some endangered  species.  </P> <P> Using changing displays and aquariums, the recently opened exhibit reveals the  importance of these areas and the wide variety of life that can be found there.

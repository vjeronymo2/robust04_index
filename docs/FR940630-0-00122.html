Elsewhere in today's edition of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , the Department has published an interim rule that makes comprehensive amendments to HUD's section 3 regulations at 24 CFR part 135 to bring these regulations into conformity with the changes made to section 3 by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.

Background_Conforming Amendments Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Since its enactment, section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) has been a statutory basis for promoting the award of jobs and contracts, generated from projects receiving HUD financial assistance, to, respectively, low-income residents and businesses of the areas where the projects to be assisted are located. Section 3 was recently amended, in its entirety, by section 915 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act). Although the 1992 Act significantly revised section 3, it did not alter the objective of section 3_to provide economic opportunities to low-income persons. The 1992 Act, in fact, strengthens the section 3 mandate by: clarifying the types of HUD financial assistance, activities, and recipients subject to the requirements of section 3; identifying the specific individuals and businesses who are the intended beneficiaries of the economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities; and establishing the order of priority in which these individuals and businesses should be recruited and solicited for the employment and other economic opportunities generated from HUD-assisted activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elsewhere in today's edition of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Department has published an interim rule which makes comprehensive amendments to HUD's section 3 regulations at 24 CFR part 135 to bring these regulations into conformity with the changes made to section 3 by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The section 3 (part 135) interim rule is based on the proposed rule published on October 8, 1993, and takes into consideration public comment received on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule makes final a conforming amendments proposed rule published on October 8, 1993, and which was a companion rule to the section 3 (part 135) proposed rule also published on October 8, 1993. The October 8, 1993 ``conforming amendments rule'' proposed to make conforming amendments to several parts in title 24 of the Code of Regulations to include reference to the applicability of the part 135 regulations to the HUD program addressed by these parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several HUD programs, particularly new HUD programs, include in their program requirements the applicability of section 3 to the program, but do not require compliance with the part 135 regulations. (See, for example, 24 CFR parts 576, 583, 700.) Compliance with the part 135 regulations was not included because the part 135 regulations had not been updated to reflect statutory amendments. (The part 135 regulations have not been amended substantively since their original adoption in 1973, although statutory amendments were made to section 3 in 1974 and 1980.) Additionally, several parts in 24 CFR currently refer to the part 135 regulations, but include reference to the former statutory language of section 3 (i.e., before its amendment by section 915 of the 1992 Act, the title of section 3 was ``Employment Opportunities for Businesses and Lower Income Persons in Connection with Assisted Projects''). The Department notes, however, that not all parts in 24 CFR which reference section 3 and the part 135 regulations require conforming amendments. (For example, see 24 CFR 941.208(a).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 8, 1993 conforming amendments rule also proposed to amend 24 CFR part 963_Contracting with Resident-Owned Businesses_to raise the dollar contract limit from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The purpose of the alternative procurement process provided by part 963 is to encourage PHAs to contract with resident-owned businesses for public housing services, supplies, or construction. The increase in the dollar contract limit is directed to encouraging additional contract opportunities for resident-owned businesses, which is consistent with the objectives of section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

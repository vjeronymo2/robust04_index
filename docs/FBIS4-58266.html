			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani said that if  matters relating to the F-16 deal aree not settled with the  United States, the world market is open for Pakistan to purchase  other planes. Talking to newsmen at Larkana, he said Pakistan  will not accept any condition in this deal that is against its  national interests because there are other things more important  than F-16's. Negotiations, however, are in progress.    When asked about occupied Kashmir, the defense minister  spoke  of the heavy deployment of Indian forces there. He said,  however, that our frontiers are well protected and we are  capable of facing all eventualities.    To other question, Aftab Shabaz Mirani replied that the  prime  minister has openly asked the opposition to end its boycott and  return to the National Assembly. He said the government could  still adopt many measures to end the confrontation and bring the  opposition back to the negotiating table.</p>

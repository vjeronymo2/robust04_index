			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Jihad Duty Binding on All"] </F>   [Text] The Israeli leadership might be able to alter  Palestine's geographical boundaries and introduce amendments to  its demographic map by absorbing large numbers of emigrants.  But this leadership -- no matter how powerful materially --  cannot change the Palestinian people's beliefs, the foundations  of their faith, and their absolute belief in their legitimate  rights.    We are reemphasizing these constants because of the clamor  provoked by the Yitzhaq Rabin government over a speech  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat delivered during a meeting  with South African Muslims in a Johannesburg mosque. In the  speech he demanded the Muslims' jihad for the sake of liberating  Jerusalem and restoring it as a capital for the Islamic nation  as a whole.    Maybe the Palestinian president was forced -- under Israeli  and U.S. pressures -- to offer clarifications which include  justifications, not backtrackings. But what applies to him as a  politician engaging in a difficult and complicated peace process  whose balances are not equal does not necessarily apply to the  Palestinian Arab people's sons, who are actually exercising  jihad in the occupied territories daily.    When they confront settlers in Hebron and take revenge for  their victims within hours in heroic fedayeen operations, it is  the highest kind of jihad. When they cling to the land, refuse  to bargain over it, and prefer to stay in detention centers  rather than pledge to abandon their right to resist, it means  that numerous troubles are ahead of Israel if it insists on its  repressive policies, refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab  territories, and continues its settlement policies.    The jihad remains a duty for every Arab and Muslim as long  as  the holy land is occupied and as long as al-Aqsa Mosque is  shackled. And if the United States succeeded in omitting the  "jihad" from the resolutions adopted by the Dakar Islamic  summit, it will not succeed in imposing this ban on the peoples  after the rulers.    So the Israeli clamor in question reveals the Rabin  government's bad intentions with regard to Jerusalem and its  future -- the fundamental issue which has been deferred to the  negotiations of the final phase, which are supposed to begin in  three years at the latest.    The Palestinian president was right when he appealed to all  Muslims throughout the world to perform their duty to liberate  Jerusalem.    Suffice it to say that this people have continued the jihad  for 70 years to safeguard the Arab Islamic identity of this old  city. They fiercely resisted all temptations to emigration and  naturalization and as a result they have lost thousands of  martyrs.    All the propaganda festivals held for Jerusalem here and  there do not have a fraction of the effect caused by an Iraqi  missile fired on Israel. Jerusalem does not need prayers and  speeches, but, rather, actions and sacrifices.    It is shameful and suspicious at the same time for us not to  hear a single call for jihad for the sake of Jerusalem. And if  this call is announced, it tends to emanate from a besieged,  suffocated, starved state. As for the Arab and Islamic states  that are overstuffed with money, missiles, aircraft, and all  types of weapons, they pretend to forget Jerusalem and the  people of Jerusalem. They do not want to do anything about it.  And if they do, their actions are not in the Palestinian  people's interests and do not help to recover their rights in  the framework of the simplest possible forms of sympathy and  solidarity.</p>

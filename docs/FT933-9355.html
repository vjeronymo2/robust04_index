			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold ends first day 26p higher SHARES IN Bakyrchik Gold, which offers an investment in a gold mining venture in Kazakhstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, went to a premium of more than 20 per cent when trading started yesterday. London investors were asked to provide Pounds 9m by way of a placing by stockbrokers Williams de Broe of 7.5m shares at 120p each. The shares closed last night at 146p. Mr Kevin Foo, BK Gold's London-based chief executive, said the issue had been over-subscribed and allocations to institutions in Europe had to be scaled down. The promoters suggest that BK Gold is the only substantial 'pure gold' company listed in London and that the flotation has provided an early opportunity to invest in Kazakhstan. The company has a joint venture with the Kazakhstan government to develop the Bakyrchik gold mine, which has one of the world's biggest gold deposits on the republic's north-eastern steppes. If the first phase goes well, BK Gold intends to raise a further Pounds 75m next year to increase annual gold production from 40,000 troy ounces to 230,000 ounces. Minproc, the Australian natural resources and engineering group, and Chilewich, a New York trading organisation, between them own 50 per cent of BK Gold. The chairman is Mr David Hooker, previously with Aberdeen Petroleum, while two former RTZ executives are on the board. Mr Andrew Buxton, once an RTZ main board director is a non-executive director and Mr Nicholas Bridgen, is the finance director.</p>

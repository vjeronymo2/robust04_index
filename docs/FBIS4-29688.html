			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning the no-confidence motion against the  Hata cabinet, a top leader of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  stated on 19 June: "It is hoped that discussions will be held  on setting a time limit (for submitting the motion)." He seems  to be concerned with the possibility that if the Social  Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ)]  carries out prolonged consultations with the ruling coalition  parties without reaching any conclusions before the current Diet  session comes to an end (on 29 June), it will become impossible  to submit the no-confidence motion, or even if it were  submitted, the LDP alone cannot have it adopted. Therefore, in  setting a time limit, the LDP intends to urge the SDPJ to make  its decision on going along with the LDP policy.</p>

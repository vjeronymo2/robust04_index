			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb--Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev has been visiting the Volga Military District, where he  thoroughly familiarized himself with the state of affairs there.  This is the first tour of its kind that he has conducted this  year. A large number of units withdrawn from Eastern Europe and  the former Soviet republics are being resettled in this  district. During his three-day visit, the Minister checked on  the combat readiness of the forces and on the progress in  building military compounds. He visited a number of defense  plants and met administration heads from the region's towns and  oblasts.    Over 270,000 servicemen have been brought back to Russia  since 1992. A large number of them are being resettled in the  Volga region. There were about 14,000 homeless officers and  warrant officers in the district at the beginning of February.  Two German-Turkish firms, Tekfen and Enka, are building military  compounds in Chernorechye, Samara Oblast, and Chaykovskiy, Penza  Oblast for units of the 2d Guards Tank Army, which is being  withdrawn from Germany.    Construction work is behind schedule, however. The contract,  worth 200 million German marks, stipulates that 1,910  apartments, complete with infrastructure, must be completed in  Chernorechye by 1 July 1994. However, the firm will not meet  this deadline. It blames inflation, the unreliability of its  Russian subcontractors, and difficult weather conditions in  Russia. Grachev was not convinced by these arguments. After  talking to the firm's manager, he received a promise that  schools and most of the officers' housing would be fully  commissioned by 1 September, and the rest of the compound would  be completed by the end of the year.    Construction of housing near the town of Chaykovskiy in Perm  Oblast is also behind schedule. Enka has failed to meet the  original deadline for commissioning of the compound--1 January  1994. The revised deadline of 1 September 1994 is also in  jeopardy. Not even half the apartments are ready yet. Basically,  the foreign firms proved to be not fully prepared for  construction work under Russian conditions.    During his visit to the Aviastar Joint-Stock Company at  Ulyanovsk, the minister noted that development of military  transport aviation is a task that must be tackled in the near  future because a large proportion of these planes remained  outside Russia after the USSR collapsed. Military experts  believe that the Russian Army needs about 100 transport planes  of the Tu-124 ("Ruslan") type-- manufactured by Aviastar--as  well as the Il-86, for rapid deployment of mobile forces in any  region.</p>

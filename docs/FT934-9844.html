			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Technology: Video with chips In the infant world of multimedia - where sound, vision, and computing data are converging to create a new branch of electronics - there are plenty of technological hurdles to be overcome before the products are relevant for most consumers. VideoLogic, a UK company, said yesterday that it had removed one by developing computer chips to speed up and enhance films in software form so their quality on a computer screen is equal to that on television. This is aimed at helping move multimedia from a niche to a mass market including small business and home users as well as big companies and organisations. 'At present,' says Trevor Wing, marketing executive of VideoLogic (owned by Avesco), 'software video can only play movies at small postage-stamp size. The demand is for full motion and full screen.' A video shot at 30 frames a second drops to only three a second when blown up to computer-screen size. The new chips, Powerplay and Powerstream - designed with IBM - can be built straight into personal computers' graphic systems to accelerate video speed. 'Publishers will introduce thousands of CD titles during the next 12 months and many of these will include software movies,' says Wing. The multimedia chips, which will be shown at next week's Comdex computer show in Las Vegas, have stimulated interest among PC makers worldwide, he adds. They will be priced low enough for manufacturers to be able to incorporate them into new PCs cheaply. Powerplay will be marketed at Dollars 25 each for batches of 1,000, though companies can negotiate lower prices for mass use. Most multimedia applications are in the training and retail areas; new ones will be in computer games, education and publishing. 'These new products really fit fairly and squarely in the everyday user category,' adds Wing. Deliveries will start at the end of January.</p>

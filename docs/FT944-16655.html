			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wescol recovers Wescol Group, the Halifax-based steel fabrication and construction company, has continued its recovery and, following a stronger second half, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 260,000 for the 12 months to July 31. The increase from last time's Pounds 30,000 was achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 18.3m, and reflected a reduced interest burden following last November's Pounds 2.9m rights issue. The directors said the company was now cash positive. Mr Peter Price, chairman, said the company was seeing 'a much closer balance of capacity and demand' and intended to enlarge the Halifax factory to provide additional production and design facilities. Current order intake showed a 'substantial' improvement over last year. Earnings per share were 1p (0.4p) and a dividend of 0.25p - the first since 1990 - is proposed. The company plans to move from the USM to the Official List 'in a few weeks'.</p>

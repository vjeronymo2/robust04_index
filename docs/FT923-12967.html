			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Nuclear in the black with Pounds 13.7m SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company that operates Scotland's two nuclear power stations, moved into the black for the first time in 1992 with a net profit of Pounds 13.7m. This compared with a loss of Pounds 32.5m in 1991 and was achieved in a year of increased output, tight cost control and lower inflation. Turnover, representing sales from the Hunterston B power station in Ayrshire and Torness in East Lothian, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 477m. Mr James Hann, chairman, said: 'So far, so good; but the company has a long way to go and many issues to be resolved before we can be satisfied with our financial performance.' Mr Hann is engaged in a long-term campaign to improve the performance of the company, which was carved out of the former South of Scotland Electricity Board in 1989, and to rehabilitate the image of nuclear power in the UK. He said the cost of SNL's electricity was beginning to compare favourably with oil and coal-generated power. Company executives make no secret of their desire to see SNL privatised. Mr Hann said: 'I do believe that we are heading towards a position where under certain circumstances the company will be privatised, but there are many issues still to be addressed.' SNL made an operating profit of Pounds 68.7m (Pounds 52.2m) but had to allow Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 75.4m) to maintain the value of its Pounds 2bn provisions for de-commissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactor stations. Operating cost per unit of electricity was 3.21p before accounting for historic liabilities. SNL does not benefit from the non-fossil fuel levy which is paid by electricity users in England and Wales. SNL supplies about 40 per cent of Scotland's electricity through its sales to Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. The load factor at Hunterston B declined from 79.1 per cent in 1990-91 to 66.4 per cent, partly because of mid-life maintenance work on one reactor. Torness's load factor rose from 38.6 per cent to 55.1 per cent because of improvements to its refuelling system. In January SNL reached agreement in principle with British Nuclear Fuels on fixed-price fuel supply and reprocessing contracts worth Pounds 2.7bn over the next 15 years. It is also applying to build dry stores for spent fuel at Torness and Hunterston B which would save Pounds 45m on fuel cycle costs, cutting 0.3p per unit from the cost of generating electricity.</p>

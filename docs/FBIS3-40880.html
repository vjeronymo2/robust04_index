			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jakarta, 7 January (Antara)--The reduction in the  export tax, intended by the government to stimulate initiative  in the business world, will not guarantee an increase in  Indonesian export volume, in the view of several commentators.    This view was expressed by Kwik Kian Gie, an economic  observer; Tadjoeddin Noersaid, a member of Committee VI of  Parliament; and Fadel Muhamad, a businessman. They were  commenting on the reduction of the export tax, as mentioned in  the speech of President Suharto on 6 January regarding "Economic  Notes" and the RAPBN [Draft State Budget] for fiscal year  1994/1995 before members of Parliament in Jakarta.    In the draft state budget (RAPBN) for fiscal year 1994/1995  which was submitted by the president to Parliament, it is  estimated that government income from the export tax will amount  to only 16.4 billion rupiahs, or 45.3 percent less than it was  in the state budget for fiscal year 1993/1994, when it amounted  to 30 billion rupiahs.    According to Kwik Kian Gie, the increase in the volume of  exports was influenced by several considerations, most of which  involved the needs of producers for infrastructure to turn out  goods.    He said: "The availability of adequate infrastructure is  more  important than a reduction in the export tax because it directly  influences industrial efficiency."    A similar view was also expressed by Fadel Muhamad. He said  that without the infrastructure needed by businessmen to hold  down production costs, it would be difficult for them to  penetrate the international market which, at the present time,  demands high competitive ability.    He declared: "If I were asked about the impact of a lower  export tax, I would say that there will be an increase in  exports, but it will be very small. The reduction in the export  tax is a small consideration among the factors required by the  business world."    Tadjoeddin, a member of Committee VI representing the  Functional Development Faction (FKP), considered that if the  reduction in the export tax is intended to increase export  volume, the government will not get the results it hopes for.    He said: "What is more directly needed by businessmen is  easing the regulations on productive activity. The reduction in  the export tax is something which will not have much of an  influence on the present situation."    Therefore, he said, if a businessman says that he would be  able to increase export volume if his need for infrastructure is  met, the government should place greater emphasis on efforts to  build such infrastructure.  <H5>  Without Protection </H5>   Both Kwik, as well as Fadel and Tadjoeddin, agreed that if  the government wants to increase export volume, which surely  will require a high level of product competitiveness, all  existing forms of protectionism should be abolished.    Kwik said: "The business world must be taught how to carry  on  its business without protection, because protection, as it has  been provided up to now in a number of industrial sectors, in  fact only makes the business world more dependent on the  government."    He added that such protection ensures that Indonesian  domestic industry never grows up and never wants to try to grow  up.    He stated: "This is a not a good sign for economic growth."    According to Tadjoeddin, although there is general agreement  on tariffs, and newly established business firms will operate  effectively for several years more, the government by now should  have anticipated developments with greater imagination,  particularly in preparing the business world "to function on its  own," rather than "to be guided" by the government.    Tadjoeddin declared: "If businessmen are able to compete  internationally, export volume will also increase automatically,  because in an indirect way, demand for Indonesian products will  also increase."  <H5>  Sukamdani </H5>   Meanwhile, Sukamdani S. Gitosarjono, chairman of the Board  of  Directors of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  (KADIN), said that the tax receipts target of 42.6 trillion  rupiahs in the state budget for fiscal year 1994/1995 is too  ambitious because at the present time a climate conducive for  stimulating an increase in taxes has not been properly created.    Sukamdani said: "This large a target can only be achieved if  the government is able to create a climate which is conducive to  business activity." He was answering questions from reporters  after attending the ceremony in Jakarta on 6 January at which  the president spoke on "Economic Notes" and the draft budget for  fiscal year 1994/1995.    According to Sukamdani, the question is not the ability or  inability of the government to reach this target, but, rather,  how the government can create conditions to encourage private  businessmen as the agents of development to provide support for  large taxes.    He said: "Previously, the government was the agent of  development, and the private sector was only a participant in  the process. However, now the government hopes that the private  sector will be able to provide 73 percent of the target of 600  trillion rupiahs to be invested during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.  This means that the private sector has a major role."    Sukamdani hoped that the government, as well as KADIN, will  serve as the engine of the business world in the effort to make  a success of planned programs.    He did not think that an increase of 9.0 trillion rupiahs in  the non-oil and gas sector, from 37,641 trillion rupiahs in  fiscal year 1993/1994 to 46,886 trillion rupiahs in fiscal year  1994/1995, is too fanciful.    He stated: "I think that this increase is appropriate  because  our manufacturing sector is sufficiently developed, and there  will always be further expansion of production. Moreover, the  quotas for developed countries have been watered down since the  negotiation of the original GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade) agreement. Now it remains to be seen how courageous  we are in taking advantage of our opportunities."    According to Sukamdani, the most important thing for  Indonesia to do is to have a sort of company called "Indonesia  Incorporated," as was once proposed by Arifin Siregar. That is,  pressure for cooperation between the government and the business  world.    He said: "Then the government will only act as policymaker  and facilitator, while the business world functions as the  economic agent or implementer."</p>

Widespread of jaundice epidemics is  due to lack of vaccination and closing of many heath centers in  villages, according to RILINDJA issue of January 9.    Epidemiologists say that water pipes of Gllogovc might have  caused the epidemic because the water system of Gllogovc is  still dirty since Serbian officials of the commune did not deem  it necessary to clean the reservoir and put chlorine to water.  Gllogovc is a commune with 100 percent Albanian population.</p>

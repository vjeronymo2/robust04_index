			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Arts: Tottering totalitarianism - Cinema TO LIVE (12) Zhang Yimou GERONIMO (12) Walter Hill THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (15)Stephan Elliott WAR OF THE BUTTONS (PG) Jon Roberts SPARROW (12)Franco Zeffirelli I once saw a stage performance of Man And Superman in which the cast was taking its final bow when a large piece of background scenery began falling on them. 'Look out]' yelled the audience. Just in time, the players turned round and caught hold of the offending flat. A similar thing is now happening in Chinese cinema. Historical backdrops are getting larger and heavier - in films like Farewell My Concubine, The Blue Kite and now Zhang Yimou's To Live - and instead of enriching the characters from a distance they tend to fall right on top of them. To Live takes place over 30-odd years of Maoist history - 1940s to 1970s - during which a poverty-racked couple (Gong Li, Ge You) lose their children, their livelihood and most of their emotional bearings in the onslaught of Great Leaps Forward and Cultural Revolutions. Having gambled away his house in the opening scene, our hero breaks with his wife, takes up puppetry, gets swept up in the war between Communists and Nationalists, then returns home to his spouse and deaf-mute daughter. Thereafter they surge more intimately across history's stage, while the movie's lessons in the evils of totalitarianism totter or topple over them like errant scenery. The finest passages, in a movie never less than epic in its ambition, are when they hold the backdrops off: when Zhang allows the particular to grapple effectively with the panoramic. It can be the shot of a sudden bayonet piercing the white placidity of the puppeteer's screen, announcing the break-out of war in 1949. Or it can be the mordantly powerful scene of the daughter's sojourn in a maternity hospital. Here the doctors have all been dismissed or jailed as 'reactionary', so the trainee nurses must cope with the girl's haemorrhaging and hysteria. Finally a starving medico is dragged in - his condemned man's placard still round his neck - and stuffed with buns while the camera swivels tragically, comically between one mortal crisis and the other. This is the Zhang of Red Sorghum and Raise The Red Lantern: a director of dark wit and merciless compassion, who knows that the absurd and the terrifying meet on the dark side of life's curvature. But To Live would have been a stronger movie if it had allowed quirky human reaction to compete more often with historical agenda. In the end we feel as much stunned as the characters by the long march of Chinese politics: though to underline that march's grim continuity Zhang himself, on the strength of To Live, is currently banned from making another film in China. Geronimo's time span is more modest: the last months of the Apache leader who for five years, with a few hundred braves, resisted capture by a few thousand US soldiers. But Walter Hill is another film-maker fighting off the backcloth of history. Overwhelmed by the burning rockscapes of Utah and the din of destiny, Jason Patric as cavalry officer Charles Gatewood, who secured Geronimo's surrender, makes a thin, inhibited hero. And Wes Studi's Indian, though chiselled of feature and sonorous of voice, often seems part of the landscape rather than the human world. The film has decided that it is filming Mythic Events, so it adopts a cathedral tone. The script by John Milius and Larry Gross is literate, even Biblical. But we keep wishing the solemn Walter Hill (of The Long Riders) had been pushed aside more often by the kinetic Walter Hill (of Driver and Streets Of Fire), so the film could build on the hints of tantalising magic that break into the historical liturgy: the black-and-white flurries of dream-flashback that haunt Geronimo, or the hypnotic, fractured twanglings of Ry Cooder's music. In the cast Gene Hackman (cavalry general) and Robert Duvall (veteran scout) steal the acting honours. Duvall especially shows that grandeur grows from the particular: that history can be more eloquent when reflected in the tiny tic of an eye or the hitch of a tired man's lip than as an unwieldy cyclorama dwarfing or drowning the dramatis personae. Terence Stamp, wigged, frocked and lipsticked, takes his career in a whole new direction in the Australian film The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert. Resembling a boot-sale Marlene Dietrich, the one-time British heart-throb plays a drag queen joining up with two others (Hugo Weaving, ex-Neighbours star Guy Pearce) on a tour through the Outback, during which their bus breaks down. At nature's mercy, what can they do but perform their numbers right there in the desert? So They punch out Abba to the Aborigines. They swap choice culture-shock epigrams. And they befriend a small town impresario (Bill Hunter), who falls for La Stamp at the expense of his Oriental performer-girlfriend, whose speciality is shooting ping-pong balls from an intimate body part. All this and eye-catching scenery too. Writer-director Stephan Elliott, who underwhelmed the Cannes Film Festival in 1993 with Frauds, made up this year by stealing the entire event with Priscilla. The film should ideally be seen late at night with a crowd of well-wined friends. But once seen, never forgotten: especially the sight of Pearce sporting a billowing silver 'train' as he mimes to 'Sempre Libera' on the bus's moving roof while sitting inside a giant stiletto heel. I have never been to Australia, but I felt that I had after this. I have been to Ireland, but I never felt I was there in War Of The Buttons. Set in the present day, this tale of two villages and their children's gang rivalry feels like a 1950s film: that era when Scotland, Wales and Ireland, on the British screen, were fantasylands of rural innocence dreamt up by jaded London. Here the writer and producer of Chariots Of Fire, Colin Welland and David Puttnam, not content with re-potting Yves Robert's original 1962 French comedy, also re-train it as a inspirational fable of detente. After much running, jumping and fighting, the two fugitive gang leaders  - we somehow know that good will sonorously triumph - end up saving each other's skins on a mountain face. Meanwhile debut director John Roberts tries to haul into competence his cast of handpicked teenage unknowns. The best of these are the pintsized camp-followers, allowed their small ration of funny faces and throwaway comedy riffs. But the seniors are a dull lot: piped towards the uplifting finale by Rachel Portman's sub-Chieftains music and never helping to clarify for us - nor do Puttnam, Welland and company - whether this film is intended as an exercise in rural charm or children's comedy or universal moral improvement. But Franco Zeffirelli's Sparrow is by some way the week's worst: another gilded tussle between temporal and spiritual love like his Brother Sun, Sister Moon. Aspiring nun Angela Bettis, on convent leave during a cholera epidemic, falls for passing hunk Jonathan Scaech. Soon 1850s Sicily is melting into gilded visual goo reminiscent of a margarine commercial. While the camera does its soft-focus transports, guest stars Dennis Quilley, Valentina Cortese and Vanessa Redgrave try to extract some sensible dialogue  -vain task - from the soft-headed script.</p>

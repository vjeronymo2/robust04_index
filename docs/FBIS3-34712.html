"The very fact of reaching an agreement is in itself  positive," he told AFP. "That shows that we got what we wanted."    The Ma'ariv newspaper headlined: "Security top brass happy,  'All our main demands have been accepted'."    The daily quoted triumphant security officials  congratulating  themselves on the pact signed by PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on Wednesday [9 February]  night.    Israel keeps control of the border and crossing points,  Jewish settlements and roads leading to them for the five-year  interim period of autonomy.    Ben Ami said Israeli and Palestinian delegations would next  week resume talks on the military, civilian and economic aspects  of autonomy, in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba and in  Paris, in a bid to seal an overall agreement to launch self-rule.    "We are now going to try to put into practice the principles  expressed and signed in Cairo. A lot of questions remain to be  answered," Ben Ami said.</p>

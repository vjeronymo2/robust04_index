			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The extent to which the project will provide the maximum impact on the concerns identified in a cost-effective manner.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (20 points) In determining the extent to which the project will provide the maximum impact on the concerns identified in a cost effective manner, HUD will consider the quality and reasonableness of the proposed activities, timeline and budget for implementation and completion of the project. HUD will consider as well the adequacy and clarity of proposed procedures to be used by the agency for monitoring the progress of the project and ensuring its timely completion. These procedures may consist of a system for checking whether or not the milestones established by the project's timeline are being met. The applicant's capability in handling financial resources (e.g., adequate financial control procedures, accounting procedures) will be taken into account as part of the assessment. This may be evidenced by the applicant's financial management of previous FHIP or other civil rights project management, a certification from cognizant auditor, and other documentation. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraphs III.(a)(2), and III.(a)(5) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The extent to which the applicant's professional and organizational experience will further the achievement of project goals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (20 points) In determining the extent to which the applicant's professional and organizational experience will further the achievement of the project's goals, HUD will consider the applicant's experience in formulating and carrying out programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory practices, including the applicant's management of past and current FHIP or other civil rights projects, the experience and qualifications of existing personnel identified for key positions, or a description of the qualifications of new staff that will be hired, including subcontractors/consultants. For organizations submitting an application under the Education and Outreach Initiative, HUD will consider both fair housing experience and experience in implementing education, outreach or public information programs. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraph III.(a)(3) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The extent to which the project utilizes other public or private resources that may be available.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (10 points). Both monetary and in-kind resources identified in the application are eligible for determining the extent to which other public or private resources are available. The resources that will be considered must be targeted specifically for the proposed project, and must be over and above the resources available to the applicant as a part of its usual, non-project operations for such expenses as salaries, equipment, supplies, and rent. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraph III.(a)(4) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Selection Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each application for funding will be evaluated competitively, and awarded points based on the Selection Criteria for Ranking Applications for Assistance identified in section I.(d)(1) of this NOFA. The final decision rests with the Assistant Secretary or designee. After eligible applications are evaluated against the factors for award and assigned a score, they will be organized by rank order. The rank ordering will be done separately for: Each Initiative; each program component (national, National Fair Housing Month, regional/local, and community-based) of the Education and Outreach Initiative; each purpose (continued development of existing organizations, and establishing new organizations) under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative, or funding cycle (one-year and two-year projects) under the Private Enforcement Initiative. Awards for each Initiative will be funded in rank order until all available funds have been obligated, or until there are no acceptable applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Cost Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department expects to fund multiple applications as a result of this NOFA. At some point, however, two or more complete and eligible applications, after evaluation against the Selection Criteria, may be considered equal in technical merit. At that point, the project's cost will become the deciding factor. Furthermore, an applicant's proposal will not be funded when costs are determined to be unrealistically low or unreasonably high.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Applicant Notification and Award Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Notification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No information will be available to applicants during the period of HUD evaluation, except for notification in writing to those applicants that are determined to be ineligible or that have technical deficiencies in their applications that may be corrected. Selectees will be announced by HUD upon completion of the evaluation process, subject to final negotiations and award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

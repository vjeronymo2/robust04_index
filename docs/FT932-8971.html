			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Fashion: It's true: you are what you wear - Lucia van der Post reflects on dressing for work - and invites FT readers to a fashion workshop DRESSING FOR work, we learned from the series of articles we have just finished in the Weekend FT, is a serious business. Whether it was an architect purveying a minimalist message, a surgeon trying to look safe with a scalpel, a government minister dressing to care, or an advertising executive trying to look creative AND responsible, everybody agreed that, whether we like it or not, how we dress conveys a powerful message. Getting it right is not always easy, particularly for those who, perfectly properly, feel that their mind is better applied to the job in hand than to the clothes in their wardrobe. Quite right. Let physicians stick to their stethoscopes, architects to their drawing-boards, lawyers to their briefs, and politicians to their boxes. But there may come a time when you might like a professional to sort out your wardrobe - just as you would call in an architect to build a new house, or an artist to paint a portrait. This kind of help is in its infancy in the UK. In the US, stores have long acknowledged that the way to prosperity is to keep the customers happy, and the way to keep customers happy is to make them feel good in the clothes they buy. The store that stops you buying purple flares or an over-busy jacket is the store you go back to. The assistant who takes time and trouble to help you put a look together is the one you learn to trust. A few of the smaller, more upmarket British boutiques have led the way. Susie Faux at Wardrobe, 3 Grosvenor Street, London W1 and 17 Chiltern Street, London W1 has long had a well-deserved reputation for helping the professional woman look both efficient and glamorous - NOT as easy as you might think. She and her staff advise on hair, make-up and accessories as well as the clothes. 'These days,' says Susie, 'my customers cannot afford to have two wardrobes so increasingly they want clothes that work in their professional and private lives. Though we are commonly perceived to be an expensive shop and you cannot dress well on nothing, the average income of our customers is between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 18,000 a year - but they believe that good clothes are an investment.' Her favourite labels are Jil Sander, Erreuno, Mani and Strenesse. I have had great success at Whistles stores, where if you are prepared to spend time and look as if your mind is made up about getting a new look you can persuade an assistant to give you some serious attention. Some of the larger stores, such as Harvey Nichols and Harrods, have full-time wardrobe advisers who will search out garments for you at no extra charge. A colleague and I asked Gabriella Di Nora of Harvey Nichols to help find something special for a chic wedding. Gabriella was sympathetic and unpushy and she tried very hard. We both thought she was extraordinarily nice but we had initially hoped for a little more flair. The lesson is that no matter how clever a wardrobe adviser is, it takes time to build up a relationship. Gabriella had never seen my colleague and it was asking the impossible for her to come up with some stunning number for a total stranger. My colleague went back a few days later and Gabriella produced a much more interesting collection, from which she eventually bought two suits: a navy-blue one by Yves St. Laurent (in the sales reduced from Pounds 750 to Pounds 300) and another by the German designer Lange with which she is extremely pleased. She will be using Gabriella again and Gabriella has even promised to look out for bargains that might suit her when sale time comes round. Andrea Galer is strictly speaking a dress-designer cum dressmaker, but she seems to become a wardrobe adviser to her clients. She started as a costume designer and when asked to provide a series of snappy clothes for the yuppies in ITV's Capital City (remember the elegant Johanna Kanska?) she realised how difficult it was to find stylish clothes at a reasonable price. She then went into the designing and manufacturing business and now provides a beautiful bespoke service for a raft of (mainly) professional men and women. Soft wool and silk or silk and linen jackets, linen dresses, hand-printed silk blouses - the clothes are lovely but not cheap. A bespoke jacket would cost about Pounds 550, an off-the-peg version (she always has a collection so that customers can see her range and style) about Pounds 400. Her customers, such as Jane Hill, a writer and art consultant, stockbroker Ruth Sack and barrister Gillian Marks, love the personal attention, the fact that the clothes really fit and that every one is different. Her shop is at 4 England's Lane, London NW3. Tel: 071-483-3242. If you want wide-ranging advice - from how to get your hair cut, what shoes to buy and which of the many designers and shops is the one for you - then Amanda Platt (who regular readers may remember 'did over' our buccaneering travel writer Nicholas Woodsworth) will give you her personal undivided attention for Pounds 225 a day. And if you think that is expensive, I would point out that that sum will ensure everything you buy will really work for you and will probably end up costing less than you would have spent on your own. Contact her at 28 Holland Park Avenue, London W11 3QU. Tel: 071-229-8109. Finally, if you are still confused (and if you are, you are not alone) and longing for help Browns, of 23-27, South Molton Street, London W1, is holding a fashion workshop on the evening of Tuesday June 8 for the first 50 Financial Times readers to apply for tickets. Joan Burstein, the inspiration behind Browns and a legendary chic figure in the retail world, feels that fashion at the moment is in a state of flux and that most of her customers are more in need of advice and help than ever before. 'Unless we are under 20, in which case there is no problem, it is difficult to find a look that is comfortable, suitable and fashionable,' she says. 'I, for instance, am wearing trousers now which I have not worn for years. The long skirt is still a debatable issue as far as I am concerned - it isn't so much the length that matters as the proportion. I find a long skirt also looks better if it is of flowing material and not stiff, and the right shoe (with a heel) is essential. 'Above all, women should feel comfortable in their clothes. Clothes should never be tight, and women should never get talked into buying something that they are not going to enjoy wearing. I wish customers would ask for help more. All my staff love to help and are trained never to push customers into unsuitable clothes - we want them to come back, which they will only do if they are happy - but on the whole the British are shy to ask. Many of our customers start with us by coming during the sales, and I wish more people knew about our Labels for Less shop across the way at number 45, where there are always bargains on offer.' Those who are accustomed to thinking of Browns as expensive (and undoubtedly some of the labels are) should know that there are also plenty of less expensive things that could do wonders for any wardrobe - Jil Sander T-shirts in masses of colours at Pounds 15 a time, fine, silky long-sleeved cotton tops in mouth-watering shades at Pounds 25, a crisp, classic white shirt for Pounds 25 and so on. She thinks the key pieces this season are a blouse with a jabot, a long sleeveless gilet and soft, widish crepe trousers (but study the proportions carefully). 'I don't say no to jackets - most working women need them - I just say NO to power jackets. It is fabrics that matter - they should be softer, more flowing, more sensuous.' The Browns/FT fashion workshop will run from 6.30pm to 8.30pm on Tuesday June 8. Tickets are Pounds 20 (the money will go to the Leukaemia Research Fund) and will also entitle the reader to a 15 per cent discount on all purchases until the end of June. Champagne and snacks will be served, a Molton Browns goodie bag will be given to every reader and for the winner of a lucky draw there will be a Pounds 250 gift voucher. Tickets will go to the first 50 readers to send their name, address and Pounds 20 cheque (made out to the Leukaemia Research Fund) to me here at the Financial Times, No. 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 (mark the envelope Browns/FT Fashion Workshop).</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIAN FIGHTS EXTRADITION; FEARS HE'LL BE SACRIFICED  </P> <P> Eddie Hatcher, a Tuscarora Indian fighting extradition to North Carolina where  he is wanted for holding a newspaper staff hostage, said from his jail cell  Thursday that he hopes California will not "throw me to the wolves."  </P> <P> Hatcher, 31, lodged in the San Francisco City Jail, held a telephone news  conference to announce the launching of a petition drive appealing to Gov.  George Deukmejian to refuse extradition. The news conference was staged by the  International Indian Treaty Council  </P> <P> "I would ask that the justice system here not throw me to the wolves," Hatcher  said.  </P> <P> He said his attempts to expose alleged corruption in North Carolina endangered  his life and his mother's safety in the past to the extent that they both took  to wearing bullet-proof vests. He said he would be in danger if forced to  return.  </P> <P> "I know what can happen. I've seen it happen, and that's my main worry,"  Hatcher told the news conference.  </P> <P> Hatcher stormed into The Robeson newspaper in Lumberton, N.C., Feb. 1, 1988,  and seized 17 hostages at gunpoint, including editor Robert Horne. He said he  committed the desperate act out of fear for his life after making allegations  of local political corruption, including racism and law enforcement turning a  blind eye to drug-trafficking in the rural county situated on Interstate 95,  midway between Miami and New York.  </P> <P> All of the hostages at the newspaper were released unharmed. But after Hatcher  was acquitted of the federal charges, the state of North Carolina filed  kidnaping charges against him and co-defendant Timothy Jacobs, 19, who is  awaiting trial.  </P> <P> Hatcher hid on an Idaho Indian reservation before surfacing in San Francisco on  March 10 at the Soviet Consulate, where FBI agents arrested him as a fugitive.  </P></p>

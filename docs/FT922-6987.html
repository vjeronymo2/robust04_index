			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Europe's new muddle army: Plans for military co-operation will have to disentangle overlapping forces and command structures It did not look such a great idea. Putting together a Franco-German brigade of 4,200 soldiers took three years' preparation. When it was inaugurated near Stuttgart in 1990, senior French officers admitted it would take somewhat longer before anyone would consider sending the brigade into combat. Two French regiments, two German battalions; one kind of beret but different codes of discipline, pay structures, radio systems, ammunition. Headquarters staff spoke French to each other one day, German the next, occasionally resorting to English. Le Monde dubbed it the unite-gadget, the gimmick unit. The French army seemed happy to keep it small. Yet the apparently fanciful experiment has become the embryo of a grand project. At their summit starting today in La Rochelle, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl are set to agree the blueprint for a joint corps, starting at about 35,000 men, ready in three years and intended as the nucleus of a future European army. For now, it is the nucleus of a disorderly tangle involving Europeans and Americans in intense diplomatic exchanges on the nature of European defence initiatives and their impact on Nato. The arguments are not about the principle of joint forces, but how they should be organised and who they should take orders from. They are not yet about what these forces might actually do in crises like Yugoslavia's. Ideas for new military combinations have been taking shape for about two and a half years. They arise from two distinct perspectives - Nato restructuring and development of the European Community. For Nato, multinational groupings were the best way it could keep a cohesive military structure after losing the enemy that for 40 years provided its reason for being. Almost all its members were cutting defences. Combined formations could rationalise these forces and make the continued presence of foreign troops in Germany more acceptable to the Germans. At the same time, the US was contemplating progressively bigger reductions in its troop levels in Europe - currently being halved to 150,000, with further withdrawals widely expected. By common accord, Europe had to take more responsibility for its own defence. Since relatively small forces were now required to be ready at short notice, it was logical that these should essentially come from the Europeans. Other notions of joint European defence - maybe, one day - on a more grandiose scale, were meanwhile appearing on the EC's horizon in the build-up to last December's Maastricht summit, coinciding with Nato's strategy review. Convergence was always going to be difficult, however. The EC had always left defence to Nato. There was a defence body straddling the two, the Western European Union (WEU), consisting of nine members of both the EC and the alliance, but it enjoyed no public profile, had been dormant for much of its existence, and had no troops. Nato, always busy trying to patch over its internal strains, was meanwhile searching for a new purpose, and Washington was going to be edgy about any attempt to rock the boat. And then, as always, there was the complicating factor of France. It is where Nato used to have its headquarters, has five other Nato allies on its borders, but for 25 years has had no part in the allied military hierarchy or in its joint military planning. It is now the nation most eager to carry the flag for Euro-defence. Nato got in first. A year ago, Britain leapt at the suggestion by General John Galvin, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur), that it should head a new rapid reaction corps of at least four divisions: 70,000 men. It would be a Nato force, but could also provide units for a European reaction force; commanders would just swap their Nato hat for a WEU hat. Under the WEU's wing, the forces could be sent outside the Nato area - something on which Nato has never reached a consensus. France saw the plan as a crude bid to pre-empt its own efforts to create a European defence structure that would be something more than a by-product of Nato. The Germans participated in the plan, but thought they had been stampeded by the British. When France and Germany came out with their own plan for a joint corps in October, the reaction from Washington and London was even sourer. Some other European allies shared their concern that it could undermine the alliance, in particular loosening the cement which since the 1950s had kept Germany at the heart of Nato. The UK, anxious not to alienate the US, contests the logic that Nato's role should decline proportionately as Europe's defence role increases. Some other EC partners are also cautious about the Franco-German plan, including the Dutch and Portuguese. But, one senior British diplomat says, for most European countries 'it is very difficult to tell the French to get lost'. Behind the careful compromises worked out at Nato's Rome summit in November ('the development of a European security and defence role . . . the enhancement of the role and responsibility of the European members') and the tantalisingly hedged ambitions endorsed by EC leaders at Maastricht in December ('the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to common defence') lie two fundamentally different approaches. For the French, it is prudent for Europe to make preparations independently of the US. From a British viewpoint, that is the kind of attitude that will make the US leave. Nato has constantly reiterated the need for a continued 'North American presence' in Europe. Canada, which up to now has shared this transatlantic function with the US, dealt allies a nasty surprise in February by saying it would pull its small remaining force out altogether. Keeping US forces, even at much reduced levels, is seen as providing the crucial linkage to Nato's ultimate defence guarantee, the US nuclear 'umbrella'. US involvement in Nato also stands as a more general emblem of transatlantic co-operation. Gen Galvin describes his post as 'America's seat at the table in Europe'. Sensitivity to this US view has led Nato allies to shelve the idea of appointing a European Saceur for the first time. Instead, Gen Galvin will hand over next month to another US army officer, Gen John Shalikashvili. As part of the military overhaul, the number of Nato commands is being been reduced, but Americans hold on to the two top posts - the supreme commands for Europe and the Atlantic - and to the southern Europe command in Naples. The paradoxical result is that, while Nato is being redesigned to take on a more European complexion, the US has a bigger share of the top military jobs. Britain opposes setting up any parallel European command structure - confusing, it says, and a waste of money. The WEU is, however, to have a contingency planning staff of 40. The WEU is being brought into service because it is there. The body once had an incipient military organisation but handed it over when Nato was formed. It embodies a firmer commitment than Nato's for allies to come to each other's aid. But its own military involvement has not gone beyond co-ordinating some Gulf naval operations. Britain wants it to be balanced halfway between Nato and the EC. But the language of Maastricht ties it more closely to the Community, as 'an integral part of the development of the European Union' and the executor of EC decisions that have defence implications. The WEU is set to co-ordinate closely with the Community, moving its secretariat from London to Brussels and opening its membership to other EC states. European Nato allies outside the Community may only join as associates. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, last week spelt out initial proposals for forces that might be made available to the WEU. How big they were would be up the WEU, but there would be no standing forces and the organisation would draw on existing headquarters. He accepted that the Franco-German corps could be well suited for the task but only as one of a number of available units. France is lobbying hard to persuade other WEU members to give the corps more substance by joining. But there are few immediate candidates. Belgium is the most likely - the reason for a lightning visit there by Mr Rifkind on Tuesday - but appears still to be hesitating. Britain says clearly it will not join, but would contribute other forces for the WEU. These could include the existing UK-Netherlands amphibious force and the air-mobile division which Britain, Germany, Holland and Belgium are jointly forming as part of Nato's rapid reaction corps. But Nato would have first call on the troops. Mr Rifkind allowed that the WEU might be called on to act within Europe, but only when Nato chose not be engaged. It was 'hard to conceive of significant combat operations in Europe where Nato would not be involved'. The Germans, alert to the worries of the US and other allies, have given firm assurances that their own troops will remain assigned to Nato. The French foresee arrangements under which the whole corps could be placed under Saceur's wartime operational control. This is clearly distinct from assigning French troops automatically to Nato. But the Germans say the corps promises to associate France more closely with Nato's military partners, to Nato's benefit. The Bonn authorities meanwhile appear to see the corps as a possible way of easing the constraints on German military involvement abroad, something that the constitution is usually read as precluding. Still unclear are the corps' relationship to the WEU - the US fears it may create yet a third layer of military control - and its geographical scope. 'It seems odd,' admits Mr Willem van Eekelen, the WEU secretary-general, 'to argue to the French and Germans to make these forces available for everything except defence of their territory'. WEU foreign and defence ministers are expected to approve outline plans for putting troops at the organisation's disposal when they meet in Bonn on June 19. But it will all take time to clarify, and even then it will be an agreement on means rather than ultimate aims. Through the conceptual wrangling, the diplomatic niceties and the recondite arguments can be glimpsed a familiar spectacle of the old European military powers jockeying for influence.</p>

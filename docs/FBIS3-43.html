			<p>SUMMARY                                          The Japanese Government appears to be interpreting portions of  the 12 March agreement to expand Motorola's access to the  Japanese cellular phone market in ways that differ significantly  from the reported U.S. reading of the accord.  Tokyo's divergent  interpretation may reflect an attempt to keep the agreement from  serving as a precedent for Tokyo's acceptance of targets for  measuring its trade performance in other sectors.                                       END SUMMARY     In comments to the Japanese press, a number of Japanese  Government officials have taken issue with reported statements by  various U.S. officials on the 12 March cellular telephone  agreement.  These differences with U.S. officials'  interpretations focus on language that commits the Japanese  Government to ensuring that the Japanese telecommunications  company Nippon Idou Tsushin (IDO) carries out its pledges to  increase market access for the U.S. firm Motorola.     -- According to the 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, when the  agreement was announced on 12 March, Vice Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki specifically denied that the  Japanese Government had accepted any sort of numerical targets.     --  The 14 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun also reported that Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) General Affairs Councillor  Masahito Tani on 13 March took issue with comments reportedly  made by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that the  agreement represented a victory for the U.S. Government's  results-oriented policy in dealing with U.S.-Japan trade issues.  Tani reportedly said that in the Japanese Government's view,  IDO's commitment to increase the number of base stations capable  of handling Motorola equipment was "neither a numerical target  nor an objective criterion.  It is nothing but a private  corporation's contract."     -- According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Vice Minister  of Foreign Affairs Kunihiko Saito attempted to play down a clause  in the agreement between the U.S. and Japanese Governments which  states that Tokyo will use "all available measures" to ensure  that IDO fulfills the agreement.  The paper quoted Saito as  stating that "All this means is something like conducting regular  checks on the degree of progress being made in dealings between  the private companies."  Saito also reportedly told Kyodo on 14  March that the Japanese Government was in no position to  intervene in the affairs of private companies and asserted that  any difference in the U.S. and Japanese interpretation of the  agreement was because of Washington's misunderstanding of the  accord.     -- Similarly, Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications  Futoshi Shirai, in comments to Kyodo on 14 March, took issue with  reported remarks by U.S. officials, stating that the Japanese  Government had in no way agreed to guarantee that IDO would meet  the target of building 159 base stations using Motorola  technology as stipulated in the cellular phone agreement.     -- An unidentified senior Ministry of International Trade and  Industry MITI) official reportedly told Kyodo on 15 March that  the Japanese Government had provided no guarantee that IDO would  fulfill its commitments.     Concern Over Precedent     One of the major reasons for the Japanese Government's efforts to  limit the way in which the cellular phone agreement is  interpreted appears to be a concern that the United States will  attempt to use the agreement as a model for setting numerical  targets for market opening measures in other sectors.  A 15 March  Kyodo report quoted an unidentified senior MITI official as  stating that Japan could not accept any interpretation of the  agreement that would lead to the setting of numerical targets.  According to the 15 March Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI is  particularly worried that the United States might try to use the  model of the cellular telephone agreement in the auto sector,  asking Japanese Government to provide guarantees for voluntary  targets for imports of U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts that  Japanese automobile companies are reportedly currently drawing  up.  In a 16 March speech, MITI Vice Minister for International  Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu reportedly specifically stated that the  cellular telephone agreement could not be applied to the  automobile sector.  According to a 16 March Kyodo report,  Okamatsu stated that while the telecommunications sector was  regulated by government licenses, the auto and auto parts  industries were "completely free trade areas" which could not be  controlled by the government.     The cancellation of a planned visit to Washington by Ichiro  Ozawa, Secretary General of one of the key parties in the ruling  coalition and the Japanese politician widely reported to have  been instrumental in framing the cellular phone accord may also  reflect the Japanese Government's desire to limit the impact of  the cellular phone agreement.  The 16 March Yomiuri Shimbun  quoted senior members of Ozawa's party and other Japanese  officials as stating that the United States pinned too high hopes  on Ozawa, expecting that he would come to Washington with "a bag  packed with a lot of gifts."     Outlook     Japanese officials will probably do everything possible to keep  the cellular telephone pact from serving as a precedent for the  setting of numerical targets in other sectors.  The difference in  interpretation with the United States, however, has the potential  to create further friction in bilateral relations.  In the past,  Tokyo has differed with the United States over the wording of  such agreements as the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement  and the agreement setting up the U.S.-Japan framework talks  reached by former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President  Clinton in July, 1993.  In the semiconductor agreement, Tokyo has  consistently argued that the United States has misinterpreted a  pledge that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor  market would reach 20 percent by the fourth quarter of 1992 as a  formal commitment, when the Japanese government intended it only  as a goal.  Similarly, in the framework agreement, the Japanese  government has consistently disagreed with the United States over  how to define the "objective criteria" which the agreement stated  would be established to measure Japan's trade performance.

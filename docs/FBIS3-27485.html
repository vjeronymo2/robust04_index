			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P.N. Kandinsky] </F>   [Text] Professor Li of the Shanghai Academy of Social  Sciences wasn't impressed when a Communist Party newspaper  invited him to write an article on the "socialist market  economy" in late 1992.    "Those people have gone on preaching about their kind of  socialism for the last three years," he said. "Who knew what  they really wanted?" Li didn't write anything for it, but he  continued to publish articles about his market theories in other  media. "Publications on the lower levels of the official  hierarchy have a better reputation," he said. "Intellectuals of  my generation no longer have any hope of working with this  regime."    But the newspaper kept asking him, most recently late last  year, shortly after the party's central committee held its  annual plenary session which adopted a decision to embrace more  economic reforms. "I finally agreed, thinking this time it might  be different," he said. "But once again, I was being stupid."    The editor of the newspaper called Li not long after the  article had been submitted. "I'm sorry, but we can't use your  piece," he said. "Why?" Li asked. The editor explained:  "Didn't you recently write an article for a Hong Kong  newspaper? According to the responsible authorities, you did  and that article raised some problematic points."    And so, the professor's article was killed. "Every time the  government fails, it is because it has refused to listen to its  best critics," Li said.    China's best-trained economists, including those in the  government think-tanks, are predicting the regime's single  minded pursuit of high growth will have disastrous consequences,  according to Li. But Chinese leaders have yet to mend their  relations with the intellectuals, which were rent asunder after  the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.    The party's "policy on intellectuals" is still one of deep  distrust. Soon after Tiananmen, the regime convened a series of  meetings to "sum up the experience" of how the party had won  that "historical victory." The central issue was explaining the  spread of "bourgeois liberalism" which had almost toppled the  communist regime. Their conclusion: It was still necessary to  continue the class struggle in the Stalinist and Maoist sense.  Class analysis, not economic development, should remain the  "lifeline of the party".    The class enemy, the party ideologues declared, was the  middle class represented by troublemakers among the  intellectuals. Their theory, according to Li, is that  intellectuals know how much more their counterparts in the West  are paid. Their resentment has corrupted them into refusing to  work for the party and attacking the proletarian state.    "Examine the speeches and articles by people like Deng  Liqun--the party's leading hardline ideologue--or Wang Renzhi,  who was director of the party's propaganda department after the  1989 crackdown," said Li. "From their speeches, you can see  clearly that the middle class is the enemy and intellectuals are  its representatives."    There were open clashes between party bosses and  intellectuals at the meetings to sum up the lessons of 1989, he  said. At one session, he recalled, Wu Jinglian--one of China's  leading economists--challenged the party speaker by saying that  no government could hold itself up without support from  intellectuals, nor could society become stable without a large,  middle income population. "Of course, they rejected this kind  of criticism," he said. "They don't believe that a middle class  is necessary to sustain stability. They think because they have  the Army their guns and tanks will be enough for them to rule  China forever."    Since the mid-1980s, economists have been strenuously  advocating many of the reform ideas which the regime is now  tentatively considering. The proposal for a genuinely  independent central bank, for instance, was rejected by the  Premier, Li Peng, many times. At one State Council meeting in  1991, Li became furious when banking reform was mentioned. "The  People's Bank [China's nominal central bank] is nearly the last  bit of power that I have left," Li yelled at the proponent. "If  you want to rob me of this too, why don't you just proclaim  yourself premier?" It may not be coincidental that the new  banking reforms were only approved while Li was on sick leave  after a heart attack last year.    "I no longer care whether they use my ideas or not," a  professor at Beijing University said. "These are the same ideas  we put forward back in the mid-1980s and which they condemned as  "bourgeois liberalism"--if they don't use my ideas, they  themselves will pay the price."    Relations between the regime and intellectuals were  different, he said, from the time "when we were enthusiastic  about the reform and optimistic about its success. Now, it is  more like a business relationship: You place an order, and I'll  deliver the goods--if I feel like it."    There were several thousand Chinese graduate students with  economics majors in Western countries. But the regime had never  listened to their opinions, he said. "This is a terrible waste  of human resources at a time when China is faced by all sorts of  dangers."    As one cultural critic said: "China fall apart. But if it  reaches that point, it will be because of the regime's policy  blunders. The worst mistake is to label those whose help is  most needed as the enemy."</p>

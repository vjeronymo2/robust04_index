			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REGGIE JACKSON, PARTNER, SEEK PHOENIX TEAM  </P> <P> Former baseball star Reggie Jackson and his former agent Gary Walker are  attempting to assemble a group of local and out-of-state investors to become  part of Phoenix's effort to get a major-league baseball expansion franchise.  </P> <P> Walker, currently a partner with Jackson in United Development Co. Inc. of  Tempe and a real-estate syndicator, has met with local sports officials and  potential investors over the past week in a last-ditch attempt to keep the  Phoenix area in the competition for one of two National League expansion teams  that will be awarded next year.  </P> <P> The effort looked like a long shot amid the controversy surrounding the Martin  Luther King Jr. holiday issue and after Martin Stone, owner of the minor-league  Phoenix Firebirds, began to pursue efforts to be part of a group trying to buy  the Montreal Expos,  </P> <P> Walker said that he regards the Phoenix effort as a long shot and that he and  Jackson are also doing long-range planning to acquire an existing franchise.  </P> <P> Walker said he also plans to discuss the prospects of buying the Firebirds from  Stone to lay the long-range groundwork for a future major-league acquisition.  </P> <P> Walker would not identify potential investors in a baseball team but said most  of them are or will be from Arizona.  </P> <P> He said Jackson would be an investor in the group and perhaps the team's  general manager.  </P> <P> The group would be under a tight deadline to raise the $95-million franchise  fee. The National League also has said it will announce its "short list" of  sites by the end of the year.  </P></p>

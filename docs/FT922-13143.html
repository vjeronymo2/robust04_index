			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: Analysing Germany's problems Sir, You quite rightly drew attention in your editorial on 10 April ('A deepening German crisis') to the difficulties the German government has in responding quickly and effectively to rapidly changing economic circumstances - to the disadvantage of Germany's partners in the EC. This slow response is an inevitable result of the coalition government which has meant that, in a number of respects, Germany has failed to deal with long standing issues. For example, with little privatisation in the former West Germany, the German tax payer continues to pour huge sums of money into hopelessly inefficient coal mines (to enable them to provide unfair competition with efficient British mines). Your editorial analysis of Germany's paralysed political system failed to identify one of the reasons for it - Chancellor Kohl's having to depend upon the support of the Free Democrats in coalition. l know that your newspaper has a strong predilection for proportional representation, but doesn't your own editorial on April 10 undermine the case for it?

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Norway attacked over whaling NORWAY was condemned from both sides of the Commons yesterday for announcing its intention to resume commercial whaling while seeking membership of the European Community, which bans the practice. Urging the Norwegian government to reconsider its position, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, stressed that if the membership application succeeded the rules of the EC would have to be accepted. Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, protested: 'Surely it cannot be right for a country to seek to join the EC if it intends to flout one of its regulations?' But Mr Gummer agreed with Mr John Bowis (C Battersea) that, far from having the whaling issue used as a barrier, Norway should be encouraged to become a member of the EC so that its regulations could be strictly enforced.</p>

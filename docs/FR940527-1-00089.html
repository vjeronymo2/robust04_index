			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One concern that we have about the use of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio as a measure is that it may be possible for hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to manipulate cost report statistics to meet a current ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold. Some analysis suggests that the current ratio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be supplemented by measures such as days in accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receivable and/or days in accounts payable in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the prospects for manipulation. We will continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study this issue before publication of a final rule on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special exceptions provision. We welcome comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the current ratio as a measure of hospital financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerability, on the appropriate threshold under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure, and on whether the current ratio should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemented by other measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An eligible hospital must pass an age of asset test in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to qualify for an exception. Hospitals almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universally have plant and equipment of varying ages. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average age of a hospital's assets is commonly determined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ratio of accumulated depreciation to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation expense. The current version of the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost report (HCFA 2552&hyph;92) allows for determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average age of assets for all hospital assets, for building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fixed equipment alone, or for moveable equipment alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average age of buildings and fixed equipment can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined on the basis of information on the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare cost report (HCFA 2552&hyph;92, Worksheet G, Lines 14,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14.01, 16, 16.01, 18, 18.01, 20, and 20.01, and Worksheet A&hyph;7, Part III, Column 9, Lines 1 and 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose a two-part age of asset test to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aging hospitals that undertake needed major capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement or renovation projects during the transition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test would only consider changes in the average age of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building and fixed equipment (determined by the ratio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulated depreciation for building and fixed equipment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current depreciation for building and fixed equipment) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to focus on major capital replacement and renovation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects. We believe that it is appropriate to grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions only to aging hospitals that undertake and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete major capital projects during the capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment transition period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first part of the age-of-asset test is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether a hospital had relatively aged fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets at the beginning of the capital transition period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, the hospital's first cost reporting period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning on or after October 1, 1991). We would determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital's average age of building and fixed equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using cost report data for the first year of the transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in comparison to the national average age of buildings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed equipment for that year. The threshold for qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this part of the test would be the 75th percentile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that the special protection we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing under this provision should be extended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals who cannot demonstrate an urgent need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement or renovation of facilities. We believe that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average age of assets at or above the 75th percentile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally is a sufficient indicator that a hospital had a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressing need for renovation or replacement at the beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the capital transition period to serve as a threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifier for a special exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would determine whether a hospital is at or above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 75th percentile nationally on the basis of Medicare cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report data for FY 1992. That data is becoming available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this year. Preliminary but incomplete data suggest that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average age of buildings and fixed equipment at the 75th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentile is approximately 16.4 years. We intend to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final determination on the basis of more complete data that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will become available at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second part of the test would compare the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age of buildings and fixed equipment in the cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period beginning in FY 1992 with the average age of fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets in the year the hospital reports the completion of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major capital replacement or renovation. A major renovation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or replacement of hospital capital during the transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period should result in a dramatically reduced average age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of buildings and fixed equipment compared to the first year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the transition. We are therefore proposing that the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be whether a hospital's average age of buildings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed equipment has declined by at least 50 percent since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first year of payment under the capital prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system. Thus, a hospital whose average age of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> buildings and fixed equipment is at or above the 75th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentile nationally in the first year of capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment, and whose average age of buildings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed equipment has declined by at least 50 percent in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated year later in the transition, meets the age-of-assets test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We welcome comment on the use of an average age of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asset measure, on the age-of-assets test as we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conceived it, and on the appropriate threshold levels to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply under such a test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Ewart gets go-ahead for Laganbank project SOME Pounds 20m in government finance for the Laganbank property development project in Belfast was approved yesterday, giving the go-ahead to Ewart, the project's lead developer, to begin contracting for an estimated Pounds 110m in construction work. Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director of the Belfast-based company said: 'This is excellent news for Ewart . . . the government has quite rightly recognised the importance of this huge capital investment to the long term future of the Northern Ireland economy.' The development is the centrepiece of the government's Laganside development plan and will include a new concert hall to be financed by the Belfast City Council, a 200-bedroom hotel, 400,000 sq ft of office space as well as retail space and car parking. The complex will be located near the Belfast City Hall. Last month, Monarch Properties, the private property developer based in Dublin, sold its 29.2 per stake in Ewart for 80p per share, having failed in its attempt to take control of the board.</p>

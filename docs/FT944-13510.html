			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Observer: Ritzy Heartened by the prompt response to yesterday's query about when is a quango not a quango - a six-page briefing paper from the Cabinet Office had arrived before morning coffee - Observer is now seeking an official definition of sleaze. According to Cassell's Concise English dictionary, it is anything which is squalid, distasteful or disreputable. Since this could apply to the behaviour of most MPs, let alone members of the Tory government, Observer is looking for something more specific. What does the word stand for? One reader has suggested that it is short for 'stay literally everywhere at zero expense'. The best contribution will win a bottle of malt and be passed on to the Cabinet Office. Who knows, it might even find its way into another briefing paper.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshinori Nakai] </F>   [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 21 Jun -- On 20 June, Colombian  President-elect Ernesto Samper and Vice President-elect Humberto  de la Calle held their first news conference for the foreign  press, including MAINICHI SHINBUN. Touching on economic  relations, the president-elect said: "Colombia will give top  priority to our relations with Japan, and we want Japan to know  more about our country."    Concerning the current lack of interest among Japanese  companies toward investing in Colombia due to apprehensions over  security problems such as terrorism and abduction, both of them  pointed out: "Other foreign investors share the same anxieties.  Since measures have been taken to ensure security, however,  such activities are no obstacle to investment." They also said:  "We hope the Japanese people will try to learn more about  Colombia. We are sure that measures can be taken to solve the  security problem."</p>

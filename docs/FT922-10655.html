			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: CS Holding CS Holding is obviously more optimistic about the prospects for Swiss banks than the Zurich stock market. Its decision to defer flotation of 20 per cent of Credit Suisse reflects not just the fact that the move is no longer necessary to satisfy the country's strict capital requirements. Having recently brought Mexican banks to the market at 3.5 times net asset value, it is also reluctant to part with its own assets at less than book. In fact, the outlook for the larger Swiss banks is not as bad as is suggested by a weak domestic economy, high interest rates and a depressed property market. The worst knocks have been taken by regional banks. Because the domestic rules require capital backing which is high by international standards, the larger banks have capacity to pick up high margin international busi-ness as Japanese banks withdraw. Perhaps yesterday's slight drop in CS Holding's share price was a mark of investor disappointment that it is not going to return Credit Suisse to them on the cheap. Some may also be disappointed that part of the dividend is again to be paid in equity warrants as a means of stocking up further capital. They might take some consolation, however, from the speed with which CS First Boston has bounced back from its 1990 losses, as well as from strong performance from the derivatives business. That said, it would be dangerous to be beguiled by a 12.4 per cent return on shareholders' equity. It looks high compared with the likes of UBS and Swiss Bank Corporation. But compared to them, CS Holding's equity base is still relatively low.</p>

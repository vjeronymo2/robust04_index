			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Combative Tory growler strains at the election leash - Campaign Profile THE Conservatives have dubbed him the 'rottweiler' of their general election campaign. The label is consciously ambiguous: a tribute to the raw aggression he directs against the Labour party, but a less flattering judgment also on his pugnacious temperament. Mr David Mellor has been much in evidence on our television screens in recent weeks, frightening voters with dire warnings of Mr Neil Kinnock's tax plans. His weekend comment that the Labour leader had been 'craven and cringing' towards the former Soviet Union provided a flavour of the combative style. We will see more of him as the campaign unfolds. He is a close friend of Mr John Major and is guaranteed promotion from his present post as chief secretary to the Treasury if the Conservatives win the election. It is a curious friendship. Mr Mellor's abrasive self-confidence is the antithesis of the prime minister's careful courtesy. Among others at Westminster, he is not widely liked. He is bright, politically astute and effective in the brawls that pass these days for parliamentary debates. His political instincts are those of his master - dry on economics, wet on social policy. Like the prime minister he is a keen supporter of Chelsea football club. Unlike Mr Major, he is fond of eating in very expensive restaurants. He is a gutsy politician, whose career so far has marked him out as a man who combines vaunting ambition with a reckless confidence in his own judgment. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, suspicious of his politics and irritated by his imperious manner, froze him out of her cabinet. Her demise in November 1990 provided his opportunity. He was a key figure in Mr Major's campaign, lunching alone with the new prime minister on his first day in No 10. No one would describe him as one of politics' humbler souls. He can be as publicly arrogant as he can be privately insecure. He is as rude to officials as he is polite to a carefully cultivated coterie of journalists. He has a keen sense of humour but finds it harder than most to laugh at himself. The Treasury establishment has a superiority complex, convinced that, with occasional exceptions, mere politicians are not up to running the economy. Mr Mellor, though, is a cherished target. Asked for an instant judgment, one mandarin replied bluntly: 'Nigel Lawson without the intellect.' That assessment of the 42-year-old MP for Putney is not entirely fair. He is a clever man and a talented politician. Friends find his natural disrespect for authority endearing. But he cannot be surprised if a careless indifference towards those who work for him and an ostentatious enjoyment of the trappings of ministerial office do not attract wider admiration. As one Treasury insider comments: 'I have never once heard him say 'thank you''. A colleague who clashed with Mr Mellor during last year's public-spending negotiations is more diplomatic: 'He was good, very sharp and in command of the arguments. But he was deliberately confrontational. We wasted a lot of time'. There were many such clashes. Mr Douglas Hurd is temperamentally as mild as Mr Mellor is abrasive. But the foreign secretary was incensed by the chief secretary's less than courteous negotiating style. Mr William Waldegrave had a rougher time, storming out of one argument over his health budget. Nor has Mr Mellor won friends among Tory grandees. At a smart Belgravia dinner last autumn, one of these Knights of the Shires startled the assembled company into silence by voicing the hope that his party lost the election. With delicious sarcasm, he explained: 'I want to see David Mellor using the bus'. Mr Mellor started in politics early. The son of a Wareham schoolmaster, he was chairman of South Dorset young Conservatives at the age of 15. An education at Cambridge and a spell at the Bar were interludes in a determined ascent on the political escalator. Within months of entering parliament in 1979 he was making friends among journalists and deploying the political invective which has led Mr Major to put him at the forefront of the Tory assault on Labour's tax plans. By 1981 he was a junior minister at the department of energy. Subsequent spells as a middle-ranking minister at the foreign office, the health department, the home office (twice) and arts exposed his talents and his flaws. Millions of television viewers saw a blistering confrontation with an Israeli army officer over the treatment of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied Gaza. It was an incident, a colleague says, that encapsulated neatly: 'his personal guts and his love of the television lights'. The brashness disguises a willingness to strike the deals essential in politics. Skilful handling of the broadcasting bill won praise from political opponents as well as colleagues, as he persuaded Mrs Thatcher that quality as well as cash had a part to play in commercial television. At the health department he fought alongside Mr Kenneth Clarke in a string of battles with the medical professions. Others might have ducked below the parapet. So he has his admirers; and his unpopularity cannot be divorced from Tory snobbery. Mr Mellor is a pushy grammar school boy in a party that does not wholly share its leader's vision of a classless society. A sympathetic cabinet colleague attributes the criticisms from civil servants to the instinctive irritation of a public school establishment with ministers who dare to set their own agenda. He is not naturally telegenic. A chubby, gap-toothed grin and early 1970s hairstyle are not the first choice of the image makers. He compensates with aggression and ready wit. He intends to convince the voters that 'Dogs bark, cats miaow and Labour puts up taxes.' As long as he is coining phrases like that, there will be plaudits to balance the brickbats. But Mr Mellor should be careful not to stumble. Few colleagues will offer a hand to pull him to his feet.</p>

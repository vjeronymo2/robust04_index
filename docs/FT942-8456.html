			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sieve keeps movie films safer The 'vinegar syndrome' is the curse of film archivists, but Kodak has developed the Molecular Sieve to combat the deterioration of valuable motion films in storage through moisture, temperature, acids and vapours from the air. The molecular sieve consists of a small sachet of zeolite, a mineral, that absorbs moisture and chemicals. Kodak says its inclusion with processed film in a plastic bag will extend the life of the dye images and the cellulose triacetate film support. Kodak: UK, 0442 61122</p>

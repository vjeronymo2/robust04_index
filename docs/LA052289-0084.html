			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HANDICAPPED MAN VANISHES AT DISNEYLAND, IS FOUND SAFE  </P> <P> A mentally handicapped man who disappeared on a weekend visit to Disneyland was  found unharmed Sunday, walking along a street on Balboa Island, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Alfonso Navaretti, 52, of Santa Maria was last seen about 5 p.m. Saturday  entering a restroom next to the Alice in Wonderland attraction in Fantasyland,  Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard said. Navaretti was visiting the amusement park  with a tour group of about 30 other mentally handicapped people from Santa  Maria, which is north of Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> An all-night search of the theme park and surrounding neighborhoods by  Disneyland security and Anaheim police failed to turn up Navaretti or any clues  as to his whereabouts, Howard said.  </P> <P> "We had been told that he liked to walk, so we expanded our search to include  some of the areas around the park, thinking that he may have left the park on  his own" Howard said. "But we came up empty."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Description Circulated  </P> <P> Navaretti's description was sent to other law enforcement agencies in the  county.  </P> <P> About 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Newport Beach patrol officers spotted the middle-aged  man calmly walking in the 500 block of Balboa Boulevard. He was taken to the  Newport Beach Police Station, where Anaheim officers picked up him.  </P> <P> He was reunited with his group, a Santa Barbara-based organization called New  Directions, which puts together tours for the handicapped, and they returned to  Santa Maria on Sunday afternoon, police said.  </P> <P> Because Navaretti has the mental capacity of a child and can only respond to  simple questions with yes or no answers, Howard said, investigators were unable  to determine how Navaretti got from Anaheim to Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "There was just no way to interview him," Howard said. "The important thing was  he was not hurt and seemed in good spirits."  </P></p>

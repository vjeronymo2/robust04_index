			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FOR 2 GOVERNORS, NO ORDINARY OATHS  </P> <P> Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin became the first woman governor to serve three  terms when she took office Thursday, and a former governor in New Hampshire  collapsed during inaugural activities and was hospitalized.  </P> <P> In Concord, N. H., former Gov. John King was reported in guarded condition  after collapsing during the inauguration of Republican Gov. Judd Gregg.  </P> <P> About an hour after Gregg's inaugural speech, King "slumped to one side" in a  chair, said Mert Mann, an aide to Rep. Chuck Douglas. King, 72, was given  oxygen as he was taken from the Statehouse on a stretcher.  </P> <P> King was governor from 1963 to 1969 and chief justice of the state Supreme  Court from 1981 to 1986.  </P> <P> In Vermont, Kunin asked state residents to think globally to help quell the  threats of nuclear war and environmental destruction.  </P> <P> "Increasingly we find Vermont's triumphs and Vermont's problems linked with  those of people around the globe," Kunin said.  </P></p>

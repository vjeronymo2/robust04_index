Reg., Vol. 58, No. 133, July 14, 1993, pp. 37966&hyph;37967). The Commission was requested to submit its report by June 30, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  General information may be obtained from Ms. Arona Butcher (202&hyph;205&hyph;2230), Office of Operations, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20436.

The investigation will include a comprehensive empirical analysis of the economic condition of U.S. domestic industries impacted (including upstream and downstream industries) by unfairly traded imports both before and after relief was granted. This analysis will include relevant industry information on employment, wages, production, prices, investment, trade and other factors internal and external to the industry including but not limited to the relevant unfair foreign trade practices affecting the general health and competitiveness of such industries. Also, the USTR has requested that a standard comparative static model be employed to estimate the economic effects of the unfair trade practices and remedies on selected U.S. industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USTR noted that the process of relief from unfair trade practices entails real costs to firms, to individual workers and to taxpayers. The USTR has requested the Commission to complement the empirical analysis above with quantitative and other estimates of the labor and other domestic adjustment costs involved. Also as requested by the USTR, the Commission will seek to provide an assessment of the economy-wide net economic welfare effects of unfair trade practices and the remedies provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public hearing in connection with the investigation will be held at the U.S. International Trade Commission Building, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC, beginning at 9:30 a.m. on September 29, 1994 and September 30, 1994 (if required).

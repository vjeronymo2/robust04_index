			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Shake-out in China's leadership: Communist party seeking to present younger image to the people A BIG shake-up of China's leadership is in progress following the retirement of more than half the Communist party's politburo - the country's leading decision-making body. Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, yesterday reported that eight of the 14 members of the politburo, including President Yang Shangkun, 85, and defence minister Qin Jiwei, 78, had tendered their resignations during the party's 14th congress. The newspaper, which generally reflects Beijing's point of view, was silent on who would replace the eight. There have, however, have been persistent reports that the party wants to present a younger image to the Chinese people as well as to the world at large. Wen Wei Po indicated that old age was the reason for the eight to retire. But it said the top 'leadership level and the presidium' had given a positive evaluation of the eight's 'noble character and sterling integrity'. A front-page commentary in yesterday People's Daily, the official newspaper of the party, prepared the wider party for a change at the top. It said: 'With the passing of time, quite a few old comrades are getting advanced in age and finding it hard to shoulder their heavy workload.' In addition to Yang and Qin it named Wan Li, the 76-year-old head of the National People's Congress, or parliament; Song Ping, 75; Yao Yilin, 75; Wu Xueqian, 71; Li Ximing, 66; and Yang Rudai, 66. Song and Yao are on the politburo's all-powerful standing committee and are regarded as being on the hardline conservative wing of the party. Their replacements, and the composition of the standing committee generally, are being watched closely by Beijing's western diplomatic corps to assess whether Deng Xiaoping, 88 and the nation's pre-eminent leader, has been able to increase the number of pro-economic reformers on the standing committee. This week the party embraced a radical, market-oriented reform programme which envisages the introduction of free markets and the restructuring of the country's ailing state industries. It turned its face, however, against any form of political reform, flatly ruling out 'a western, multi-party, parliamentary system'. The politburo is expected to be expanded from its previous complement of 14 to more than 20 people. The expanded number is expected to allow greater representation by provincial party bosses, including those of Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Shandong, in addition to Beijing. These provinces have been the engine of Chinese economic growth and their power has increased significantly. At the same time, analysts said, the inclusion of more provincial party bosses on the politburo would bring them further into the policy orbit of Beijing, from which they have been straying recently. The party congress is expected to close tomorrow, when a new central committee will be appointed. It in turn will appoint the politburo and its standing committee, which might be announced at the same time or on Monday.</p>

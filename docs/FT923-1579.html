			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (9): Yes, we have too many bananas - Farmers are switching to new products THE government of Belize has taken to buying old bulls in an effort to beef up its livestock industry. It buys them from farmers, and then provides the farmers with access to younger stock of a higher quality. Small livestock farmers can also benefit from the loan of a young cow. When the beast has gained significant weight it is sold, with the farmer keeping the value added while it was in his care. Such innovations are part of Belize's attempt to deal with three problems which trouble agriculture: over-reliance on the traditional and now uncertain sectors of sugar, bananas and citrus; high operating costs; access to credit for small farmers. 'Farm credit is a major problem for agriculture,' says Mr Michael Espat, the minister of agriculture and fisheries. 'Commercial banks are not keen to give credit to the sector, and are interested more in short term credit at high interest rates. We are trying to get a small farmers' bank established which will give loans at 8 per cent, against the market rate of 12 per cent to 13 per cent. It will be established with BDollars 5m from the divestment of the government's holdings in state enterprises.' Bankers say there is no reluctance to lend for agriculture. 'People with good projects and good track records are not turned away,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the manager of Barclays Bank in Belize. 'The government's agencies handle many such loans and the farmers' bank is planned. These are more than adequate for developmental purposes in Belize.' In spite of these problems, non-traditional agriculture has been expanding. Beef production, for example, has grown to allow exports, on the hoof, over the border to Mexico's Cancun province. Mr Espat reports that the country is self-sufficient in poultry meat and eggs, and an expected 50 per cent increase in rice production this year, lifting output to 15m pounds, will satisfy local demand. The country's proximity to the US and Canada offers a growing market for tropical and exotic fruit. Officials report increasing local and foreign interest in cashews, pineapples, ginger, papayas and avocado. More significant, however, is the promise of continuing expansion of seafood production and exports, and which earned the country BDollars 20m last year, 15 per cent more than 1990. Lobster, shrimp and fish are finding markets in North America, Europe and the Far East. Shrimp exports are set for significant growth in volume from last year's 500,000 pounds. Two shrimp farms have been established which, at full production, will each produce 1m pounds a year. In addition to their headaches over credit, farmers face a few other difficulties. Although official figures point to a labour surplus, the farming sector has difficulty finding enough workers. The shortage has been eased by the influx of refugees from Belize's neighbours, who are willing to do work refused by some native Belizeans. Expansion of agro-industry is also difficult. The minimum wage of Belizean workers is twice as big as in neighbouring countries. Electricity costs will remain high for several years until a hydro-electric station which is being constructed becomes fully operational. Large-scale, commercial processing and refrigeration of meat products, for example, is not attractive. 'The inputs for agriculture in Belize are very costly,' says Mr Joe Smith, director of agricultural projects. 'There is a high cost for fuel, wages and chemicals, for example, and this puts agriculture at a significant disadvantage.' In spite of the promise of rapid and significant expansion in the non-traditional products, Belizean agriculture will continue to depend for some time on its main sectors. But these face an uncertain future. Sugar, bananas and citrus are dependent on preferential markets in North America and Europe. Current changes in international commerce such as the global tendency to freer trade, the emergence of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), and the creation of a single European market in January all threaten a sector which accounts for one fifth of the economy. Raw sugar, totalling just over 91,000 tonnes last year, is sold under quota to the European Community and the US,and at prices significantly higher than those prevailing on the world market. The country also sells to the world market after domestic demand has been satisfied. While there is no immediate concern over the future of the EC sugar quota, there are already doubts over continuing preferential access to the US with the emergence of NAFTA. Indications of increased access to the US for Mexican sugar has left Belize and its neighbours concerned that their quotas will be phased out. There is similar concern about exports of orange and grapefruit concentrate, most of which go to the US under a preferential trade programme for several Caribbean Basin countries. Easier access to the US for the Mexican product will damage Belizean citrus which suffered last year from poor weather, but which is expected to do better this year. Like other traditional suppliers of bananas to the EC, Belize is caught up in a battle to retain preferential access after next January. Its neighbours, who produce at a lower cost, are arguing for an open market on which the Belizean fruit will not be able to compete. 'We have been told our access to the EC will be at the 1990 level of our exports but the growers are asking for the access to be at that which we expect to be exporting in 1997,' says Mr Espat. '1990 was a bad year for exports as floods and disease depressed production.' The acreage under bananas has expanded by a third since 1989, and the industry's goal is to lift exports to 100,000 tonnes, six times the 1989 level, by 1997. While agriculture has a central role in the country's economy, there is no political consensus about its future. 'We have a simple economic plan, and that is to grow as much food as we can,' says Mr George Price, the prime minister. 'We must meet our local demand for food, and then look to exporting.' Mr Manuel Esquivel, the opposition leader, disagrees: 'there is over dependence on agriculture in the economy,' he argues. 'Agriculture is important, but we cannot hang our hat on this alone as we cannot do anything about the market.'</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French cash rates rise FRENCH cash rates moved up sharply again yesterday after the Bank of France suspended the 5 to 10-day lending window and lifted overnight rates to 12 per cent, writes James Blitz. The French move was the focal point of a rather bearish day in cash and futures markets. French futures fell back sharply on the move, while Euromark futures were temporarily depressed by the Bundesbank's decision not to change money market rates, as had been expected. Sterling money market dealers ignored a powerful rally by the pound against the D-Mark. Sentiment in the cash market was depressed by the Bank of England's decision to offer a longer-dated repurchase agreement. France's decision to raise short-term rates was deemed a 'pre-emptive strike' by some dealers. Although the franc has come under renewed pressure in the European exchange rate mechanism since the new year, forex trading volumes still seem very thin, and the move had not been expected. The decision to suspend the 5 to 10-day lending window created thinner liquidity in the market, and cash rates moved up sharply. The overnight rate climbed to around 15 per cent from the previous day's 13 1/2 per cent, while three-month closed at around 13 3/4 per cent. The March French franc contract fell to 90.29 after ending at 90.48 on Monday. Euromark futures fell back in the morning after the Bundesbank announced that it would not push its repo rate below the previous fixed rate of 8.75 per cent as some had expected. However, it added a net DM5.5bn in an allocation that was thought generous. In the sterling market, three-month money firmed to 7 1/8 per cent from a previous close of around 7 1/16 per cent, in spite of a strong rally by sterling against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. The poorer sentiment may have been caused by the Bank of England's decision to sell Pounds 210m in a repurchase agreement due on March 1 at a rate of 6 29/32 per cent. By asking dealers to tie up funds until then, the Bank created the impression that there would be no chance of a cut in base rates until the spring. A strong feeling in the market was that this was a technical move, resulting from the large shortages in the system. But the March short sterling contract declined 6 basis points to end at 93.38.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Transatlantic air-fare 'war' is only a light scuffle: Delta Air Lines' price cuts on former Pan Am routes are seen as a publicity feat NO SOONER had the US domestic 'air wars' abated, than Delta Air Lines - one of the nation's three 'mega-carriers' - announced last week that it was cutting prices on its transatlantic routes. International travellers hoped that they too would enjoy the sort of ticket bargains which have sent US holiday-makers into such frenzied excitement in the past six weeks. No such luck. The Delta cuts duly generated a string of matching deals from other US carriers and from European airlines, including Lufthansa, Swissair and British Airways. But the reductions were never that generous in the first place, nor were they aimed at the leisure traveller. The drawbacks to Delta's initiative are threefold. For a start, although the new fares are billed as 'up to 45 per cent' lower, maximum reductions can only be found on the least popular routes. If you want to fly between Miami and Istanbul, you may find some fares have almost halved. But between Los Angeles and London, Delta's cuts range from 1 to 28 per cent (depending on the type of fare). Between Atlanta and London, the savings are 12 to 20 per cent. And so on. Second, these cheaper fares apply solely to round-trip travel originating in the US. Anyone who wants to board the outward-bound aircraft in the UK or Continental Europe - or simply wants a one-way ticket - will find them of no use at all. Third, the fare reductions apply only to full coach, business class and first class tickets, and do not permit stopovers of more than 14 days. That provides little appeal for the average leisure traveller, although the new fares may benefit the business market. Today, according to one New York 'bucket shop', a round-trip ticket between Los Angeles and London, for travel in early August, would cost about Dollars 800 (Pounds 440). By contrast, Delta's full coach fare, which has come down by a princely 1 per cent, is Dollars 1,800. To get a more significant 28 per cent fare reduction on the LA to London route, you would need to buy a first class ticket - now Dollars 5,800, down from Dollars 8,100. The business community may be more grateful. 'I've got one customer who was going from New York to Milan anyway - and his fare's come down from Dollars 3,400 to about Dollars 2,800,' said one US travel agent after the cuts took effect. Even so, the truly thrifty businessman will still find that Trans World Airlines, the bankrupt carrier owned by Carl Icahn, undercuts Delta and its imitators - although the differential has been reduced to the cost of a modest lunch. Many observers view Delta's initiative more as a publicity feat, than a serious bout of 'fare wars'. After all, the Atlanta-based carrier acquired its extensive Transatlantic routes from the now-defunct Pan Am only last November. Given subsequent integration problems, this may be a good opportunity to tell the world what Delta now offers.</p>

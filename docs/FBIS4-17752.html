			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- A meeting of the  Presidential Council was held in Kremlin today to discuss ways  and methods to achieve civic accord, the presidential press  service reports.    The meeting noted that the adoption of the new Russian  Constitution enabled more tranquil situation in the country and  signing of the agreement on civic accord may become a new step  towards civic peace.    An introductory speech of President Yeltsin stressed the  importance of the current level of mutual understanding between  the president, the government and the Federal Assembly. The  Presidential Council members basically shared this point of view  but called the president's attention to the fact the State Duma  has not begun the fulfilment of its major task -- legislative  renovation of Russia.    Speaking of acute Russian problems, council members urged  the  president to enhance consolidation of Russian statehood,  including more tough measures against crime. Some members of  the Presidential Council sharply criticized the procurator's  office.    When commenting on economic issues, the meeting participants  called attention to social dangers caused by the aggravated  problem of non-payments and further production recession.    A number of council members expressed concern over the  president's passiveness in encouragement of reforms.</p>

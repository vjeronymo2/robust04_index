			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Brussels puts UK behind on growth Growth in the UK will lag behind the rate of economic expansion in Germany, France and Italy by as early as next year as higher taxes take their toll on British consumers, the European Commission said yesterday. In its latest assessment of economic prospects for the 12 member states of the European Union, the Commission said it was confident recessionary forces were dissipating and that the projected recovery would be 'widespread'. The Union's GDP is now expected to expand by 1.6 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 1995. But for the UK, where consumer spending has been the motor behind the recovery, last month's tax increases are expected to slow the rate of overall growth from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in the next by hitting the pace of consumer spending. The forecasts are not significantly out of line with the UK Treasury's own projections but have been downgraded from the previous set of commission figures. In spite of the rosier outlook for growth, Mr Henning Christophersen, vice-president of the Commission, warned that the recovery would have little impact on Europe's grim unemployment figures. This year nine, and next year six, of the member countries will experience increases in unemployment. 'In 1995 France and Italy could join Denmark, Ireland and the UK in registering a moderate decline in unemployment,' said the commission. Inflation is likely to ease further over the next two years dropping to an overall 3.3 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent in 1995. Mr Chistophersen said that a 'broad majority' of member countries was expected to respect the inflation criterion contained in the Maastricht treaty next year. Greece, Spain and Portugal were the exceptions. Falling real labour unit costs, institutional changes in wage setting procedures and steps to establish the independence of central banks were all helping to shore-up the favourable outlook for inflation.</p>

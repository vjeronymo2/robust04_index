			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Break-up of British Gas ruled out: DTI rejects two main recommendations of Monopolies Commission report The decision on British Gas yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, means that he has rejected the two main recommendations of August's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report - the first time he has gone against the MMC in a significant inquiry. He commended the commission on the 'high quality' of its reports, but made it clear he disagreed with its analysis of the priorities in dealing with the problem of British Gas's monopoly. He also felt a break-up of the company was impractical and unnecessary. Instead, he is proposing British Gas should have separate internal businesses to overcome the conflict between its dual role as transporter and trader of gas. The MMC had said that true competition could never develop as long as British Gas wielded such power over the market. Mr Heseltine said: 'My view is that complete separation of the two businesses within continued British Gas ownership is likely to be sufficient to overcome the obstacle to competition which the MMC identified. I have therefore decided not to require divestment.' He was prepared, he said, to see how the restructuring on which British Gas had already embarked would work. If it was unsatisfactory it would be up to Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, to take appropriate action. What seems to have tipped the balance against break-up is the speed with which British Gas has changed since the MMC inquiry was launched more than a year ago. As one person close to the decision said yesterday, the inquiry was like 'a giant consultancy exercise' which forced British Gas to confront tough issues and push through reforms in management and structure. On the abolition of the monopoly, Mr Heseltine said he wanted a faster timetable than that proposed by the MMC because of the government's strong commitment to improving competition in gas supply. 'I am keen to make further progress in reducing the monopoly as rapidly as possible. I do not believe that the removal of the monopoly needs to be delayed as the MMC envisaged.' Ministers also wanted to get the gas market opened up at the same time as electricity - in 1998. But a key point was that while independent companies should be admitted to the franchise market, constraints on British Gas's operations in the non-franchise market should also be removed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      HESELTINE MAKES HIS CHOICE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MMC recommendation:                   Michael Heseltine's decision: British Gas to sell off its gas       No sell-off, but British Gas must trading arm by March 1997             separate its transport and trading                                       activities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abolition of British Gas's            Phased abolition of domestic monopoly of the domestic gas          monopoly in 1996-98 market by 2000-2002  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Wider monopoly reference              Accepted powers for Ofgas  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Price regulation of British Gas       Ofgas to consult and decide transportation business  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Modification of current gas price     Ofgas to consult and decide formula from RPI-5 to RPI-4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tobback: `Flow of Refugees Seeking </F> Asylum Gradually Under Control' -- Total Applications in May  Under 1000 for First Time in Years"]    [Excerpts] Yesterday, Louis Tobback was both content and  optimistic when assessing his own policy on asylum-seekers.  Moreover, the minister, who is also responsible for alien  affairs, offered some hard facts and figures to justify his  buoyant mood: In May 1994, a total of 919 asylum requests were  received, according to the latest figures released by the Alien  Affairs Department. That is several hundred fewer requests than  in previous months. Even greater is the difference between this  figure and the one registered in June 1993, when the monthly  record of 3,058 was set. Anyway, it was years ago that the  number of asylum-seekers was last under the 1000 mark. This  brings the sum total of asylum requests received over the first  five months of this year to 1,105. Remember, the annual total in  1993 amounted to 26,883, and the 1992 total was 17,647. "What  is more, the latest figure released for May even includes around  100 Rwandans," Tobback emphasized. The minister primarily  attributes this success to his own firm asylum policy. Exactly  one year ago, a new, faster asylum procedure was introduced  which, among other things, did away with the possibility of  appealing to the Council of State in the asylum request  procedure. "However, it was not a question of tightening up the  procedure, the sole aim was to limit and dissuade people from  abusing the possibility of lodging an appeal." The candidate  for mayor of Leuven also considered it to be of great importance  to dissociate asylum-seeker status from eligibility for a work  permit. [passage omitted]    What is the ultimate objective? "Not to set a world record  for the lowest number of asylum requests," Tobback said, "but to  reach a figure that is as close as possible to the number of  people definitively recognized as political refugees."  According to the statistics, ultimately something like 5  percent of all asylum-seekers are recognized as refugees.  [passage omitted]</p>

The drug traffickers now are  crossing through the town of Tres Lagoas in eastern MS on the  Sao Paulo State [SP] border. As a result of an investigation of  fast fortunes, Federal Police discovered a gang of Tres Lagoas  farmers and businessmen. The head of the gang, Osvaldir Garcia,  belongs to one the town's established families.    Police received information about the drugs but could not  seize the first cargo of 338 kg, which was delivered a month  ago. The seized cocaine was bought in Bolivia for $2,000 per  kilo and hidden in a secret compartment in the chassis of a dump  truck with license plate FV-4435 from Andradina (SP). The truck,  which was being towed because its engine was ruined, had been  assembled in the Bolivian town of Puerto Quijarro, on the MS  border.    Part of the cocaine was being sent to Rio de Janeiro, where  it would be sold for $7,000 per kilo, and also to Europe, where  it would be sold for $40,000 per kilo. Police arrested truck  driver Claudio Goncalves, 39, and tow truck driver Benedito  Cardoso Filho, and are holding them at the Federal Police  Superintendency in Campo Grande. Osvaldir Garcia and three  other drug traffickers escaped, but their preventive arrest  already has been decreed.</p>

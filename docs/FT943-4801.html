			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Optimists in Ulster Mr John Major's cool reaction to the 'complete' ceasefire declared by the IRA last week is finely judged. The prime minister's insistence on a copper-bottomed guarantee that violence has been permanently renounced is quite understandable. This is not a matter of mere semantics. As the Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has intimated, the use of the word 'permanent' is of less importance than the desirability of extracting an undertaking from the military wing of Sinn Fein that it does not intend to take up arms again. Anything less would feed the suspicions of Ulster Unionists. The anxieties of Irish nationalist politicians are all the other way. Rush to embrace Mr Gerry Adams, their actions suggest, or the peace will be lost. The president of Sinn Fein was seen by many only a week ago as the public face of a two-headed organisation steeped in blood. Now the world is asked to regard him as the man who talked the IRA into laying down its weapons. The Irish view, reflected in Washington, appears to be that that historic decision must be rewarded by at least the appearance of political momentum, or the conflict may be reignited. Extraordinary scenes Whatever its merits, this argument can be the only explanation of yesterday's extraordinary scenes in Dublin, when Mr Albert Reynolds welcomed Mr Adams, along with Mr John Hume, to discuss preparations for a 'National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation'. The Irish prime minister is undoubtedly devoted to ending the violence. So is Mr Hume, who as leader of Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour party has risked a great deal to bring the IRA/Sinn Fein into democratic politics. As to Mr Adams's commitment, the jury is still out. In short, yesterday's apparent rift between London and Dublin need not damage the prospects for lasting peace. It could indeed be helpful. Nothing said by Dublin or Mr Adams will persuade the terrorists on the 'loyalist' side to cease their murderous activities; what the British government says or does could be decisive. Each government must address its own set of intransigents according to its own circumstances. The British way is, rightly, to avoid euphoria within the first few days of an IRA announcement. Mr Major may be at odds with the ultra-unionists within his own party, but he has the support of Mr Tony Blair, who has moved Labour away from its pro-nationalist tilt, and, for the Liberal Democrats, their spokesman Lord Holme. Backed by the two principal opposition parties, and his own cabinet, he should be able to resist the blandishments of well-meaning peacemakers in the US and Ireland. Self-determination Optimists may therefore regard the events of the past few days as constructive, provided that the terms of the Irish-British declaration issued at Downing Street last December are not breached. The essence of that important document is that the right to self-determination of the people of Ulster is recognised. On this page Mr Enoch Powell writes of a conflict of nationalities; the declaration stands as a guarantee that the people of the six counties will be ruled under the British crown unless a majority of them freely consent to a change. In those circumstances there will be a united Ireland; otherwise not. If Sinn Fein rejects this, its entry into the democratic process will not be permanent. Perhaps both sides, nationalist and unionist, need further coaxing before they will accept the merits of the declaration. This will require much talking. Fortunately, there is much that could be talked about. In the spirit of the Anglo-Irish agreement concluded by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, there is the prospect of allowing the people of Ulster to govern themselves, while reassuring the Catholic community that the old Protestant ascendancy would not be restored. In today's language, what is required is a series of agreements that would construct a relationship of variable geometry. An elected executive in Belfast could negotiate cross-border arrangements with Dublin. Both could do political business with London. The possibilities could be limitless. The risk is a collapse of the peace; the potential reward a permanent end to a long nightmare.</p>

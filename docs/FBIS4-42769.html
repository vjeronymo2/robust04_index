			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] On the subject of the German-Spanish consultations,  the following can be read in the MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG of  Halle: Will European unity soon receive more impetus again?  The prospects are not bad, because within the next 18 months,  the Germans, French, and Spaniards will assume the presidency of  the European Union [EU] one after another. After his talks with  Spain's Prime Minister Filipe Gonzalez in Schwerin, Chancellor  Helmut Kohl was already enthusiastic about the troika at the  head of the EU until the end of 1995. Nevertheless, the  triple-team will not find things easy, for it will consist of  large European member-states, and in the past this has  repeatedly given rise to mistrust, if not opposition, on the  part of smaller countries, says the MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG.    NEUE ZEIT of Berlin says on this topic: Considering the  substance of the observations made at the 11th German-Spanish  consultations, one may be permitted to have doubts. Everyone  wants the best. Success depends on specifics. But more  important than all good intentions is the climate this time. It  was good to bring the Spanish Prime Minister Gonzalez,  representative of southern interests in the EU, to  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and discuss an eastward expansion  there as well. The partners must be convinced that this  expansion does not lead to a German special path, that doing the  one thing does not automatically mean abandoning the other, the  consolidation of the EU, says NEUE ZEIT.    NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG represents the following view: The  formation of a European triple-team consisting of Germany,  France, and Spain, announced by Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez,  will not encounter unanimous support in every EU country. Above  all, in Great Britain there is profound suspicion about such a  troika, but one cannot assume a leadership function if one  applies the brakes all the time. Without the boost supplied by  Germany and France, stagnation would have been almost  inevitable, and there would have been no EU. Also in future,  the EU needs such pioneers, not bosses, and it is to be  considered highly positive that Spain is placing itself in this  group of kinetic forces, says the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG.</p>

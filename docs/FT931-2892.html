			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bayer warns on prices as sales slide WORLDWIDE sales of Bayer, the German chemicals giant, fell by 11 per cent in the first two months of this year, the company said yesterday. Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, said there was no prospect of a recovery in Europe during 1993. He warned that prices worldwide might fall by 1.5 per cent during the year. Sales in Germany were down 8 per cent so far this year. In the last quarter of 1992, pre-tax profits in Bayer's German subsidiary halved. Worldwide pretax profits for the fourth quarter fell 17 per cent to DM469m, on sales down 4.4 per cent at DM9.45bn. For the year, group profits fell 16 per cent to DM2.7bn, on turnover down 2.8 per cent. The dividend was cut from DM13 to DM11 a share. Bayer's German pre-tax profits for the year were down 27.6 per cent at DM1.33bn on sales down 3.2 per cent at DM17.5bn. The decline in turnover was accentuated by the strength of the D-Mark, which reduced sales by 3 per cent, Mr Schneider said. Volume growth last year of 1.9 per cent - equivalent to DM800m - was offset by price falls of nearly 2 per cent. Polymers, organic chemicals and industrial chemicals registered the largest drop in prices. Healthcare, which includes pharmaceuticals, non-prescription medicines and diagnostics, generated operating profits of DM1.82bn. It was the only division to report an increase in sales - up 1.4 per cent at DM9bn. Agrochemicals results fell 21 per cent to DM378m, on sales down 3.5 per cent at DM5.15bn. The polymers division posted a trading loss of DM37m, on turnover down 7.5 per cent at DM7.2bn. Industrial products which include polyurethanes and pigments, generated an operating profit down 34.7 per cent at DM275m on sales down 2.6 per cent at DM7.6bn. The organic products division reported operating profits down 14.8 per cent at DM121m on sales down 5.1 per cent at DM5.4bn. The sector suffered from a downturn in the textile sector and increased competition from Asian groups. The company is cutting 230 jobs at its Dralon plants at Dormagen, Germany.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (5): KMT supremacy challenged - Domestic politics A REMARKABLE change is under way in Taiwanese politics. The old order, represented by one-party authoritarian rule, is giving way to more plural multi-party politics. It is still too early to say where the change will lead. What seems certain is that there is little chance of Taiwan peacefully returning to the past. The island has embarked on a process of democratisation which, when the president is popularly elected in 2 1/2 years, will further underline its separateness from mainland China. And therein lies the risk for Taiwan's politicians. Taiwan's new politics has opened up debate on the island and 'Taiwan independence' is now openly advocated. Beijing has resolved to prevent the island's secession from the mainland and has threatened to move quickly, using military means, to stop it from doing so. For the time being, however, these considerations have given way to a contest for power and influence in one of north Asia's most dynamic economies and societies. In this period of transition, the supremacy of the ruling Kuomingtang (KMT), which has governed Taiwan since the end of the Second World War, is being challenged. Business leaders and even some senior officials of the KMT now openly speculate that the government may fall from power. Five years ago the thought would have been impossible, and probably seditious; what is genuinely surprising is the apparent equanimity with which they view the prospect. Says Mr Chi-Chu Chen, senior vice-president of the International Commercial Bank of China: 'It's my view that in three years the KMT will be out of office. People are sick and tired of the status quo. In general people do not trust the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party), but they just might take the risk and vote them in. The KMT is not forever.' At the top level of the KMT, officials are phlegmatic. Says Mr James Chu, the party's spokesman: 'We are concerned but not worried. Take a look at what has happened to ruling parties in other countries. Conservatives in the UK had a hard time - the same in the US and Japan. This is an era of diversity and dynamism; people want change. 'I think we are doing well. But we can't expect always to get 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the vote in elections when we are going through a process of democratisation. Some day we may be the opposition party; we know that is a price we may have to pay. That is not a failure of democratisation but the success of it.' Universally known as 'the party', the KMT remains very powerful and is likely to do so for some time to come. It supplies Taiwan's president, prime minister and head of the judiciary. Moreover, more than 90 per cent of Taiwan's civil servants are party members. It is also very rich. Companies controlled by the KMT's Central Investment Corp had at the end of February assets valued at NTDollars 963.9bn (Dollars 37bn), making it Taiwan's largest business group. One of its important financial and political assets is its ownership of television. It is seeking to expand that control into cable TV when the government approves the establishment of cable networks. In spite of this appearance of control, the KMT is facing pressures from many directions. Internally it is riven by faction and is showing signs of fracturing. Moreover, the Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates 'Taiwan independence' and is its main external threat, has been skilful in exploiting these divisions to score a number of parliamentary victories, notably the passage of a law requiring politicians and senior government officials to reveal their personal wealth. Although the ruling party's financial strength is a huge asset, it has become a political liability. Voters in Taiwan, especially among the educated middle classes in the cities, are tired of 'money politics' (corruption). They are also questioning the efficacy of a political party playing such a powerful role in industry and commerce and the potential conflicts of interest this poses. In last December's elections for the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's law-making body, a group of concerned citizens formed a lobby called the Clean Election Campaign. Its purpose was to monitor vote-buying by politicians of all parties. The support the campaign received underlined the extent of voter dissatisfaction with corruption in Taiwanese politics. Mr Jack Huang, managing partner of the US law firm Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue and a leading member of the campaign, says: 'Initially we did not invest a lot of hope in the success of the campaign, but to our surprise we received 700,000 letters from voters who said they would not sell their vote.' Next month the KMT will face a further test of its popularity and unity when elections for 21 county mayors and magistrates are held across the island. The party currently controls 13 of these positions, but it is widely expected that it will fare less well this time around, possibly losing the simple majority it currently enjoys. Its rival, which controls seven localities, expects to win 11 or 12 of the local government positions. Winning a majority of the positions has become make-or-break for Mr Hsu Sin Liang, chairperson of the DPP. He has said he will resign party leadership if the party does not win more than half the seats. The DPP sees these local elections as a chance to cut its rival off from its grassroots support through its own access to the patronage power in Taiwan. Mr I-Jen Chiou, deputy secretary general of the DPP, says: 'We think we can win the coming the coming elections and if so them I think we can, through the mayors, build our power and weaken the special interests of the KMT.' At a national level, defections from the KMT to the China New Party - formed after the KMT's 14th party congress in August by a faction disaffected with the China policy - have seriously affected its ability to govern. 'Ours is a large party', says the KMT's Mr Chu. 'We do have a caucus in the legislature but it has become more and more difficult for us to hold them in line . . . We hope the situation will improve.' Because of the split, the KMT's strength in the 168-seat legislature has been cut from 102 to around 95 as former party members have left. Its strength there is likely to be eroded by further defections to the New Party. This party, led by Mr Chao Shau Kang, a former environment minister and senior KMT member, promotes a curious blend of populism and conservatism. On one hand, it has taken up the battle for clean government and a clean environment; on the other it wants a more accommodative policy towards mainland China. 'We think we should have government-to-government talks and direct trade and communications links with the mainland,' says Mr Chao. In this inchoate political climate, the KMT is pushing ahead with internal reforms in an attempt to answer its critics' complaint that it is still too authoritarian. It is also considering reforms of Taiwan's legislature to change it from a forum which screens the executive's proposed laws to one which can originate legislation. This reform would allow for a separation of the executive from the legislature, raising the possibility of an opposition-controlled legislature and a KMT executive. The reform will also pave the way for the direct election of the president in May 1996. As Taiwan moves towards the greater use of the ballot box in determining political power, so it moves closer to independence. That may prove too much to stomach for China's Communist rulers who have never renounced the use of force to reunify the nation.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPLAY: A HILLBILLY TREASURE FROM THE VAULTS OF CAPITOL;  </P> <P> THIS FEATURE SPOTLIGHTS NOTEWORTHY COMPILATIONS AND REISSUES  </P> <P> Album: "Hillbilly Music . . . Thank God! Volume 1." Bug Records/Capitol.  </P> <P> Artists: Merle Travis, Hank Thompson, Buck Owens, Faron Young, Louvin Brothers,  Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rose Maddox, others.  </P> <P> History: "Hillbilly music" was country music, when country wasn't cool.  Emerging in the 1920s from its folk roots in the Appalachians -- largely  through recordings of pioneering performers such as Jimmie Rodgers and the  Carter Family -- its popularity spread in subsequent decades through the South  into the Southwest, and eventually throughout the world. Generally, the music  referred to as hillbilly differed from the "Western" branch of country (made  famous in the 1930s and '40s by Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and other singing cowboy  movie stars) by its rural, backwoods underpinnings and frequently mournful,  melancholy lyrics. It's this brand of seminal country music that has been so  successfully resuscitated in recent years by Emmylou Harris, Randy Travis,  Dwight Yoakam and the other "new traditionalists."  </P> <P> Sound: This first-rate double album is drawn from the Capitol Records vaults.  The music dates from the late '40s into the '60s.(All the recording information  was lost, so dates of the individual sessions are not known.) When Capitol  Records opened its doors in Los Angeles in the '40s, a major part of the  label's prerock-era success was from hits by country artists signed right here.  This retrospective spans the label's major artists (Hank Thompson, Merle  Travis, Faron Young, the Louvins) to the truly obscure (the Farmer Boys, the  Milo Twins). There's a healthy nod to Buck Owens, with two of his own  performances as well as two other Owens songs, one recorded by Rose Maddox and  one by the Farmer Boys. If the term hillbilly music was something of a  pejorative, the songs often compensated for trivial subject matter with  inventive word play, engaging harmonies or simply a healthy sense of humor. And  snobs who might turn up their noses at the very idea of hillbilly musicianship  should listen to "Stratosphere Boogie," a rip-roaring exercise in dexterity by  steel guitar duo Jimmy Bryant and Speedy West. The liner notes by the album's  producer, rock singer Marshall Crenshaw, are informal, spirited and  informative, and the remastered sound is remarkably clean throughout. RANDY  LEWIS  </P></p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Restructured GM Firth reduces deficit to Pounds 1.98m GM Firth (Holdings), the Wakefield-based engineering company, yesterday announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m for the year to March 31, down from Pounds 5.99m previously. This year's result was after charging exceptional items and provisions totalling Pounds 872,000. The largest item was Pounds 530,000 for potential costs in respect of a leased property formerly occupied by a discontinued activity. During the year the company concentrated on shedding lossmaking activities in order to prepare for a capital injection. This fol-lowed earlier this year in the form of a Pounds 4m rights issue. Sales in the 12 months from continuing activities came to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 21.2m). Net interest payable declined to Pounds 272,000 (Pounds 880,000). Losses per share fell to 3.97p (11.43p).</p>

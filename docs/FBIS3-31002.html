			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Feb 10 (AFP) -- UN troops deployed  Thursday [10 February] at six strategic points around the  Bosnian capital to enforce the latest UN-brokered ceasefire  agreement, as Bosnia Serbs warned they would retaliate against  NATO airstrikes.    The UN Protection Force stepped up its presence in the city,  while spokesman Colonel Richard Pernod said the UN troops had  been ordered to riposte if attacked.    Bosnia's Serbs on Thursday rejected the North Atlantic  Treaty  Organisation's ultimatum to end their siege of Sarajevo or face  air strikes, and said their heavy weapons would not be removed  from around the city.    "Despite this ultimatum, the Serb artillery will not move an  inch," said their main spokesman, Miroslav Toholj. "We are ready  to retaliate."    And in what appeared to be an early Serb reaction to the  NATO  deadline, Toholj confirmed the Serbs were preventing UN refugee  workers from following UN orders and leaving Serb-controlled  zones.    "This decision was taken on the orders of the deputy  commander-in-chief of the Serb army," General Milan Gvero, he  said.    However, the UNHCR denied its staff were being held hostage.  "We are having problems at the checkpoints but they are not  hostages," said spokesman Kris Janowski here.    The aid agency Wednesday [9 February] recalled to Zagreb or  Belgrade two thirds of its staff stationed in Serb-held areas of  Bosnia. "The reason for this recall is next week's visit here of  the High Commissioner and overall tense situation," he said.    Toholj described Wednesday's threat by NATO to hit Serb  positions with air strikes if the artillery is not pulled back  within 10 days as "a terrorist threat," adding that the Serbs  would respond "by all means" to any attack.

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts Yesterday's gilt auction turned out more successful than the authorities could have dared hope. One can discount the high cover ratio: it may simply reflect rogue bids designed to pick up paper on the cheap. The minimal difference between the highest accepted price and the average is a different matter. That points to solid demand. Perhaps UK institutions have decided that the inflationary outlook is good enough to make an 8.5 per cent yield on long-dated paper attractive. There must be some who feared that, even with the more frequent auctions, the opportunity to buy long-dated gilts will not come up that often. Perhaps, too, the market had been deliberately oversold since the budget by traders looking for cheap auction stock. The danger is that an element of the demand came from fickle sources like international hedge funds attracted by the steep UK yield curve. If so, the authorities should beware. With this auction under its belt, together with sales to banks and calls on existing issues, it could start the new financial year with getting on for Pounds 10bn already covered. That is good for confidence, but there is a long way to go.</p>

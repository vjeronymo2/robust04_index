			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING-OUT PARTIES FOR TWO MAGAZINES;  </P> <P> FORBES HATCHES HIS NEW EGG AND CELEBRATES IN L. A.  </P> <P> The East Coast media Establishment met West Coast club trendies at a launch  party for Egg magazine, that wider-than-it-is-long publication with the odd  name brought to you by Mr. Moneybags himself, Malcolm Forbes.  </P> <P> Forbes and his minions presided over a fete Friday night at Arena, the latest  club happening from club happening veterans April and Christian. It was  probably the only launch party/club launch ever with a receiving line. First in  line was Malcolm and son Tim (with wife Anne), who offered handshakes and  smiled identical smiles while wearing uptight suits and ties. Malcolm, we know  you have some black leather jackets in your closet.  </P> <P> Once inside, it was night life as usual, with oval bar, really loud house music  and a crowd that looked like leftover extras from "Slaves of New York."  </P> <P> The Slaves of L.A. were an eclectic group, including Faith Ford and husband  Robert Nottingham, Robert Townsend with Charlayne Woodard, artist Andre  Miripolsky (still handing out those "Fear No Art buttons"), Allee Willis,  "thirtysomethingers" Polly Draper and Melanie Mayron, public access star Mr.  Pete with Maggs, actor Charles Busch (his show, "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom," is  coming to L.A.), Burt Sugarman and wife Mary Hart (her gams adorn the premiere  issue cover), Hollywood Kids Lance and John, Mary Crosby, Barry Krost, Dolph  Lundgren, plus Egg editor Hal Rubenstein and West Coast editor Jeff Yarbrough.  </P> <P> One woman was thrilled to see actress Julie Newmar, otherwise known as  Catwoman. "I couldn't believe it," she said. "I said to the man standing next  to me, 'Gosh, I thought she was dead.' And it turned out he was her publicist."  </P> <P> Charles Busch perused his own spread in Egg titled "The Guys in the Freudian  Slips," in which editor Hal Rubenstein chatted with three men who are the toast  of New York theater, appearing on stage as women.  </P> <P> "Thank god, some of this stuff got edited out," said Busch with a relieved  sigh.  </P> <P> At the coat check, one guest was distressed to find that her wrap had been hung  on a wire hanger. "Wire hanger?" she said, eyebrows arched. "Don't worry," said  the man behind the counter. "Joan Crawford is dead."  </P></p>

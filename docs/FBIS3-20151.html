Speaking on television after polls closed in the  second-round  voting, Balladur said the French people had "confirmed the  results of the first round" in which the two right-wing parties  in his coalition won more than 44 percent of the votes.    Balladur thanked the French people for their support "all  the  more because these are difficult times" -- an allusion to a wave  of student protests over the past two weeks against his youth  employment plan.    Conceding that his proposals "are causing concern," Balladur  said he would announce an initiative in the next few days "to  reestablish dialogue."    "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the  government,"  he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people."</p>

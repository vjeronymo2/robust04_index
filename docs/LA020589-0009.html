			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTMODERN CHILDREN AND 'IN THE BEGINNING'  </P> <P> I bought "In the Beginning" from the bookstore where I work but was somewhat  disappointed with the selection of myths. I do agree that the comparative  nature of the book asks a lot of 8-year-olds.  </P> <P> ANTHONY PICKERT  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO  </P></p>

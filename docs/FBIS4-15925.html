			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- The Russian Government has  made the first practical step towards the settlement of its  drawn-out conflict with the country's miners: On its  instructions, the Central Bank of Russia today remitted 300  billion roubles to local branches to pay the delayed wages in  the mining regions. This is the first of the weekly batches to  be forwarded to the mining regions during this month.    A wave of miners' strikes first swept the country in the  middle of last year - the colliers protested against delayed  wage packets and lack of state support for the industry which  was fighting for survival. The situation repeated itself in  March of 1994, this time around it culminated in the picketing  of the houses of government at the end of the month. The miners  demanded an immediate repayment of the budget debt for the last  quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, which by that  time had amounted to 800 billion roubles. They also demanded  that the customers pay off their accumulated debt of more than  one trillion roubles.    As a result of negotiations between the colliers' labour  union and the government it was decided that Moscow would pay  the industry 300 billion roubles a week beginning on April 13.    "It will take a few days before the money reaches the  miners," said Vitaliy Budko, chairman of the Rosugleprof Labour  Union. This will add tension to the already grave situation in  some mining areas. For example, forty miners refuse to come up  from the Mayskaya mine in Chelyabinsk region, demanding that  they be paid wages for work done in January, February and March.</p>

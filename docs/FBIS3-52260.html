			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 30 Dec (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has  warned against foreign schemes to destroy Iraq's Kurdistan.    In an editorial entitled "The Truth Will Prevail," AL-'IRAQ  today says this terrible scheme was assigned to agents of the  foreigner after they abandoned all nationalistic feelings and  mortgaged their will to serve the enemies of Iraq and its unity  and stability.    The paper adds: Observers are raising big questions about  the objectives behind the various recent security breaches in  Kurdistan and the role of the foreign hands that move the agents  to sabotage security and stability and push the region to a  phase of escalating fighting that will substantially harm the  basic interests of the Iraqi Kurds.    The paper expects eliminations and countereliminations among  the so-called parties to grow into a more serious phase that  will threaten the lives of citizens in Kurdistan. The  destructive consequences of this phase, the paper says, may  affect the entire situation there.    The paper notes the suffering of the citizens of Iraqi  Kurdistan as a result of the fighting among the agents which is  reaching villages, towns, and districts in Irbil and  al-Sulaymaniyah.    The paper notes a sharp and clear contrast between the state  of tranquillity, stability, and security that prevailed in  Kurdistan under the 17-30 July Revolution and the free,  dignified life it had under the canopy of the homeland on the  one hand, and the current dark and tragic state after the agent  cliques took control, on the other.    The paper concludes its article by saying that this fact  exposes the allegations and phony slogans that were raised to  serve as pretexts.</p>

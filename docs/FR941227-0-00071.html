No taxpayer will be provided a schedule of ruling amounts under section 468A for any taxable year unless the portion of the rates attributable to the decommissioning costs of that taxpayer with respect to such taxable year are treated by the taxpayer as though they were subject to section 88.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Par. 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.468A&hyph;3 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

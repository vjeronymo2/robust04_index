			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / New limit boosts unit trust Peps A CHANGE in Personal Equity Plan rules has led to a record inflow into unit trust Peps. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that Pounds 6,000 could be invested in a unit or investment trust Pep this tax year. The previous limit - except for investment trust new issues - had been Pounds 3,000. About 230,000 unit trust Peps were opened between April 6, the start of the tax year, and May 1, according to the Unit Trust Association. The Pounds 151m invested in April was a record monthly figure, pushing the total invested to Pounds 2.3bn, spread across 996,000 accounts.</p>

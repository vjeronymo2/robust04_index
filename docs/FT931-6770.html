			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gabicci in discussions with a possible buyer GABICCI, the USM-quoted casual clothing group, yesterday admitted it is in talks with a possible buyer after speculation about a bid caused a fluctuation in its share price this month. The group also warned that its interim results for the six months to December 19 1992 were likely to fall short of expectations. Gabicci's share price fell to a little above 20p earlier this month from a plateau of about 45p at the end of last year. They closed at 47p yesterday. Rival clothing companies, Helene and Campari International, are seen as potential bidders. Campari sells to a younger market than Gabicci, but a merger would allow for rationalisations in design, sourcing and distribution since the two groups are virtually neighbours in North London, one analyst said. However, he added, although Campari is cash rich, the group was likely shortly to announce profits down by about 35 per cent and might lack institutional support for acquisitions. Gabicci was in talks with Helene last year but discussions collapsed in November.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sparbank up 21% in spite of credit losses SPARBANK, the Swedish savings bank, boosted profits by 21 per cent last year to SKr1.03bn in spite of SKr1.11bn credit losses, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. At end-1991, the bank had Skr5.2bn of extended credit but said while this was substantial, there was no risk to the bank because 'a large part was covered by first class security'.</p>

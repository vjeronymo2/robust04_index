			<p>BFN     [Text] Poprad, east Slovakia, April 8 (CTK) -- The  cooperation of the Visegrad Four countries in the military  sphere, their admission into Western military systems and  modernization of the Slovak and Polish armed forces were  discussed by Slovak and Polish Defense Ministers Piotr  Kolodziejczyk and Pavol Kanis today.    Kolodziejczyk told journalists he was optimistic regarding  regional cooperation of the Central European countries and the  Partnership for Peace project. This is a way of creating a  joint defense area which has no alternative, he added.    Kanis (left-orientated Democratic Left Party, SDL, appointed  to the post on March 16) said that Slovakia's orientation  towards the West would continue. This is evidenced by the  identical view of the ministers that the Visegrad Four countries  (Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) should enter  NATO jointly, he added.    Kolodziejczyk said the Polish offer to jointly use military  training areas, including that above the Baltic Sea, was still  topical and it was being discussed by experts.    Poland is planning a string of joint military exercises with  NATO countries. It would like Visegrad Four representatives to  participate as observers, Kolodziejczyk said. Kanis added that  the exchange of smaller units had been proposed as well.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SECOND GENERATION PICKS UP THE TORCH FROM BOB MARLEY  </P> <P> It may be time for the record industry to look seriously at reggae again.  </P> <P> The Jamaican style, spearheaded by the late Bob Marley, was touted as a "next  big thing" 15 years ago, but it failed to make a pop breakthrough and was soon  pigeonholed as a cult music. For many fans, the last hope ended with Marley's  death in 1981. To them, Marley was reggae.  </P> <P> But the capacity turnout of 11,000 for the Bob Marley Day concert Sunday at the  Long Beach Arena -- more than double the attendance at last year's event at the  Santa Monica Civic -- indicated that reggae has spawned a sizable  second-generation audience.  </P> <P> While Marley remains a revered figurehead, this new audience -- much of it of  high school and college age -- is embracing new heroes, including Marley's  teen-age son, Ziggy, and England's UB40. This young audience also seems  attracted by reggae's distinctive, almost communal feeling (much of the arena  lobby was filled with the crafts displays that are a familiar part of large  reggae gatherings).  </P> <P> UB40's "Sing Our Own Song" could be an anthem embodying the second generation's  experience as perfectly as the Bob Marley-Peter Tosh classic "Get Up Stand Up"  did for the earlier reggae fans.  </P> <P> Judy Mowatt, in fact, performed "Sing Our Own Song," though she slipped it in  early in her 45-minute set rather than saving it for a triumphant finale. But  the former backing singer for Marley still offered the most striking blend of  contemporary and classic reggae on the eight hour-plus bill, which also  featured Daddy U-Roy, Al Campbell, Haile Maskel and Matuzalem.  </P> <P> Remarkably, Mowatt's sophisticated arrangements blended '60s girl-group  harmonies, dance-hall toasting (Jamaican rapping) and American-style rapping  without ever sounding artificial or forced.  </P> <P> Working with a local band rather than a regular unit eliminated some of her  subtle intricacies. Yet Mowatt's soaring voice (reminiscent of Martha Reeves')  smoothed over the rough patches.  </P> <P> Pato Banton, the young British toaster who was the only second-generation  artist featured, could do no wrong for the crowd during his hourlong set. But  his performance foundered on the question facing reggae's up-and-coming  artists: Can they write songs as memorable as those of their predecessors?  </P> <P> Banton operated in a slick, rock-influenced dance-hall style, but seemed more  concerned with -- and was more successful at -- pushing his personality than  making significant music.  </P> <P> Although some of his socially conscious themes were laudable (anti-apartheid,  anti-cocaine), the presentation was often trite -- as on the sing-along of  "What the World Needs Now Is Love." Banton claimed that he helped pioneer  England's rapid-fire "fast talking" deejay style, but it doesn't matter how  fast you say something if you don't have much to say.  </P> <P> Then again, you could be Burning Spear, a.k.a. Winston Rodney, whose voice  alone is unforgettable. The veteran Jamaican singer displayed the liquid,  grainy voice that gives him the authoritative air of a village elder entrusted  with handing the tradition down.  </P> <P> Unlike Banton's, his 90-minute set made minimal concessions to show-biz ritual.  A "do you want a sing-along?" query during "Slavery Days" was less an  invitation than a challenge -- reminiscent of Robert DeNiro's "you talkin' to  me?" line in "Taxi Driver."  </P> <P> Even as the event celebrated Marley's birthday (he would have been 44 on  Monday), the energy of the artists and the audience seemed to point to the  future. The influx of young fans, who are growing up with their own heroes, may  well be helping reggae move out of Marley's shadow.  </P></p>

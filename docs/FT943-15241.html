			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Beijing hails 'close comrade' It is a measure of the importance Beijing attaches to its relations with North Korea that China marked Kim Il-sung's passing with a 'personal' message from Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, and official condolences from the three most senior members of the Chinese communist party. Mr Deng, 89, hailed the North Korean dictator as a 'great leader' and a 'close comrade in arms'. This is high praise from a leader whose own efforts in the modernisation of China's economy stand in such stark contrast to the ideology of juche, the self-reliance that has kept North Korea isolated and impoverished. Mr Deng sent a telegram to the Workers' Party of Korea central committee saying he was 'shocked and deeply grieved' to learn of the death: 'The life of Comrade Kim Il-sung was one devoted to the national liberation of Korea and the happiness of the Korean people, and one dedicated to the forging and development of Sino-Korean friendship.' To Mr Deng's condolences were added those of Mr Jiang Zemin, state president, Mr Li Peng, prime minister, and Mr Qiao Shi, head of the National People's Congress, presented under joint authorship. Political specialists at western embassies in Beijing played down the political significance of the lavish coverage, saying it was a matter of conforming to protocol and protecting China's long and sometimes strained alliance with North Korea. 'China doesn't want North Korea to feel alarmingly isolated, especially in the middle of the talks about nuclear arms. So it sent a reassuring message. And there is probably some genuine compassion by Deng and the old Chinese leaders for a fellow Marxist revolutionary,' one diplomat said. However, it is unclear how much influence Beijing has over Kim Jong-il, expected to be the new leader. The younger Kim cancelled a visit to Beijing in March last year when China refused to arrange meetings for him with senior leaders.</p>

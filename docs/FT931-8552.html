			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surinam bauxite strike ends BAUXITE MINERS in Surinam have returned to work after a two-week strike. About 2,000 miners were demanding 100 per cent wage increases to keep pace with inflation, but settled for a rise of 40 per cent. There is still a threat of industrial action as the workers are seeking payment for the days they were on strike. The industry, based on a 1.6m tonnes-a-year refinery and a 30,000 t/y smelter, accounts for about 70 per cent of the South American republic's foreign earnings. It is owned by the Aluminum Company of America and Billiton, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell.</p>

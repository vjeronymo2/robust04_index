			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Warburg settles SBC dispute with charity donation S. G. Warburg yesterday settled a 'dealing dispute' between itself and Swiss Bank Corp by agreeing to make a charitable donation on Swiss Bank's behalf. The London Stock Exchange, which had been asked by SBC to consider whether Warburg had broken exchange rules, said yesterday it was 'satisfied that no further action is required'. The exchange declined to say whether or not its domestic equity rules committee had decided that Warburg had actually broken the rules, nor did it state that it was Warburg which had been required to make the charitable payment. An earlier sub-committee of that group had determined that Warburg had violated a rule obliging a marketmaker to fill a 'firm limit order' from a client when the marketmaker had the opportunity to do so. Yesterday, Warburg declined to comment on the matter while SBC said it was happy that the dispute had been settled to the benefit of charity. The exchange said that the issue which SBC presented 'raised unprecedented and complex issues in connection with the interpretation of the exchange's rules'. In particular, it said there was a need to consult with the Takeover Panel on rules about firm orders to buy shares during takeover situations. The dispute stemmed from an unusual offer by Warburg during Enterprise Oil's contested bid for Lasmo when, days before the offer was to close, it - as broker to Enterprise - offered a select group of institutional investors in Lasmo the opportunity to sell their shares at a price well above the market. SBC is said to have complained that although it had left a firm order to sell its Lasmo shares, Warburg failed to meet its obligation to do so. Warburg, in turn, is said to have argued that SBC had left no such order, and that in any event, marketmakers have an option, but not an obligation, to fill those orders before offering to buy shares from elsewhere. It is understood that the exchange's Rules Committee ruled that while the wording of its rule 4.24(b) is unclear, market convention and practice have required marketmakers to fill client limit orders such as that placed by SBC.

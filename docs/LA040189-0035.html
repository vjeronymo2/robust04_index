			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Muslims in Southern California and around the world will begin the monthlong  fasting period of Ramadan on Friday, ceremoniously beginning with the sighting  of the slim crescent of the moon.  </P> <P> Ramadan commemorates the tradition that the Prophet Mohammed received the  revelations of the Koran in 611. The custom of daytime fasting on the ninth  month of the Muslim calendar was initiated by Mohammed and his followers in  624.  </P> <P> From dawn to dusk each day during Ramadan, faithful and physically able Muslims  are expected to abstain from food, drink, smoking and sex.  </P> <P> Each evening meal is a celebration, and mosque attendance grows during this  month, said Muzammil H. Siddiqi, the spiritual director of the Islamic Society  of Orange County in Garden Grove. "Ramadan seems to bind together both  immigrant Muslims and native Americans who accepted Islam during the last 25 to  30 years," he said.  </P> <P> Siddiqi, who has a Harvard Ph.D. in comparative religion, will talk about the  virtually unanimous Muslim objections to "The Satanic Verses," the  controversial novel by Salman Rushdie, in a public lecture at 7 p.m. Tuesday at  UC Riverside. The talk, in the Watkins building on the campus, is co-sponsored  by the Muslim Students Assn. of Riverside and the university's Program in  Religious Studies.  </P> <P> RESOLUTION  </P> <P> The Southern California Board of Rabbis recently recommended that "unfermented  grape juice is made available" in any sacred or social event, public or  private, at all synagogues and that the juice be placed in an easily accessible  location. The resolution was proposed by Rabbi Allen Freehling of University  Synagogue, who said the step would "acknowledge that we have a number of  recovering alcoholics and that children should not be encouraged to abuse  intoxicating drinks." After a year with a similar policy at his Brentwood  synagogue, Freehling said "at least half of the people" prefer the grape juice.  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> The prolific work of John Hick, 67, professor of the philosophy of religion at  Claremont Graduate School, will be discussed by British and American scholars  in a two-day conference starting Friday morning at Claremont McKenna College.  Hick's 20th book, "An Interpretation of Religion," was just published by Yale  University Press. His liberal theological views were the center of contention a  few years ago when he asked to transfer his ministerial credentials to the  Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) from the United Reformed Church in England. Hick  eventually withdrew his request.  </P> <P> ACTION  </P> <P> In a joint letter, regional leaders of 13 Christian and Jewish denominations  "strongly urge" Gov. Deukmejian to sign a bill to curtail sales of automatic  weapons if one of several proposals is passed by the State Legislature. The  governor has that indicated he will sign a measure to control sales of  automatic rifles that have no sporting value. "We believe that prohibiting the  sale and use of particularly deadly weapons such as automatic rifles would  lessen public danger," said the letter, dated Tuesday and written on the  stationery of United Methodist Bishop Jack M. Tuell. Other signers included  Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, Episcopal Bishop Frederick Borsch,  Lutheran Bishop J. Roger Anderson and Armenian Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian.

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Washington presses for better access to China MR Joe Massey, assistant US trade representative, has arrived in Beijing for a new round of market access talks with some rare good news from Washington  -the ending of a ban on purchases of high-performance computers, Nancy Dunne reports. The talks come as the Senate prepares to vote today on legislation setting stiff conditions on continuing China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status. Senator George Mitchell, majority leader, has criticised the administration for lifting the high-technology ban. The sanctions were ended after Beijing sent written guarantees it would observe the 'guidelines and parameters' of the Missile Technology Control Regime. Beijing welcomed the move, while insisting that it does not supply arms for offensive purposes. Mr Massey's attempt to get an agreement to open China's market is part of the US administration's plan to deal with trade disputes through strong trade action rather than removing the broader MFN tariff designation, which puts China on equal ground with most other US trading partners. MFN has allowed China to garner huge chunks of the US market for textiles, clothing and electronics. Mr Massey will be negotiating under a Section 301 trade action launched in October, giving Beijing a year to lift barriers. Washington complains of quantitative import curbs, import licences, undue certification and trade rules. It is pushing for agreement in June.</p>

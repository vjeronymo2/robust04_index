			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Raw nerve of Germany's state banks: Privatisation call fires debate as it challenges core of 'social market' principles A DEBATE has flared up in German political and business circles about the future of the state-owned banking sector after a call by Mr Otto Lambsdorff, economics spokesman for the Free Democrats, for the Landesbanken - commercial banks owned to a large extent by federal Germany's state governments - and Sparkassen - savings banks owned by local authorities - to be privatised. His comments prompted criticism from Mr Horst Kohler, the president of the powerful German savings bank federation, and from Mr Friedel Neuber, chief executive of Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), the largest and most controversial of Germany's Landesbanken. Public sector credit institutions, which enjoy more than half the German banking market, would seem obvious candidates for a sell-off. Privatisation could raise DM100bn-DM150bn (Pounds 40bn-Pounds 60bn) for the cash-strapped German government, economists have calculated. It would also fit with the government's new-found commitment to privatisation - outlined most recently in the economics ministry's policy document on securing the future of Germany's economic base. Influential economists, such as Professor Horst Siebert, head of the Institute for World Economics in Kiel, argue that there are no logical economic reasons why there should be a state-sector banking industry in Germany. Everything that the Sparkassen and the Landesbanken did could be done just as well, if not better, by the private sector, Prof Siebert has said in a spate of articles and interviews. Mr Lambsdorff went further than this last month, saying the public sector institutions had outgrown the special role they played in helping to rebuild the German economy after the Second World War. The only part of Germany which needed state-owned banks now was eastern Germany, he argued. Mr Neuber, the WestLB chief and most prominent public sector banker in Germany, rejected these arguments in forthright terms, saying the fabric of society and the stability of the German banking system would be damaged if it was tampered with. He added that those who called for privatisation were in fact goaded by the state sector's steadily improving competitiveness: 'This has not found favour with everyone,' he said. Indeed, WestLB's aggressive expansion in recent years has angered the private sector banks. The Dusseldorf-based institution is formally house-bank to the state of North Rhine/Westphalia, responsible for innocuous public sector tasks such as managing the state's finances, paying its civil servants' salaries and doling out subsidised loans to support local industry. But Mr Neuber has a broader concept of the role of a state bank. He has built up alliances with other, smaller Landesbanken to diversify beyond its Ruhr-heartland, he has built up an international presence and he has muscled into corporate banking business which for decades was the preserve of the private sector. He has also put together a large portfolio of share stakes in industrial companies. WestLB says the strategy is designed to support the Ruhr-area's regional economy. But to critics it is empire-building on the part of an arm of the Social Democrat controlled state of North Rhine/Westphalia - particularly inappropriate at a time when Bonn has accepted the need to roll back the frontiers of the state. But privatisation in Germany has its limits, and those limits have so far stopped short of the financial sector. The reason is that the state role in banking goes right to the heart of Germany's 'social market' economy - where market forces are tempered by social considerations. Any attempt to tamper with the status quo would unleash powerful forces of opposition, not least in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament which represents the interests of the Lander.</p>

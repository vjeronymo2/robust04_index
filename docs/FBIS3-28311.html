Then, how can the Japanese manufacturing  industry, which strayed into a "black forest," find its way out?  <H5>  Technological Innovations Reach Interim Stage </H5>   It is apparent that the Japanese manufacturing industry will  be on the verge of a crisis if the current downtrend continues.  However, discussions that needlessly incite crises are not  helpful. It is essential, especially at this time, to reexamine  the "map" of our macro and micro measures, find the way out of  the black forest into which Japanese industries blundered and  identify the direction leading to a reliable course.    When Schumpeter analyzed the Great Depression of the 1930's,  he studied the capabilities of the then main industries, such as  automobiles, steel, chemicals, etc., and concluded that these  industries were not in a particularly deplorable state and, to  explain why such a serious depression resulted despite that, he  turned his attention to the overall stage setting of industrial  operations. Though today's Japanese industries have their  respective problems, they are not as dilapidated as the U.S.  industries were over 10 years ago and they have not lost  competitive power like the current high-tech industries of  Europe.    However, it is certain that they are lost in the forest and,  to escape, they must examine what kind of forest it is and where  they are situated topographically.    To do that, first, the so-called map of long-range changes  in  technological innovations, which are the bases of industrial  developments, will be reviewed and the terrain of our present  position will be described. The cyclical theory that long-term  variations in technological innovations are simply repetitious  occurrences is difficult to accept per se, but the conclusion of  our evaluations of corroborative researches made from various  viewpoints is that the possibility is extremely strong that  technological innovations will face a turning point around 1995.  In other words, as widely reported, the present is an interim  stage of technological innovations, when the wave of old  technologies has peaked and the wave of new technologies has not  arrived yet. This viewpoint that it is an interim stage is a  factor adding to confusion in the industrial sector.  <H5>  Reengineering </H5>   To explain our points briefly, the simple sketch shown in  Figure 1 [not reproduced] was drawn.    This sketch was drawn with the present Japanese situation in  mind--when a single technological innovation appears and reaches  the matured stage, the technological system becomes complicated  and multiple interactions are required for the innovation, and  when the cumulative interactions exceed the critical point,  discontinuous changes begin to appear. We call this type of jump  "systemic innovation." As for concrete examples, the "new  synthetic textile," discussed later is a good sample.    However, simultaneously, the next wave of technological  innovations begins to overlap and the theoretical development of  a new paradigm is already apparent. To put it concretely, the  first wave dealt with electronics-related technological  innovations and the next wave deals with molecular biology and  nuclear engineering. The crucial point is that there are  interactions between the performances of the former system and  the theoretical deployment of the latter system. For example, in  the case of the "new synthetic textile," progress is already  being made toward another new fabric through the influence of  molecular biology.    An equally important point is that the two waves are  overlapping the transitional stage toward an  information/communication-based infrastructure in the economic  world.    With these waves overlapping, the viewpoint that Japanese  industries are at an interim stage of technological innovations  is valid one. The assessment of the interim stage will influence  decisions and it is important to acknowledge that this is the  border of twofold opportunities in the sense mentioned earlier.  To say that opportunities are twofold might sound optimistic but  the significance lies in the following two points:    1. The simple wait-and-see attitude or interim viewpoint  that  technological innovations are exhausted, so to speak, and the  next wave must be awaited is not interpreting the present  situation correctly and will not lead the way out of the present  labyrinth. Even if the application of superconductivity,  biotechnology, nuclear engineering, etc. must be awaited for  full-scale technological innovations, the foundation of their  development will be the present electronics technology. That  such a future can be clearly foreseen is providing enterprises  the perseverance to continue current technological developments.    2. Changes and innovations are the focal points of current  problems, but it is not possible to start afresh and redesign.  In assessing the problem, it is important to be prepared for  full-scale systemic reforms but, as long as the economic system  and organization are severely restricted by technologies, the  correct interpretation of the technological and economic  paradigm of present-day Japan is the best and basic course for  systemic reforms and organizational changes.    At present, the concept of corporate "reengineering" is in  vogue in the United States and is attracting attention in Japan  too, but the point that is stressed, "return to the starting  point and redesign business operations," should not be  misunderstood.    To return to the starting point does not mean to start  afresh  with a clean slate. It means to determine again, on a map, the  course that was pursued intently up until now, clearly identify  one's position, and plot a new course for business operations.  As evident from the foregoing discussion, Japanese reengineering  is actually only superposing and it should be undertaken as a  "process" linked to market changes. There is a difference  between that process and the method of readjusting while  maintaining the status quo, and clarification of that subtle  difference is the important point for consideration at this time.  <H5>  Future Production of Goods </H5>   Let us proceed now to concrete discussions. First, with  reference to the aforementioned return to the "starting point,"  where should that point be placed? In the case of Japan, that is  the "production of goods" which closely followed technological  innovations. Despite the software age and the substantial  advancement of service industries, that point remains the same.  The starting point, which enabled Japanese industry to develop  to this stage, was the universally unprecedented elimination of  segregation between blue- and white-collar workers and the  concentration of knowledge, know-how, skills, and intellect on  production of goods.    However, the direction to go from this starting point is not  sheer production of goods. It should be information-based  production, production processes with high information and  intelligence content, and not just single-item production, but  systematized production. Needless to say, Japanese production  will not be profitable unless it develops to that stage if the  present yen appreciation continues.    To state it so there would be no misunderstanding, in an age  when software and designing have become vital, it does not mean  that Japanese industry can be rebuilt by ignoring them. It does  mean that if reconstruction is considered with the past  development route, and with the technologies and financial  resources accumulated during that process as the starting point,  to put it succinctly, the direction toward "information- and  knowledge-intensive production" will be found. The concrete task  of Japanese-style reengineering is to consider the  organizational aspects of how to combine software designing with  manufacturing capability and how to raise the software ratio  while increasing the interactions between them.    Japanese industries will be divided into three main  categories and the basic points of each will be discussed below.    Classified from an overall standpoint, Japanese industries  can be divided into three groups--"intellectual industry,"  "industrial resources industry," and "consumer system  industry"--and with respect to each, industrial characteristics  vary and the method and organization for rebuilding also differ.  <H5>  Intellectual Industry </H5>   In this industry where companies are striving for leadership  in the global competition, the considerable lead taken by the  United States is one of the main causes of anxiety about the  future of Japanese enterprises. In the architectural competetion  to organize and integrate basic software and microprocessor  units, U.S. corporations, such as Intel and Microsoft, are the  dominant leaders and Japanese companies are not even in the race  at the moment. That is why the outlook does not look as bright  as it did during the period after the past oil crises when Japan  restructured its industries by taking the initiative to  introduce electronics technology.    It is true that architectural standardization of equipment  related and geared to computers is important and future  competition will greatly affect the profits of enterprises  involved, but that is not the sole purpose of the competition.  The ultimate objective is to provide a combination of hardware,  software, and services that will satisfy corporate and  individual users.    In the software competition, too, basic software (operating  system) is certainly important, but not exclusively. Recently,  Japanese computer manufacturers are trying to adopt the strategy  of "solution business," intended to present to users solutions  to problems of the overall system, and though it might be an  option they had to select because they were lagging in the  architectural race, it can be said to be viable as a strategic  goal. Unless concrete images of information-based organizational  innovations can be visualized beyond the architectural race, the  demand for computers will not be revived by this competition.    This argument is especially valid from our standpoint that  the present time is the turning point for the basic  infrastructure. Infrastructural conversion is not accomplished  by a sudden switch to an entirely new order but is advanced by  taking actions to complement the existing infrastructure and in  the case of building a new information and communication  infrastructure, too, truly diverse tasks covering the entire  spectrum of hardware, software, and services are essential. To  accomplish that, it is important to learn what needs exist in  society as well as what information-processing and work  capability the end users in the respective work sites should  possess so there are many economic opportunities in the  "solution business," which points out options.    In the semiconductor industry, Japan is ahead in DRAM  [dynamic, random-access memory] development, but lags in MPU  [microprocessor unit] logic. Both are needed, of course, in  personal computers and work stations and, when integrated into a  system, electric power consumption must be kept to a minimum.  Therefore, even if the United States is leading in MPU's, there  is the third alernative of low power consumption where Japan can  display its strength. This third course is not very profitable,  but reduction of computer power consumption, which is already  becoming a big problem, is compatible with the basic move toward  an information-oriented, earth-conscious environment.    Particularly in the case of Japan, because the information  technology is notably lagging in the public sector for various  reasons, fortunately or unfortunately, tasks to be performed  have piled up and the current recession presents an excellent  opportunity to tackle them governmentally. The problem is that  what is essential is not hardware but software, so the urgent  policy measure in the allocation of public investments is to  increase the software ratio.    In essence, the problem is not the lack of financial  resources, but their distribution, and the task can be  accomplished if the present regime changes the financial  allocations as they have promised publicly. Working toward the  policy goal of creating an age of "everywhere computing," when  computers can be used by anyone, anywhere and anytime, and  computers become a natural part of daily living, will provide  the Japanese intellectual industry with a clear direction to  follow.  <H5>  Industrial Resources Industry </H5>   By the industrial resources industry, we refer to the  overall  industry concerned with intermediate resources, such as  machinery parts, machine tools, robots, etc., that support the  manufacturing industry. These industries are fully capable of  carrying out our "systemic innovations," by thoroughly  dismantling the product manufacturing processes and upgrading  each, and then, reintegrating them.    Also, these products are indispensable to the industrial  sophistication of Asian nations and the construction of new  plants by the former socialist countries and on a near-term  basis, a strong effective demand is awaiting in countries which  can be supplied through industrial channels and cooperative  network.    Despite that, these industries are suffering from the  recession simply because of the cyclical effect resulting from  the lack of effective demand within Japan. Particularly in the  case of the machine tool industry, which depends heavily on the  level of plant and equipment investment, the decline in private  equipment outlay is exerting a serious effect. In the United  States, during the recession of 1980's, machine tool capacity  was curtailed because that problem could not be overcome and  that caused the deterioration of the U.S. manufacturing  industry. If the starting point of Japan's international  competitive power is thought to be "production" capability, in  the aforementioned sense, effective demand must be created  through macro measures to prevent the cutback of that  capability, and repetition of the U.S. mistake must be avoided.  There is no reason why effective demand measures of that  moderate extent cannot be enacted.    Another facet that must be dealt with policy-wise is how to  maintain the vital segment of the small enterprise network which  supports the base of the machinery industry. The small factories  in the downtown districts of Tokyo and Osaka are not simple  groupings of small enterprises. As I have said before, this  small enterprise network constitutes a delicate and important  base of Japan's manufacturing capability through its capacity  for speedy trial manufacturing and production of special order  parts requiring unique skills, and its flexible operational  setup for specialization and cooperation. It is a technical  grouping that is rare in the world.    The loss of this capability would be a fatal blow to  Japanese  production capacity. However, at present, this group is clearly  facing a crisis. But at the same time, surprisingly handsome  factories, which do not even look like factories, have begun to  appear recently. Therefore, especially during this business  slump, the new factory law, etc., should be aggressively pushed  and governmental efforts should be made to revive and maintain  this important segment of the technical group as part of the  urban development endeavor. By advancing deregulation, the urban  plans which were set back at the final stage can be revived and  domestic demand can certainly be created.  <H5>  Consumer System Industry </H5>   By the conumer system industry, we refer to the group of  industries that have a direct bearing on our lives, i.e., food,  clothing, and shelter. The policy task facing Japan at present  is how to systematize them and make them efficient and  convenient to use, and in so doing, simultaneously expand  domestic demand while eliminating foreign and internal price  differentials. As concrete measures, here too, policies which  deal with information services and earth environment must be  promoted aggressively.    First, the outlook for "clothing" is rather bright. The  reason is that the technological innovation of producing new  synthetic textiles, which might be called a typical example of  "systemic innovation," has already appeared and is expanding the  market. As for the new synthetic fabric, "the high sensitivity,  which natural textiles do not possess, was attained by applying  a combination of delicate spinning and skillful processing  techniques to existing textiles." Universally speaking, its  creation through the concerted action of a medium-sized Japanese  textile manufacturer and a small textile processing enterprise  in the Hokuriku District makes it an event to record. Even at  this interim stage of technological innovations, an innovation  of this type is possible by devising a new system and as a  result, an old industry, called the textile industry, has been  revived.    This type of innovation produces a ripple effect of a  desirable pattern. In fact, with Toray Industries, which  represents the new synthetic textile industry, as the leader and  with the support of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, numerous  companies are cooperating to establish a so-called "fashion  town" on the shores of Tokyo Bay. Information technologies are  being used widely there and a worldwide exchange center in this  field is being created. It is said that if fashion is included,  the new synthetic textiles have reached a market scale  surpassing automobiles.    Needed now are systemic technological innovations that  create  demand, and policies to support them, including establishment of  "centers" for worldwide mutual exchanges.    Even in the field of "food," similar systematic innovations  are about to take place. Innovations in the distribution sector  are actually beginning to occur and the Japanese industrial  system has begun to change in the field closest to our daily  lives. The use of information technology by 7-11 stores has  become too well-known and everyone takes it for granted, but the  results are impressive. The important factors are that such  advanced information know-how has spread to other distribution  enterprises and other forms of businesses, and that such  technologies and know-how can also be applied to recycling of  commercial products and waste materials.    The removal of regulations will probably further promote  such  activities. Speed in the spread and transfer of technologies and  continued upgrading during that phase have been the superior  aspects of the Japanese industrial system, but that mechanism  has been obstructed by protective regulations in the  distribution field. This is an excellent field in which to apply  the fundamentals of information technology--openness and  downsizing--and by their application in many industries that lag  in efficiency and by their spread throughout the country, the  consumer system industry can develop substantially toward an  information-based, earth environment-conscious system.    As for "shelter," the activities of Tostem Co., which is  systematizing housing construction through use of certain  building materials, and Secom Co., which is introducing  technology in daily livelihood mainly through residential  security services, can be called information-based creative  innovations aimed at developing a full-fledged consumer system  industry. Even among research institutes under the jurisdiction  of the Construction Ministry, there are estimates that housing  construction costs are nearly 20 percent higher than in Europe  and the United States, and some builders claim costs are 50  percent higher. Together with the promotion of construction  materials import, it should be possible to lower costs by about  20 percent. Fortunately, land prices have already fallen nearly  20 percent so Japanese housing costs should drop considerably  and demand can be expected to increase.    This type of price decline, or elimination of foreign and  domestic price differences, tends to be regarded as having a  deflationary effect which will worsen the recession but,  according to estimates of the "International Price Structure  Research Institute," of which I am the director, if Japanese  prices fall to the U.S. level through elimination of  foreign-domestic price differences, real consumer expenditures  will increase by 20 percent per capita through the price  elasticity effect of demand. If the planning begins for the  information-based infrastructure, which we propose, the  livelihood system industries affecting "shelter" will begin to  operate in earnest and will probably change our living pattern.  If that cannot be accomplished, Japan will not be able to stave  off international criticism.  <H5>  Start "Reflective" Actions </H5>   Based on this analysis, Japanese industries have not lost  the  capability to rebuild nor are they incapable of determining the  future course. To take Schumpeter's example referenced at the  beginning, the results of our industrial capacity analysis,  undertaken to clarify the causes of recession, should not at all  lead us to despair.    If that is so, the blame for the causes of recession would  tend to be placed on the failure of government policies, but  such recriminations are not productive. It is important to  analyze and understand the real reasons for the failure and not  only the government but companies and consumers, too, as well as  the market, had failed in greater or lesser degrees.    As stated at the beginning, the essential attitude is to  reexamine the map in the black forest into which one strayed,  confirm the present location of each, and start "reflective"  actions. Reflective in this sense does not carry a moral  significance and means reflective actions, as used in  self-organizational evaluations, to create new activities to  cope with new information.    If the foregoing arguments are analyzed and a reliable  course  is plotted from the general map of Japanese industries, that  would point to the aggressive development of a consumer system  industry centered on information and earth environment. It is  essential for companies and consumers, as well as the  government, to react in response to the determined course and  the self-organized combined and cumulative efforts will create  the strength to override this severe recession.    The organizational principle of the New Deal, which  triggered  the recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, was to  "involve" various organizations in its operations. That was made  possible by the attraction of the New Deal "banner" and the  grassroots movements of the people who responded. In the present  context, that would be self-organizational actions directed  toward information utilization and earth environment  preservation.    Open standards and downsizing are affecting the computer  industry significantly at present, but they are not limited to  the computer sector. Openness means that information will be  displayed publicly, and downsizing is, literally, reducing to a  smaller scale. This is the age of an open world where  information is publicly disclosed and small-scale equipment and  activities link into a network to perform big jobs. If systemic  reforms and organizational changes are tackled after an earnest  study of the true nature of information technologies, the result  will not be decontrol and clever organizational reform just for  appearance sake.    What we need now are mutual interactions between economics  and politics to change the system and organization themselves  reactively as a "process" to such market movements, and our  determination to seek continuation of that action.</p>

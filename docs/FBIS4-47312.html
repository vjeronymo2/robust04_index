G. Bronevich, A N. Karkishchenko, Taganrog </F> Radiotechnical Institute; UDC 519.237.8]    [Abstract] This paper examines rather complex statistical  objects, random processes characterized by their own probability  distributions. The objects are formalized using the concept of a  statistical class, which is introduced in this article. The main  vehicle for describing statistical classes is level sets. These  sets are defined by set-theoretical operations on statistical  classes, in particular, measures of mutual inclusion and  equality of arbitrary classes. Many properties of level sets are  studied in the first part of the article. It is shown that a  group of these sets can be used to define a statistical class.  Operations on statistical classes are a natural extension of  operations on level sets. The link between level sets and the  traditional axiomatic theory of fuzzy sets is described. The set  of minimal events, described in this paper, leads to the  representation of a statistical class in the form of a fuzzy  set. The link between fuzzy sets and probability distributions  is established. The measures of inclusion and equality used for  statistical classes can be transferred to arbitrary fuzzy sets,  and more importantly, to fuzzy intervals and numbers. However,  not every fuzzy set corresponds to a statistical class, and this  is an issue that must still be addressed. References 6: 4  Russian, 2 Western.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Portmeirion 12% up at Pounds 1.6m PROFITS before tax of Portmeirion Potteries (Holdings) rose to Pounds 1.59m for the six months ended June 30, an improvement of 12 per cent over last time's Pounds 1.42m. The figures benefited from a sharp reduction in interest charges to Pounds 27,000 (Pounds 220,000), which reflected lower interest rates on lower bank borrowings. Turnover for the opening half year increased from Pounds 10.43m to Pounds 11.37m but at the operating level profits were static at Pounds 1.54m having been adversely affected by difficulties experienced in the installation of new glazing equipment. Earnings per share rose from 8.89p to 9.88p and the interim dividend is a same-again 2.25p. Looking ahead, the directors said some export markets remained difficult. They added, however, that the major markets in the UK and the US were 'performing well' and that profit margins were expected to improve now that production difficulties were being overcome. The shares rose 4p to 399p.</p>

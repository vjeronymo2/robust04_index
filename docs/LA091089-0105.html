			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WALL OF NAYSAYERS  </P> <P> It should cause little wonder that Sacramento balked at the Oceanside Community  Development Department's proposal for using migrant housing funds  ("Restrictions Keep Migrant Housing in Limbo," Sept. 4). As originally  conceived, that proposal was virtually a "grower giveaway." City Housing  Director Richard Goodman, who loudly decries everyone else's naivete, is  seemingly oblivious of the very sad history of privately run farm-labor camps  in this county. Almost without exception, those camps are badly substandard and  badly overcrowded. Not infrequently, workers are overcharged -- if not gouged.  </P> <P> Moreover, Mr. Goodman apparently rejects the fact that such arrangements are  fraught with potential for exploitation. Time and again, we have encountered  farm-worker families afraid to complain about even serious habitability  problems (for example, raw sewage seepage outside their front doors) because  they stand to lose not only roofs over their heads but their livelihoods.  </P> <P> Conversely, they are all too often reluctant to complain about labor abuses  (for example, failure to pay minimum wage) because retaliation is likely to  take the form of discharge and eviction.  </P> <P> Assembly Bill 617, as amended, does allow for mobile homes on grower  owned/leased land, and for single men. However, it does not compromise the need  to ensure that farm-worker housing underwritten with taxpayers' funds is safe,  decent and affordable, and that applicant families aren't discriminated  against.  </P> <P> Neither does it compromise the need to ensure that the landlord-tenant  relationship is not characterized by intimidation.  </P> <P> Agricultural employers do have a significant role to play in efforts to shelter  their workers, but Oceanside should consider providing other incentives for  agribusiness to house its workers, such as permit fee waivers.  </P> <P> The almost solid wall of naysayers encountered in this county is unprecedented  in our long (nearly 25 years) and wide (from El Centro to Marysville)  experience trying to promote the development of farm-worker housing.  </P> <P> First, housing officials from the county on down said that San Diego was not  sufficiently agricultural to be considered favorably by federal and state  farm-worker housing programs. That straw man was knocked down, but now the  inability to find even scattered, publicly owned sites has been interposed.  </P> <P> Would that the energy expended on finding 10 reasons why such shelter can't be  provided here were used to devise five ways of "making it happen" -- as it has  in 14 other farm counties. If farm-worker housing can be provided in Palm  Springs (on city-donated land), surely it could in, say, the San Pasqual Valley  (90% owned by the city of San Diego) or Fallbrook (a hard-core agricultural  area).  </P> <P> CLAUDIA E.

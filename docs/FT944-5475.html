			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Helping a minnow swallow a whale Much is at stake in RJB's raising of funds for its bid for the English coal mines, not least the reputation of its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd. For BZW has put itself on the line in what one rival calls a 'rather heroic' effort to help a minnow swallow a whale. The BZW seal of approval is an important component of the RJB bid. 'BZW and Rothschild (the government's adviser) obviously add credibility,' said one investor. But, he added: 'Great names have given their names to propectuses in the past and they haven't always worked out.' Mr Graham Pimlott, managing director of BZW, shares the view that an investment bank lives by its reputation. However, he plays down the significance of the RJB deal. 'Other than the publicity surrounding it, it is not significantly more interesting than several other deals we are working on.' The investment banking arm of Barclays is acting as joint adviser on the sale of the government's 40 per cent holdings in the UK power generators. It is by that transaction, rather than the RJB bid, that BZW's privatisation skills will be judged. Nor is coal as attractive a sector as some. Kleinwort Benson took the expertise it accumulated in electricity privatisation to win mandates around the world. Mr Pimlott sees no great wave of international coal privatisations and intends to disband the RJB team. The focus, moreover, is on RJB rather than its adviser. Even a critic such as Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, coal specialist at Kleinwort Benson, the investment banker to a rival of RJB's, conceded: 'You can criticise an adviser but the primary responsibility lies with the client.' The RJB deal does nevertheless matter to BZW. The perfor mance of the enlarged group and its leader, Mr Richard Budge, will reflect on the investment bank's choice of clients. Rival bidders have questioned the accuracy of RJB's assumptions in a bid to which BZW put its name. The investment bank also advised RJB to put in a bid which turned out to be at least Pounds 300m more than rival offers. Even flawless execution is no defence. One BZW executive said privately that somebody would have to take the rap if the bid failed and BZW could receive a share of the blame. There is a definite upside, however. Privatisations are prestigious transactions. 'If you succeed it is a definite feather in your cap,' said Mr Pimlott. The RJB transaction serves also to demonstrate BZW's broking and placing power. 'They are selling the story quite well in face of tremendous criticism,' said one observer. Problems associated with the offer have received such an airing that a successful fund raising will be all the more of an achievement. However, it will be the securities side of BZW, always its stronger dimension, that takes the credit from other investment bankers; not the corporate finance department. 'They bid way more than they need have done. If the broking side pulls it off, then it will be a great triumph for them,' said a director at a UK house.</p>

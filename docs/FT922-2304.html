			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries buoyed by positive inflation comments POSITIVE comments on inflation from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and news of lower store sales helped Treasury prices recovery from early losses yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 101 27/32 , yielding 7.832 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  1/16 at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.971 per cent. The market weakened early on after government data showed an 11 per cent rise in housing starts last month, the largest monthly rise since February 1991. Later in the morning, however, prices moved into positive territory on Mr Greenspan's written testimony to a Congressional committee. He told the committee that the economy was 'poised to make further advances' in trimming inflation. The market was also helped by news of a 0.6 per cent rise in May industrial production, a figure in line with expectations, and a report from the Johnson Redbook Service that department and chain store sales fell 4.5 per cent during the first two weeks in June. UK government bonds shrugged off funding worries and ended the day over one-eighth of a point higher at the long end, on healthy buying interest and better-than-expected Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures. The PSBR amounted to Pounds 3.134bn in May, compared with Pounds 3.464bn in the previous month. The figure was well below many City forecasters' expectations, some of whom had predicted a PSBR of Pounds 4bn. The gilt-edged market has suffered recently due to the combination of funding worries and uncertainty about the prospects of European economic and monetary union in the wake of Denmark's vote against ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. The Bank of England announced yesterday afternoon it would auction Pounds 2.75bn of the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 on June 24. The news led to a slight fall in gilt prices initially as dealers said the auction was larger than expected. The issue will be partly-paid with 35p payable on July 20 and 30p on August 25. The existing issue is about Pounds 1.5bn in size. Despite the larger-than-expected auction size, the market later picked up and the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 traded up to 116 7/32 , from its opening level of 115 7/8 . DANISH government bonds dropped about half a point yesterday after the central bank decided to sell its tap stock well below the level at which it was already trading. Traders estimated about DKr4bn of the 8 per cent bond, due 2003, was sold yesterday after the price was announced. Many complained about the bank's decision to undercut the market price, prompting a fall in Danish bond prices. The yield spread over the 9 per cent German bond due 2000 widened from 108 basis points to 116 basis points. German government bonds traded narrowly, ending the day slightly higher. The Liffe bund future contract traded between 88.02 and 88.16. HOPES of a cut in short-term interest rates nudged Japanese government bond prices slightly higher yesterday. Most of the activity concentrated on short and medium-dated issues, while long-dated bonds ended the day little changed, leading to a slight steepening in the yield curve. The benchmark No 129 closed with a yield of 5.48 per cent, against its opening level of 5.47 per cent.</p>

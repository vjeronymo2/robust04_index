IZVESTIYA has been told this by informed sources at  the Russian Ministry of Defense.    As is known, 104 SS-18 missiles -- the heaviest in the world  -- each with 10 nuclear warheads, and also Tu-95MS strategic  bombers with 240 cruise missiles with a nuclear payload are  stationed in that state. The situation on the nuclear technical  bases where these specialized munitions are stored is becoming  threatening. Particularly in the garrisons at Derzhavinsk in  Turgay Oblast and at Zhangiz-Tobe in Semipalatinsk Oblast, where  two missile divisions are stationed.    The number of nuclear munitions laid in store [are] more  than  twice the permissible norms. The fire alarm system, the fire  extinguishing equipment, and the electric wiring are literally  on their last legs and virtually do not work. If, God forbid,  some untoward situation were to arise, it would be problematic  to get the nuclear warheads out of the building and also to  extinguish the flames -- the consequences do not bear thinking  about. Things are no better in the shop in which operational  checks on the reentry vehicles of strategic missiles are carried  out. For several months now it has been in a precarious  [avariynyy] state. The end wall has come away from the  building, and if it collapses it will bury beneath itself both  nuclear warheads and people.    I was told that there is no heating or water in the special  premises of the missile technical bases. The technical  contrivances for guarding these bases, the engineered structures  -- or more accurately, the wire entanglements -- and the  protection device along which high-tension current passes have  been disconnected from the power supply network, and the mine  fields and signal rockets are not activated when the perimeters  of the guarded sectors are violated by wild animals and people.  The guard subunits are not fully manned, and their training is  at such a low level that you can only be amazed that no one has  yet stolen a single atom bomb. Maybe this is only because it is  so cold now in the steppes of Northern Kazakhstan and criminals  do not feel like going after nuclear secrets.    There is, in principle, just one reason for all these  disgraceful things, which specialists call by the abstruse term  "gross violation of the explosion-and-fire-safety requirements"  -- the lack of an interstate agreement between Russia and  Kazakhstan on the status of, and on the future fate of, the  missile technical bases and the strategic missile troops  stationed on the state's territory.    Although Almaty does not consider itself the owner of these  specific weapons and has announced that the state has subscribed  to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a  country which does not possess them, according to information  from the same source, its officials prohibit the Russian  military from taking them outside the republic to manufacturing  plants and, moreover, do not permit the delivery to the  garrisons of the necessary spare parts and tools or the  equipment for carrying out repair work or the warranty servicing  of nuclear munitions.    The national bank of Kazakhstan does not have a ruble  account  to which Russia could transfer money to pay for the labor of its  officers and ensigns or allocate funds for electricity or to  ensure the garrisons' vital activity.    Owing to chronic nonpayments, the missilemen regularly have  their electricity cut off, and this, so specialists say, could  result in the unpredictable behavior of the entire nuclear  missile complex.    "Things have reached the point," one of the officers who  have  arrived from Kazakhstan told me, "where our pay is smuggled over  the border to us."    But there is nothing to buy in the garrison stores even with  the money that the officers do get -- they are completely empty.  The mood among officers could not be worse. Virtually over  half the nuclear specialists with top qualifications do not wish  to sign contracts for military service here. Deserters have  even appeared among officers, and 14 recent graduates of higher  military schools went absent without leave from one of the  divisions and have not turned up for service for several months  now. Four of them are specialists on nuclear warheads.    According to the information which the editorial office has,  repeated requests from the leadership of the Russian Ministry of  Defense to Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko to  help to organize the normal functioning of the nuclear missile  installations located in the country have not produced any  results. Written requests have not even been answered. Maybe  the visit to Almaty of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will get  something moving. But the military is afraid that this process  might drag on indefinitely. Nuclear weapons cannot wait  endlessly.</p>

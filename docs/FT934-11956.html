			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weak gilts trigger slide in equities THE build-up of downside pressure on the UK equity market continued yesterday as the gilts market came under fire following the biggest ever auction of gilt-edged stock. But many market traders said there had been very little in the way of determined selling pressure in equities. The view of one head of trading yesterday was: 'The Budget, and the probability of a UK interest rate cut, is another day nearer and we have seen no huge weight of selling; if anything I was impressed with the market's stability in the face of a tumbling gilts market.' He also noted that the Footsie future was indicating a firmer opening in the cash market this morning. The FT-SE 100 Index, which has come under increasing pressure since the end of last week, fell another 11 points to 3,154.3, to post a three-day decline of 44.7, or 1.4 per cent since last Friday's record closing level of 3,199. Second-line stocks, on the other hand, were much more resilient, with the FT-SE Mid 250 index down 7.9 at 3,537.1 and continued to outperform the senior index. Since last Friday, when the Mid 250 also reached an all-time peak, the index has come under only marginal downside pressure, easing only 0.2 per cent. And many market observers continued to adopt a bullish stance on the UK equity market. In a pre-Budget seminar, James Capel, regarded as one of the most powerful agency brokers in the City of London, forecast a 3 per cent rise in the UK's gross domestic product next year as well as a series of small tax cuts in the November Budget, with bigger cuts to come. And Capel's equity market strategist, Mr Paul Walton put forward a figure of 4,000 for the FT-SE 100 on a 12 to 18-month view. The broker is looking for a half-percentrage point cut in UK interest rates at the time of the Budget, a half-point more by the end of the year and a further half-point fall next year. There was very little selling pressure in equities as the session got underway, when the FT-SE 100 rallied from a modest opening fall of around points to move confidently in positive territory by mid-morning. At its best the 100 index was almost six points ahead. However, reported remarks made by the new President of the Bundesbank, dampening market hopes of more German interest rate cuts, plus the disturbing news on the UK economy included in the recent Confederation of British Industry survey and the slide in the gilts market took the steam out of the market. A poor opening by Wall Street did little to improve sentiment in London and the FT-SE 100 dropped to a low of 3,152.2 prior to regaining a measure of composure just before the close. Turnover accelerated sharply to 712.2m shares, leaving Monday's 482m and Tuesday's 589m well behind, although the frantic activity in bid target Ferranti, now a mere penny stock, accounted for over 82m shares. The level of customer business transacted on Tuesday also showed a good increase on the previous day, reaching Pounds 1.29bn. From today, the London Share Service pages of the FT show dividends calculated in a slightly different way. The changes, which also affect the dividend yield calculations, bring the figures into line with those used for the FT-Actuaries All-Share index and other FT-SE Actuaries indices.

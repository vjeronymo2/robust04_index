			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Nothing was so like Bush as his leaving: Acclaim in the world and discord at home mark president's exit SOME presidents go out with a bang and some with a whimper. In his final days George Bush seems to be managing a bit of both. On the one side of the ledger, he has authorised military intervention for humanitarian purposes in Somalia, signed the Start 2 treaty in Moscow, given a final push towards concluding a multinational trade agreement and become, at least in words, more active in pursuit of a solution in the former Yugoslavia. He is now also threatening further military action against Iraq. In most of these moves he has enjoyed the sort of broad bipartisan support at home that characterised the high days of his presidency. Mr Bill Clinton, who takes over in two weeks, has publicly endorsed everything and Mr Bush has repaid the compliment by saying the nicest of things in Moscow and in Paris last weekend about his successor. On the other side, in the starkest of contrasts, stands the pardon on Christmas Eve of Mr Caspar Weinberger and five others for any charges connected with the Iran-Contra scandals. That act, and the defensive justification he gave for it, has brought a ton of critical bricks on his head for having short-circuited due legal process, as well as the threat of continued investigation into his own role in the affair even after he leaves office. Mr Bush was not president during Iran-Contra. But there are legacies of his term, such as the courting of Iraq and the improper searches into Mr Clinton's passport records, which have the capacity to haunt him in the future and which, in part of the public mind, serve to offset whatever warmth may be due him for having done the 'right' things in the last two months. Previous presidents have behaved variously in their final days. On the reflective side, Mr Dwight Eisenhower, who came to the office from the army, surprised many with his valedictory warnings about the dangerous growth of a military-industrial complex in the US. Mr Jimmy Carter spoke, more predictably, about the risks of nuclear proliferation. Mr Lyndon Johnson's last act, however, seemed to some more vindictive as he had his administration bring a massive anti-trust suit against International Business Machines, which consumed US courts for a decade to come. Mr Ronald Reagan and Mr Gerald Ford faded on to the speaking circuit and the golf course respectively, though Mr Ford had begun office with the pardon of President Richard Nixon for any Watergate crimes. Mr Nixon, consumed by Watergate, never had the time for final thoughts or action from the White House, though his subsequent reflections have been voluminous. Mr Bush, a self-confessed unreflective man, has not so far tied together the activity of his concluding weeks in any thematic way. Two speeches, in Texas last month and at West Point on Tuesday, were no more than recitations of the changes that had taken place in the world on his watch and some very generalised thoughts on the use of force. Indeed the common thread of the transitional activity is not easy to find. Actions such as the Start 2 treaty and the continuing Uruguay Round talks mostly represent a continuation of policies long in train, though - especially in trade - not always firmly on track. Both constitute the 'old' way of doing things, albeit, in the case of Moscow, with different partners. Yet both Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and Mr Boris Yeltsin had their own good reasons for pushing arms control and were active suitors of the president in three arms agreements. The Somali initiative and the harder verbal line on Bosnia were, in effect, born after Mr Bush had lost the election and the constant and generally cautious advice of Mr James Baker. Both can be said to have been created in a policy and political vacuum, certainly influenced but not necessarily critically, by the wave of publicity that the plights of both countries were exciting. Mr Bush has also had to be careful not to tie Mr Clinton's hands with commitments at which the next administration might balk. But he seems to have sensed that his successor is likely to be active in foreign policy, though not necessarily always interventionist, in areas such as humanitarian policies that were never accorded the highest priority in his own government. Mr Clinton could return the favours by calling the government investigative hounds off Mr Bush's trail, much as Mr Ford sought to calm the country by pardoning Mr Nixon. The difference is that neither Iran-Contra, nor Iraqgate, nor any other attendant matter has quite reached the critical mass that was Watergate: equally, no matter how charitable his inclinations, Mr Clinton might not want to start his brave new administration by appearing to condone secretive and possibly illegal practices in the one just past. So Mr Bush goes out no longer feeling disconnected and with the international strings playing sweet and fond farewells but the domestic bass section rumbling in discord. This was the story of his presidency anyway.</p>

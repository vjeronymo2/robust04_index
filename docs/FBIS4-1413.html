			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- South Africa's  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials worked through  the night to ensure that where there were shortages of ballot  papers on Wednesday, the situation would be remedied by Thursday  morning, IEC chairperson Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said on  Thursday. The printing of 5.4 million additional ballot papers  began on Wednesday afternoon and were already reaching their  destinations throughout the country. Some voting stations may  open a little later than expected but most voting stations  should open on time and in full supply of ballot papers and  other vital election materials, Mr Justice Kriegler said.    He added that the IEC was grateful to the electorate for the  patience it demonstrated on Wednesday despite the many hours  spent by voters in long queues as they waited to vote.    Mr Yunus Mohamed, a director of the election administration  directorate, has also issued special urgent instructions to all  district electoral officers and presiding officers. He said all  presiding officers who have experienced shortages are asked to  get immediately in touch with their district electoral officers,  preferably before they open their voting stations, to establish  when and how they should receive their voting materials. Ballot  boxes had to be properly guarded. Presiding officers would also  keep their voting stations open to ensure that all voters  intending to vote were attended to.    It was also decided that when ballot boxes were full, and if  a station ran out of ballot boxes, presiding officers should, in  the presence of voting agents, empty the contents of the full  boxes into post office bags. Prior to the use of such bags  approval must be obtained from the party voting agents present  at the voting station.    National Peace Secretariat Chairman Antonie Gildenhuys has  been requested by Mr Justice Kriegler to second peace monitors  to the 9,000 voting stations around the country to help ensure  orderly access to voting stations.    This urgent request will override the 500 metre restriction  zone placed on monitors around polling stations until now.</p>

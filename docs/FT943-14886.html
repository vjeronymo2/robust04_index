			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (4): Call for drastic restructure - Kevin Done discusses a report prepared for the European Commission The automotive components industry is 'the weak link in the European motor industry's competitiveness today', according to a controversial report prepared for the European Commission. The study claims that the industry must restructure in the 1990s to close an 'alarming' competitive gap with Japan and warns that more than 400,000 jobs are likely to be shed in the sector by the end of the decade. The report, which was produced by the Boston Consulting Group*, claims that 'unless drastic action is taken soon, the competitive gap in components risks widening even further'. The European Commission has contested the report's drastic conclusions about prospective job losses, but accepts that the 'restructuring needs in the supply sector are particularly important'. In its paper earlier this year to the European Council of Ministers and the the European Parliament on the European auto industry, the Commission says that, 'the international pressure on car manufacturers is being transferred to the EU component manufacturers, triggering substantial structural change'. According to the Boston Consulting Group report the EU components industry, which employed about 940,000 in 1992, and had an annual output worth Ecu92.7bn (Pounds 72bn), 'will be under even greater pressure in the future'. It claims the productivity of Japanese vehicle makers is around 30 per cent higher than that of European rivals, but in the components sector productivity is 2.5 times greater. Employment in the industry is likely to fall to around 500,000 by 1999 from just under 1m. More job losses will follow those already announced in the past two years with several leading European vehicle makers demanding cost and price reductions of more than 10 per cent a year from suppliers. If productivity continues to grow by 4 per cent a year as in recent years, employment in the industry would be reduced by 11 per cent by the end of the decade. 'However, this level of productivity growth would leave the industry hopelessly unviable at the end of the period and in danger of collapse,' maintains the Boston Consulting Group. 'If the European components industry were to reach, in 1999, the level of productivity of the Japanese industry in 1992, then employment would be reduced by 54 per cent, implying a 14 per cent per annum improvement.' Even such a drastic cut in jobs, however, would not guarantee the EC reaching parity with the Japanese industry, which has lifted productivity by 5-6 per cent a year in the last decade. The report says the productivity gap must be at least halved as 'the absolute minimum necessary for the industry to be in a position to survive after 1999'. The structure of the European components industry 'is likely to change radically' with a clear movement to a tiered structure similar to that in Japan. The present fragmented European industry will be forced to restructure and concentrate. Vehicle makers are expected to reduce the number of direct suppliers by around two thirds between 1988 and 1997. 'A concentration of first-tier suppliers to around 500 principal ones in Europe is probable, with only 2-6 main competitors in the EC for most key sub-systems.' The number of companies operating as second or third-tier suppliers may fall by up to a third, warns the study. The greatest challenge to improve productivity in the industry lies among the second tier suppliers, which are often small and medium-sized companies, 'where awareness of means to improve competitiveness is least advanced'. Individual car makers have already taken action to cut the number of their direct suppliers from around 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 at present, but the number is expected to drop The upheaval now under way most critically in the German motor industry among both vehicle makers and their components suppliers is central to the restructuring of the entire European auto industry. Germany alone accounts for 47 per cent of the production of the EU independent components industry (excluding production by the vehicle makers themselves), for 53 per cent of the sector's added value and for 46 per cent of employment. France accounts for 19 per cent of production, the UK for 12 per cent, Italy for 11 per cent and Spain for 7 per cent. Concentration of ownership is one of the main structural changes facing the sector. The process is being driven, says the report, by 'the lack of competitiveness of many suppliers in an extremely fragmented industry,' and by changes in vehicle makers' policies towards: More outsourcing and the transfer of design and development to the supplier industry; The sourcing of components to single rather than multiple suppliers; The purchasing of systems rather than individual components; and The formation of strategic buying alliances. As the industry restructures, it will be transformed. There will be fewer but larger suppliers. They will have a European presence assembling systems in factories near the car plants, and sub-contracting non-core production to second and third-tier suppliers. They will enjoy supply contracts for the life-time of vehicles and will share R &amp; D with the vehicle makers. From a structure based on confrontation between the vehicle makers and their suppliers, the motor industry will also have to move 'towards one based on partnership where profit is shared among the different players in the value chain'. * The Evolving Competitive Challenge for the European Automotive Components Industry.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Klimov report: "Proposing Our Own Partnership </F> Program"]    [Text] What are the main results of the two years that  have passed since the Russian Army was created? This question  was answered by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation  minister of defense, at a press conference for Russian and  foreign journalists. The Armed Forces have become a reliable  guarantor of the state and of the maintenance of stability in  society.    Here are the results of the review of the winter training  period -- 14 units were graded excellent and 61 good. Only 10  units and ships "flunked." The worst state of affairs prevails  in the Pacific Fleet.    Much has been done during the two years, but even more fresh  problems have cropped up. Just as before, attention will focus  mainly on the strategic nuclear forces.    The Armed Forces will retain their five-branch structure at  least until the year 2000. But each branch of the Armed Forces  will undergo substantial changes. For example, seven regiments  of the Strategic Missile Forces will be equipped with new  technology. Special attention will be given to the creation of  an air-space defense in the Air Defense Forces. The Air Force  has acquired two new commands. There are many complications in  the Navy.    There is also the problem of manpower acquisition in the  Armed Forces. Much has been written about the complexities of  the draft and there is no point in repeating it. But the poor  quality of contract recruitment poses a new problem.    The exercises which have been held not only demonstrated the  degree of the troops' training but also highlighted the need for  transition to territorial-administrative commands. Units and  combined units of all branches of the Armed Forces must be  subordinate to a single leader at regional level.    Army Gen. P. Grachev told the journalists a lot, but saved  the main news item until the end of his statement. He  emphasized that no international actions can succeed withot  Russia, without its participation and approval. This was  confirmed by events in Yugoslavia. NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" program will also be impossible without it. But the  program cannot be said to suit Russia in its present form. A  decision has been made to elaborate our own alternative for  partnership. Its name cannot contain the words "for Peace"  because there cannot be any partnership for war. The Russian  program will be examined by the [Russian] Security Council and  will then be endorsed by the Russian Federation president. The  Russian minister will present our program 24 May, when all NATO  countries' defense ministers will assemble in Brussels.</p>

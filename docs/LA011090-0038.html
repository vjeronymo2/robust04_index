			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> BIBS BID TO BE LATEST TREND IN DESIGNER DINNER WEAR  </P> <P> Here's a product both functional and fun. It's Bib-Elite, a fashionable bib  that can keep that lobster, marinara sauce or salad dressing off your tie or  blouse.  </P> <P> The washable bib comes in three styles and fastens behind the neck with a  Velcro-like closure. They can be purchased in 100% cotton or a cotton-polyester  combination.  </P> <P> These 12-by-20-inch bibs are designed for adults, but there's no reason  children couldn't wear them, too.  </P> <P> The most popular model is the Tuxedo, which features lapels, a white shirt and  black tie, says designer Jean Pomerance, president of the Eat Elite Co. in  Sherman Oaks, Calif. The other styles include the Princess, which looks like a  black blouse with a white collar and faux pearls, and the Engineer-Western,  fashioned of blue and white striped work-shirt cloth with a red and white  checkered neckerchief.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Bib-Elites can be found at the Tops Gallery in Malibu or the  This n That Boutique in Temple City. Or they can be ordered for $13.95 plus  $1.50 for shipping and handling from Eat Elite Co., 14844 Dickens St., Suite  204, Sherman Oaks, Calif. 91403; phone, (818) 986-8677.  </P> <P> Bringing the World Into Sharper Focus  </P> <P> Sports fans, opera lovers or bird watchers may want to consider the new Perma  Focus binoculars. They let you see everything from 40 feet to infinity in sharp  focus. And you don't have to adjust them manually; you just look through them  and they focus automatically.  </P> <P> The new binoculars' secret is in their optical elements, "engineered to make  use of the eye's natural ability to focus," say representatives of Jason  Empire, the Overland Park, Kan., manufacturer of binoculars and telescopes.  </P> <P> There are several models with different magnification powers in Jason's Perma  Focus line.  </P> <P> The company suggests the Model 194, a 7x35 binocular, for the sportsman, bird  watcher or baseball fan. For football or auto racing, a wide angle Model 195  might be preferable. Both are lightweight and come with a wide neck strap and  nylon case. They retail for about $70 and $80 respectively.  </P> <P> Boaters, hunters or horse racing fans might prefer the 10x50 Model 196, the  most powerful Perma Focus. It weighs 30 ounces and retails for about $100.  Opera buffs should check out the Model 184, a 6x21 binocular, which fits in a  pocket or purse. It sells for about $60.  </P> <P> Perma Focus binoculars are sold nationwide in camera stores and by chain  stores, including Fedco, K mart, Montgomery Ward, Sears, Service Merchandise  and Target. If you can't find them in your area, contact Jason Empire Inc.,  9200 Cody, Box 14930, Overland Park, Kan. 66214; phone, (913) 888-0220.  </P> <P> Soap Opera Trading Cards Make a Splash  </P> <P> New from Hollywood -- where else? -- are Soap Star! trading cards, 14 3-by-5  cards depicting your favorite actors and actresses from TV's soap operas.  </P> <P> You'll find Kin Shriner, who's been on "General Hospital" for more than a  decade; Barbara Crampton of "The Young and the Restless," and Mary Beth Evans  of "Days of Our Lives," to name a few.  </P> <P> Modeled after the long-successful baseball trading cards, Soap Star! cards  offer exclusive color photographs of each star, says their creator, Jim Warren,  an actor who has appeared in several soaps.  </P> <P> The cards carry a short biography of performers, including a replica of their  signatures. A second set of cards will be available in March. They can be  purchased for $6 by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Red Star,  P.O. Box 3555, Hollywood, Calif. 90078; phone, (213) 851-5111. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Submission warns on dangers of overload THE TEACHERS' submission attacks 'excessive prescription and content overload'. It warns against the 'danger of an ad hoc, subject-by-subject revision which would inevitably lead to a lack of coherence and possible overload'. The proposals follow three headings: An overall view The teachers say it is 'almost universally accepted' that the curriculum in its present form takes up too much time to be balanced and broadly-based. 'Drastic pruning' of the requirements for each of the foundation subjects is essential. At each of its four key age ranges it should concentrate on 'the basics'. General principles would include religious education, and 'the highest priority must be given to reading, writing and basic computation' for seven-year-olds. Assessment 'Many technical flaws remain.' The teachers say this is because the procedure 'suffers from attempting to combine too many features into one system'. These include attempting to measure accurately each child's attainment across an 'enormous range of attainment targets', while using the tests in a diagnostic way 'although the timing of the tests and information obtained from them are not appropriate for this purpose'. They say assessment must 'support not dominate the curriculum', and take full account of continuous assessment by teachers. The review process The teachers want a planned and predictable cycle, or 'shelf life' for reviewing the content of each subject within the curriculum. This would curb the secretary of state's current power to order revisions whenever it is deemed appropriate. Reviews of a subject would start two years before the end of its shelf life. Evidence would be taken from inspectors' reports, teachers and other groups, and proposals would be drafted by a group including teachers, inspectors, and the Department for Education, before being presented to the secretary of state. The proposals would then undergo two stages of statutory consultation, before being finalised by the secretary of state. The submission was jointly drafted by the six unions and endorsed by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, and five organisations of independent schools: the Girls' Schools Association, the Headmasters' Conference, the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools, the Independent Schools Association Incorporated, and the Society of Headmasters and Headmistresses in Independent Schools.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREASURY MAY LIMIT INSURED ACCOUNTS TO THREE PER CUSTOMER  </P> <P> The Treasury Department is considering restricting each American to three  federally insured bank, savings institution or credit union accounts -- no  matter how little money is in each.  </P> <P> The department asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to estimate how much  the proposal would save and to describe potential problems in administering it,  FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Seidman said the idea "has some merits and ought to be looked at," but a  banking trade group, the Independent Bankers Assn. of America, is vigorously  fighting it.  </P> <P> The group sent an "alert" to its members quoting unidentified "top policy  officials" as saying a limit on multiple accounts is "the reform concept most  alive and well in Treasury circles."  </P> <P> "This is not three accounts within an institution -- it is three accounts per  individual, period," it said.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady reportedly has not decided on the idea  yet, but it is being advanced by Under Secretary Robert Glauber, the official  in charge of the Bush Administration's effort to overhaul the financial system.  </P> <P> A senior Treasury official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, stressed  that limiting the number of accounts was "one of a number of proposals floating  around" and "we are not in any sense embracing it."  </P> <P> Glauber is directing the preparation of a department study, due next month. The  study is expected to be the basis of an Administration proposal to Congress  next year calling for the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system since  the Depression.  </P> <P> Economists have cited the broad coverage of deposit insurance as one of the  causes of the savings and loan debacle. Shaky institutions have no trouble  attracting deposits because the accounts are federally guaranteed, they argue.  </P> <P> Brady in July said the Administration was disturbed by rules that permit  depositors to protect far more than the $100,000 insurance limit, either by  spreading their money among institutions or by dividing their money among  individual, joint and trust accounts at a single institution.  </P> <P> However, the trade group's letter was the first indication that the  Administration is considering imposing restrictions that would affect millions  of Americans with much less than $100,000.  </P> <P> Many Americans maintain far more than three accounts. For instance, a depositor  with six accounts -- $1,000 in checking, $5,000 in savings, $2,000 in a credit  union, $10,000 in an IRA retirement fund, and two $1,000 certificates of  deposit -- would be allowed to designate only three of them as insured, even  though the total -- $20,000 -- is far below the $100,000 limit.  </P> <P> "I think tens of millions of people would be adversely affected and their  financial life rendered more uncertain at just the wrong time," said Kenneth  Guenther, executive vice president of the independent bankers group, which  represents smaller, community banks.  </P> <P> "A lot of CDs (certificates of deposit) would wind up not being insured. That  would drive funds from community financial institutions to too-big-to-fail  banks," he said.  </P> <P> However, Seidman said most small depositors likely would consolidate their  accounts so that all of their money was guaranteed.  </P> <P> "This is much more likely to cut back on the guy who has quite a bit more  money," he said.  </P> <P> The senior Treasury official said the definition of an account, for insurance  purposes, could be changed so that savers could combine all of their  certificates of deposit into one savings account with varying maturities.  </P> <P> An option previously discussed by policy-makers was limiting coverage to  $100,000 per person. But because people withdraw and deposit funds frequently,  that would be more difficult to administer than a flat limit on the number of  accounts.  </P> <P> Guenther's group has been lobbying against any cutback in deposit insurance. It  argues that large banks, which regulators believe must be kept from failing to  protect the financial system, would have an advantage in attracting deposits  over smaller institutions whose failure would not threaten the system.  </P> <P> In an effort to kill the three-account proposal, the trade group on Wednesday  sent its members 250,000 protest postcards, to be filled out by bank customers  and mailed to President Bush.  </P> <P> "We hope by Monday there will be 100,000 postcards at the White House," he  said.  </P> <P> Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., S&amp;L analyst who favors privatizing deposit  insurance, said limiting the number of accounts would accomplish little unless  the government also finds a way to allow large banks to fail without  endangering the financial system.  </P> <P> And any proposal that affects the insurance of small depositors likely would  create a political firestorm, he said.  </P> <P> "I don't think it will fly. You will hear a howl like you wouldn't believe," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / French lift rates to defend franc: Only action by the Bundesbank can ease the pressure THE Bank of France yesterday raised overnight borrowing rates from 7.75 per cent to 10 per cent in an attempt to defend the franc against one of the most serious attacks it has suffered within the European exchange rate mechanism. The move, which was followed by a strong joint statement by the French central bank and the Bundesbank, pledging firm co-operation in monetary policy, marked a significant escalation in measures to defend the French currency. Currency traders reported some easing in the strong selling pressure which had forced the Bank of France and the Bundesbank to intervene heavily to support the French currency on Thursday. But the franc remained weak. At between 3.4100 and 3.4180, the franc it was still trading at just over 1.25 centimes above its ERM floor rate of 3.4305 to the D-Mark. Economists in Paris said that the rise in interest rates showed the French government had sent a clear signal that it was determined to fight to maintain the franc/D-Mark parity, even if this meant suffering higher interest rates during a recession. But they added that higher interest rates were not a long term solution to the problems facing the french currency. 'This isn't like the previous franc crises in January and September last year,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'The fact that the French economy is in recession means that it is much harder to convince investors and speculators that a protracted period of high interest rates is plausible.' Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that speculation against the franc would be ended without the need to change other lending rates. 'It will be stifled without touching other leading rates on which our economy depends,' he said in a statement to Le Monde newspaper. He said he was 'convinced that those who have cast doubt in people's minds about our determination to defend the franc will end up paying for it.' But economists said that if short term interest rates were maintained at their new level for more than a few weeks, or even increased, to defend the franc, pressures will mount on longer term borrowings. French banks, already suffering from exposure to company failures and depressed real estate markets, would find it difficult to resist rais-ing base rates, currently at about 8.4 per cent. One French banker said that there would be a delay of several weeks before higher short term rates forced a rise in base rates. He cited the last serious assault against the franc in January when banks kept base rates at 10 per cent, under the central bank rate of 12 per cent and despite a rise in short term rates to about 13 per cent. French politicians voiced strong support for the existing parity and rejected a devaluation of the French franc. 'No example in the world shows that, over the medium term, these artificial devaluations get you anywhere,' said Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the National Assembly's finance committee in a radio interview. His comments reflected a consensus across the political spectrum in support of the franc fort policy of Mr Edouard Balladur. Currency analysts said that the next week would be critical in determining the fate of the franc within the ERM. 'The best hope for the French authorities is a reduction in German interest rates next week,' said one economist at a French bank. 'This would allow French rates to come down again before the pressures from higher interest rates start to mount.' Without a reduction in German interest rates, analysts predicted the franc would continue to come under attack. An economist at a French investment bank said the French government could then be forced into a choice between devaluation or withdrawal from the ERM altogether. 'If they devalue, they will lose a great deal of credibility,' he said. 'They might even be tempted to withdraw from the ERM in the expectation that the economic fundamentals would support the value of the franc.'</p>

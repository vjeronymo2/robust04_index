			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Some 7,000 students of  Korea University in Seoul held a rally on the campus playground  on April 18 before going over to an anti-"government"  demonstration on the lapse of 34 years since the April 19  popular uprising that led to the overthrow of the Syngman Rhee  puppet regime, according to the South Korean KYONGHYANG daily  news.    After the rally, the students burnt an effigy of the traitor  Kim Yong-sam at the university gate and marched to the Suyu-tong  cemetery where the April 19 martyrs lie buried, shouting  "Renegotiate Uruguay Round Agreement!"    On the same day, the university students ran to and from the  April 19 monument, 16 kilometres both ways, engraving on their  minds the will of the students who died a heroic death on the  streets of the April 19 resistance.</p>

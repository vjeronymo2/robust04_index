Polyethylene-Polyethylene composites are an attractive idea  as both matrix and fibre are extremely light, the bonding  between fibre and matrix is likely to be very good and  polyethylene fibres offer excellent stiffness and strength  properties. The resulting composites would have high absolute  properties and exceptional specific properties.    The drawback in the past has been that orientated  polyethylene fibres tend to lose their properties at  temperatures in excess of 120 degrees Celsius, making any melt  processing of the matrix impossible.    The IRC's approach is to use a hot compaction process where  fibres of high modulus polyethylene are pressed together at  elevated temperatures. Critically, however, only a small  proportion of the fibres are melted -- enough to bind together  the remaining fibrous material. The requirement is that nine  percent of the fibre is melted, with this material binding the  composite together as it cools. Sufficient pressure is  introduced to stop shrinkage and to retain fibre orientation,  but not to inhibit melting.    The resulting composites are claimed to offer strengths at  the level that might be expected from conventional composites  with an equivalent starting quantity of polyethylene fibres, but  with reduced stiffness. The exact mix of stiffness and  strength, however, is variable according to the exact processing  conditions selected.    The process also works with other fibre types including  polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene and liquid  crystal polymer.    The IRC is now examining the material for applications in  the  biomedical field such as dental plates and bone replacement  material.</p>

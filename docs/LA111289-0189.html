			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> DON'T PAY HOME LOAN WITH A MONEY ORDER  </P> <P> QUESTION: Two months ago, my out-of-state mortgage company claimed they did not  receive my mortgage payment. They sent me a nasty computerized late notice  demanding my payment plus a $49 late charge. But I have a perfect on-time  payment record and they know it, so there was no reason to get nasty.  </P> <P> I contacted the grocery store where I bought the money order for the mortgage  payment but the manager says it will take at least two months to trace if the  money order has been cashed.  </P> <P> When I sent in my payment for last month's mortgage payment, the mortgage  company sent it back with a rude letter, refusing to accept it because they  claim I still owe the payment for two months ago plus the $49 late charge.  </P> <P> This lender doesn't have an 800 toll-free phone number and when I try to call  them I always get a busy signal. Yesterday, they sent me a notice giving me 10  days to pay or they will begin foreclosure. What can I do to clear up this  mess?  </P> <P> ANSWER: In the future, never, never, never make important payments by money  order. As you discovered, tracing a money order is virtually impossible.  Incidentally, I repeatedly warn my tenants not to pay rent with money orders  but they keep doing it. Get a checking account so you can control your  finances. Not having a personal checking account is extremely foolish.  </P> <P> Somehow, you've got to talk to a supervisor or officer with the mortgage  company. Perhaps if you call information in the distant city you can get  another phone number for the lender that isn't always busy. Work out an  arrangement to pay the two missing payments. Most lenders will waive a late  charge if you are forceful. Emphasize your excellent payment record.  </P> <P> You should know that lenders earn millions of dollars in late payment fees, so  they are eager to claim loan payments were received late. To prevent your  problem from reoccurring, after you get your personal checking account, send  your lender 12 post-dated checks for the next year.  </P> <P> Enclose a letter explaining you want no more hassles and send it via certified  mail with a return receipt. I've used this tactic with several nasty loan  servicers and have had no further attempts to extort late charges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Lenders More Flexible Than Others  </P> <P> Q: My husband and I are frustrated prospective home buyers. We have saved  almost $20,000 for a down payment and our parents will help us with any  additional amount we might need. But our problem is qualifying for a mortgage.  </P> <P> We talked to a loan officer at the S&amp;L where we have our savings and  checking accounts. She said we don't earn enough income. But we pay our bills  in full each month and only have one installment loan for our car and it will  be paid off in a few months.  </P> <P> We were so proud of ourselves for saving almost $20,000 in just a few years,  but when the loan officer said we couldn't get a large enough loan to buy the  home a local realty agent had shown us we were heartbroken. Any ideas?  </P> <P> A: Yes. You were probably talking to the wrong lender. There are "good guy" and  "bad guy" lenders. The "bad guy" lenders are inflexible and require their  mortgage borrowers to meet the tough, unreasonable loan standards of the big  secondary mortgage market buyers such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  </P> <P> You were probably talking to such a lender. For example, if your loan payments  will take over 28% of your gross income, Fannie and Freddie don't want to buy  your loan. I'd like to know where they got that low percentage. Borrowers in  circumstances like yours can obviously afford to pay more of their income for  mortgage payments.  </P> <P> But the "good guy" lenders are the flexible portfolio lenders or the lenders  who sell their loans to more reasonable secondary market buyers such as pension  plans and insurance companies.  </P> <P> Portfolio lenders, including some of the nation's largest loan originators,  keep mortgages in their loan portfolios several years to "season" it. Then the  lender may sell it after you have established a solid payment record.  </P> <P> Some flexible portfolio lenders will approve home loans where payments take up  to 50% of gross income when the borrower has good credit, good income and few  debts.  </P> <P> Questions and comments may be sent to the Real Estate Editor, Los Angeles  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

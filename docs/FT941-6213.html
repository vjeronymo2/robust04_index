			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Aerospatiale wary of superjumbo project - France's increasing reluctance to continue with joint studies Europe's four leading aircraft manufacturers are to hold talks in London today with Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, to decide whether to pursue joint studies for the development of a 600-800 seat superjumbo airliner. The meeting comes amid signs of increasing reluctance on the part of Aerospatiale of France to continue the joint studies between the four partners in the European Airbus consortium and Boeing. France has been particularly angered by the recent decision of Saudi Arabia to place a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) commercial aircraft order with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US after intense pressure from the US administration. The French Airbus partner also appears worried over Boeing's motives in collaborating with the Airbus partners on a superjumbo airliner project. Airbus Industrie itself has suspected from the beginning that Boeing was attempting to split the four partners at the same time as stalling Airbus's own plans to develop a large aircraft to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the jumbo market with its 747-400 airliner. The Airbus partners including Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), British Aerospace and Casa of Spain agreed last year to conduct an economic and market feasibility study jointly with Boeing on a new 600-800 seater airliner. The chief executives of the four European companies will review with Boeing these studies at today's meeting and decide whether to pursue further studies. Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, recently indicated he expected the parties to agree to continue studying the superjumbo project. But he did not envisage any early decision to launch such an ambitious programme at a time of continuing overcapacity in the airliner market. Boeing also appears reluctant to launch another costly programme at this stage because it is already involved in the development of its new 777 widebody airliner, a new derivative of its 737 narrow-body airliner and a cargo version of the 767 twin engine airliner. Boeing has also continued its own independent studies on developing a very large aircraft or stretching the 747-400. Airbus for its part formed its own integrated design team six months ago to study the development of an Airbus jumbo airliner, the A3XX, to challenge Boeing. Although France appears disenchanted over collaboration with Boeing and may decide to pull out of the joint studies, the German partner yesterday said it remained interested in the collaboration project. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chief executive, spearheaded the original collaboration project between the European manufacturers and Boeing on a superjumbo. The rationale behind collaboration is that aircraft makers believe there is unlikely to be room in the market for more than one very large airliner.</p>

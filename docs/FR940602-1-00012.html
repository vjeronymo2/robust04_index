			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One possibility would be for the Board to promulgate a rule or several rules which are specifically tailored to these particular industries. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  It is possible, though not certain, that the issue of separate appropriateness when raised in different industries may present different considerations. For example, a rule which finds a single facility appropriate, in part, because of a defined insubstantial amount of interchange among locations may differ between the trucking industry and the retail industry because of the differing nature of the duties of the employees in the two industries, including their itinerant as opposed to stationary work stations, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is not the Board's present intention to promulgate rules for any particular sub-categories or sub-industries within the retail, manufacturing or trucking industries. The Board's intention is to promulgate a rule or rules with the broadest applicability possible within these three generic categories of industries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another possibility would be to promulgate a single rule applicable across all three industries, deeming appropriateness to be determined by reference to several specified factors. For example, a rule could be promulgated which would declare appropriate any separate facility unit requested where (a) A given number of employees_for example, 15_were employed, or (b) no other facility of the employer was located within a specified distance_for example, one mile_and where, in addition, a supervisor within the meaning of the Act, located at the site, oversaw operation of the facility requested. Extraordinary circumstances would render the rule inapplicable. One such extraordinary circumstance might be where a set percentage (e.g., at least 10 percent) of the employees in the unit sought performed work at other locations a certain percentage (e.g., at least 10 percent) of the time (frequently referred to as temporary interchange.) Because they have seldom made a difference in prior Board decisions, permanent interchange would no longer be deemed relevant; nor would centralization of personnel functions, functional integration, or contact between employees at the facilities. If extraordinary circumstances were present, or if the rule were for other reasons inapplicable, the issue would be decided by adjudication, under published precedent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule or rules also may address the definitional question of what constitutes a single facility. See, e.g., Child's Hospital, 307 NLRB 90 (1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous other possibilities present themselves on these subjects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the fact that the Board has made no decision on the propriety of any form of rulemaking in this area, we invite all interested parties to comment on (a) The wisdom of promulgating a rule or rules on this issue in the three specified industries, and (b) the appropriate content of such a rule or rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Member Stephens and Member Cohen <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The rule declaring the presumptive appropriateness of a single facility bargaining unit has had a long and somewhat stable history, unlike the Board's turbulent experience with health care unit determinations that prompted our rulemaking on that subject in 1987. Nevertheless, given the prevailing view of our colleagues that the single facility presumption should be reexamined and perhaps strengthened, we have no objection to considering the matter in the context of informal rulemaking. Unlike case adjudication, an advance notice proceeding such as this will enable the Board to solicit comments from a broad cross-section of interested persons before making a final decision on the relevant issues, including whether rulemaking is at all warranted, whether (and how) the substantive law defining the pertinent factors that can rebut the presumption should be changed, and whether indeed extensive (and perhaps unnecessary) resources are being expended litigating this unit question. Until the appropriate administrative record is compiled, we join our colleagues in deferring a final decision on any of these questions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: Washington, DC, May 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By Direction of the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> National Labor Relations Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph E.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: TRW to collaborate with Fiat subsidiary TRW, the US automotive, space, defence and information technology group, and Magneti Marelli, Fiat's motor components subsidiary, have signed an agreement to collaborate on the development and sale of advanced control systems for vehicles. Florida-based TRW Active Control Systems will provide computer-controlled 'active' rear steering and suspension components and technology for Magneti to integrate into full working systems. Active rear wheel steering and suspension systems are potentially two market growth areas for component suppliers. In the former, a system of sensors monitors factors such as speed, driver steering input and side forces. At high speeds on motorways, an active rear steering system could automatically compensate for sudden severe side winds or the vehicle being blown off course while passing a truck. Active suspension is expected to allow sensors to read an uneven road and compensate for it by controlling movements of the suspension - a system seen on some grand prix racing cars. Although Magneti is 61 per cent owned by Fiat, Italy's largest industrial group, only 36 per cent of its sales are made to Fiat. It will be looking to sell the systems to vehicle makers throughout Europe. Currently its biggest single customer outside of Fiat is Renault of France. The venture involves collaboration between existing entities within both partners. There are no plans to form a joint venture company and TRW will pursue the North American market for such systems on its own. Magneti, headquartered near Milan but with subsidiaries throughout the world, designs, develops and manufactures a broad range of components and vehicle systems involving advanced electronics, instrumentation, lighting and air conditioning.</p>

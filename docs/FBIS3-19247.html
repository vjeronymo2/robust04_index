			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Margarete Limberg] </F>   [Text] Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf  Scharping appeared to be highly satisfied with Gerhard  Schroeder's election success. When praising his former rival  for SPD chairman, Scharping did not miss the opportunity to pay  due tribute to the federal SPD too, which he is heading.    [Begin Scharping recording] It has been a clear victory for  Gerhard Schroeder and the Lower Saxon SPD, and the principal  credit goes to them. The success is the result of high  concentration on issues of economic development, fighting  unemployment, and the restoration of social rights, against the  background of remarkable achievements in the land in terms of  housing construction, kindergartens, and education policy. The  fact that, at a federal level, the SPD has become a stable  force, was certainly not a disadvantage -- I think it was even  helpful. [end recording]    Gerhard Schroeder had given assurance that he and Scharping  were only temporary rivals while now they were friends again  just as in the past. Moreover, he is certainly too intelligent  to indulge in excessive muscle flexing. Nevertheless, Schroeder  will not hide his light under a bushel, and his weight in the  federal party has certainly increased.    Despite the satisfaction about the good start into the 1994  super election year, Rudolf Scharping's statements were  characterized by his traditional sobriety. He said that the  election victory gave the SPD the opportunity to achieve clear  leadership.    [Begin Scharping recording] From that aspect, the result is  optimal. It does not mean the trees will grow to unprecedented  heights but it indicates that we do have good chances and that  we have to continue our hard work and maintain our high  concentration. I would like to warn everybody in our own party  against sticking their noses up in the air. [end recording]    Lower Saxony is the first land in which a coalition between  the SPD and Greens went through a whole legislative term, and in  which the SPD was not harmed through its alliance with the  Greens. Nevertheless, the SPD leadership does not yet want to  draw any conclusions from that for the Bundestag election and,  what is more, does not want to have a coalition discussion  forced upon it at an early stage. The goal of becoming the  strongest party has now become even more realistic, Scharping  said, and he anticipates that the offer of coalition partners  will be larger than the demand -- which, as everybody knows, is  something that always reduces prices, he said.    Scharping assessed the renaissance of the main parties,  which  won 80 percent of the vote in Lower Saxony, as positive. This  is a sign that there is still a chance to reduce the public  irritation with politicians and political parties, Scharping  said. In addition, it was encouraging that the Republikaner  were given a rebuff. Nevertheless, their share in the vote was  still much too high, Scharping concluded.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have revised &sect;409.45(c)(2) to allow provision of medical social services on a short-term basis to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver if it can be demonstrated that the service is necessary to resolve a clear and direct impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery. Though this change could increase program expenditures, we believe the additional cost will be negligible because of the low volume of these services and offsetting savings if the beneficiary's rate of recovery is improved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several changes made to the proposed rule will benefit HHAs' administration and utilization of home health aides. We have revised &sect;484.36(b)(2)(iii) to allow a home health aide to receive the required 12 hours of in-service training during a 12-month period instead of each calendar year. This change allows HHAs some flexibility in scheduling training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters opposed the requirements of proposed &sect;484.36(d)(2)(i) and (ii). We agreed and are deleting those sections from the final rule. Therefore, we are not mandating supervisory visits once a month while the home health aide is providing patient care, or mandating supervisory visits while the aide is furnishing services in all instances if the home health aide services are provided by an individual not employed directly by the HHA. These changes allow HHAs additional flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 409.43, 484.18, 484.36, and 484.48 of this document contain information collection requirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504), we have submitted a copy of this document to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these information collection requirements have been previously approved under the information collection requirements contained in the conditions of participation for home health agencies. These information collection requirements implement patient rights provisions and set forth home health aide criteria; they were approved under the OMB approval number 0938&hyph;0365 on June 24, 1991 through December 31, 1993 by OMB in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). We are requesting reapproval of the collection requirements in those sections. Public reporting burden for these collections of information is estimated to be six hours per home health agency per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 409  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Health facilities, Medicare.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 413  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Health facilities, Kidney diseases, Medicare, Puerto Rico, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 418  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Health facilities, Hospice care, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 484  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Health facilities, Health professions, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low for APV APV fell 6 1/2 to to a new low for the year of 61 1/2 p after the food processing equipment specialist denied a weekend report that it was in danger of breaching banking covenants. Turnover was heavy at 2.6m shares. The group, which last month cut the interim dividend and said profits margins were under increasing pressure, last week ousted its chief executive and warned of an unspecified charge to cover further restructuring at its liquid foods division. APV said that on current projections, it expected to stay within its covenants, but declined to detail what they were. Analysts' estimates of the restructuring charge range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m. Market talk suggested that a number of potential industry bidders were beginning to run their eye over the shares which were 138p earlier this year.</p>

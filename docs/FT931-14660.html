			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Fashion: Full pelt into the world of fakes - Lucia van der Post says today's array of synthetic furs means animal magnetism is not just skin-deep ANYONE WHO has ever shrugged their way into a real fur can feel at once that it is warm, glamorous, sexy and, as if many women needed any further persuasion, it lasts almost forever. But, outside the frozen tundras of Alaska and Siberia where wearing fur could be said to be essential for survival, there has always been another, hidden cost - the aura of the idle rich, of Hollywood excess, the faint hint of the kept woman and, in more recent times, of being unaware, uncaring, spoilt. Since those long-gone days when Elinor Glyn desported herself so exuberantly on a tiger skin, attitudes have changed - real fur may be softer, warmer, longer-lasting, a better investment (and it is all of those things), but, by and large, most of us prefer not to wear it. Some do not dare, some genuinely do not want to and others cannot afford it. The good news, though, is that the alternatives get better and better. Fake fur used to look stiff, garish and - not to mince words - just a bit common. Modern fibres and mixtures, as well as new ways of treating the fibres, mean that the latest generation of fake-fur fabrics are softer, warmer and infinitely more appealing than their predecessors. They take colour better - prints can be soft and subtle, like the smudgy grey and black hooded duffle coat (above) or deliberately, flauntingly bold and eye-catching like Sportmax's glamorous car-coat (above, right). Some ape the real thing alarmingly realistically, others home in on strange and unearthly mutations of leopard, panther, cheetah, tiger, ocelet. Above all, though, the appeal of the furry numbers featured here is that they are nearly (but not, it has to be admitted, quite) as warm, as cuddly, and as glamorous as their natural counterparts - but all are a great deal cheaper. If a full coat is not what you are looking for, a range of sumptuous accessories in fake fur has arrived in the shops this winter. Jilly Forge, for instance, in her own shop at 14 Addison Avenue, London W11, has some long fur-cuffed gauntlets, silk-lined, in chocolate, white, light brown or black at Pounds 70 a pair that would add panache to almost any outfit. She has a big range of warm, soft squashy hats in almost every shape and colour, from chocolate and light brown to black and white (prices range around Pounds 65), as well as muffs (Pounds 65) and velcro-fastening fur-collars (Pounds 70) which could add instant glamour. At Fenwick of 63 New Bond Street, London W1, there are some adaptable 'fur' pieces in mottled-grey animal print which can be used to glamorise gloves, coats (add them as cuffs) or the tops of boots. At Pounds 19.95 a pair, they are a bit of fun to cheer up a grim January or February day. If you still have not bought a winter coat and are thinking that perhaps a fake fur is the answer, Fenwick has the most reasonably-priced classy version fake I have seen - once Pounds 259, now reduced to Pounds 199, it features a soft grey cat print and is cosy enough to see you through any number of chilly winter days. Finally, anybody out and about on the high streets will have noticed that the fad for jungle prints has strayed far beyond just coats - from T-shirts and leggings to Versace's much-photographed (particularly on the Duchess of York) silk blazer; versions, some chic, some kitsch, are everywhere. You could buy an outrageous body or a chiffon shirt, a simple scarf or a luxuriously soft twinset such as the one here from Laura B. You could pay as little as Pounds 12.99 for leggings (at C&amp;A, which has a complete feline collection of its own) or several hundreds for a Versace jacket. The main thing to remember is that animal prints may be fun, a bit of tongue-in-cheek, but they are dangerously easy to over do. If in doubt, do not don more than one spotted number at a time and keep the background colours to grey or black or brown.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah 'Ali Akbar </F> Meshkini-Qomi in Qom on 17 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] Apparently, during the same  gathering in Crans Montana an interview was arranged where the  Iranian president carried out an interview with them by  satellite -- for questions to be put to the president and the  respected president to respond to them. He replied and made  Iranians proud. I listened to the contents of the president's  replies. They were all excellent. The nation endorses such  issues [crowd chants: "God is great," "Khamene'i is the leader,"  "Death to the anti-independence and revolution"], especially as  his remarks were in accordance with the high objectives of the  nation and in line with the wishes of our great leader  [Khamene'i]. I hope that God makes his words effective.    Another point I should mention here is that the eminent  leader's directions should be implemented by the people. When  we speak of the eminent leader... [pauses] The same reasons that  since the era of the Shaykh Mofid [Islamic scholar] until now  have given the great personalities and sources of emulation  legitimacy, religious authority, religious leadership, influence  of word, authority to be obeyed, they have made our great  leader, Ayatollah Khamene'i as well. [crowd chants: "Peace be  upon Prophet Muhammad and his scion"] We recognize the authority  of our leader as a leader for the same reasons that we  recognized the grand Ayatollahs Esfahani, Borujerdi, Hakim,  Ruhollah [Khomeyni], Golpayegani, and 'Araki, may God extend  their shadow.    Please pay attention: His order is influential. If even a  religious leader issues a fatwa [religious edict] and Khamene'i  issues a ruling, that ruling takes precedence over the fatwa.  If a religious leader has written a book of religious practices  -- and he has the right to do so, he is an honorable source of  emulation -- he has written in his book of religious practices.  I think it is religiously forbidden to enter arms deals with a  certain country. That becomes a fatwa. Then the leader sits  down and finds that to deal in arms with such and such a country  is appropriate today. He issues a ruling that the government  should sell arms. The government is obliged to carry out the  ruling and set aside the fatwa, that is because the religious  leaders here say: A ruling cancels a fatwa, but a fatwa does  not cancel a ruling.

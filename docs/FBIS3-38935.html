			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb 9 (AFP) -- NATO sought Wednesday [9  February] to reach a consensus on airstrikes against the Bosnian  Serbs, with sentiment growing for giving them a warning to  withdraw their artillery from Sarajevo, alliance sources said.    A NATO source said "a majority, not everybody" in the  16-member alliance was in favour of putting the Serbs on notice  following the mortar attack last weekend that killed 68 people  in Sarajevo's central market.    But NATO requires unanimity to take a decision and Greece  has  come out strongly against the airstrikes. Canada has also  expressed strong reservations for fear of reprisals against its  troops serving in Bosnia.    In Washington a U.S. official said the United States would  ask its NATO allies to authorize bombing raids against the  Bosnian Serbs unless they pulled their heavy weapons back from  the hills around Sarajevo.    The NATO source said two proposals were on the table at a  meeting of NATO ambassadors here, one by the United States and  France and the other by Britain. Both contained the notion of a  warning but avoided the word ultimatum.    The aim would be to give the Serbs seven to 10 days to  withdraw their heavy weapons at least 20 kilometers (13 miles)  from the predominantly Moslem Bosnian capital. The Bosnian  army's artillery would be put under international control.    The source expressed optimism for reaching a consensus.  "Last  night we were closing together," he said.    The alliance was to consider a request by UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to authorise the use of its  warplanes for a punitive action to deter future attacks such as  Saturday's slaughter in Sarejevo's market.    But NATO, stung to action by the worst incident in the  22-month-old conflict, appeared to have a broader purpose in  mind: lifting the siege of Sarajevo immediately as urged Monday  by the European Community.    In Washington Secretary of State Warren Christopher  emphasised that the military threat was paired with a vow to  step up pressure on Bosnia's three warring factions to reach a  political settlement.    Christopher said the military and diplomatic initiatives  were  "very closely interrelated. They are interlocked. One does not  take the place of the other. They go together."    Clinton approved the twin-pronged response to the grizzling  [as received] shelling of Sarajevo's market on Tuesday.    During the day he talked by telephone to French President  Francois Mitterrand, French sources said, but declined to give  details.    Clinton also telephoned Canadian Prime Minister Jean  Chretien, and tried but failed to contact British Prime Minister  John Major, said a senior administration official who asked not  to be identified.    Canada and Britain, the largest contributors to the UN  Protection Force in Bosnia after France -- which has deployed  6,000 blue helmets, are reluctant to back Paris' call for an air  strike, fearing it might expose their own troops to Serbian  retaliation.    Washington hopes to find "an agreeable position" with Paris  on a minor sticking point relating to the distance to which the  Serbian artillery should pull back from Sarajevo, the senior  administration official said.    But as far as an agreement within NATO in the Brussels  meeting, "I don't know if this will happen tomorrow," he added.    The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John  Shalikashvili, warned a Senate committee on Tuesday that air  power was limited.    "Air power alone can not bump someone into a peace treaty,"  he said.    He said NATO's North Atlantic Council would discuss "whether  you can use limited air power not to stop, but to reduce, the  chance of a tragedy that occurred in Sarajevo the other day."</p>

Parkhomenko, Dr. of Technical </F> Sciences, Professor: "Test Range Leaves Estonian Republic"]    [Text] Renewal of the Russian Navy within the framework of  the new military doctrine is possible only on the basis of  extensive scientific research, both theoretical and  experimental, to include testing of weapons, equipment and the  ships themselves in the field.    Today, one of the most important qualitative characteristics  of a ship is its detectability by the enemy's reconnaissance,  observation and target indication equipment, and the degree of  protection afforded against weapons having guidance systems  reacting to ship physical fields.    As we know, the parameters of ship physical fields are  measured by both maneuvering (ship) and stationary (test range)  resources. Both are used in the Russian Navy (in distinction  from the U.S. Navy, which uses test ranges only). Maneuvering  resources are mobile, and they make it possible to take  measurements in different regions of the sea; however, owing to  their metrological features they are used primarily for directly  checking the correspondence of the levels of ship physical  fields to established norms. Stationary systems do not require  special deployment for measurements, which significantly reduces  testing time and provides for acquisition of broader  information, and they can be used effectively in the course of  scientific research.    Under today's conditions, both our test ranges and those of  foreign countries carry out a large number of specific tasks,  including in particular: accumulation and analysis of data on  the physical fields of ships of different classes, participation  in creating new monitoring, measuring and analyzing equipment,  development of the procedures of measuring, checking and  standardizing ship physical fields, testing and improvement of  these procedures in the field, and research on ship physical  fields, particularly with the goal of revealing sources of  fields exceeding prescribed levels and developing  recommendations on how to reduce them. Our test ranges carry out  these and other jobs in this area both independently and jointly  with other naval organizations, industrial enterprises and  institutions of the academy of sciences. In this case, the  effectiveness of the research is related to the territorial  location of the test range. Proximity of scientific research  institutions of the corresponding profile, together with their  specialists and modern apparatus, the possibility of utilizing  the production base of industrial enterprises to manufacture  models of instruments and equipment, and use of ships given over  to the navy for testing under comprehensive programs are factors  helping to increase this effectiveness.    Nor should we forget another function of test  ranges--training personnel with the needed qualifications for  institutes and directorates of the navy, the Naval Academy and  naval institutions of higher education.    These specific tasks were assigned in particular to a test  range near Tallinn and to a research base in the Crimea.  However, in September 1992 the base located in Balaklava was  incorporated into the Ukrainian Navy, to a significant degree  through the efforts of base commander Captain 1st Rank O. Prodan  and his deputy Captain 1st Rank S. Chubarov. The base is  currently undergoing reorganization, placing its further  existence in doubt. The fate of the test range, which celebrated  its 40th birthday on 12 September 1993, was different.    Established in 1953 in Khara-Lakht Bay, 75 km from Tallinn,  the Naval Test Range No 1 was essentially the only large  scientific research center studying ship physical fields in the  Baltic. It may be said without exaggeration that the entire  country built it. This was a unique facility. The test range  possessed sonar and hydrodynamic test beds, a test bed for  magnetic treatment of ships and adjustment of steering controls,  a magnetic modeling laboratory, an electric field laboratory and  a large number of hydraulic engineering structures. Close to  1,000 surface ships and submarines of dozens of designs passed  through these facilities; 50 scientific research projects were  completed, and the results were introduced into naval  requirements, into manuals and regulations on ship protection,  and into specifications of new equipment and apparatus.    Under the leadership of Rear Admiral Ya. Krivoruchko and  captains 1st rank L. Dubinin, R. Krupnov and V. Chizhevskiy, in  the 1970's the test range became a huge scientific research and  testing organization having extensive ties with the USSR Academy  of Sciences, the State Standards Committee and enterprises of  ship building industry. During this time it significantly  widened and strengthened its ties with enterprises and  organizations of the Estonian SSR. Officers of the test range  took a direct and active part in testing of the latest ships and  submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets, and organized  special research. The results served as the basis for developing  measures to produce physical fields of ships currently afloat,  ships under construction and those still on the planning boards.    The test range's associates have heard uncontested praise  for  developing the methods and resources of measuring ship physical  fields and processing the data. In the navy they were the  pioneers of automating their measurement and analysis. Nor  should we forget the test range's contribution to training  highly qualified specialists. More than 20 of its associates  have become scientists with higher degrees.    The 9 July 1980 government decree "On Further Reduction of  the Noise of Nuclear-Powered Submarines" called for  modernization of the test range with the goal of developing its  laboratory base further. There were plans for building new  underwater test beds, replacing the measuring complexes and  carrying out capital construction. However, cancellation of  appropriations as a result of perestroyka processes made it  impossible to carry out modernization by the intended deadline,  and subsequent changes in the sociopolitical situation, and  chiefly Estonia's departure from the USSR and then the Union's  disintegration, made it both unsuitable and impossible to carry  out the planned volume of work.    Its location within a foreign state and the uncertainty of  the test range's status in light of the growing strength of  nationalistically oriented circles in the Estonian Republic had  a negative effect on its scientific activity and production.  This is why the question of radically resolving the test range's  fate with regard for planned withdrawal of the Northwestern  Group of Forces and the Tallinn Naval Base to Russian Federation  territory was raised in 1991.    A special commission was appointed in order to resolve the  issues of its reorganization and to conduct negotiations with  the Estonian side. The commission was placed under my charge.  Fundamental agreement regarding the suitability of preserving  this institution in Khara-Lakht Bay and using it in the  interests of the RF Navy and the Estonian Navy was reached in  1992 in the course of repeated working contacts with Minister of  State Rayvo Vare and other officials of the Estonian Republic.  Providing scientific and technical services to Baltic states in  questions of measuring and studying ship physical fields was  proposed as one of the directions of its activity. Proposals for  using the test range's scientific potential in the interests of  space were also developed with the purpose of making it a highly  competitive organization in the very near future.    Essentially, only one question raised disagreement in the  prepared package of documents on implementing the reached  agreement: While the Estonian side insisted on staffing the test  range with civilians or manning it with servicemen of the  Estonian Republic, we suggested that executive positions in the  manning table (up to division chiefs inclusively) should be  filled by officers of the RF Navy, with all other positions  being filled by blue and white collar workers. Changing all of  its associates to civilian status while filling executive  positions with our specialists who would remain as personnel of  the RF Navy was seen as a compromise.    Looking back, I can say with confidence that implementing  the  agreement reached with R. Vare would have best served the  interests of the navies of the Russian Federation, Estonia and  other Baltic countries possessing naval forces, and of course  the interests of RF citizens who had lived in the settlement of  Suurpea since the day the test range was established. Mention  should also be made of the fact that neither the command nor the  associates of the test range had ever experienced cases of  negative contacts with the indigenous population of Kharyuskiy  Rayon in the "pre-perestroyka" period. But events were destined  to develop differently.    For practical purposes, a government crisis that resulted in  replacement of the Estonian cabinet of ministers scuttled the  agreements, which had not been given any legal force. The new  individuals who continued the negotiations on the Estonian side  wished to interpret the scientific organization as nothing more  than a Russian naval base threatening the sovereignty and  transgressing upon the economic well-being of what they called  their "tiny, impoverished Estonia." Administrative advisor  Priiks was distinguished by special zealousness in destroying  all that had been accomplished. And although the Estonians  offered to lease us land for the test range and award it the  status of a naval base, they asked for such an unrealistic rent  that there was no doubt that they counted on us rejecting it.  The situation regarding the test range was also aggravated by  publication of Order No 126 of the Main Command of the CIS Joint  Armed Forces dated 4 April 1992, which essentially prohibited  all commercial activity by it. In this way, "everything is  possible" transformed into "nothing is permitted." Consequently,  further attempts at preserving the test range in Estonia and  making a profitable enterprise out of it lost all meaning.  Dozens of documents coordinated with financial, economic and  legal departments and approved by the naval command, the RF  Ministry of Defense and the State Committee for the Management  of State Property, and contracts signed with Russian and  Estonian enterprises, firms and organizations transformed into a  useless pile of papers. The months I spent with Captain 2d Rank  S. Sazonov, the acting chief of the test range, in Moscow and  Tallinn "corridors of power" were wasted.    The fate of the test range had to be resolved quickly, and  on  a new legal basis. The most radical solution, one not requiring  special effort, and apparently desired by a number of  bureaucratic departments, was to disband it. On the backdrop of  the devastation in the country and the enormous difficulties  experienced by the navy, this decision might not even have  appeared blasphemous. In this way, the test range found itself  omitted from the list of troop units to be relocated from the  Baltic, which for practical purposes predetermined its automatic  disbanding. Under these conditions Vice Admiral V. Polyanskiy,  the chief of the Ship Building Directorate, Rear Admiral I.  Zakharov, chief of the Ministry of Defense Central Scientific  Research Institute No 1, Captain 1st Rank O. Maslov and other  officers had to exert a great deal of effort to substitute the  word "disband" in the corresponding plans by the words "relocate  the test range."    The relocation site (variants were proposed from the Far  North and the Far East to St. Petersburg) immediately became an  object of heated disagreements, ending with adoption of a  decision in our favor. We argued the suitability of locating the  test range in the vicinity of Leningrad Oblast, which was made  evident by the results of special research that scientifically  proved the advantages of its establishment precisely within this  region. In addition, the positive working experience of a branch  of the test range, established there in May 1992, also played a  role.    A directive published by the General Staff in February 1993,  which decided the final fate of the test range, set the deadline  for its relocation in late 1993. Thus the work of moving the  test range acquired a firm basis, although the real difficulties  were only just beginning.    A sizable part of the territory of the Estonian National  Park  near Tallinn had been dedicated to us. I should say in passing  that we took very good care of this land. Two military posts  were located there, together with their infrastructure including  special children's institutions, a sick bay, administrative and  laboratory buildings, storage depots and so on. Upon studying  and reconnoitering the terrain in the new area (a zone of  so-called "magnetic calm"), we found that we could realistically  hope to use an amount of territory that barely equaled a tenth  of the former territory. Foreseeing difficulties in solving  problems associated with reserving the land, and still  continuing with our attempts to preserve the test range in  Estonia, we began an effort to reconcile this issue. However,  despite a decree of the RF Council of Ministers and a directive  of the General Staff of the RF Armed Forces that determined the  location of the test range, and the basic consent given to this  by the leadership of the Leningrad Oblast Council and the local  administrative heads, this issue has still not been resolved,  and its resolution is the most important task of the immediate  future. Of course, the total mutual understanding attained in  relation to the test range's fate between us and between V.  Pashin and V. Kopchenov, the leaders of the Central Scientific  Research Institute imeni A. N. Krylov, and L. Khromykh, chief of  the institute's testing station, permits temporary placement of  the delivered apparatus and equipment in this area, and creates  the necessary conditions for the military unit to start  functioning.    We were able to retain possession of sizable amounts of  material valuables as a result of the relocation. The property  and apparatus were shipped by sea and by motor transport. The  following ships and vessels were put into service for the sea  shipments: the BDK-122, the dry-cargo transporter "Bira," the  BTR-77, and the cable ship "Nepryadva." Motor transportation  (20-tonne trucks) made around 40 trips. A total of over 1,500  tonnes of freight were transferred, including unique Russian and  imported apparatus, an electric power plant, boilers, hangars,  transformers and so on. Special and transport launches and  vessels registered to the test range were moved to the new  basing area (on their own power and under tow by the icebreaker  "Buran"), and all of the motor and tractor equipment needed to  maintain normal life at the test range was delivered.    Because the RF Ministry of Defense did not appropriate  resources for the relocation as a separate item, being a  cost-accounting organization we made maximum use of our own  internal reserves for this. Despite the fact that the recent  times have been distinguished by instability of the positions of  the military leadership regarding rights granted to scientific  and testing organizations of the Ministry of Defense operating  under self-financing conditions, we took all possible steps to  ensure the test range's survival through the cold winter and  spring of 1993, and to fulfill the relocation plan approved by  the naval Main Command and avert the social explosions that  nearly occurred on several occasions. Nor should we forget the  efficient, highly professional work done by finance specialists  headed by Lieutenant Colonel S. Kushnarev, who ensured timely  payment for work done by the test range on the basis of  contracts. We are also indebted to them to a significant degree  for attaining complete mutual understanding with the higher  financial body headed by Colonel Ye. Abrashkin, which provided  timely assistance in converting monetary resources.    The work experience acquired by associates of the test range  in 1992-1993 in servicing its ZPD [not further identified] by  the watch method has allowed us to set up, jointly with  specialists of the Central Scientific Research Institute imeni  A. N. Krylov and on the basis of delivered equipment, temporary  test beds with which to measure and check the physical fields of  ships. Creating a high quality scientific and technical product  in 1994 is the main objective of the test range.    In the first stage, it is fully understandable that such  relocation is unavoidably associated with fulfillment of  functions by scientific associates atypical of them (functions  that are significantly destructive in nature), with loss of a  stable way of life, and with periodic experience of extreme  situations. Moreover, successes in scientific and productive  activity depend directly on living conditions and the personal  well-being of people. This is why the chairman and members of  the relocation commission tried to do everything within their  power to make the move and the initial period of reestablishment  as painless as possible.    On 17 and 18 November 1993, which were unusually frosty  days,  a column of 20 vehicles carrying test range personnel and their  families arrived at the new place. The last to leave the test  range was Captain 1st Rank V. Bokov, as is expected of a  commander. The promises of representatives of the naval command  to accommodate all of the new arrivals in a sanatorium didn't  materialize (we of course didn't really think they would), but  to make matters worse, even tents were not to be had. Owing to  the assistance of local administrative head M. Sergeyev, deputy  director of the local affiliate of the Energiya  Scientific-Production Association Yu. Ogurtsovskiy, chief of the  testing station of the Central Scientific Research Institute  imeni A. N. Krylov L. Khromykh, and director of the tourist base  of the Manula Joint-Stock Company N. Okhrimchuk, all of the new  arrivals were temporarily accommodated in living quarters  allowing them to get through the winter normally. In the future,  fully specific measures will be implemented by Colonel S.  Trubitsyn, deputy commander of the Leningrad Naval Base, at the  direction of the naval commander-in-chief to provide some  housing support to the test range's associates. And we are  seeking possibilities for radically solving the housing problem,  doing everything necessary for this.    The relocation has been completed. A period of creative  activity aimed at restoring the test range on its new territory,  and a scientific and technical base that will be used jointly  for the moment with the Central Scientific Research Institute  imeni A. N. Krylov, is beginning. Study of the problems of  planning an experimental model of the test range will reach its  conclusion in 1994. The initial appropriations for 1994-1996  have been planned by a decree of the Council of Ministers. The  naval commander-in-chief approved a plan of measures for 1994  and subsequent years to set up and develop its infrastructure.  There are full grounds for believing that this plan will be  carried out.    And so, the test range has left the Estonian Republic,  basically preserving its equipment, personnel, and the 40 years'  traditions and number of the military unit intact. The losses  suffered by the RF Navy in this case are tangible. Given today's  requirements on improving the qualitative characteristics of  ships and raising their combat effectiveness, the importance of  research on ship physical fields is growing. Consequently, there  is no doubt that the test range will be restored in full volume  in the next few years, and in a new place and on a new  scientific and technical basis at that. Russia has sufficient  forces and resources for this. The Estonian Republic lost  incomparably more: A scientific research center doing work in  which all Baltic countries are interested will apparently no  longer exist in the foreseeable future on the shore of  Khara-Lakht Bay.

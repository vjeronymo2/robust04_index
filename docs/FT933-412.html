			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / West's best bet: Boris Yeltsin's bid to broaden the democratic base deserves support Russian legislators are reported to be confused by western support for President Boris Yeltsin's attempt to abolish the legislature. They are not alone. Many people in the west instinctively condemn any ruler who dissolves an elected parliament and asserts his own supreme authority. That was clear enough in the past year, when Peru's President Alberto Fujimori suspended the constitution and dissolved Congress, even though inside Peru his popularity rocketed to unprecedented levels. Since then, Mr Fujimori has managed to reduce inflation, to stabilise a weak economy, and to conduct a successful counter-offensive against the Sendero Luminoso guerrillas who were terrorising the countryside and, increasingly, the cities. This was what Mr Fujimori was elected to do, and it had become clear that he could not do it if he stuck to the letter of the constitution. Easy enough for liberals in New York to purse their lips; not so easy to offer a better answer to Peru's problems. Yet the lip-pursing may have been right and necessary. But for the sanctions imposed by the US (mainly through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), Mr Fujimori might have thought he could run the country in such a manner indefinitely. At least now he is holding a referendum on a new constitution, which will allow the election of a new congress; and he has had to keep a tighter rein on human rights violations by his security forces than he might otherwise have done. Mr Yeltsin, for his part, knows very well he would not get away with indefinite presidential rule. When he dissolved parliament last week he simultaneously fixed new elections for December. This point is surely more important than the question of the legitimacy of the parliament's original election in March 1990. At the time, the election was seen as a victory for democracy, or for 'pro-democracy campaigners', at least in the big cities. But, the Financial Times reported, 'party officials have managed to hang on to control of many outlying regional soviets (councils), and may still end up with a majority in the Russian parliament'. The party in question was, of course, the Communist party, by then beginning to disintegrate but the only party able to contest the elections as even a semi-organised force. Its official monopoly of power had been dropped from the Soviet constitution only the previous month. Mr Yeltsin was eventually elected president, or speaker, on the third ballot, by a margin of four votes. Much more decisive was his election as president by universal suffrage the following year. But even if the election of 1990 were democratic, it would hardly change the issue. What Mr Yeltsin is doing is something provided for in most west European constitutions when there is an irreconcilable clash between the executive and the legislature: you 'go to the country' and let the people decide. That was what Mr John Major was threatening to do last July when he made his handling of the social protocol to the Maastricht treaty the subject of a vote of confidence. Had he lost, the Queen would have dissolved Parliament and there would have been a general election. The French president has the same power. Charles de Gaulle used it twice (in 1962 and 1968); Francois Mitterrand did so immediately on his election in 1981, and again on his re-election in 1988 - on both occasions because by electing him the voters had, in effect, disavowed the sitting National Assembly. It was logical to give them a chance to choose a new assembly reflecting their current preferences. In Mr Yeltsin's case, the electorate explicitly confirmed its confidence in him and (by a narrower margin) his economic policies in a referendum last April. In spite of that, he has agreed to hold a new presidential election next June (two years before the expiry of his mandate). He might be better advised to hold the two elections simultaneously, but he is surely not obliged to do so, provided he accepts the parliament elected in December and appoints a government that enjoys its confidence. A majority of votes was also cast last April in favour of the dissolution of parliament. Unfortunately he could not act on it because the constitutional court had ruled that this required a majority of eligible voters. Thus those who failed to turn out were counted as votes against. Mr Yeltsin has now decided to ignore that ruling and to act as the majority of those who actually voted wanted him to do. In so doing he has violated the constitution. But that constitution dates from the Brezhnev era. It has been amended about 400 times, but by parliamentary, not popular, votes. It was written for a country which was part of the Soviet Union, and in which the Communist party was to have a permanent monopoly of power. When that monopoly was abolished and the Soviet Union broke up it would have been logical for the Russian people, who were, in effect, founding a new national state, to adopt a new constitution. But in revolutions things are not always done logically. The problems facing Russia now are hardly less than those that faced Peru last year. In fact, given the size of the country, its ethnic diversity, and the legacy (both economic and political) of 70 years of communism, they can surely be considered much greater. Many Russians doubt whether they can be solved democratically, or at all. So far, Mr Yeltsin is still trying to introduce a democratic constitution, to carry the people with him at each stage of his reforms, and to avoid a recourse to violence. So long as he behaves like that, he deserves support.</p>

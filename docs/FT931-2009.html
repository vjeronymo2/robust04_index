			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (9): 'No LAN is an island' - Enlarged Local Area Networks AT a time when IBM and other leaders of the information technology industry are in trouble, one sector is growing by leaps and bounds. Internetworking - the linking together of small personal computer networks to create one giant computer - is flourishing as businesses everywhere seek to make the most of existing information technology investments. Internetworking has sprung out of the local area network (LAN) industry. LANs were originally only intended to link small groups of personal computers. But they have proliferated in many organisations, and their cost has come down so low that they have become a commodity item. Now, many companies are realising that these isolated LANs could bring more benefit if they were tied together. The enlarged LAN should improve the dissemination of corporate information and increase staff productivity: where data was previously requested by telephone delivered by courier, it can instead be retrieved electronically. For example, staff at Strathclyde Regional Council are soon going to be able to tap into data on debtors and creditors from any of the council's 120 office sites. The system will also provide up to date information on other activities such as social work. 'I have a saying here that 'no LAN is an island.' While they might start as a standalone LAN, we find they rapidly grow and need to share information, says Mr Lindsay Barr, distributed systems services manager at Strathclyde. Internetworking has gained further momentum from the trend towards 'downsizing' - replacing large, expensive mainframes, with smaller personal and mid-range computers. As a result, leading vendors are growing at rates of 40 per cent or more per year. Synoptics, a leading vendor of internetwork hub products grew 57 per cent in 1992 over 1991, reporting revenues of Dollars 388m, over Dollars 248m the previous year. Its smaller rival, Chipcom, grew its 1992 sales by 82 per cent, up to Dollars 87m from Dollars 47m in 1991. Wellfleet, number two to Cisco for the supply of routers - products which transmit traffic between LANS - almost doubled its revenues for the six months to December 31 last year. It reported Dollars 72m, up from Dollars 34m the previous year. However, customers are becoming concerned that the vendors are riding high on their growth figures and failing to address a number of key problems. Internetworking is not a simple process. John Wise, who heads up the lobby group known as European Network Users' Forum, says that network managers commonly run into difficulty when they try to interwork different types of networks. But the vendors are not being helpful in finding a solution. For example, joining a Novell Netware network with a Microsoft LAN Manager network will result in many of the functions of both networks being lost. In such a case, someone in one office wanting to access a database held elsewhere, may find they can't do so - 'if your LAN strategies have evolved independently - and this tends to be the case historically - then you have disparate collection of LANs which you then have to interwork. You have to find a way of doing this. I think it's a problem,' says Mr Wise. There are further difficulties when it comes to managing the network. This entails checking how much data is stored on file servers, and how much traffic is travelling along the lines. This information is important for planning the system capacity, so that users always have access to what they need. Jim McMahon, an independent networking consultant, says that the problem occurs because most network operating systems, such as Netware and LAN Manager, remain proprietary. 'There seems to be an ambiguous approach to being open, because the vendors don't want to lose their competitiveness. The support for interworking of multi-vendor LANs is not as good as if you've got all of one environment or the other,' he says. Novell claims to address this issue, at least partially, in its latest version of Netware, version 4, released earlier this month. It says the new software offers better interworking with networks running the Unix operating system. But Mr McMahon, who is having to find a solution to this issue for a pan-European LAN-based network, remains sceptical - 'wait and see,' he says. Novell also says it does supply products to interwork Netware with other networks, but has not been very good at telling its customers of their existence. Another issue that concerns users is the implementation of new technologies. Chief among these is known by the ungainly title of asynchronous transfer mode or ATM. This will eventually provide super-fast data transmission at speeds of up to 2.4 gigabits per second. Such high speeds should make it easier for companies to transmit large data files, such as video and image. A problem today is that LANs become overloaded and crash if too many people try to access the system at once; video or image transmission on a large scale is difficult. It is envisaged that ATM could provide the backbone network, carrying the bulk of the traffic. ATM was originally conceived by the telecom industry for wide area transmission, but has been hi-jacked by local area network vendors. Unlike telecom suppliers, they exist in a ferociously competitive market. They have therefore pressed ahead much faster with product development. Products are scheduled to appear this year. Cisco, Synoptics, and UK vendor Fibrenet all say they will have an initial product by the autumn of this year. And Wellfleet, Network Equipment Technologies and another UK company Netcomm, could be ready sooner. But as the vendors rush to lay out their ATM stalls, customers want to know how they will migrate from today's products to ATM. Mr Laki Marangos, communications manager at merchant bank Morgan Grenfell says he wants to see stepping stones to new technologies, so that he can meet new business requirements for networking facilities with an incremental cost. Mr Marangos would not want to buy an entire new network, in order to get ATM capability - 'if you buy products today, they must fit in with your existing and future requirements,' he says. Many are also unsure of the true benefits of ATM. Mr Barr says he will be looking at ATM, but it's too early to say what use it might be. And he adds: 'Every technology is of interest, but being at the leading edge is expensive, in terms of resources as well as finance.'</p>

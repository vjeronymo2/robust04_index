			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has concluded his contacts  with representatives of the UN Security Council permanent member  countries in Cyprus.    This morning, he separately received Chinese Ambassador Chen  Zhenyou and French Ambassador Gerald Pavret de la Rochefordiere.  He explained the Turkish position regarding the disarming of  Cyprus.    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said: The fact  that Kliridhis announced that the agreement to sign a defense  agreement with Greece was made in Greece, and the fact that he  then offered the disarmament, tells the Turkish Cypriot side a  lot of things; we must be very careful.    Denktas recalled that a former Greek Cypriot interior  minister recently said there is a need to hoard some 20,000 to  30,000 weapons. This means, Denktas said, that when the time  comes, the EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters]  movement will resume. Kliridhis' disarmament offer while this  danger exists, reminds us of when Makarios returned the obsolete  weapons to the British authorities in 1959, and then a year  later, set up secret armies. People who went though those times  must study the present proposals more carefully. The defense of  the Turkish Cypriot side is bizonality, and its borders are  being protected by Turkish troops today.    Denktas went on to say: We expect a change of mind and a  change of heart from the the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek  Cypriot government must stop the provocations of Greek Cypriot  youths against Turkish Cypriots. If it cannot, then this must  be done by the United Nations.    Denktas said he explained all these views to the Security  Council officials who listened carefully and took notes.    Replying to a question, Denktas said that the Cyprus  question  is a national cause for Turkey and concerns the future of the  Turkish Cypriots. Turkey has never used the Turkish Cypriots as  a tool of compromise until now and will not do so in the future.  Turkey is helping the Turkish Cypriots to ensure that a sound  and equitable agreement is signed, in line with its own  interests and those of the Turkish Cypriots. I am convinced  that Turkey will continue to help us, Denktas said.</p>

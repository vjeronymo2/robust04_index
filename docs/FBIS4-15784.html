			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepakanert, April 11 (SNARK)--An independent  Russian-language paper "NAGORNY KARABAKH" began publishing in  Karabakh. Its first issue cited the declaration of Arkadiy  Gukasyan, Karabakh foreign minister: "Karabakh is now  independent de-facto and nobody can deny this fact".    Marsel Petrosyan, founder and commercial director of the  paper, told SNARK the main readers of the paper will be those  Armenians in the CIS, who would like to be aware of the real  events in their mother land. The circulation of the paper is  5,000 copies.    It is planned to publish "NAGORNY KARABAKH" in English too.</p>

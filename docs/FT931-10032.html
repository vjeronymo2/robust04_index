			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: SAS and Icelandair in strategic collaboration SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System and Icelandair yesterday announced a strategic collaboration which will allow the Icelandic carrier to create a European hub at Copenhagen airport. The agreement will see Icelandair increasing its Copenhagen round trips from seven to 28 a week, starting from June 1 at the latest. 'The pact will strengthen both airlines position in their northern European home markets,' said Mr Vagn Sorensen, senior vice-president at SAS Business Division, 'It spells a significant boost to SAS's traffic system at the Copenhagen hub.' Under the agreement, Icelandair will increase its flights from Keflavik (outside Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland) to Copenhagen from daily to twice daily and it will start twice daily services between Copenhagen and Hamburg. Passengers on these services will be able to access 30 cities on SAS's European network and some of its international flights. Analysts said that the agreement reinforced the importance of Copenhagen to SAS at a time when there was some sensitivity over the airport's future role in the context of a broadening of the European Quality Alliance. This is a loose partnership that groups SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. KLM, the Dutch airline, recently said it was considering launching talks on strategic co-operation with the three airlines.</p>

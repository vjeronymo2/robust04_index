Recalling that at a time when the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks is due on March 21, some seditious forces of the United  States, Japan and South Korea are trying to obstruct the  implementation of the agreed conclusions, insisting on  preconditions and hard lines against the DPRK, the news analyst  says:    This is an anti-dialogue move of those who hate a negotiated  solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    By calling for preconditions, those seditious forces seek to  hinder the implementation of the agreed conclusions reached at  the New York DPRK-U.S. contact and lower the checkbar on the way  of the solution of the nuclear issue through dialogue and  negotiation which has been paved with much difficulty.    Things, however, will not go as they wish.    The point is how the DPRK and the U.S. promote the process  of  the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula which has been put on the right track, with a sound  thinking faculty, not caring a bit about the moves of any  seditious force.    The situation may develop to a grave phase, if any side  delay  or foil the implementation of the agreed conclusions, seeking  its selfish purpose or lending an ear to the seditious voices.    The seditious forces must renounce the reckless attempts to  block the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    What is needed at the present moment with the third-round  DPRK- U.S. talks ahead is to do act in favor of the settlement  of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    If a dialogue partner set unreasonable preconditions and,  furthermore, take up the refrain of the call of the seditious  forces for tough measures, that will result in spoiling the  atmosphere of dialogue and negotiation.</p>

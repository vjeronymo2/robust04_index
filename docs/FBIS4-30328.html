			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with </F> unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime minister's  official residence in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Dean of the Press Corps] I would like ask you some  questions. Mr. Prime Minister, if your cabinet resigns en  masse, political parties will move toward nominating a candidate  for prime minister. Do you intend to become prime minister  again? In your opening statement, you referred to a new  government framework and said you would aim for a new government  formed by political parties sharing the same policies. Do you  think the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] should return  to the ruling coalition?    [Hata] Regarding your first question, I think the question  of whether or not I seek the premiership again should be left to  the Diet. I will follow the Diet's judgment. As far as I am  concerned, I am at zero. A way can start from there. Hence, I  am not thinking about it at all. As for the new government, I  hope the SDPJ will break with its status as an opposition party.  I also hope the SDPJ will become a responsible political party  and play its part in Japan's politics. I have wanted this since  the Hosokawa government's inauguration and the last generation  election was held. During the two months of my cabinet, I  strongly urged the SDPJ to return to the coalition government  and share the responsibility of running it. As I have just  stated, I will leave the question of whether or not I seek the  premiership again to the Diet. I hope everyone will think  seriously about their country's future.    [Dean of the Press Corps] In your opening statement, you  referred to a political vacuum on the eve of summit talks with  the United States and the summit [G-7 Naples summit]. If the  prime minister is replaced, Japan will be unable to avoid  stagnation in politics and national strength. Mr. Prime  Minister, you once stated that you considered dissolving the  House of Representatives so Japan could avoid such a situation.  Mr. Prime Minister, if a general resignation by the cabinet  creates such a situation, how will you take responsibility for  it?    [Hata] Japan was forced to host the summit [G-7 Tokyo  summit]  last year while the House of Representatives remained dissolved  following the Miyazawa cabinet's defeat in a no-confidence vote  in the Diet. If the House of Representatives is dissolved, no  one knows for sure how the political situation will develop. I  do not believe the House of Representatives' dissolution is a  responsible act, and therefore, have decided not to do so. I  once thought doing so would change public opinion by causing it  to seek confidence in my cabinet. But no one knows what would  result in the House of Representatives's dissolution. I want to  avoid that based on the thinking that would lead to a loss of  trust in Japan.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, you held  long talks with Mr. Ozawa [Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party)  secretary general], which began last night and lasted until this  morning. Did you and Mr. Ozawa discuss the possibility of  dissolving the House of Representatives?    [Hata] We did not discuss such a possibility. What I have  always said is that Japan's politics must be reformed. The  centerpiece for political reform is the reform of the current  electoral system. I have also said the current electoral system  must be reformed to build a new political system wherein real  political debates are held. The House of Representatives should  not be resolved to reform the current electoral system. Given  the economic situation and a host of issues facing Japan, the  House of Representatives' dissolution should be avoided. I have  also said I would not renounce my power to dissolve the House of  Representatives under any circumstances when my cabinet clashes  with the Diet.    [Hata continues] After seriously considering the  situation, I held consultations with representatives from each  of the parties of the coalition -- rather than saying I talked  with Mr. Ozawa alone. We discussed what we should do to create  a stabilized government, but eventually, during the course of  our discussions, I came to the conclusion that the House of  Representative's dissolution should be avoided. Since the  no-confidence motion had been submitted, I decided to sum up my  conclusions. I wanted to avoid a political vacuum at any cost.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, in general, when  a cabinet is dissolved, in view of regular constitutional  government procedures, it is natural to hand over power to the  largest opposition party. What do you think of this?    [Hata] If we give power to the LDP, that will mean another  minority government. It will be similar to my cabinet, which  has been criticized for being a minority government.  Unfortunately, there is no party in the Diet that has a  majority of seats. For this reason, I do not think power should  be given to the first opposition party. Rather than giving  power to the opposition, the issue should be left to the Diet's  judgment so that the people will be able to see how politics  work. As has been pointed out, since the people cannot see what  is going on in Japan's politics or the obstacles facing it, the  matter should be left to the Diet -- some say it is quite  difficult to translate the word "yudaneru" [verb, leave or  entrust] -- and follow the Diet's judgment.    [Unidentified reporter] The no-confidence motion has been  submitted. What was the underlying reason for your cabinet's  resignation, even before a vote on the no-confidence motion was  taken?    [Hata] If we accept the vote on the no-confidence motion, we  must have the power to reject the motion, or at least, to make  efforts to reject it. However, since my cabinet is a minority  government, it is very difficult to reject the motion with our  current power. We can no longer spend the time needed for a  vote. It will also take much time to create the next government.  We should avoid spending such time. For this reason, I have  decided to take action before a vote is taken.    [Dean of Press Corps] The last question please.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you stated it is  time to put an end to political strife. There is no persuasive  force in what you said because you yourself used to get involved  in political strife when you were an LDP member. What is your  opinion on this?    [Hata] I would like you to review my 25 year political  career. I have always thought of nothing but the nation. During  the so-called 40-day strife within the LDP, wherein such  influential leaders as Eiichi Nishimura, Susumu Nikaido, Shin  Kanemaru, and Noboru Takeshita, were involved, I refuted them,  saying that what they were thinking was unclear to the people.  I then personally told them that I would take new action. What  happened at that time is widely known. Moreover, I have  repeatedly said that it is necessary to take the initiative in  managing the government. I am a man who has never acted to seek  his own authority or higher gain. If you check the details of my  political career over the past 20 years, you will understand  what I have done. I am sorry I cannot explain these things now,  but I do want you to review what I have done.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you said at a  press conference yesterday that you leave the matter of  negotiations between the ruling parties and the SDPJ. But now  you have announced your cabinet's dissolution before letting us  know what went on at the meeting between the ruling parties and  the SDPJ. Can we take your announcement as a full acceptance of  Mr. Murayama's call for a voluntary resignation?    [Hata] In a meeting with the SDPJ -- I do not remember  clearly what time it was -- there were no big differences in  policy matters. But on other issues, we failed to reach an  agreement at the meeting -- I think it was around 0400 or 0500  PM. Given the situation, the ruling coalition presented our  policy accord proposal to each party. This time, however, each  party still had doubts as to the direction the situation would  go, even though the no-confidence motion had been submitted.  Under such circumstances, it was impossible to bring  negotiations with the SDPJ to a successful conclusion.  Prolonging such a situation is not good for the people, and  therefore, I chose to dissolve my cabinet en masse. I strongly  hope the other parties will understand my true intentions. I  have made a decision not to comply with somebody's intention but  to avoid a political vacuum. Pursuing the SDPJ's cause of  breakup from the coalition will eventually lead to a political  vacuum. I came to the conclusion that the Diet's judgment  should be followed, and I made the decision. It's time to end.  Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Shares fall on warning from Brent Chemicals BRENT Chemicals International, the speciality chemicals group, said sales in the last two months of 1991 were materially below expectations and warned that annual profits would be below those previously anticipated. However, they reiterated their intention to maintain the final dividend of 5.8p. The market took the news badly, and on Friday the shares fell 18p to 117p. The directors also said that they had implemented a further programme of redundancies, which was expected to cost Pounds 800,000. It will be taken as an additional exceptional item for 1991. They added that the programme and other cost reductions made during the year were expected to reduce operating costs by more than Pounds 2.5m in 1992. For 1990 the group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m.</p>

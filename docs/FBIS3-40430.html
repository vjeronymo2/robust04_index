			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with General Adyr da Silva, president </F> of Telebras, by Ethevaldo Siqueira, by telephone on 8 October  1993: "Telebras--Year 21, According to its President";  introductory and concluding paragraphs in italics as published]    [Text] In this exclusive interview, the president of  Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.], Air Force General  Adyr da Silva, announces contracts for 1.8 million terminals by  the end of 1993 and the installation of 1 million new lines in  1993. He also presents an analysis of his firm, which will  celebrate its 21st anniversary on 9 November.    "Telebras is the result of an antiprivatization movement,  seeing that the situation in the preceding period was one of  private concessions and hundreds of obsolete and inefficient  municipal systems. Its work during these 21 years has been  extraordinary in that it has expanded the Brazilian telephone  network from about 1.5 million terminals in 1972 to more than 11  million today. In mathematical language, that is what we call a  positive derivative."    With those words, Air Force General Adyr da Silva sums up  the  role played by Telebras in the 21 years of existence that it is  now completing. In his opinion, one of the holding company's  most significant gains is the "complete technological cycle"  that has been achieved thanks to the work of the Cpqd [Research  and Development Center]. That work has guaranteed development of  the main basic technologies--ranging from digital telephone  exchanges to fiber optics.    Here we present the main passages from his lengthy  interview,  which was given by telephone at 2300 hours on Friday 8 October.    1.8 million terminals--"We have now contracted for over 1  million terminals, and by December [1993] we will have added to  that number another 720,000 terminals for large public digital  exchanges. That will give us to a total of 1.8 million lines  contracted for in a single year, including 200,000 cellular  telephones. That is a historical record. But it is not a  question simply of setting records, but of reversing the  previous situation. The fact is that a little over 300,000 lines  were contracted for in 1992. We have had to put more emphasis on  signing such contracts to guarantee an annual average of close  to 1 million during the three-year period and thus reach the 2.2  million planned for 1995 and beyond. And to the surprise of  those most skeptical, the cost of an integrated terminal is  declining and may reach $2,600. There has been a sizable drop in  the cost of switching."    Record installation--"By the end of December we will have  installed 1 million new terminals. This means that Telebras will  be making favorable progress by increasing the number of  terminals installed from about 800,000 in 1992 to 1 million in  1993. We hope to reach 1.4 million in 1994."    Fiber optics--"Brazil now has many optical fiber  manufacturers, among them Pirelli, Bracel, ABC Xtal, Furukawa,  and others. This proves that the market is growing. The Telebras  system uses many thousands of kilometers of fiber-optic cable,  including not only long-distance cables--such as Embratel's  [Brazilian Telecommunications Company's] cable between Rio de  Janeiro and Sao Paulo--but chiefly the urban connections that no  one sees. I returned recently from Sao Luis, where I signed the  Telma [Maranhao Telecommunications] cellular telephone contract.  This means that the fiber-optic ring in Sao Luis will soon be  completed. So optical fibers are becoming a technological  reality and playing a part in day-to-day Brazilian  telecommunications."    Card-operated public telephones--"The rate at which public  telephones are expanding is speeding up, and we are going to  reach a total network of over 270,000 this year. We have had to  overcome various problems in order to consolidate the card  technology and even the industrial cost of producing new public  telephones. It was a struggle, but we won thanks to the Cpqd's  work."    Tropico and Zetax--"When Zetax objects to the acquisition of  720,000 Tropico terminals and accuses us of protecting the three  Tropico manufacturers, I argue that Zetax telephone exchanges  are still a long way from achieving the capacity of our RA. As  far as I know, Zetax exchanges have trouble handling 2,000  terminals. So if Zetax wants to build Tropicos, it can do so.  Telebras will transfer all the know-how to it immediately. But  is there a market for so many manufacturers?"  <H5>  Six Major Goals </H5>   Adyr da Silva reviewed the six major goals adopted under his  management: a resumption of growth, an increased social  contribution by the industry, PQP's (quality and productivity  programs), a new policy for the Cpqd, international cooperation,  and establishment of the ombudsman system. Here is an evaluation  of those six courses of action in the words of the Telebras  president himself:    Resumption of growth--"Considering the fundamental role  played by telecommunications, which are a real springboard on  which the country depends, our first goal is the resumption of  sectoral growth. This is reflected in the contracts signed for  over 1.8 million lines this year and the installation of 1  million terminals. And as a contribution to the country, we are  thinking much more about integrated development than simply  about economic, technological, or social development."    Social contribution--"We have often been criticized for  giving priority to this goal on the grounds that we are simply  subsidizing the cost of telephone tokens and basic residential  service. That is not true. We are going far beyond those two  areas with projects such as these:    "Virtual telephony, by means of which people and  professionals with low incomes can have a terminal or `mailbox'  enabling them to receive messages and giving them access to the  telecommunications system at much lower cost.    "Community centers, such as the one inaugurated recently in  Toledo, Parana, which provide the public with access at a single  location to telephones, domestic and international direct  dialing, faxes, microcomputers, and so on. It is `the poor man's  teleport,' to use the picturesque nickname it has been given.    "The encouragement of fund drives such as Child-Hope, which  may collect something in the neighborhood of $2 million this  year alone for helping needy Brazilian children through UNICEF.  Our support is not limited solely to the Globo Network's drive,  as one might think; it is available to any other broadcaster  that wants to launch similar drives. We also have the Campaign  in Support of the Physically Handicapped, which is co-sponsored  by the government of the Federal District, and Betinho's  Campaign Against Hunger, by means of which the Telebras system  encourages its companies to accept contributions in  nonperishable foodstuffs and products and send them to  accredited agencies.    "Low-cost rural telephone service is a program that we  intend  to launch before the end of the year.    "Incidentally, the issue of rural telephone service has been  a challenge for Brazil. When people criticize the state monopoly  on the grounds that only 2 percent of Brazilian rural properties  have telephone service, I don't know whether that is little or a  lot, considering that according to the IBGE [Brazilian Institute  of Geography and Statistics], there are over 7 million parcels  of rural property in our country. At any rate, considering the  extremely low purchasing power of farmers and the high cost of  rural telephone service, how can this problem be solved? In my  opinion, the best prospects will have to come from the new  technologies."    Quality and productivity--"We are establishing total quality  and productivity programs in many firms belonging to the  Telebras system, among them Telebahia [Bahia  Telecommunications], Telepar [Parana Telecommunications],  Teleceara [Ceara Telecommunications], Telpa, Telerj [Rio de  Janeiro Telecommunications], and, obviously, Telebras itself.  For that purpose, we have international agreements allowing us  to send professionals to Japan and other countries for training.  The UFMG [Federal University of Minas Gerais], for example, has  been playing a prominent role in this area of total quality and  productivity."    Policy for Cpqd--"The Cpqd cannot disperse its funds among  dozens of projects. A better plan is to concentrate its efforts  on a few development projects that are real priorities. In line  with that thinking, the center is putting more emphasis on the  following projects:    "1. Adding new features to the Tropico telephone exchange.    "2. Refining and innovating resources in connection with  card-operated telephones.    "3. Exploring all the possibilities of virtual telephony  based on voice mail technology.    "4. Mastering the technology of intelligent networks.    "5. Investing as much as possible in network management, one  of the most important areas for the country in the future.    "6. Exploring all developments in the field of personal  communications services in accordance with the PCS (Personal  Communications Services or Personal Communications Network)  concept."    International cooperation--"Telebras has been benefiting  from  international cooperation programs, among which I would like to  emphasize the following:    "1. The Cpqd has technological cooperation contracts with  the  following international firms: Northern Telecom, the NTT,  AT&amp;T,  Alcatel, Siemens, Ericsson, Millicom, and others.    "2. The National Training Center, which the ITU  [International Telecommunication Union] considers a worldwide  model and example, has been used intensively for programs to  train professionals from all over Latin America and from  Portuguese-speaking African countries.    "3. Telebras is preparing to provide international  consulting  and support services. This will be the case in Hungary, where we  have been awarded the contract in international bidding."    Ombudsman--"Ten firms in the Telebras system--among them  Telerj, Telebahia, and Telepar--now have an ombudsman system for  protecting the interests of the users. The ombudsman is always  an employee, has complete support and autonomy, and cannot be  fired while in that job. But the rules as adopted do not allow  him to investigate accusations that crimes have been committed.  In those cases, the Federal Government's ombudsman steps in."  <H5>  Triumphalist Tone </H5>   In his interview, Gen. Adyr da Silva selects the best  figures  in the firm's history and pays tribute to the "people who have  devoted and do devote the best of their creativity and  competence to the development of this sector," the "work of  industrial partners who, with initiative and technology, have  believed and do believe in this sector," and, lastly, all those  who "have contributed all along the way... some of them  anonymous heroes."    The figures that fill the draft of his speech for the firm's  21st anniversary also show that from January through August  1993, investments in telecommunications totaled $1.975 billion,  or 61.7 percent of the total planned for the year. Next comes  the number of terminals installed during the same period:  495,431, 140,000 of which are cellular mobile telephones. The  number of terminals placed "in service" during the first eight  months of the year was slightly higher at 507,000.    Besides those successes, the president of Telebras draws  attention to the long-distance fiber-optic cable program and the  public telephone program as milestones of his management.</p>

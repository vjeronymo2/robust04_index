			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: The Tempest - Theatre The RSC's new production at Stratford-upon-Avon, The Tempest, ends with a raspberry. Alec McCowen's Prospero is finally granting freedom to the spirit Ariel. 'Fare thou well,' he says in tones that include gratitude and affection. We think that only the epilogue is to come. Then Simon Russell Beale's Ariel responds to the farewell by spitting copiously on Prospero's face before marching off. What this incident has to do with the rest of the production is exceedingly unclear. Until the raspberry director Sam Mendes has delivered an interpretation that is almost entirely cerebral. This is a Tempest that smacks excessively of English literary criticism. All the studies of what Shakespeare might have meant by the difference between nature, as represented by Caliban, and nurture, as it is portrayed by Prospero, have been read and digested. It is one of the most hierarchically structured productions of the play that you are likely to see. David Troughton's Caliban is not a beast in the literal sense. His physical form is entirely human, but he is a being of little brain. He looks and moves like a not very good, retarded Japanese wrestler. Prospero personifies learning and the belated coming of wisdom and even forgiveness. Frequently he appears at the top of one of those very tall pairs of library steps. The rest of the characters are somewhere in the middle. The real villains in the Mendes view are Stephano and Trinculo, normally described as a drunken butler and a jester. Here Stephano is shown as a pseudo-toff with a see-through upper-class accent. Trinculo carries a ventriloquist's dummy. The performances, by Mark Lockyer as Stephano especially, are very fine, but it seems unfair to blame them for all the ills that flesh can get up to. There are, after all, plenty of genuine villains around, such as the lot who deposed Prospero as the Duke of Milan in the first place. The latter do not get much of a look in. Ariel does, and it was a striking decision to cast a man who admits he looks as if he was born to play Caliban in this role. Russell Beale is very good; he always is. He is dressed in one of those Chinese tunics that suggests he belongs to the party machine. He struts about like an obedient, if reluctant military servant, but one does wonder if that final venomous spitting is not a hint that he would have been happier playing the beast. The trouble with trying to impose a hierarchical, ordered vision on The Tempest is that ultimately it does not work. The play is full of mysteries, just as the isle is full of noises, but they are not noises that can be easily explained. There ought to be a lot of fun in it, but unless you count the rather cruel humour of the Trinculo-Stephano-Caliban scene, there is no fun here, not even the element of surprise. There is not much romance either. Ferdinand, played by Mark Lewis Jones, is a plodding, if amiable dolt, and there is no sign that Sarah Woodward's Miranda has benefited from all those years of learned tutorials with her father. When she sees a collection of real people at the end and comments 'How beauteous mankind is', she sounds as if she is setting off to be a coquette. Still, you should not let such criticisms deter you from going. Until the final scene, I found the direction riveting throughout. There is also the perverse pleasure of being irritated at the same time.</p>

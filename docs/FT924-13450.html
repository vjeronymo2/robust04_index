			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (12): Expanded service links - Freephone numbers cut company overheads HOW CAN a company expand into another country without the expense of setting up an office there? The answer, according to the world's telephone companies, is to set up an international Freephone number. Potential customers in the target country can call up free of charge to ask for the brochure or discuss services. And the company, hopefully, will win new clients. Freephone numbers, otherwise known as toll-free numbers in the US, or green numbers in continental Europe, are fast becoming a competitive area for international telephone companies. The reason is that international businesses are organising themselves on a regional basis, rather than on a national basis. So, instead of having service offices in the UK, France, Germany, Holland and Switzerland they might choose to have only one European centre. For example, American personal computer manufacturer Packard Bell, set up a customer support centre in the Netherlands. Calls from customers in 13 countries are transmitted toll-free to the centre, where inquiries are dealt with by 60 multilingual staff. Similarly, the hotel chain Holiday Inn is about to set up a Dutch-based reservation centre to take bookings for hotels all around Europe. Customers who want to book, do not have to worry about the expense of making an international call, and the company has the benifit of reducing its overheads. Other users include mail order suppliers and distribution companies which give the freephone number to their drivers to call home. Call revenue from international Freephone numbers can be significant, and some telephone companies are going out of their way to attract the business. PTT Telecom Netherlands offers special tariff packages, voice mail, and ready-furnished offices fitted with telemarketing equipment. It wants to attract call traffic to Holland, and claims that its low call charges are a competitive weapon. BT encourages customers by offering discounts according to the volume of traffic generated by the Freephone number. It is also putting in more functions on the exchanges which handle the freephone calls: for example, it can transfer the calls to different locations if given specific times of the day, or days of the week, to do it. Roger Gilbert, manager of BT's freephone services, said that international freephone numbers are growing in double digits. But the phone companies are also starting to use freephone numbers in developing new services for travellers. The most significant of these is what is referred to as third country calling. This is where a customer can dial toll-free from one country to another, and be put through to a third one. They get the bill at their home address. The service is similar to the call-home services such as BT Direct, except that BT Direct only allows people to call back to the UK. With third country calling, someone could call from Stockholm to London toll-free, and be connected to Germany. American phone company Sprint International, is beginning to market such a service. Subscribers get a charge card showing an account number, as well as a PIN number. Sprint first offered the service to its existing charge card holders when it launched on September 1. It claims that in the first week, between 5 and 10 per cent of all calls were third country calls. But Sprint is not limiting its marketing of the service to the US. A marketing promotion campaign running with British Airways, aims to sell to business travellers of all nationalities. All subscribers, even those based outside the US, will be put through to a Sprint operator in the US who will connect the call. A number of other phone companies, including BT, are expected to announce third country calling soon. Several are also working in partnership with credit card company Visa International to introduce a toll-free calling facility for Visa card holders. Called Visaphone, it means that people can make calls by dialling a freephone number and quoting their Visa account number and a special PIN to the operator. They pay Visa for the call, which appears itemised on their monthly bill. Like the Sprint service, Visaphone will be targeted at international travellers. It is likely to be popular with people who spend a lot of time in hotels, because it avoids the huge surcharges that hotels add to guests' phone bills. In one week last August, Visaphone generated 7,000 phone calls in the US.</p>

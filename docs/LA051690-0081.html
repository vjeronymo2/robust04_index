			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NINTENDO TO FUND LEARNING PROJECT AT MIT  </P> <P> Nintendo Co., the computer-game maker whose ubiquitous machines have penetrated  one in five American homes, announced Tuesday a strategic tie to a leading U.S.  research institution to probe the future of child learning, artificial  intelligence and information media.  </P> <P> Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi said the company will contribute $3 million  over five years to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media  Laboratory, specifically to support studies of how children learn while at  play.  </P> <P> Sponsorship of work in progress at the media lab, though limited in scope, will  give Nintendo access to a wide range of cutting-edge research in related areas  such as electronic publishing, advanced television, computer music and  holography.  </P> <P> The research alliance comes at a time when Nintendo is enjoying phenomenal  success, dominating the U.S. computer-game scene with an 80% market share.  </P> <P> At the same time, Nintendo has come under attack from some parents, who worry  that their children are virtually addicted to the games to the detriment of  learning. The company has also been the target of accusations that its business  methods are anti-competitive. Its chief American rival, Atari Corp., has filed  an antitrust suit alleging that Nintendo unfairly restricts its outside  software developers.  </P> <P> Separately, Nintendo has said it plans to diversify outside of home  entertainment in the United States sometime this year and establish a  communications network for its Nintendo Entertainment Systems hardware. This  would give users the ability to shop, trade stocks, conduct banking  transactions or make travel arrangements -- as well as play long-distance  computer games. Home brokerage services have been offered to Nintendo customers  in Japan for the past two years.  </P> <P> Nintendo's $3-million commitment to MIT will help support the work of Seymour  A. Papert, a pioneer in artificial intelligence who is using computers in a  curriculum-free setting to teach children at a public elementary school in  Boston. Papert developed a computer language for children that is standard in  the field, and his students are writing computer programs to control machines  they build out of Lego blocks.  </P> <P> Yamauchi said Nintendo's contribution to MIT reflects a sense of responsibility  -- as the world's largest computer-game maker -- to provide educational  opportunities through its machines.  </P> <P> "We teamed up with MIT's Media Lab because we want to go beyond entertainment,"  Yamauchi said in an interview at Nintendo headquarters in Kyoto. "We think  children ought to learn while they're having fun."  </P> <P> Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Laboratory, said Yamauchi was  reluctant when Negroponte approached him in February to propose the research  sponsorship, accompanied by Papert and Marvin L. Minsky, another pioneer in  artificial intelligence, who was awarded the prestigious Japan Prize in April.  </P> <P> "At first, Nintendo didn't know what to make of the idea," Negroponte said.  "But I think they're following their instincts."  </P> <P> Indeed, Yamauchi said, he has built Nintendo into a multibillion-dollar  corporation by "trial and error."  </P> <P> Founded 101 years ago by Yamauchi's great-grandfather as a modest manufacturer  of traditional hanafuda playing cards, Nintendo now projects sales of 400  billion yen, about $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, and after-tax profit  of more than $360 million in the fiscal year that began April 1.  </P> <P> "We simply followed the computer revolution and found out what people really  wanted," Yamauchi said.  </P> <P> Exports to the U.S. market of Nintendo's 8-bit NES home system, its new  hand-held Game Boy computer game and software cartridges for both lines account  for nearly 75% of the company's sales.  </P> <P> Nintendo, which makes all its products in Japan, ships 850,000 units of the NES  to the United States each month, according to Minoru Arakawa, president of  Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo of America Inc. Arakawa said he plans to travel  to Frankfurt, West Germany, at the end of the month to start a new, wholly  owned subsidiary that will market Game Boy in Europe, where sales have lagged  because of "cultural differences."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Nintendo holds such a commanding lead in the American computer game  market that it is occasionally accused of monopolistic practices. Last  December, for example, Rep. Dennis Eckart (D-Ohio) asked the Justice  Department's antitrust division to investigate Nintendo's "significant  intimidation in the retail market," which supposedly stifles competition.  </P> <P> "I suspect Mr. Eckart is seeking publicity," Yamauchi said. "Nintendo doesn't  consider this as a problem."  </P> <P> Likewise, Yamauchi said the company's lawyers will have no difficulty defending  against Atari's antitrust suit, which he expects to go to trial in federal  court in San Francisco in about a year.  </P> <P> At issue is the company's practice of demanding tight contracts with its  outside software developers, which prevents them from selling their computer  games to other hardware vendors, such as Atari. Also controversial is  Nintendo's strategy of pricing its hardware very low (about $100 a set) and  reaping huge profits on subsequent sales of software game cartridges.  </P> <P> "Nintendo's system of controlling its software developers has caused an awful  lot of resentment," said Colin Mills, a securities analyst for the brokerage  firm of W. I. Carr in Tokyo. "But it's really a brilliant move. Who cares if  you have enemies when you're making money like this?"  </P> <P> Nintendo, which recently shifted its fiscal year, reported sales of $1.4  billion and net profit of $178 million for the seven months ended March 31.  Annualized, this represents sales of $2.4 billion, a dramatic jump of about 25%  over the company's performance in its latest full fiscal year.  </P> <P> Yamauchi said the structure of the computer-game industry naturally tends to  create one manufacturer who takes all the spoils, because most families cannot  afford more than one set of hardware. And Nintendo's software subcontractors  are free to go elsewhere if they like, he said.  </P> <P> "If our terms are so strict they make people unhappy, they're always free not  to accept them," Yamauchi said. "But so many companies are satisfied because  they see the merits of doing business with us. It's always their choice, not  ours."  </P></p>

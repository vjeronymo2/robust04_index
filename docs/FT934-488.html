			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool WOOL Prices at New Zealand sales on December 20 were frequently a little softer again, and clearances to the trade were not good. Only at last week's Bradford auction of British wool did prices rise, and the rise was sharp at up to 15%. This was a special situation with very few firms selling substantially earlier in the season and finding that better activity in the carpet wool sector has led to concentrated competition for limited supplies. The market otherwise has closed dull and indecisively for Christmas with wool prices significantly above the season's low point but also well down on November peaks.</p>

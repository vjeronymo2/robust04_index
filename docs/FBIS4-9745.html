			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 31 Mar (EFE) -- Peruvian congressman Alexander  Kouri of the Popular Christian Party (PPC) today regretted the  declarations made by General Humberto Ordonez, chief of the  Ecuadoran 1st Army Division, who called for the recovery "with  the use of arms" of the Peruvian Amazon territory claimed by  Ecuador.    Kouri rejected Gen. Ordonez' comments and noted the quick  answer from Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, who said  the general's reaction "is part of the pressure from some  Ecuadoran political groups seeking to gain support for the  upcoming partial renewal of the Ecuadoran Congress."    "There is no territorial problem with Ecuador," said Kouri,  who pointed out that any debate on this issue should be made  based on the Rio Protocol, which in 1942 established the borders  between the two countries after a war in 1941.    Ordonez' declarations "do not deserve an answer," said  Kouri,  who added that now Ecuador does not recognize the Rio Protocol,  saying that it is not "applicable."    Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on 30 March that  Peru should welcome Ecuadoran Presidnt Sixto Duran Ballen "with  open arms."    In relation to the new postponement of Duran Ballen's visit,  President Fujimori, who is in Pucallpa in Peru's central jungle  region, said: "I presume there are reasons preventing him from  coming and we understand it."    "He, Sixto Duran, will find the most appropriate date; let  us  wait for him with open arms," reiterated Fujimori, who added  that relations between the two countries are at the highest  level.    The comments by the Ecuadoran general also were criticized  by  another congressman, Manuel Moreyra, of the opposition  Solidarity and Democracy, who said the Peruvian Government has  handled its relations with Ecuador badly.    He said the government made the mistake of making Ecuadorans  believe "the country can give up part of its territory. We are  now paying the consequences of the bad management of our foreign  relations."    "What should have been said from the beginning is that Peru  will not give up a single centimeter of its territory," said  Moreyra, thus agreeing with Kouri that Ordonez' comments do not  deserve an answer.    Foreign Relations Committee President Oswaldo Sandoval, from  the government alliance Change 90-New Majority, said the new  postponement of President Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is the  result of internal political problems in Ecuador.    "It is not a final postponement," said Sandoval, who  expressed his hope that the Ecuadoran president will visit Peru  before the end of 1994 in answer to the three visits made by  Fujimori to Ecuador.    He also added that Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is important  to strengthen the links between the two countries.</p>

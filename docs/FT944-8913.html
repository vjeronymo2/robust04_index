			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: China fund takes stake in ink maker Zim, a new closed-end China fund, has joined Sicpa of Switzerland in taking a majority Dollars 16m share of the Shanghai Printing Ink Factory, China's largest ink manufacturer. The investment gives the foreign partners 70 per cent of the joint venture. Zhonghua Investment Management, a partnership which includes Kamsky and Associates and Oppenheimer of the US and Electra Trust of the UK, is targeting companies in high-growth consumer industries for investment. Sicpa, which is helping to upgrade the Shanghai plant's technology, is the world's largest privately-owned ink manufacturer. Mr Wing Keong Siew, president of Zim, said the company had assembled a Dollars 50m fund for investment in the consumer sector, but expected to increase the fund to some Dollars 200m. Zim's strategy, Mr Wing said, was to invest in unlisted Chinese companies and joint ventures. In the case of the Shanghai venture it had identified an opportunity, introduced foreign expertise and was helping fund technological improvements with the fast-growing packaging industry in mind. Zim is one of some 25 China funds that have developed over the past several years with an estimated Dollars 1bn under management. These funds have tended to invest either in the B-share market or in China-related stocks on the Hong Kong exchange. But in a strengthening trend funds are seeking opportunities for investment in unlisted companies that are becoming more freely available as a consequence of China's drive to restructure its economy. Struggling state-owned companies are turning to foreign partners for assistance with technological upgrading and investment.</p>

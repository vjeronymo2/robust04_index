			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION'S ROLE IN BATTLING TERRORISM  </P> <P> The abuse of language concerning recent Mideast events has created a prism of  distortion through which America views the latest developments and it causes us  to perceive a dangerously twisted image of reality. Israel's most recent blow  against international terrorism with its capture of Sheik Obeid cannot be  called a "kidnaping".  </P> <P> I would like to invite public attention to the fact that in common English  parlance, criminals are captured, seized, arrested, or apprehended; not  kidnaped. Only innocent people are kidnaped. We are allowing ourselves to be  trapped by the semantic deceptions of terrorism if we accept a label such as  "kidnapers" when referring to Israel. We continue surrendering our moral values  and our linguistic autonomy when we refer to Sheik Obeid as a "hostage". He is  an accessory to murder who enjoyed total immunity until Israel acted with  dazzling brilliance and surgical precision. Only innocent individuals are  termed "hostages." Obeid is a prisoner.  </P> <P> RABBI IRVIN BRANDWEIN  </P> <P> Temple Beth Emet  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

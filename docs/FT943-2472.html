			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Enviromed makes Pounds 7.4m buy Enviromed, the biotechnology group, has bought F&amp;H Baxter (Holdings), a dental equipment and supplies company, for Pounds 7.42m. Enviromed also proposes to raise Pounds 2.7m by the placing and open offer of 3.6m 8 per cent convertible redeemable preference shares at 100p. The shares are being offered to existing shareholders on the basis of two for every 13 ordinary shares. The acquisition will be satisfied as to Pounds 2.1m by the issue of 1.7m ordinary shares, Pounds 3.72m in variable rate guaranteed unsecured loan notes, and Pounds 1.6m in cash. Of the cash consideration, Pounds 1.38m will be deferred until the Inland Revenue agrees to offset Baxter's advance corporation tax liability arising before September 1994 against mainstream corporation tax. Turnover for Baxter for the year ended August 31 1993 was Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 18.2m) for pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.59m).</p>

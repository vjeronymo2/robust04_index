			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Arms inspectors return as allied jets patrol over Iraq UN WEAPONS inspectors returned to Iraq yesterday stressing that the imposition last week by the US, Britain and France of an air exclusion over the south of the country would not affect their work. Aircraft from the US and Britain continued to patrol the area south of the 32nd parallel yesterday with no indication from the Baghdad regime that it was prepared to challenge the new allied restrictions. French Mirage 2000 jets are due to join the patrols today. The so-called 'no-fly' zone was imposed officially to protect the Shia population from intensified attacks by the regime of President Saddam Hussein, but some US officials concede that it is part of an overall strategy to topple the Iraqi leader. These officials had expected the previous UN weapons team to challenge the Iraqi regime's refusal to permit inspections of government ministries, in defiance of Security Council resolutions. Reports from Washington had suggested President Bush would have been prepared to order air strikes to ensure compliance. However, no request was made to search a government ministry and the weapons inspection team left Baghdad without incident. Mr Maurizio Zifferero, the Italian who heads the new team, said on arrival in Baghdad yesterday that his policy was 'not to be the cause of provocation'. He declined to say where the team would be carrying out its searches for more evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, but added: 'If this visit is quiet and fruitful, it will be a success.' Reuter adds from New York: UN Security Council members are contemplating possible action over Iraq's alleged harassment of UN guards after a bomb was attached to a UN car in northern Iraq, diplomats said. The bomb was found on a UN car on Friday after it had passed a government checkpoint. The UN said harassment against its personnel continued yesterday when the windscreens of two vehicles were smashed in Baghdad.</p>

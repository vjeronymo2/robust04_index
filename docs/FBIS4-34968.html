			<p>BFN     [Text] The refloating of Urupabol [Permanent Joint  Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia], which disappeared  in 1982, does not have as its purpose to become a counterbalance  to Argentina and Brazil, the two powerful partners of Mercosur  [Common Market of the South], Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio  Abreu Bonilla said yesterday. "The essential thing is to  develop the idea of Urupabol based on complementary interests  and not on a confrontation between interests," he said.    While he admitted that Paraguay and Uruguay have to compete  within Mercosur among common interests in a single market of 200  million consumers, he added that this does not necessarily mean  confrontation, as common interests and common positions among  the four countries must be sought.    The Uruguayan foreign minister added: "What we must seek  within Mercosur is a clearer and more definite integration, and  especially a strict fulfillment of the obligations assumed by  the (four) countries. This is true for the large ones  (Argentina and Brazil), in particular, because they are our main  markets. It is also true for the small ones, or those  suffering the imbalances (Paraguay and Uruguay), both because of  our exporting potential and also based on the importance that  needs to be given to the obligations assumed."    Bolivia is part of the Andean Pact, and for this reason is  not a member of Mercosur, as the Asuncion Treaty does not allow  it. The Uruguayan foreign minister said, however, that  bilateral agreements can be achieved with Bolivia through the  Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) headquartered in  Montevideo. He further explained that improved trade can be  achieved through ALADI, as a way of explaining that there are no  difficulties for Paraguay and Uruguay in exchanging products  bilaterally with countries that are not members of Mercosur.    "The presence of Bolivia is very important, not only within  the framework of cooperation, but essentially within the  framework of trade -- only with the legal instruments we already  have, and not with the legal structures that prevail in the  Mercosur market," he said.    Abreu Bonilla said his country has offered Paraguay and  Bolivia its port services for export of their products through  the Atlantic Ocean, considering that both are landlocked  countries.</p>

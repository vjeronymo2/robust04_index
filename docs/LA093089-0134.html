			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOES OF IRVINE RIGHTS LAW CALLED OUTSIDERS  </P> <P> The Rev. Louis Sheldon, the Anaheim anti-gay activist, and other people who do  not live in Irvine are helping to organize and direct the campaign to deny  homosexuals protection under Irvine's controversial human rights ordinance,  critics charged Friday.  </P> <P> Calling the involvement of Sheldon and the others an intrusion into the city's  affairs, City Councilwoman Paula Werner expressed concern over outsiders  becoming active in issues that she said should be decided solely by residents  of Irvine.  </P> <P> "I certainly intend to investigate how we as a City Council might better  formulate our campaign rules and restrictions so that Irvine residents and  workers are having the impact on matters regarding Irvine, not the outsiders  like the ones who have gotten into this campaign," she said. "I don't think  outside interests should be interfering with Irvine politics."  </P> <P> Werner's comments came after it was revealed that Sheldon and other  non-residents had lent their support to the Irvine Values Coalition, a group  primarily composed of religious fundamentalists that is trying to delete the  words "sexual orientation" from the rights ordinance. A proposal to that effect  will appear on the Nov. 7 city ballot.  </P> <P> Werner also serves as a board member of Irvine Citizens United, a group formed  to oppose the ballot measure.  </P> <P> Irvine Citizens United said two men who helped write the ballot argument to  exclude homosexuals from the ordinance are not Irvine residents. The group  identified them as Joe Dallas, a Garden Grove counselor, and Dr. Lawrence J.  McNamee, a radiologist in Whittier who lives in La Habra Heights.  </P> <P> McNamee worked with Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) on Proposition  102, a proposal that would have required that the names of AIDS patients be  registered with the state. It was rejected by California voters in the last  election.  </P> <P> Attempts to contact Dallas and McNamee for comment were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Jim Boone, a member of Citizens United, said many Irvine residents resent  "being controlled and run by people completely outside the city. It is plain to  see that Rev. Louis Sheldon is the 'grandfather' of this organization, and all  the rest are his children. The similarities are endless."  </P> <P> Boone pointed to the similarity in the names and agendas of Sheldon's  Traditional Values Coalition and the Irvine Values Coalition. Last month,  Sheldon's group led a protest against a gay pride festival in Santa Ana. He is  waging a recall effort against that city's mayor and three council members  because the festival was allowed to be held.  </P> <P> Scott Peotter, chairman of the Irvine Values Coalition, at first strongly  denied that the two organizations had been in contact but he later conceded  that "a few conversations" took place with Sheldon. Sheldon went further,  saying the Traditional Values Coalition had been advising and shaping the  Irvine group since its infancy.  </P> <P> "We have been serving them since the very early beginnings of it, which is only  natural because we have an interest in this thing too," Sheldon said. "I just  spoke to them and gave advice to Scott a few days ago. We chitchat about  different things quite often."  </P> <P> Victoria Miller, treasurer of Irvine Citizens United, criticized Peotter's  group for bringing in outsiders to give the organization legitimacy.  </P> <P> Peotter responded that residency was not a primary concern in bringing in  people to work on the campaign.  </P> <P> 'We are bringing in people that look credible; residents were of secondary  concern," Peotter said. "It is not being run by those guys, but sometimes we  use the expertise of people like William Dannemeyer. We are all just amateurs  at this."  </P> <P> If voters approve the Nov. 7 ballot measure, the words "sexual orientation"  would be deleted from the human rights ordinance. The City Council adopted the  ordinance to ban discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, physical  handicap, marital status or sexual orientation.  </P></p>

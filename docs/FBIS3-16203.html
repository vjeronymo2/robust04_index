			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] BELAPAN has learned that the legislative commission  for state building has elaborated a draft law on presidential  elections in the Republic of Belarus. According to the  document, the presidential election will be held based on the  general, equal, and direct electoral law in the form of a secret  ballot. If this provision is approved by the Supreme Soviet,  the election will be closed to citizens found incapable by a  court decision as well as citizens who are incarcerated or held  in custody. The draft also says that only Belarusian citizens  over 35 years of age are eligible to vote, and only those who  have lived in the Republic for at least 10 years can be elected.  The president's term of office would last five years. At the  same time, the same person cannot be elected for more than two  terms.    According to the document, candidacies for the Belarusian  president will be put forward by at least 70 legislative  deputies as well as by Belarusian citizens, who must collect at  least 100,000 signatures of the electors. All expenses  connected with the organization of the election are covered by  the state budget. The commission for state building suggested  that the submission of presidential candidates should start in  75 days. The Central Electoral Commission has to register an  initiative group in charge of collecting signatures for  presidential candidates within five days. Lists of the  signatures are to be submitted to rayon, city, or city district  electoral commissions at least 55 days before the election. So,  simple calculation shows that the legislative commission  considers two weeks or so a sufficient time for collecting  100,000 signatures from citizens.</p>

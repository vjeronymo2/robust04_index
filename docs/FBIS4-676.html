			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Office of Chief Minister of kwaZulu on </F> the SAPA PR Wire Service on 14 April]    [Text] Statement by the delegation of the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] to the international mediators on the present  impasse in the mediation process.    The IFP is ready, willing and able to begin the mediation  process immediately as we have been ready for the past 12 hours.    The IFP stands by the consolidated terms of reference agreed  upon between then ANC and the IFP on Sunday, April 10, 1994 ,  which the IFP believes must form the basis on which negotiations  must begin and proceed. In fact the mediators were brought to  South Africa on the basis of these term of reference.    If the South African Government wishes to submit to the  mediators an additional document in which they set forth any  different or additional concerns or any other matter, they may  do so. During today's discussions it appears that the South  African Government does not have an objection to the contents of  the consolidated terms of reference agreed between the IFP and  the South African Government which are basically reflected in  the document produced by the government.    However, the government seems now to require that the IFP  accepts a precondition as a price to pay to enter the  international mediation effort. This request of the South  African Government has been supported by the ANC which has  reneged on the consolidated terms of reference previously agreed  upon.    This precondition is that the IFP agrees that the election  shall be held only on the scheduled date of April 26 and 27,  1994. This means that by virtue of having agreed to such a date,  the IFP could no longer sustain and advocate its policy position  that the election date is to be postponed in any other fora in  which the political debate is taking place. There is no doubt  that the issue of the postponement of the election date is the  crux of the present national crisis. In fact, any possible  analysis of the situation shows that only through a postponement  of the election will it be possible to ensure that a  constitutional compromise can open the doors to enable the IFP  to rejoin the electoral process on an equal footing with all  other parties.    The IFP has agreed to consider the possibility that the  issue  of the election date is not to be raised during mediation but  can not agree under any circumstances on the imposition of this  precondition in breach of all previous agreements related to  international mediation.    Furthermore, the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party]  alliance and the National Party are now requesting that the IFP  agrees on an implementation procedure which would effectively  preempt and prevent the participation of the IFP in the election  process. They request that the IFP agrees that the only  implementing technique to translate into reality any positive  result emerging from negotiations shall be a "solemn pact". This  means that whatever constitutional compromise produced through  international mediation will be delivered to a constituent  assembly after elections, rather than being translated into  constitutional amendments prior to elections. The IFP would not  be represented in such a constituent assembly and it would be  forced to operate as an extra-parliamentary force.    In this light the only purpose of the "solemn pact" appears  to be to ensure that the IFP has no political or moral ground to  continue to oppose the legitimacy of the election process and  the empowerment of a constituent assembly after elections.    During over four hours of negotiations today neither the ANC  nor the South African Government has shown any flexibility with  respect to the imposition of these two preconditions.    The IFP rejects the notion that it should accept these two  preconditions in order to sit at the mediation table. The IFP  stresses the fact that the final purpose of international  mediation is to create the basis for a political compromise  which will enable the IFP to participate in elections.    There will be no stability in this country or any certainty  about future democratic developments if a significant political  force such as the IFP is not part of the process. The ANC/SACP  alliance and the National Party wish to close the only available  options to ensure that such a result is achieved.    The IFP regrets that it might not be the role of the  mediators to get involved in the issue of the election date of  the election dat or the issue of whether any rasults of  mediation should be translated into a solemn pact rather than  constitutional amendments. However, it is not fair or just to  require that the IFP accepts that the options of amending the  constitution prior to elections an postponing the election date  be eliminated from any political debate in the country at the  outset of mediation as a precondition to begin mediation.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE PROMISES SUPPORT TO ROMANIA ;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: THE SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS HE WAS 'MOVED' BY TALKS WITH  BUCHAREST'S NEW LEADERS. HE SAYS MOSCOW WILL INCREASE OIL AND GAS SHIPMENTS.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze spent Saturday meeting with  Romania's new leaders and afterward said that he promised them the Soviet  Union's "political, material and moral support."  </P> <P> He said that talks on economic cooperation will begin "in the near future" and  promised Romania increased shipments of oil and natural gas to help its 23  million citizens get through the winter with homes heated to near-normal levels  for the first time in years.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said he was "moved" by his sessions with the National Salvation  Front leaders and the provisional government, which will run the country until  elections are held in April.  </P> <P> "Never before have I come to a country with such feelings of emotion which I  experienced here today on Romanian soil," Shevardnadze said. "The feeling is in  my heart, and is always present whenever you make history. And there is no  doubt that the Romanian revolution is a phenomenon in Romanian and world  history.  </P> <P> "The people with whom I talked told me of the great hardships and difficulties  the country must overcome to do away with the inheritance of the dictator."  </P> <P> The Soviet foreign minister's visit came 12 days after Romanian dictator  Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed by a military firing  squad. In power for 24 years, Ceausescu's grim police state was an obvious  embarrassment to the Soviet Union throughout the period of Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's leadership.  </P> <P> "By comparison with the past," Shevardnadze said, "I must say the atmosphere  was absolutely purified. It was, if I may say so, full of oxygen and quite  pleasant to be here." He said that his meetings Saturday "will lead to better  development."  </P> <P> "The Soviet people have great enthusiasm for the (Romanian) revolution," he  said. "They have expressed their wish to support the revolution. This is in  line with the process of perestroika," the Soviet term for restructuring.  </P> <P> "We do not accept dictatorship," he said. "That is why we started our  revolution, which is called perestroika. An important feature of our revolution  is the democratization of politics, society and economic relations in our  country. Dictatorship cannot be accepted, neither a Communist dictatorship nor  a bourgeois one."  </P> <P> Meeting with journalists, Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union has no intention  of attempting to influence the direction of the new government or of the April  elections.  </P> <P> "What specific parties will lead Romania is the business of the Romanians," he  said. "We shall always obey the will of the people."  </P> <P> On the issue of the Soviet republic of Moldavia, Shevardnadze said restrictions  will be lifted on both sides of the Romanian and Soviet border, allowing  relatives on both sides to visit either country. "In that way," he said, "some  of the problems will be solved."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said the Soviets had sent Romania about 130 railroad cars of  medical supplies, valued at 1.5 million rubles, and had offered 8,000 hospital  beds.  </P> <P> He said Romania is receiving daily 22 million cubic meters of natural gas and  that the Soviet Union will send 390,000 tons of oil this month. "We also intend  to supply other sources of energy," he said.  </P> <P> He added that the Soviet Union will no longer receive imports of meat and dairy  products from Romania.  </P> <P> It was not clear just how much meat the Romanians have been supplying to the  Soviets in recent years in exchange for oil, but Romanian stores have been  barren for years, with meat and dairy products virtually non-existent for  ordinary consumers.  </P></p>

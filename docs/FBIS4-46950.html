			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Yesterday Vladimir Nekhoroshkov, oblast  administration deputy chief, received Amsa Amin, Republic of  Bangladesh ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to  Russia, who was visiting Novosibirsk, as he said, on a goodwill  mission to restore business relations and learn about the oblast.    This is the first time Novosibirsk has received such a  prestigious guest from a distant Asian country. Noting this  fact, V. Nekhoroshkov emphasized that the ambassador's visit  marked the beginning of extensive contacts between Bangladesh  and Novosibirsk Oblast in various areas, but particularly in the  field of economics, culture, education, and science.    The parties exchanged information about possible business  cooperation and reached the conclusion that it could be arranged  on a long-term basis since there was common interest in this.    A. Amin intends to visit industrial enterprises and  scientific, cultural, and educational institutions in  Novosibirsk.    The ambassador is accompanied on his trip to Novosibirsk by  Petr Nechayev, Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Department of Foreign Relations chief specialist.</p>

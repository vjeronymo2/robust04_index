			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA GROWTH PLAN'S FRUSTRATED OPPONENTS PONDER NEW STRATEGY  </P> <P> A Ventura citizens group opposed to the City Council's growth plan is trying to  regroup in the wake of the council's final vote this week in favor of a  population of 115,000 by the year 2010.  </P> <P> But the group concedes that it is only beginning to learn the political basics  needed to overturn city policy in an initiative campaign.  </P> <P> Ventura's estimated population now is 90,000. The citizens group, called the  Alliance for Ventura's Future, would like a slower rate of growth than the one  the City Council approved.  </P> <P> The group has scheduled a Sept. 13 meeting at Anacapa School to plan its  strategy in the wake of final City Council approval of the city's comprehensive  growth plan initially approved in June.  </P> <P> The Alliance for Ventura's Future originally had hoped to organize a referendum  on the growth plan to be included on the Nov. 7 ballot, when four City Council  seats will be at stake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Initial Plans Frustrated  </P> <P> Cathy Bean, vice chairwoman of Alliance as well as a council candidate, said  this week, however, that the group's plans were frustrated by the timing of the  council's final actions.  </P> <P> She said the council's decision to postpone until Monday a final vote on the  comprehensive plan made it impossible for the citizen's group to get a  referendum on the November ballot.  </P> <P> The only alternative would have been to force a special election sometime  around Christmas, Bean said. Alliance members decided that that would have been  politically divisive.  </P> <P> "We started out with the idea of a referendum, but they kept postponing the  final date for the council vote," Bean said. "This makes it much harder for us.  An initiative campaign is much harder to organize than a referendum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Involves More Expense  </P> <P> "It has to be legally airtight, and that involves added legal expenses," she  added. "We will be discussing the costs and general strategy Sept. 13 with some  experts from Santa Barbara who ran a similar initiative campaign."  </P> <P> Ventura City Councilman Richard Francis was among several council members  questioning whether an initiative campaign on the growth issue will be  successful in Ventura.  </P> <P> "I never want to underestimate the public, but my personal opinion is that  there must be some difficulty in the organization or they wouldn't have  switched from the referendum approach to this one," Francis said.  </P> <P> The group's present goal, Bean said, is to have the initiative written this  fall and placed on the general election ballot next June.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Be Rejected  </P> <P> Although Alliance members privately say their goal is to limit Ventura's  population to 102,000 by the year 2010, Bean declined to discuss a figure and  said any initiative proposal specifying a population limit would be rejected by  the courts.  </P> <P> "The language has to be couched in certain legalese," she said. "This is not  going to be simple to write. The goal is to stop the rapid growth in Ventura.  It will be hard, but I wouldn't be involved if I didn't think it has a chance."  </P> <P> In Santa Barbara, a citizens group collected 10,500 signatures for an  initiative campaign aimed at limiting future commercial growth. The Santa  Barbara group has delayed filing its petitions, however, because of a  city-sponsored ballot question on the same subject.  </P> <P> Ventura City Clerk Barbara Kam said the timing of the city's final approval of  the growth plan was not related to the effort of the citizens group in any way,  but was simply the result of the lengthy time required in printing copies of  the planning documents.  </P> <P> Kam said that any referendum effort launched later than early July would not  have qualified for the November ballot. She said an initiative drive aimed at  next June's ballot will require the signatures of 15% of the 52,000 or so  registered voters in the city.  </P></p>

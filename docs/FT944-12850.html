			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Mark Thatcher Affair: Arms-payoff facts prove scarce - Al Yamamah deal 'Thatcher's millions from Saudi defence deal' is the UK journalistic equivalent of 'Who shot Kennedy?'. An army of journalists has investigated the long-running allegation that Mr Thatcher exploited his position as the then prime minister's son to take a fat commission on the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah military contract between Saudi Arabia and the UK. A consensus has developed among the many Thatcher conspiracy theorists that he was paid Dollars 20m. Hard facts are scarce, however. There is one piece of documentary evidence, authenticated as part of a US court case, that he played some role in the deal. This is a 1989 memorandum written by a US defence company executive, purporting to be an account of the executive's conversation with an employee of the US embassy in Riyadh about Saudi defence sales. It contains the tantalising but obscure sentence: 'This 4 bil US was menioned in connection with M. Thather's (sic) son.' A rather more comprehensible account of his alleged role in defence sales is contained in another company's memorandum, although this has never been authenticated. It was passed by Mr Jeffrey Rooker, the Labour MP, to Downing Street for further investigation - but the government has never commented on its veracity. Mr Howard Teicher, an adviser to the US National Security Council during the Reagan presidency, insisted two years ago that he saw intelligence and diplomatic dispatches confirming Mr Thatcher's involvement in Al Yamamah. More recently The Sunday Times newspaper reproduced transcripts of alleged conversations between arms dealers and agents of the Saudi royal family which appeared to confirm that Mr Thatcher had acted as an agent in that deal. The Sunday Times has, however, disclosed that it does not possess the original tapes - and anyway the transcript gives no detail of payments to Mr Thatcher. Officials and politicians have privately confirmed that in the mid-1980s Mr Thatcher was mixing in the circles of those who were involved in the negotiations - so the journalistic quest for this holy grail of alleged sleaze will go on. For his part Mr Thatcher says he is a friend of Mr Wafic Said, the Syrian-born financier who acted as go-between for the British negotiators on Al Yamamah. But he insists that the relationship with Mr Said is rooted in the close friendship between his wife, Diane, and Mr Said's wife, Rosemary. Mr Thatcher said: 'Merely because I know this man does not mean to say that he is going to pay me Pounds 12m because I am a nice guy.'</p>

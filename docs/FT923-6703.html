			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Au revoir les cafes: The passing of a French institution Every day at 6am, Mrs Nicole Barradis drags open the doors of Le Ventadour, the cafe that she owns off the bustling Boulevard de l'Opera in Paris. She cleans the cafe, issues instructions to her staff, then sits on a stool until 8pm selling cigarettes and stamps from the tabac kiosk. 'My routine has been the same for 15 years,' she says. 'In all that time I've only ever had two weeks of holiday. I come to the cafe even when I'm ill. I daren't think what would happen to it without me.' Almost every street in Paris has its cafe au coin, ruled with a rod of iron by a patronne such as Mrs Barradis, wearing a black cardigan, whatever the weather, with gracious smiles for her regulars and frosty nods to strangers. But France's cafes are dying. More than 5,000 disappear each year, according to official figures. There were 510,000 cafes in France during their heyday in 1910. By 1960 there were 200,000 and by 1990 just 70,000. The consensus is that there will be only 50,000 to 60,000 cafes left by the year 2000. Small cafes have borne the brunt of the decline. France's smart restaurants are flourishing. Three weeks' advance booking is needed for those with three Michelin stars. The legendary literary cafes in Paris are packed with tourists. Aux Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint-Germain is so full of foreigners hoping someone will come along to play Simone de Beauvoir to their Jean-Paul Sartre that the locals flee to Cafe de Flore down the road. Brasserie Lipp across the street is so busy that it can afford to turn away tourists - too many and the locals might be offended. Life is very different for the cafes aux coins, the neighbourhood bistros and the cafes-tabacs with their tobacco kiosks at the end of the bar. They are the gallic equivalent of Britain's pubs and the US neighbourhood bars. They belong to the bygone era when workers went back to the same zinc-topped bar night after night to knock back hearty vin du pays with Johnny Hallyday records crooning from the jukebox. Mr Pierre Discazeaux ran a cafe-tabac on Rue Saint-Anne in central Paris for seven years. Three years ago he turned it into a tabac-presse, or newsagent. The cigar-shaped tabac sign still hangs outside, but the cafe fixtures have been taken away to make room for shelves of sweets, cigarettes, newspapers and magazines. 'It's much better like this,' he says. 'I don't have to work so hard and I make more money. The cafe was always a struggle. There was no future in it.' The demise of the cafe au coin reflects broader changes in the French way of life. Many of the old cafes were in city centres, or close to factories on the fringes. They have gone out of business as the locals have moved to the suburbs and factories have closed or contracted. Le Cochon a l'Oreille has been a bistro in the Les Halles area of Paris since 1913. Its original customers were the workers from the nearby fruit and vegetable market, who popped in for meals between shifts. After the market closed in 1969 it struggled along, drumming up custom from the remnants of the local wholesale trade. Eventually even the wholesalers drifted away. 'Things were really tough for a while,' says Mr Andre Camboulas, who runs the bistro, now filled with designers and stylists from the fashion companies that have sprung up around Les Halles. 'The neighbourhood has changed and we changed with it. Life hasn't been easy but we've survived.' Others have been less fortunate. The biggest single blow to an old-fashioned French cafe is the news that a fast-food outlet is opening in its area. McDonald's, Burger Kings, sandwich bars and croissanteries now offer an efficient alternative to the traditional snack at a local bistro. One of the factors that persuaded Mr Discazeaux to close his cafe was the growth of the deliver-to-the-door sushi bars along Rue Saint-Anne, now the main Japanese eating area in Paris. Le Cochon a l'Oreille faces stiff competition from the nearby branch of Lina's, a chain of de luxe sandwich shops. An analysis by the French restaurateurs' association showed that a typical cafe loses 30 per cent of its business if a McDonald's opens in its area. Sushi and Big Macs are only part of the problem. The traditional French cafe is a victim of modernity. Almost all the changes in postwar lifestyles have contributed to its decline. Television tempts people to spend more time at home. Fax machines mean they need fewer stamps from the tabac. Microwave ovens make it easier to whip up quick snacks rather than to nip into a bistro. Espresso coffee makers mean office workers no longer need to go to a zinc comptoir for their capuccino. The cafe au coin is out of tune with the times. The customers are mainly male blue-collar workers in their 50s or 60s. It is unusual to see anyone under 30 in a traditional cafe-tabac unless they are with older workmates. Young Parisians go to sombre bars in Pigalle and Bastille, where they play chess and read poetry. Sheherazade, one of the hottest clubs in the city, opened earlier this year with a neo-Surrealist arts event. Mrs Christianne Taupin took over Cafe du Perron, a cafe-tabac on Rue des Saints-Peres, four years ago. She manages to stay in business thanks to a loyal band of regulars who work nearby, but there are few newcomers. 'I'd be finished without my regulars,' she says. 'Young people just don't go to cafes any more. I can't even get them to work here. The hours are too long and the pay is too low. Cafes are closing all the time.'</p>

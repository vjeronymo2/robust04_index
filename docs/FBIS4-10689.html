			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 April, the Electric Union of the Ministry of  Basic Industry announced that the electric power deficit being  experienced nationwide will continue on into next week, and that  outages will continue to be extensive. The nation's power  generation capability is 3,132 megawatts, but the fact that the  generator units of certain plants have not received maintenance  or have broken down has resulted in a significant drop in the  output of energy. Although 1,325 megawatts were provided this  week, there is a marked difference between the nation's supply  of electricity and its demand. This has resulted in extensive  outages between 0500 and 0000.    Next week's deficit is estimated at 680 megawatts;  therefore,  the extensive outages will continue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Kondrashov, ITAR-TASS correspondent, </F> Belgrade: "A Life Preserver"]    [Text] No matter how strange, but in Belgrade and even in  the Serbian part of Sarajevo there was, during the 10 days when  the NATO ultimatum was in effect, no manifestation of a special  anxiety, commensurate with the threat hanging over the Serbs.  Moreover, a number of signs point to the fact that the  leadership of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serbs did not consider  as serious the NATO threat to inflict strikes on the Serbian  artillery positions near Sarajevo and was originally convinced  of the political settlement of this conflict.    To all the appeals of a number of opposition parties to  convene an extraordinary session of the Serbian parliament to  discuss the impending threat, the leader of the parliamentary  faction of the ruling Socialist Party answered with a refusal,  alluding to the great effectiveness of secret diplomatic efforts  and the needlessness of additional dramatization of the  situation.    The military-political leadership of the Serbian side did  not  believe in the effectiveness of NATO air strikes and calmly  waited for the outcome of the situation. To conduct a large air  operation in Bosnia in February would be extremely difficult  because of the weather conditions. Constant fog, low clouds, and  strong winds sharply decrease the possibility of precise  bomb-release, not to speak of the threat of large  weather-related air plane losses alone. Incidentally, during the  period of the ultimatumm, two NATO planes were involved in a  catastrophe over the Adriatic Sea (the last smashed in Slovenia,  miraculously not having caused a calamity in connection with the  possible explosion of ammunition and fuel on board).    Combat flights over Sarajevo with the bombing and launching  of missiles aimed at Serbian batteries located at times in  residential quarters, next to places where contingents of the UN  forces are stationed, next to Muslim districts, could already  during the first days lead to hundreds of victims among the  civilian population and even the "blue helmets." It is not  difficult to imagine what an echo this would produce in the  Western countries.    Moreover, the "first demonstrative strikes" would  practically  decide anything as regards the demolition of the fire power of  Serbian artillery, having several reserve positions each. During  the early stage of the ultimatum the commanders of the Bosnian  Serbs openly talked about this. The neutralization of the 500  (and possibly even more) firing positions of the Serbs would  require massive carpet bombing for a period of 2 weeks, moreover  from various directions. The refusal of Greece to make available  its military bases for the NATO operation at once sharply  decreased the chances for quick success. The potential of the  military airports in Italy, as well as the aircraft carrier  Saratoga, was clearly inadequate.    If we add to this the enormous probability of unwanted hits  of civilian objects, the potential possibility of the capture of  French and British "blue helmets" by the Serbs, the  discontinuation of humanitarian convoys, saving the Muslim  population from hunger and its army--from demoralization,  reciprocal actions of the Serbian side, both against NATO  aircraft and the Muslims, and possible terrorist acts of Serbian  extremists in NATO countries, it becomes clear that the Brussels  ultimatum was sooner adventurist than a well-considered course  of military experts. It is no accident that the German minister  of foreign affairs, K. Kinkel, a number of times talked about  the fact that the West has a clear concept only about the first  step, but not about the second and third one.    On the other hand, it was disadvantageous for Belgrade to  subject the NATO bloc to possible humiliation, compelling it to  proceed to an escalation of the conflict, to aggravate the  animosity of the West to the Serbian side, and thereby to let  slip out of its hands a realistic prospect for the abolition of  the sanctions. Figuratively speaking, Belgrade was not  interested in defeating the West above the Sarajevo hills and  was worried only about having its position understood in the  Western capitals. The Bosnian Serbs, who had no objection to  playing with fire, had a different sentiment.    It was at this moment that the Russian initiative appeared,  which became the life preserver for both NATO and the Serbian  side. NATO clearly feels that, having threatened the Serbs, it  can only smash its fist, but Belgrade and the capital of the  Bosnian Serbs, Pale, are ripening for the next compromise, which  does not promise them military advantages, but gives them  considerable political dividends. And the main thing--a good  reason for retreat presented itself.    Also remarkable is the fact that even Western propaganda on  the threshold of the hysteria of the NATO ultimatum held back.  The first program of French television provided information  about a sensational secret report of UN experts to the effect  that the mortar shell on the Sarajevo market (because of which  the Bosnian NATO ultimatum occurred) was launched from Muslim  positions. This report of French Television made the rounds of  the tapes of all leading news agencies and the pages of Western  newspapers. Although at the time, when earlier TANJUG [Yugoslav  News Agency] reported about such a secret meeting of UN experts,  no one demonstratively called any attention to this. In short,  the ground for an "honorable retreat" was being prepared on the  part of NATO.    What next? In the opinion of experts, the military situation  in Sarajevo has not changed in a major way since the guns that  have been withdrawn can be returned in a few hours to the  previous positions. It will be more difficult to take the arms  collected in eight areas in the city limits out of reserve  storage since they are being guarded by the "blue helmets."  However, here, too, the principle of a "double key" is observed,  and in the case of acute necessity both the Serbs and the  Muslims may again use them. But, it would appear, that neither  the one, nor the other side for the time being is seeking  conflicts with the UN contingents and is inclined to observe the  armistice. Now, apparently, a great deal will be decided by the  choice of priorities made by the great powers involved in the  Bosnian crisis.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Looking beyond the gloom - London Markets IT SOMETIMES seems as though the stock market has been waiting for economic recovery so long that it will not know what to do when it arrives. This week, however, came the first signs of adjustment to life after recession. Norman Lamont and the Bank of England both started to look past the question of what economic policy would end the recession soonest, to the policy that would best ensure stable medium term growth. The chancellor focused, in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry on Tuesday, on the need to halve British inflation to match Japan's 2 per cent rate. Entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism required a 'sea change in attitudes to inflation in Britain,' he said. Similar noises came from the Bank of England the same day, which was also marked by government figures reporting a 0.3 per cent increase in manufacturing output in the first quarter of the year, the first rise in 18 months. Like the chancellor, the Bank wants to see further progress on inflation. Its principal concern, however, is government spending, which, it says, threatens Britain's ability to meet the Maastricht terms for entry to European Monetary Union later in the decade. All this official sternness had no immediate impact on gilts, the market most sensitive to concerns about inflation and government borrowing. But on Wednesday, the authorities' message about a slow, non-inflationary recovery was reinforced by weak retail sales numbers. Gilts bounced upwards. Longer-dated government bonds - which would benefit most from a permanently lower level of inflation - did best, with yields dropping below 9 per cent. By Friday, long-term interest rates were a quarter of a point lower than a month ago, with much of the change traceable to the past week. As a result, the gap between interest rates on gilts and on German bunds has also narrowed: this Friday it was 1.18 percentage points, the slimmest it has been in recent months and much less than the 2.30 point gap in the depth of pre-election gloom. S G Warburg is predicting a further drop to between 0.75 and 1.00 per cent in a year's time. A pointer to the gilt market's strong performance could perhaps have been seen in Smith New Court's survey of institutional investors, carried out by Gallup on May 11-12 and issued on Monday. Fund managers' buying plans for gilts were the most positive since monthly surveys began two years ago. Investors were adjusting to life after recession in other ways, the survey suggested. The balance of fund managers planning to increase their holdings of UK equities dropped back in May, in line with levels earlier in the year but well below those seen in April's post-election euphoria. As the chart shows, movements in buying intentions appear to translate into movements in the FT-SE Index, with a lag of a month or so. If that pattern continues, the weakening of buying intentions may mean that the FT-SE's retreat from its post-election high has further to go. In spite of this, it managed to recover some of last week's losses, closing on Friday at 2,715.0, up 32.4 on the week. One possible sustaining influence, noticeable in the survey, is that underlying expectations for UK equities improved last month. Fund managers are now expecting the FT-SE Index to reach 3,024 a year hence, the first time the 12-month forecast has gone over 3,000. At a more mundane level, the food retailing sector was also starting to look ahead. The strong performance of the sector during the recession seemed no longer enough for investors. Argyll reported a 25 per cent rise in pre-tax profits on Wednesday, but its shares fell 10p on the day as shareholders worried about current trading. Another setback for the supermarket chains came on Thursday, as Morrison, the Yorkshire group, announced it would begin depreciating the value of its sites. Shares of all the leading groups suffered; Tesco did worst, losing 26p to finish at 267p. On Thursday, Sir Leon Brittan announced that the EC Commission saw no competition objections to the bid for Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. On Friday, Michael Heseltine announced that the Department of Trade and Industry was referring the Lloyds bid for Midland to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. There was nothing unexpected in either decision, but the market took them as good auguries for the Hongkong bid. Midland shares closed the week at 405p, up 11p, and Lloyds at 427p, down 2p. That was not the only news affecting bank shares this week. As Hongkong Bank came a step closer to one of the first big cross-border banking takeovers of the 1990s, Barclays was escaping the unhappy consequences of a similar, rather smaller, purchase of earlier decades. It announced the sale - for what seemed a trifling sum - of its 65-branch New York retail banking operations. Barclays closed the week at 392p, up 18p. Overseas misfortune dogged another bank. In Bombay this week, the stock exchange scandal there claimed Standard Chartered as a victim. The bank announced a provision of Pounds 50m for what might turn out to be forged bank promissory notes it is holding at its Bombay branch. The Pounds 50m provision was pretty much a guess, the bank said, but its losses were 'unlikely' to be more than Pounds 100m. Standard's long suffering shareholders took the news stoically and the shares closed on Friday at 504p, up 1p on the week. Shareholders clearly remembered that, even though the economy is getting back to normal, Standard Chartered has its own definition of business as usual.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Lloyd's in cash talks with Bank: Commercial lenders may be asked to provide backing for Names LLOYD'S of London, government ministers and the Bank of England are discussing measures to ease a liquidity crunch at the insurance market, according to a senior broker involved. The exploratory talks may result in a formal request to the Bank that it should encourage commercial banks to provide loans to hard-pressed Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Another possibility would be the setting up of a commercial banking syndicate to lend to the market's central fund which pays those claims that Names are unable to meet. The broker said the price of official help may be an end to the system of self-regulation, introduced by the Lloyd's Act of 1982. A government official said yesterday: 'The Bank of England has not yet received a formal request though it would not be surprising if one was made.' The news of the talks coincided with a meeting of between 20 and 25 MPs and peers with Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's. The MPs, who subjected him to some tough questioning, were concerned about last week's House of Commons allegations of malpractices in the market. The market's 300 or so syndicates - groups of Names - have been hit by heavy claims, including those resulting from a typhoon in Japan last September. Losses are also continuing from US pollution and industrial injury awards and a series of catastrophes between 1988 and 1990. Many commercial banks have withdrawn credit lines to the insurance market, making it more difficult for syndicates to meet liabilities. 'There is a serious sterling shortage on the market,' said one agent. According to the broker involved in the talks, Lloyd's needs a funding arrangement to meet some Pounds 2bn in losses expected to fall due over the next 18 months. The refusal of some Names to meet losses could aggravate these problems. Some 600 Names - mostly members of catastrophe reinsurance syndicates - are reported to be seeking a court injunction this week to prevent Lloyd's from drawing down on deposits that they hold with their agents. The banks may be asked by the Bank of England to provide funds to shore up the market in the same way as they are sometimes pressed to provide liquidity to save ailing companies. A Bank official, however, said there was no possibility of it providing funds from its own resources. Commenting on expectations that the market's loss for 1989 - not disclosed until later this year - will be Pounds 1.35bn, a Lloyd's agent, or syndicate manager, said: 'I just don't know where the funds to meet this loss are going to come from.' Lloyd's insists the solvency of the market - ultimately backed by Pounds 18bn of assets provided by the market's 22,500 Names - is intact. 'Solvency is not an issue, but we do have a shortage of liquid funds,' said an official at Lloyd's Corporation, the body which provides regulatory and back-up services to the market. Lloyd's is also seeking to restore confidence among Names, which has been bruised by recent losses. The number of Names at Lloyd's has fallen by nearly a third over the past four years. 'If you have a confident liquid market then you have yourself a business,' said the broker. Some of the MPs at yesterday's meeting said they favoured change in the regulatory regime. Lloyd's executives were left 'in no doubt whatsoever' that MPs believed that the market needed independent regulation, according to Mr Richard Page, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, complained about his fellow MPs' outbursts. 'I have been going on Parliamentary visits for 29 1/2 years and never heard the like in terms of rudeness to our hosts,' he said. Names seek injunctions in test case, Page 12 Letter, Page 21</p>

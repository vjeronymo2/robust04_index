			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Marine pollution inquiry ends THE Donaldson inquiry into marine pollution ended yesterday after nine weeks of taking evidence in London. The inquiry followed the Braer oil tanker disaster off Shetland this year. The report and recommendations of Lord Donaldson, former Master of the Rolls, are not expected to be published until early next year. He is likely to call for more action by the government to protect coastlines while urging stricter checks on how ships dispose of their waste. He is also likely to question the cost-effectiveness of aerial spraying of oil spills and may recommend that the government spend more on research into oil clean-up technology. Lord Donaldson is almost certain to recommend that Whitehall should consider contributing to a network of strategically located tugs to help ships facing emergencies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Army Commander in Chief Wimon Wongwanit  yesterday accused the Defence Ministry of failing to coordinate  government and military discussions about the food-for-arms  barter trade policy. "All the problems and confusion should be  referred to the permanent secretary for defence or the defence  minister," said Wimon. "I want to know how they interpret the  government's policy and whether they can explain it."    Wimon, who appeared testy while speaking to reporters at the  National Defense Institute, said the army has no knowledge about  barter trade. "We know nothing. We don't know what are  Thailand's agricultural products. We don't know the prices. We  don't know about marketing strategies. Our duty is to defend  the country, not to trade," the army chief said. "Soldiers have  to abide by orders. For example, if we need 155mm ammunition or  artillery shells for target practice, the Defence Ministry can  now no longer provide them because it has to follow Cabinet  instructions. "I have asked the Defence Ministry how the  government policy can be put into practice when we still need to  know so much more. First of all, we don't know whether the  barter trade should be implemented only in cases of major  purchases. The ministry cannot give an answer."    Wimon complained that many arms proposals of the army have  "bounced back" from the Defence Ministry. "It seems we can't  move now. We can move only when the Defence Ministry has clear  understanding [of the government's policy]. But what has  happened is everything we proposed has bounced back," he said.  "We need a system, otherwise in every arms deal we will have to  bring with us cattle or pigs."    Meanwhile, senior government officials yesterday appeared to  soften the food-for-arms policy, saying the military can still  make deals to purchase weaponry while the government will  negotiate with the supplier to buy Thai commodities.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said the military's  misunderstanding of the policy had led to the confrontation  between the armed forces and the Chuan administration. "It  doesn't mean that we take our domestic products and ask foreign  suppliers to accept them in exchange for arms," he explained.    The government's prime concern is to avoid a trade deficit.  Relations between the government and the military floundered  when the Cabinet insisted last week that the Air Force must  employ a barter system for its planned purchase of six transport  planes-- worth more than Bt4 billion -- from Italy.    Top brass, including Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon and  Supreme Commander ACM Woranat Aphichari held a special meeting  to discuss the issue and concluded that the idea is both old-hat  and impractical.    Prasong said if the armed forces wanted to buy any military  equipment they would just have to keep the government informed  so that the relevant agencies could try to arrange the sale of  Thai commodities to the country in question.    "We just want to ensure the country does not acquire a trade  deficit. It's not a matter of exchanging rice for arms and the  military understood it," he insisted. He said military leaders  will accept the government's barter policy "because the military  these days is very disciplined and ready to comply with the  government policies, better than in the past". [passage omitted]    The president of Alenia, the Italian firm marketing the  G-222  transport planes sought by the Air Force, met Commerce Minister  Uthai Pimchaichon yesterday to discuss the proposed purchase.    Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap,said the  government  will not scrap the planned purchase, but is negotiating for  Italy to buy Thai farm produce. He said the Defence Ministry  will ask Alenia to extend the validity of the quotation, which  expires this month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``Exclusive interview'' with Hans Blix, director of the </F> International Atomic Energy Agency, by unidentified  correspondent, at Teheran's' Mehrabad airport on 20 April --  recorded]    [Text]    Correspondent: Mr. Blix, were any major  achievements accomplished during your talks with the Iranian  officials?    Blix: Well, I came here to discuss first of all  the arrangements of verification under a nuclear weapon-free  zone in the Middle East. And of course Iran was one of the  first countries in the world to endorse this idea and I think we  have created more understanding for the techniques and the  system of verification that the agency offers now and the kind  of enhanced verification system that would be needed under a  zone. So I think we have accomplished what we hope to do, to  spread better knowledge.    Correspondent: A few countries, and Israel in  particular, have not yet signed the Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT]. Does not this refusal to sign the treaty threaten the  international and regional peace and stability?    Blix: Well, I think the ambition should be that  all countries which do not have nuclear weapons should join a  nonproliferation treaty, either the NPT or the Tlatelolco Treaty  for Latin America. We have seen a great deal of progress in the  past few years. Argentina and Brazil have joined, South Africa  has joined the Nonproliferation Treaty, Algeria has declared  that it will join.    Correspondent: And finally could you tell us about  the IAEA's efforts to make a nuclear-free world, sir?    Blix: Well, it would be a little presumptuous to  say that we are sort of instrumental in creating a nuclear  weapon-free world, but what I can say is that I think there is  reason for a great deal of optimism at the present time after  the end of the Cold War. We have seen how the United States and  Russia have now agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals from  some 65,000 warheads to 3,000 each. We can expect that there  will be a treaty which will prohibit the production of nuclear  material for weapons purposes and which very likely will lead to  all the nuclear weapon states and India, Pakistan and Israel  submitting all their nuclear installations to agency  verification. We can expect, perhaps within one year, a  complete test ban agreement so that new nuclear weapons cannot  be even tested underground. So there is, and added to that  then, the possibility of a nuclear weapon-free zone in the  Middle East. I think that we are taking giant steps towards a  world, not free from nuclear weapons, but at least much freer  from it than it is now. And for a world really free of nuclear  weapons I think we must also foresee a much stronger United  Nations and a much stronger security organization and that will  not come about in one year or perhaps even 10 years, but will  take a longer time. But there is ground for a lot of optimism  at the present time and of course for us in the IAEA, although  we are not the negotiating parties, the verification of all  these agreements will be a very important factor. And I think  we have acquired a lot of experience in the many years of this  and we stand ready to take on these jobs.    Correspondent: Thanks Dr. Blix for joining the  IRIB English news.</p>

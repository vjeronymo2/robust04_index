			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING;  </P> <P> ANGLERS LOAD UP AS ALBACORE, TUNA ACTION CONTINUES TO COME CLOSER  </P> <P> Anglers are loading their sacks as the terrific run of albacore and tuna is  within a one-and two-day reach of South Bay sportfishers.  </P> <P> The big outbreak of albacore started last month, prompting local sportfishers  to schedule three-to-five day trips.  </P> <P> Now the big bite is just 90 miles out and has surpassed last year's catch  counts.  </P> <P> The El Dorado from Long Beach Sportfishing found solid action south of San  Clemente Island. Capt. Cookie Cook said he made 30 jig stops on the two-day run  and anglers caught tuna up to 60-plus pounds.  </P> <P> Cook, 72, who has been on many tuna trips in the past 40 years, noted that he  hadn't seen the abundance of tuna like this for many years.  </P> <P> Every stop resulted in consistent hookups. The only puzzle he can't solve is  the albacore average of only eight pounds.  </P> <P> Yellow fin and blue fin tuna mixed with the albacore are heavyweights.  </P> <P> Leroy Januwc of San Pedro was a jackpot winner with his 65-pound yellow fin  tuna.  </P> <P> Ben Villaionoz of Redondo Beach decked a 53-pound yellow fin tuna. John  Meinich, also of Redondo Beach, decked a blue fin tuna weighing 44 pounds. The  total catch was 200 albacore, 106 blue fin tuna and 72 yellow fin tuna.  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach angler Ted Mancki, fishing in the second annual Oceans Shootout  in San Diego, took grand angler honors fishing aboard the Apollo with a  110-pound bigeye tuna.  </P> <P> Dean Drulias of Rancho Palos Verdes just returned from Cabo San Lucas with a  255-pound blue marlin.  </P> <P> Darrell Fleming of Wilmington, trolling aboard the Ghetto Queen for marlin at  Avalon, had a marlin jumper hit his mackerel. It escaped as a school of sharks  attacked the bait. Pulling his trolling line, Fleming brought aboard a 77  1/4-pound mako shark.  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Beach launch ramp has been closed until spring, 1990. Work is  starting on new floats and dredging of sand that has built up at the ramp.  </P> <P> An alternate ramp for South Bay small boat anglers is the Redondo Beach ramp  site.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Jeff Kaye of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Freedom on  a two-day tuna trip, caught the whopper of the week with his 100-pound bigeye  tuna.  </P> <P> Rico Curtis of Gardena, fishing aboard the Pacifica, won the jackpot with his  28 1/2-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Jorge Perez of West Los Angeles won the jackpot fishing aboard the City of  Redondo at Rocky Point with his 25-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: Local action continues for bass and bonito. Some big bonito going  up to eight pounds are being caught on half-day boats.  </P> <P> At Marina Del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire tried the Sunset Beach area and  found a good sculpin bite as anglers sacked 430, plus 28 bonito, six calico  bass and one halibut.  </P> <P> The Happyman on two half-day trips chalked up 75 sculpin, 46 bonito, three  barracuda and two halibut.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod special fished the Rock Piles and anglers garnered 250  rock cod, one lingcod and one cow cod.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: Anglers on the Sea Spray trip to Rocky Point caught  200 bonito, 112 calico bass, eight barracuda and one lingcod.  </P> <P> The City of Redondo on two half-day trips returned with 342 bonito, 105 bass  and seven rockfish.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special on two half-day trips to Rocky Point had a catch of 83  bonito, 73 bass, 43 rockfish and two sheepshead.  </P> <P> The Isle of Redondo barge continued a wide open mackerel attack with anglers  landing 2,120 plus 242 bonito and 45 assorted rockfish.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String headed to Catalina Island and had a  variety catch of 172 rockfish, 72 bonito, 63 calico bass and five sheepshead.  </P> <P> The Monte Carlo half-day run to the horseshoe kelp resulted in a catch of 64  bonito, 15 bass, six cabezon and four sheepshead.  </P> <P> At L.A.

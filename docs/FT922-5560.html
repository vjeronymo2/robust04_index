			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading STOCK index futures started with a hangover and ended with a brief rally in a quiet day's trading marked by the absence of continental interest because of holidays, writes Christopher Price. Although expected to start brightly, the June contract was marked back at the opening as the news on Olympia &amp; York depressed both equity and futures markets. From the 2,700 level, June eventually shrugged off the bad news and began to climb on limited buying interest. It reached 2,720 by 10.15am, which proved to be the high point of the day. From then, June spent most of the session in slow decline with few buyers - particularly with the absence of European traders - around to enliven proceedings. It hit its low point at 2,698 by 3.15pm, when a firmer Wall Street reinforced a brief rally. June closed at 2,705, two points down on the previous session, but at a premium to fair value of around five. Volume was a paltry 4,791 contracts. In traded options, British Steel was the top traded stock, recording 3,570 contracts. This was followed by BT with 2,364 lots, the August 360 calls being particularly busy, and British Gas at 1,790 contracts. Total volume was 26,544, compared with Wednesday's 37,651.</p>

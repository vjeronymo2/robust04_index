			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai hosted a banquet in  honor of visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, his  wife, and his delegation at Government House yesterday evening.  The Australian prime minister and his entourage are currently  on an official visit to Thailand as guests of the Thai  Government.    In a welcome speech delivered at the banquet, Prime Minister  Chuan said that the meeting between the Thai and Australian  delegations during the visit will provide a good opportunity for  both sides to develop their existing friendship, create better  understanding, and expand cooperation between the two countries  in the exploitation of their energy and potentials. The meeting  will also enable both sides to find ways to enhance their roles  in increasing the regional dynamic and collaboration. In  addition, the prime minister expressed his admiration for  Australia's constructive role in the Southeast Asian and  Asia-Pacific regions. Australian participation in the opening  of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge is an historic event that  reflects a great achievement resulting from international  cooperation. Australia is thereby considered to have a role in  the process of establishing peace and progress in Southeast Asia.</p>

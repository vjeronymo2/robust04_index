			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): TI Group - Other Companies TI Group: The specialist engineering company is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of up to Pounds 70m, against Pounds 62.8m, on Thursday. The increase is likely to be dominated by Bundy, the automotive and refrigeration tubing business, which has benefited from buoyant demand among motor manufacturers in North America and the UK. Improving sales to the chemicals sector is also expected to boost the performance of John Crane, the engineering seals manufacturer, which accounted for 46 per cent of group profits in the full year.</p>

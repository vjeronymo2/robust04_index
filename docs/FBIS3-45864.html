John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  made the remark in the Macedonian capital of Skoplje during an  inspection of the U.S. barracks.    Shalikashvili said he was very satisfied with the vital role  the United Nations peacekeeping forces have played in  maintaining stability in the region.    Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic not involved  in the civil war now raging in other regions.    In order to prevent the war from spreading to Macedonia, the  U.N. Security Council decided in December, 1992 to dispatch  peacekeeping forces to the country. There are 300 American  soldiers now serving as peacekeepers in Skoplje.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ushers for the market with Pounds 100m valuation Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer and pub chain, is planning to come to the market next month. The group, which is expected to have a market value of more than Pounds 100m, plans to raise enough money to clear its senior debt of Pounds 35m and have some over for further expansion. Ushers brewery in Trowbridge dates back to 1824, but the current company was formed only in 1991 following the Beer Orders, which obliged the industry to reduce the number of their tied houses. The brewery and an unrelated estate of 433 pubs in south-west England and south Wales were acquired through a Pounds 71m management buy-in from Courage. Mr Roger North, chief executive and former managing director of GrandMet brewing, said the group had paid off Pounds 15m of debt in its three years of existence, and had invested Pounds 13m in taking the number of pubs to 470, as well as modernising the brewery. The results are due at the end of this month. Last year operating profits were Pounds 13.4m on turnover of Pounds 48.8m. Mr North said that the debt was structured in such a way that the interest could not fall below 11 per cent. The brewery is making 300,000 barrels of beer a year, using 24 hour shift working to meet demand. Of this 200,000 barrels are under contract to Courage - a figure that will fall by two-thirds in 1996. The group is confident that it will be able to make up the shortfall with work for other brewers and for the multiple retailers. Sponsor will be NatWest Markets Corporate Finance, and broker NatWest Wood Mackenzie.</p>

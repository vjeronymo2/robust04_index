			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin and Aleksandr Koretskiy: </F> ```Kuntsevich Case' May Replace `Mirzayanov Case': United States  on Russia's Possession of Biological Weapons'']    [Text] Yesterday THE WASHINGTON POST newspaper,  quoting an anonymous source in the Clinton administration, said  that Russia continues to develop biological warfare  agents--despite Boris Yeltsin's assurances to the contrary and  the fact that the then-USSR signed the 1972 Convention on  Banning Biological Weapons. The United States, however, does not  accuse Yeltsin personally. The Clinton administration believes  that he is ``not in the loop.''    According to an anonymous source from Clinton's inner  circles, the White House allegedly has ``irrefutable proof that  Russia has a biological warfare program.'' Specifically,  according to the newspaper, the point is the existence in Russia  of some ``biological infrastructure of noncommercial purpose.''  According to the same anonymous source, information on the  existence in Russia of a program to develop and produce  biological weapons had been received from sources in the United  States in Great Britain, including from a Russian scientist who  immigrated to the United States last year. However, another  anonymous source from the American White House, whose opinion  THE WASHINGTON POST also quotes, believes that there is no proof  to support such a sensational accusation. In his opinion, what  may be meant here is the existence in Russia of ``specialized  equipment of nonmilitary purpose,'' which nevertheless ought to  be dismantled along with the military one.    So far there is no reaction from Russia. It is interesting,  however, that the scandalous newspaper item in the United States  coincided with the resignation of Anatoliy Kuntsevich, the  chairman of the Committee on Convention-Related Problems of  Chemical and Biological Weapons under the president of Russia.  Lately he had been Russia's ``chief chemist,'' and many  varieties of second-generation toxic agents had been developed  with his direct participation. His functions included the  development of a chemical weapons destruction program and  monitoring its implementation (Moscow had always denied that it  had biological weapons but nevertheless had a committee on its  ``convention'' on the grounds of ensuring compliance with the  1972 Convention). The reason for Kuntsevich's resignation, given  yesterday at a briefing by Vyacheslav Kostikov--``giving consent  to transportation and storage of a serious consignment of toxic  agents within the limits of a large city''--is questioned by  everyone who is even minimally familiar with the chemical  weapons problem. It is laughable to remove from the job a  person, who in the past had sanctioned transportation and  destruction of entire arsenals of toxic agents in densely  population areas of the Volga region, just for giving consent to  carry out only part of this program.    An interesting suggestion came from one of KOMMERSANT's  competent sources, according to whom there is a connection  between Russia being accused of continuing work on biological  weapons and Mr. Kuntsevich's resignation (the assumption is that  there has been a leak of certain information, which was the true  reason for resignation). This assumption is indirectly supported  by the fact that at the hearings in the former Supreme Soviet  and in the State Duma Kuntsevich persistently understated the  true size of Russia's combat toxic agents arsenal by a factor of  seven or eight at a minimum (according to estimates by  independent observers).    There is only one way, however, to counter Washington's  accusations: The Yeltsin-Clinton joint statement, issued in  Moscow in January, allows for the ``possibility of mutual visits  to facilities and holding meetings of experts in order to  monitor compliance with the Convention on Banning Biological and  Toxic Weapons.''</p>

While the construction operations remained in the black, operating losses in the joinery side widened to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 500,000); a rationalisation programme has involved the loss of some 70 jobs. There were also operating losses of Pounds 500,000 on the rundown of the industrial insulation business. Losses per share were 3.2p (earnings of 0.8p).</p>

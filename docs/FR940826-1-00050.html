			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Payments for outpatient maintenance dialysis are based on rates set prospectively by HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All approved ESRD facilities must accept the prospective payment rates established by HCFA as payment in full for covered outpatient maintenance dialysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HCFA publishes the methodology used to establish payment rates and changes in those rates in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as provided in &sect;413.196(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;413.174  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Redesignated as &sect;413.198]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Existing section 413.174 is redesignated as &sect;413.198.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A new &sect;413.174 is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;413.174  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Prospective rates for hospital-based and independent ESRD facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In accordance with section 1881(b)(7) of the Act, HCFA establishes prospective rates using a methodology that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Differentiates between hospital-based facilities and independent ESRD facilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Effectively encourages efficient delivery of dialysis services; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Provides incentives for increasing the use of home dialysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA considers any facility that does not meet all of the criteria of a hospital-based facility to be an independent facility. A determination under this paragraph is an initial determination under &sect;498.3 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For purposes of rate-setting and payment under this section, HCFA will determine that a facility is hospital-based if the_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Facility and hospital are subject to the bylaws and operating decisions of a common governing board. This governing board, which has final administrative responsibility, approves all personnel actions, appoints medical staff, and carries out similar management functions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Facility's director or administrator is under the supervision of the hospital's chief executive officer and reports through him or her to the governing board;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Facility personnel policies and practices conform to those of the hospital;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Administrative functions of the facility (for example, records, billing, laundry, housekeeping, and purchasing) are integrated with those of the hospital; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Facility and hospital are financially integrated, as evidenced by the cost report, which reflects allocation of overhead to the facility through the required step-down methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In determining whether a facility is hospital-based, HCFA does not consider_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An agreement between a facility and a hospital concerning patient referral;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A shared service arrangement between a facility and a hospital; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The physical location of a facility on the premises of a hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If all the physicians furnishing services to patients in an ESRD facility elect the initial method of payment (as described in &sect;414.313(c) of this subchapter), the prospective rate (as described in paragraph (a) of this section) paid to that facility is increased by an add-on amount as described in &sect;414.313.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Erythropoietin (EPO)/Epoietin (EPO).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When EPO is furnished to an ESRD patient by a Medicare approved ESRD facility or a supplier of home dialysis equipment and supplies, payment is based on the amount specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The payment is made only on an assignment basis, that is, directly to the facility or supplier, which must accept, as payment in full, the amount that HCFA determines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

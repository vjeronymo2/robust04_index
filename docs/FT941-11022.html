			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Buoyant consumer borrowing confirmed Two reports out today confirm the renewed buoyancy of consumer borrowing as the economy continues to recover, Emma Tucker writes. The Finance and Leasing Association reports that borrowing in December sustained November's sharp rise. The association - which represents companies providing consumer credit, business finance and leasing, and motor finance - says consumer credit was 36 per cent higher in December year-on-year, and 7 per cent up on November. Spending on store cards increased 24 per cent year-on-year while personal loans were up 40 per cent over the same period. Figures for the whole of last year showed an increase of 25 per cent in consumer credit. Infolink, the credit information group, says that while demand for consumer loans varied in the final quarter of last year the underlying trend was growth. Neither M0, the narrow measure of money supply, nor M4, the broad measure, are likely to share a common relationship with inflation, says an article in the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin tomorrow.</p>

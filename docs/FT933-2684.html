			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Arts: Young pretenders see it their way - Art Exhibitions As I left London's Tate Gallery after previewing the exhibition of Picasso's sculptures to be held there in the spring, a gleaming black carrier bag was pressed into my hand. My nostrils caught an aroma suggestive of first class hotels, gleaming lobbies, scented guests crowded in a lift. The carrier concealed another tiny bag, a black satin purse containing a sample of perfume and a miniature lipstick. A scarlet leaflet, boldly titled 'Works of Art' was not a list of the sculptures by Pablo Piccaso about which we had just been lectured by Dr John Golding, but a series of essays on the Art of Fragrance, the Art of Beauty and the Art of Colour, promoting the perfume and make up which Picasso's daughter Paloma has sold in her name. This very Nineties moment, the conjunction of great art and an utterly trivial commercial object, was one which many of the artists in 'Wonderful Life', my next destination, would have relished, the little bag an appropriate talisman for a journey from one way of seeing to another. It is fitting that the Lisson show, which has run all summer, continues into October, giving an opportunity to consider this selection of younger British artists working in a manner which could be described as 'conceptual' with the masters of painting who dominate the major galleries' autumn schedules. Surely the dedication of Lucian Freud or of Agnes Martin must put these young upstarts to shame? While there is no denying the power of a lifetime's labour, the moving evidence of the struggle to render form and meaning in paint, the Lisson show is also striking. For the younger generation clearly demonstrates, as well as a great inventiveness and variety of approach, a consciousness of a particular history, that of the international conceptual and minimal art movements of the 1960s and 1970s which this work both acknowledges and takes forward. Partly this is an effect of place: the Lisson has been the champion of such work for more than 20 years, an achievement summed up by 'Out of Sight, Out of Mind' held earlier this year to coincide with 'Gravity and Grace' the Hayward's own attempt to give a historical placing to the work of that era. However, the young artists wear their history lightly. Their works are not pastiches or tributes but emerge from a consciousness which has absorbed the lessons of predecessors such as Carl Andre, Daniel Buren or Michael Craig Martin among many others, and imbued them with a contemporary sensibility, a sensibility which accepts the complexities of the modern, technologised world as a matter of course, absorbing both its most inspiring and its crassest aspects as equally valid food for thought. The use of non-traditional media such as film, video or photography, so innovative 30 years ago, is second nature to them, while the sacred integrity of the image, so hard won by masters such as Picasso, also comes into question in an age of endless reproduction. These artists play comfortably with such concepts, their concern not so much the achievement of any kind of formal 'solution' but rather the creation of a shared awareness of just how deceiving, and how inspiring, this world can be. Much of the work makes use of particular technical devices to deepen its meaning. In his 'Instamatic Paintings', Magnus Hammick includes unfixed Polaroid prints which will eventually darken completely, the image destroying itself as the temporary notoriety of their references (Asil Nadir, Damien Hirst) also fades, leaving only the odd, rough cases in which they are presented to become relics of recent history. Siobhan Hapaska, in 'Heart', presents a wall-mounted minimal sculpture which is also a loudspeaker broadcasting the strange babble of satellite communication channels. But the technical devices employed can also be very simple. Don Brown, in '12 Unpainted figures/Paris 1989' frames singly tiny individual figures from one photograph of a crowd, their blurry outlines emphasised by the pristine white mounts suggesting not only their anonymity but also their fragility. For, although happy to exploit technology, these artists do not celebrate its wonders, rather reuse them to turn the attention back on individual experience. Some also demonstrate a rather touching concern with nature. Christopher Bucklow uses a pinhole camera to capture on photosensitive paper 'The Beauty of the World', the effect of the sun's rays at different times of day determining the colour of the print (a variation on a glorious pinkish mauve.) To make 'Pear-Hawthorn Tree' Bucklow worked with the late gardener Robert Garner, who grafted the hybrid of the title, a conjuncture decided on for artistic rather than practical effect, the wonder lying in the skill as well as in the finished product, displayed in an earthenware pot. The show also has a political dimension, in the work of Christine Borland, for example, but the politics are presented not as heavy statements of dogma or intent but rather as investigations of consequences. Borland has had a .22 Beretta semi automatic rifle fired at a sheet of glass, the resulting shattering beautiful in itself but demonstrating very clearly just what would happen to flesh in such an encounter. Her 'Blanket used on police firing range, Berlin: repaired' while clearly showing the bullet holes in the mundane brown fabric also shows how wounds can be mended, with care. This insistence on looking - that we should see not only what might be there, but what it might mean - is the most refreshing and challenging aspect of this show. It makes the work of those participants who demonstrate it (and not all are working with quite this subtlety or quality) well worth watching. 'Wonderful Life', Lisson Gallery, 52-54 Bell Street, London NW1, until October 16.</p>

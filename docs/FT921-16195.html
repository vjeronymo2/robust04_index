			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Kashmiris step up calls for plebiscite KASHMIRI political groups in Pakistan held rallies and marches yesterday, demanding a United Nations-mandated plebiscite in their disputed Himalayan state to decide its future, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Kashmiri sources said a complete strike was observed in Pakistani-ruled Azad (free) Kashmir to protest against the failure to implement UN resolutions calling for a plebiscite in the region, two-thirds of which is under Indian control. Protesters burned the Indian flag in the Pakistani town of Rawalpindi, near Islamabad. They accused India of committing atrocities in Kashmir while trying to crush a Moslem independence campaign. Kashmiri groups in Pakistan designated yesterday a 'self-determination day' to commemorate a 1949 resolution of a UN commission for India and Pakistan that called for a plebiscite in Kashmir. Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum, Azad Kashmir's prime minister, called on Kashmiris to be prepared to take up arms to 'take revenge for every drop of (Kashmiri) blood'. He accused India of failing to move towards a political settlement and told a rally in the state capital of Muzaffarabad: 'If India insists on a military solution to the Kashmir problem, we are ready for that as well.' Two of the three wars between India and Pakistan since independence from Britain in 1947 were fought over Kashmir. More than 5,000 people have died in the Moslem rebellion in Indian Kashmir since early 1990. Islamabad has denied Indian charges that it is training and arming Kashmiri militants.</p>

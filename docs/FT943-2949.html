			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: 'Tosca' without tears - Opera Puccini's opera is newly produced at the English National Opera by Keith Warner and the American designer John Conklin, not to mention the lighting-man Alan Burrett. 'For whom?' might be the question; and the answer might be, 'For post-modernists who prefer to have their withers left unwrung.' This is a very cool, knowing production, to the point where the end of each act is graced, guyed or sabotaged (take your pick) by a campy graffito. At the climax of the Act 1 'Te Deum', the Madonna statue comes to life as the Tosca of Scarpia's lustful fantasies; after she murders him in Act 2, the candles she places eerily about his corpse are taken from the footlights of the little theatre glimpsed earlier at stage rear (nudge, nudge); and far from leaping from the Castello's parapets to her death in Act 3, she freezes before a soldier's rifle - but behind her a balletic double is seen falling, falling, falling in slow motion. Each of these Producers' Ideas dampens any sympathetic, suspended-disbelief response pretty smartly. I imagine they were meant to - and by all three of the men responsible, since their respective contributions merge unidentifiably at the crucial moments. Elsewhere they go their own ways: Warner directs the action in robust, cartoon-realistic style, Conklin festoons it with a calculated jumble of icons from the Renaissance to De Chirico, and Burrett laces it with hallucinatory lighting, lurid and abrupt. The principal singers found their ways through this minefield with all due caution. As the luckless hero Cavaradossi, David Rendall did that with special disarmingness: though our indulgence had been begged for his allergy-ridden throat, the missing degree of volume could not have added much to his seasoned, lyrically heartfelt warmth and despair. Rosalind Plowright's heroine was more problematic. Her forceful soprano, with its characteristic rasping edge, is right for much of the monstre sacree role, and her nervy volatility too - and she delivered a creditable 'Vissi d'arte'; but Tosca also needs frank passion and a touch of self-mockery which do not lie within Miss Plowright's English-cool, even English-prissy range. Much the most striking of the leads was the Scarpia of Henk Smit, a Dutch import. It is essentially a comic creation, properly monstrous from time to time but undercut by the eager, dapper, schoolmasterly quick-march that regularly takes him from point A to point B. The whole performance is so sardonically knowing as to place it between permanent inverted commas; we relish his act, but are never seriously frightened. Smit's English is excellent to a fault, reminding us that our language - into which Warner and his wife Emma (or sister? the programme-book is coy about that point) have translated Illica's text crisply and colloquially - just does have bumpier, more intrusive consonants than Italian in all the longer words. Smit barks through the bumps, not minding them; Miss Plowright does her best to sail past them; Rendall manages somehow to assimilate them smoothly into his fervent lines. Too long unheard in London, Sir Alexander Gibson conducts the score to expert effect, with scrupulous, self-effacing deference to his singers. (Noel Davies takes over from October 18.) Among the secondary roles we have a decently haunted Angelotti - the fugitive who sparks the action  - from Andrew Greenan, a conventionally twittery Sacristan solidly characterised by Andrew Shore (as is his wont), a tuneless but intriguing Spoletta from Edward Byles, and Richard Angas's crusty, humane Gaoler. Does it work? I might guess better if I had any confident grasp of current audience-sensibilities. I think Tosca a nasty, cleverly calculated piece which offers melodious riches to good Italian singers; I do not know what to say about the general appeal of this version. Certainly the production is aimed to curdle any weepy indulgence - but may that not deprive Puccini of a central motive? Certainly too, it throws the time-honoured love-and-death motifs into historico-critical, self-conscious relief: excellent fodder for writing reviews like this one. If you want to see a self-reviewing opera production, this provides an excellent opportunity. A co-production with Houston Grand Opera, supported by Friends of ENO; in repertory until October 27</p>

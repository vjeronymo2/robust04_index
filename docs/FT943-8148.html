			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Smaller stocks gain, blue chips slow down Wall Street Small-capitalisation stocks outperformed blue chips yesterday as investors continued to react to Tuesday's bold move to higher interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 8.09 easier at 3,776.48, investors having booked profits following Tuesday's 24-point advance. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up a scant 0.16 at 465.17. Advancing New York SE issues outscored declines by 1,187 to 944 in brisk activity, volume on the Big Board reaching 309m shares by the close. In the secondary markets, the Nasdaq composite built on its relatively small gain of the previous day, climbing 7.15 to 742.66. The American SE composite ended 1.28 higher at 444.94. For most investors it was a day to pause and reflect on the implications of the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy a day earlier. On Tuesday, the announcement of a move to lift two short-term interest rates resulted in solid gains for stocks across the board, but not before the market wrestled with worries over the impact of the policy change on corporate profits. In the end, however, investors were able to shrug off their concerns and focus on a welcome surge in long-term bond prices. The positive mood in equities carried over into yesterday's trading, even though the rally in bonds had stalled. In both markets, investors were busy cashing in on the previous session's gains, holding most of the leading stock indices in check throughout the day. The Nasdaq was the exception as technology and heatlth care stocks maintained their forward momentum. There was no economic news on offer to influence sentiment, although it was unlikely that any fresh data would have had much of an impact in the wake of Tuesday's events. In the vacuum, most stocks meandered. Among the big cyclical issues, however, Deere advanced Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 67 7/8 thanks to favourable comments by Mr Mitchell Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder. Caterpillar was Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 109 3/4 , but International Paper dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71 7/8 and 3M slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54 1/4 . Amid the general drift, American Home Products and American Cyanamid made some waves with the announcement of a Dollars 9.7bn merger agreement. After a delayed opening, Cyanamid jumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 96 1/8 on news that stockholders would receive Dollars 101 a share in cash as part of the deal. AHP's stock added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4 . Retailing issues cooled off after Tuesday's heated session which was highlighted by the release of a batch of quarterly results. However, Toys R Us, which had climbed Dollars 2 on Tuesday, put on an extra Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 37. Gap Stores retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/2 . Kmart was marked up Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 1/8 in heavy volume of 4.2m shares. After Tuesday's close the discount store operator announced plans to spin off three of its specialty divisions. Canada Toronto stocks closed mixed with a negative bias after Tuesday's rate-driven rally failed to produce any expected follow-through, in spite of a further rise in Canadian bonds. The TSE 300 index edged 2.48 points higher to 4,205.27 but falls led rises by 391 to 314 after volume of 52.8m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-sectors showed improvement. Strength in transportation and conglomerates was countered by weakness in gold, forest products and oil and gas issues. Mexico Equities ended with only a slight gain after profit-taking erased most of an early rally in response to sharply lower domestic interest rates, which fell to their lowest level in almost five months. The 37-share IPC index finished 5.05 points up at 2,699.65 after touching 2,732.45. Turnover was a heavy 2.77bn new pesos on 194.3m shares traded. A trader said: 'Prices went up like crazy when interest rates fell and that triggered profit-taking because the investors active in the bolsa now are just speculating, the others are waiting for Sunday's (presidential) election to be over.' The interest rate on the bellwether 28-day Treasury bill fell 175 basis points to 13.4 per cent at this week's auction. Analysts noted that forecasts had been for a reduction of about 100 basis points.</p>

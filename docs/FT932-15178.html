			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Iran devalues 6.7% against the dollar IRAN'S central bank devalued the rial 6.7 per cent against the dollar yesterday, and stepped up the sale of foreign exchange in a bid to take control of a volatile currency market, Reuter reports from Tehran. In its second devaluation in three weeks, the bank set the rial at 1,648/50 to the dollar against Tuesday's 1,538/41. Several dozen state bank branches in Tehran began selling up to Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,300) to any buyers after Tuesday's announcement that the rial would be fully convertible. The central bank acted after the rial sank to a new low of 1,830 to the dollar on Sunday, raising fears of a free-fall after an official devaluation of up to 95.6 per cent on March 27. The first devaluation jolted prices. Newspapers report a 30 per cent jump in prices of household goods since early March - about equal to the rise in wholesale prices in the 11 months to February 19 over the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, Irna, the official news agency said a British trade mission to Tehran planned for next month was likely to be postponed because of London's public support for novelist Salman Rushdie, ordered killed by Iran for alleged blasphemy.</p>

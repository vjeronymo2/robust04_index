			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by </F> correspondent Paolo Borrella; place and date not given; Walesa  speaks in Polish with superimposed Italian translation--recorded]    [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa was present at the  Monte Cassino celebrations. Walesa remembered the sacrifice of  thousands of his fellow countrymen who took part in that battle  along with Allied forces in this way.    [Walesa] The Polish people fought on every front during  World  War II. They fought, above all, for the liberation of Europe.  They fought for the people of Poland only in the second  instant. As early as 1939, we knew that not only Poland but  also the destiny of Europe was at stake, but they did not listen  to us. In this way, we had to fight to put right the errors  made by others.    [Borrelli] But do you not run the risk of creating a Europe  based solely on business interests rather than a Europe based on  those values that everyone wanted during the struggle against  Nazism?    [Walesa] Obviously this risk exists, but the principles will  always win in the end. Some questions are of common interest.  I am thinking of the question of nuclear power stations. The  safeguarding of the environment must be the responsibility of  everyone. Europe cannot allow situations like that in the  former Yugoslavia to arise. When I hear people say that in  order to allow Russia to join the security organization named  "Partnership for Peace" different rules to those of other  countries will be applied, I cannot see how this will work.    [Borrelli] In Russia, your powerful neighbor, Boris  Yeltsin's  power is threatened by Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy. Does this  worry you?    [Walesa] We do not constitute a desired object for Russia.  If  anything, you run this risk. The only solution is for Europe to  extend in order to include the countries of the former communist  bloc. In this way, common security and wealth are increased and  uncertainties are reduced.</p>

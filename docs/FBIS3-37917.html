			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin article under "Our Commentary" rubric: </F> "Local Authorities Trying on Red Pants"]    [Text] Russians will have to vote again in March and April  -- this time for deputies to the local self-government bodies.    None of the past election campaigns has had such a tenuous  legal basis as the present one. There is no federation-wide law  on the elections -- the State Duma is only just setting about  producing one. On the other hand the president's Edict No. 1765  gave administration heads themselves the right to ratify local  election statutes. You do not have to be a clairvoyant to  predict that they will give free rein to their whims.    This is just what they are doing.    The administration in Voronezh has reserved the right to  hold  meetings of voters -- or not, as they please -- to nominate  candidates for deputies, and to admit observers or not. The  Tula administration head may himself appoint a section of the  deputies to the representative body. The mayor of St.  Petersburg has refused students and servicemen the right to vote  while at the same time forbidding Federation Council members to  stand as deputies. The Leningrad Oblast administration head will  himself appoint municipal leaders (who should, of course, be  elected by the people).    So the executive branch offensive against representative  branch prerogatives is continuing. But there is nothing to be  surprised about here -- this is what step-by-step constitutional  reform amounts to. It is more to the point to ask the question:  What will become of the country if this impromptu approach  extends to the whole of great Russia?    As far as the range of views represented on the eve of the  elections is concerned, it does differ, though not sharply, from  that of December. All seven communist parties are vigorously  nominating their own candidates this time (only Zyuganov's  Communist Party participated in the federal elections), as are  the parties with a popular-patriotic orientation. The regional  organizations of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]  are hedging their bets. Zhirinovskiy has stated that these  elections have not the slightest significance for him -- all his  thoughts are on the presidential election. But in the provinces  the LDPR branches are not inactive and are counting on winning a  majority of the votes cast -- which, to tell the truth, is  hardly likely if you take into consideration the stiff  competition put up by the left-wing and patriotic movements.  The democratic forces, on the other hand, finally seem  reconciled to the prospect of losing. Presidential Territorial  Administration Chief Nikolay Medvedev even stated that a Red  anti-presidential cordon could form around Moscow, taking in  Lipetsk, Kursk, Orel, Voronezh, Ryazan, Mordovia, and Penza.  Almost as in 1918: Then, if you remember, the government,  ringed by the Whites, was forced to transfer from St. Petersburg  to the Kremlin in Moscow.    You can only say one thing definitely: Whatever the results  of the elections they will hardly provide a solid basis on which  to extricate ourselves from the crisis. The converse is more  likely: Yet one more leg of the presidential chair will fold  under him. But a poor result is nevertheless a result. The time  is coming when to dramatize the outcome of the voting, to ring  all the bells and cry "Russia, you've gone crazy" would be  tantamount to summoning the spirits of revolution. Enough of  that! It would be nice to enter the 21st century in a well-cut  rule of law suit. Let presidential power be the pants and  parliamentary power the jacket. Or the other way around, so  long as there are no pistol muzzles jutting from the pockets.  The pockets should contain only handkerchiefs, and these should  be sweetly scented.</p>

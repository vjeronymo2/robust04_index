			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Japanese Bonds: Profit-taking may check strong rally JAPANESE government bonds have rallied strongly recently, reaching levels last seen in early 1989 as the plunge in the Tokyo stock market has raised hopes of a monetary easing. The slide in the leading Nikkei 225 average below the psychologically important 15,000 level last week - over 60 per cent off its peak - has prompted speculation of a further cut in the official discount rate. At the end of last week, rumours circulated that the Bank of Japan might cut the reserve requirements for commercial banks, adding to speculation about lower interest rates. The yield on the No 129 benchmark bond closed last week at a record low of 4.82 per cent, down from 4.905 per cent. The yield was the lowest for a benchmark issue since January 1989. Sagging consumer confidence has also raised hopes of action by the monetary authorities. Until recently, government officials had been confident that firm consumer spending would lead the Japanese economy out of recession. However, the bearishness over the economy has filtered through to ordinary Japanese, prompting them to tighten their belts. Department store sales were down 3.7 per cent year-on-year in June, marking the fourth consecutive decline, while chain-store sales fell 1.1 per cent from the previous year, representing the first decline in five years. Concern is also mounting over the health of Japanese banks, which are burdened with bad loans linked to stocks and property. Bankers believe a further lowering in the official discount rate is essential to boost profits, offsetting a sharp increase in write-offs and loan-loss reserves. Institutional investors have been active buyers in the bond markets, and turnover in July rose to Y57,242.3bn, excluding brokers' trading on their own accounts - the highest level in five years. Total turnover rose to Y117,000bn, exceeding Y100,000bn for the first time since March 1991. As demand for loans has decreased due to the slowing economy, insurance companies and long-term credit banks have shifted into long-term funds. The Japan Securities Dealers Association said net buying by life and non-life assurers doubled from the previous month to a record Y920bn, while long-term credit banks bought a record Y500bn, up 7.5 times from the previous month. However, in spite of the excitement, analysts believe the rally in government bonds may end soon. The yield on the 10-year benchmark has fallen over 380 basis points from the 8.7 per cent level two years ago. Mr Russell Jones, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Tokyo, says that although investors may find little incentive to sell while the stock market weakness lasts profit-taking may begin. One factor which may hinder an easing of credit by the Bank of Japan, is the rising trade surplus. Lower interest rates would lead to a weakening of the yen against the dollar, and could contribute to Japan's already mounting trade surplus. With Japan's trade surplus in July rising 40 per cent from the previous year to a record Dollars 9.2bn, the central bank will need to find a balance between a weaker currency and the weakening economy.</p>

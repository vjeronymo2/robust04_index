			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Freezing technology creates novel lollies As summer approaches, food manufacturers may be interested in a novel freezing technology which could produce intricately-shaped iced lollies. Today most lollies are frozen in the mould, which is then heated quickly to release the product. This method results in the lolly losing shape and definition. The latest freezing technology, developed in Basingstoke by Air Products, relies on the principle of zero adhesion, where the surface is so cold that nothing will stick to it. By chilling lolly moulds to at least -80`C using liquid nitrogen, intricately-shaped and coloured lollies can be produced. The company has already developed lollies in the shape of a fried egg and a light bulb. Air Products: UK, 0932 249273.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENTSEN SETS HEARINGS ON SOCIAL SECURITY TAX;  </P> <P> BUDGET: REPUBLICANS CHARGE THAT THE DEMOCRATS' PROPOSED $55-BILLION REDUCTION  COULD SET OFF A 'TAX-CUT BIDDING WAR' BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  </P> <P> Reserving judgment on a Democratic proposal to cut Social Security payroll  taxes by $55 billion a year, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen  (D-Tex.) on Tuesday scheduled hearings on the politically tantalizing  legislation in early February.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said there was growing  support for the measure despite strong condemnation from President Bush and a  new attack launched by House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.).  </P> <P> One GOP opponent -- Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) -- said the legislation could touch  off a "tax-cut bidding war" between Democrats and Republicans that would add to  the federal budget deficit and require future tax increases to offset the  reductions.  </P> <P> The sponsor of the tax cut, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), formally  introduced the bill Tuesday as one of his colleagues, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings  (D-S.C.), predicted it would receive speedy approval if it comes to a vote.  </P> <P> Moynihan has proposed cutting Social Security payroll taxes by as much as $600  per person to provide tax relief to the nation's wage earners and to prevent  the government from using the Social Security surplus to reduce the size of the  federal deficit.  </P> <P> Bentsen praised Moynihan for dramatizing the rising burden of Social Security  payroll deductions on low-income and middle-income Americans, but said he  wanted to find out if the legislation would lead to future cuts in retirement  benefits.  </P> <P> Bentsen said the Moynihan plan would do much "to strip the fig leaf from the  budget chicanery" that allows the growing surplus in the Social Security trust  fund to make the federal deficit appear smaller.  </P> <P> But the conservative Texan said Congress should "not necessarily" adopt the  proposal before it receives answers to the many questions raised about the  impact of the tax cuts on the payment of benefits in the next century.  </P> <P> "Basically, Sen. Moynihan has proposed a kind of fiscal surgery here," Bentsen  said. "Like any surgery, that can be dangerous. . . . I don't know whether Sen.  Moynihan's proposal can keep Social Security and the budget healthy, but I  propose to find out."  </P> <P> The Finance Committee scheduled hearings for Feb. 5 and Feb. 8 on Moynihan's  legislation, which has put the Bush Administration on the defensive as the  second session of the 101st Congress begins.  </P> <P> Democrats intend to contrast Moynihan's plan for lowering payroll taxes on all  wage earners with the President's proposal to reduce the income tax on capital  gains, which would channel most benefits to upper-income Americans.  </P> <P> Leading Republicans, however, pictured the New Yorker's proposal as "tinkering"  with 1983 changes in Social Security financing that were designed to assure  payment of benefits to the Baby Boom generation when its members retire after  the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Michel, in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski  (D-Ill.), whose panel has jurisdiction over the retirement program, said  Moynihan's proposed tax cut was a "dangerous adjustment which could inspire  even more drastic threats to the system and ultimately bring it down."  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told reporters that Moynihan's proposal  underscored the fact that the Social Security surplus is being used to mask the  size of the budget deficit.  </P> <P> "I think it's very important for us to find a means either to see that these  funds are appropriately invested and saved for the future retirement of the  Social Security contributors, or in the alternative, to adjust the tax to what  is necessary to provide for the current requirements," Foley said.  </P> <P> Under Moynihan's bill, the basic Social Security tax rate would be rolled back  from 6.2% to 6.06%, effective last Jan. 1, on all wages up to $51,300 a year. A  second reduction to 5.1% would take effect next Jan. 1 on all wages up to an  adjusted ceiling estimated at $54,300.  </P> <P> Individual savings under the proposal would depend on the amount of income,  with a maximum $600 reduction next year.  </P></p>

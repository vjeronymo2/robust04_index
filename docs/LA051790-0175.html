			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: THE REGION;  </P> <P> TREATMENT PLANT INSTALLED  </P> <P> Workers on Tuesday began installing a $800,000 treatment plant to save a  polluted Baldwin Park well.  </P> <P> The well, on Maine Avenue near Irwindale, was polluted last year by  carcinogenic compounds commonly used in industries and businesses.  </P> <P> Water officials say the pollution stemmed from one of the four large plumes of  contamination that plague large portions of the underground water supply of the  San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> The need for the treatment plant is heightened because of the drought, said  Stanley D. Yarbrough, general manager the Valley County Water District, which  is building the facility. "Without this project, the district's existing well  supply is not going to be enough to meet the high demands during the hot summer  months," he said.  </P> <P> The district serves 40,000 residential and business customers in Baldwin Park,  Irwindale and West Covina. Of the district's 10 wells, seven have been shut  down because of pollution. To finance the project, the water district in  February imposed a 25% rate increase, most of which will go toward the costs of  the treatment plant.  </P></p>

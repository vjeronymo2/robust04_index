			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Brazil's third way BRAZIL HAD a horrible 1992. It lost a president on corruption charges and perhaps its position as the world's ninth largest economy to China. It suffered zero growth, annual inflation of 1,200 per cent, three-digit real interest rates and a budget deficit equal to two-fifths of economic output. President Itamar Franco, who took over three months ago from the deposed Fernando Collor, wants to make job creation a priority and to attack poverty through a sharp increase in the minimum wage. Officials talk of boosting government spending on infrastructure, health and education. There is no doubting the importance of rebuilding infrastructure, improving public services and alleviating poverty in Brazil. The problem is that a government without financial resources cannot begin to address these issues. This is why, although he may not realise it, fiscal reform should be Mr Franco's priority. Only through such reform will the budget deficit be closed, inflation subdued, interest rates lowered and confidence restored. Without it, Mr Franco's plans to better the lot of the poor and restart growth will be lost in an inflationary fog. Brazil's Congress has a chance at a special session next week to introduce long-overdue fiscal reform. This will not produce a long-term solution, which must await fundamental constitutional changes later this year. If Mr Franco spends the money rather than closing the deficit, it will not even offer short-term relief. Fiscal reform is by no means the answer to all Brazil's problems, but the example of the rest of Latin America should be enough to convince Brazil's politicians that it is a necessary start. Despite this, there still seems a view in the Brazilian elite that Brazil need not heed the lessons of its neighbours, which have pursued freer, more open markets and balanced budgets, and should seek a 'third way' to solve its economic woes. But even a third way would require the country to generate growth through efficient investment. That would require a taming of inflation, and a curbing of the budget deficit. In other words, there is no escape from the central, tough decision. Tough decisions are hard in Brazil's diffuse political system. The 1988 constitution, fashioned as a reaction to 21 years of military rule, so surrounds the government with checks and balances that only in unusual circumstances can it rule effectively. Mr Franco had such a rare opportunity when he took office, enjoying huge support in Congress and in the population. It is to be hoped that he has not already missed it. It is often said that the reason that Brazil has never tackled its economic malaise is because, unlike in neighbouring countries, its problems have never got bad enough. There is an unpleasant risk that 1993 will be the year in which this state of affairs changes.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIVE STORIES OF COMPTON LACKING  </P> <P> The city of Compton receives high priority from the press on negative and  superficial issues. However, it's very disturbing as a subscriber to the L.A.  Times that you fail to print meaningful activities that are taking place in the  community and certainly are of interest to its citizenry.  </P> <P> The city has been vigorously working toward its renaissance, but there is  clearly a lack of information reflecting these positive steps in your paper.  Scrutiny is welcome, but fairness should not have to be insisted. For example,  in July, 1990, the city had its grand opening for the Compton Transit Center in  conjunction with the Metro Light Rail, and coverage for the multimillion-dollar  inter-modal project was absent while thunder was present for the light rail  coverage. On Nov. 19, K mart opened its doors in the Compton Renaissance Plaza  and has broken sales records since its opening. Once again, no press coverage.  </P> <P> It is baffling that coverage is available for other communities for those types  of success stories but appears unavailable for Compton. Is that responsible  journalism or does the L.A. Times subscribe to facilitating the repressive  state of thought by others by under-representing the activities and  achievements of this growing community? Your subscribers are entitled to that  information.  </P> <P> HOWARD CALDWELL  </P> <P> Compton  </P> <P>  Caldwell is city manager of Compton.  </P></p>

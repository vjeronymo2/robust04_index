			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEPALESE LINE UP TO BUY FUEL  </P> <P> Fearing that the Persian Gulf crisis will create new oil shortages in their  Himalayan kingdom, Nepalese formed long lines today to buy fuel for their cars  and homes.  </P> <P> With memories of the cutoff in oil supplies by neighboring India fresh in their  minds, people started lining up for kerosene, the only source of cooking and  heating fuel, as soon as dawn broke over the mountaintops.  </P> <P> Reports of rationing in India reached the Nepalese capital, and motorists today  backed up in long lines at Nepal Oil Corp. facilities, the sole distributors of  petroleum products in the Himalayan nation.  </P> <P> Housewives and children carrying plastic cans waited in the long lines even  though an official of the state-owned NOC said the stock of kerosene is  adequate to meet the country's needs for a long time.  </P> <P> NOC buys crude oil from the gulf countries for hard currency but its  counterpart in India, the Indian Oil Co., handles the delivery.  </P></p>

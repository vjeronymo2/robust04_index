			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Bank accounting rules to be eased The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday moved to make some of the banking accounting requirements of the Companies Act 1985 more flexible. The move, part of the government's de-regulation drive, will remove the definition of 'banking activities' and 'banking transactions' in one of the schedules to the act. The definitions were originally inserted at the request of the banks in an attempt to clarify the European bank accounts directive. The banks have since concluded that the definitions are unduly restrictive.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO CONFERENCING IS FINALLY MAKING CONTACT WITH BUSINESS WORLD  </P> <P> After decades of false starts and unfulfilled promises, video conferencing is  beginning to make a dent in the American workplace.  </P> <P> Growing numbers of companies and government agencies are setting up video rooms  that allow people separated by a few blocks or thousands of miles to hold  "meetings" via private TV, with their images and voices relayed by satellites  or ground transmission systems.  </P> <P> The number of video rooms has about tripled in 3 years to about 700 nationwide,  American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. estimates. And U.S. shipments of a key  piece of video conferencing hardware -- a means of measuring the industry's  success -- climbed to about 955 last year, contrasted with 490 the year before,  according to Dataquest Inc.  </P> <P> "It is emerging as a critically valuable tool for corporations," says Jack  Caldwell, director of internal communications for Ford Motor Co., which  recently installed one of the country's largest in-house conferencing networks  and has made a point of keeping its size and capabilities secret. Ford, like  other companies questioned, declined to talk about the costs of the system.  </P> <P> Applications extend well beyond bread-and-butter business meetings. Parole  boards have used them to interview prisoners, employers for look-sees at  potential hires. Judges have conducted arraignments remotely, engineers have  monitored test gauges on experiments conducted at other locations. At least one  international corporate takeover has been negotiated in large part by video  conferencing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fall in Prices  </P> <P> A dramatic fall in prices is perhaps the prime reason for the technology's  increased popularity.  </P> <P> Video conferencing today costs about 20% of what it did in 1981, according to  Elliot M. Gold, publisher of TeleSpan, an Alta Dena, Calif., newsletter.  Transmission costs have come down from about $2,000 an hour then for a  high-quality picture to about $375 today, he said.  </P> <P> A lower-quality picture, harnessing technology that was simply not available at  the start of the decade, can be had for about $110 an hour. Similar decreases  have occurred in equipment costs.  </P> <P> For today, video conferencing remains very much the exception, and how far it  will go remains highly speculative. But in certain sectors of the economy --  big aerospace companies, for instance -- virtually everyone already is using it  to some degree. Most feel they gain a competitive edge through it.  </P> <P> Aircraft producer Boeing Co. was a pioneer in the field, building a short-range  system almost a decade ago to link various Puget Sound facilities that were  developing the 757 jetliner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9,000 Meetings  </P> <P> "We . . . had to manage an engineering force that was spread out over a  geographical area of about 40 miles," recalled W. R. Savery, a senior engineer  at Boeing who helped put the system together. "It became obvious to us that we  had to do something better than running up and down the highway."  </P> <P> More than 9,000 meetings have been held on the resulting network. More  recently, the company has installed eight more rooms around the country linked  by satellite. Some meetings conducted there are over long distance, others are  short-haul. Every Wednesday morning, for instance, people at Savery's facility  in Renton, Wash., confer by satellite with flight test crews in Seattle, just 8  miles away.  </P> <P> Martin Marietta Corp. of Bethesda, Md., today has 10 conferencing rooms; Contel  ASC, a Rockville, Md.-based satellite services company, is operating a network  that links facilities of Boeing and two other aerospace companies that are  jointly developing a new generation of jet fighter.  </P> <P> Government agencies are also getting more interested. Under a 1986 contract  with the Defense Communications Agency, AT&amp;T is operating about 70 rooms at  various military installations. The technology will come soon to many civilian  agencies through FTS-2000, a mammoth long-distance network that AT&amp;T and US  Sprint Communications Co. will build and operate for the federal government.  </P> <P> The basic technical challenge facing the industry is to "compress" the data  contained in a video image to lessen the cost of transporting it, in the same  way that it is cheaper to mail a half-ounce letter than a 10-pound package.  Technicians have squeezed the signal down to less than 1% the amount of data  contained in an ordinary TV image.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Quality  </P> <P> But the greater the compression, the lower the quality. The picture gets fuzzy,  motion -- a wave of the hand, for instance -- leaves ghostly trails across the  screen, and voice quality is like that of a telephone line. Still, each year  quality gets better and prices get cheaper.  </P> <P> The goal is to refine the technology and lower costs to the point that someday,  each desk at a workplace could have a video unit, allowing people to dial up  others on demand. The precedent for such wide use is there with the personal  computer, but this goal is by no means just around the corner. "I don't see it  becoming a general business product in the next five years," said David Keeler,  a Dataquest analyst.  </P> <P> Ordinary consumers will have to wait even longer. "This technology is a long  way off from being in everybody's homes," said Steve Reynolds, an analyst at  the New York City research firm Link Resources Inc.  </P> <P> The closest thing available so far is the "picturephone," introduced by Japan's  Mitsubishi Group last year. It can send a still image over an ordinary  telephone line. Speech is not possible during the approximately 10 seconds that  the picture transmission takes.  </P> <P> The economic fact driving the industry is that the costs of business travel are  high and climbing -- air tickets, meals, hotel rooms, not to mention the wasted  time of executives while they're en route. In foreign travel, there is the  danger of terrorism and kidnapping. So if people can be put together  electronically for less money, why not do it?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quick Decisions  </P> <P> In addition, decisions can be made more quickly. There is no travel time  involved, and people taking part tend to come to the point more quickly.  </P> <P> Video conferencing provides a level of communication not possible over the  telephone, adding facial expressions, hand signs and other body English to the  participants' words. In addition, people can share graphic material -- a sketch  for a new advertisement, for instance, or a table of the last quarter's sales.  </P> <P> But there is resistance. Lack of technical standards means many rooms cannot  link up with others. People may find themselves "stepping on each other," as  they talk out of turn because each image takes a fraction of a second to reach  its destination.  </P> <P> There are human factors working against it, too: Many people feel uncomfortable  with the cameras (even though in most rooms they are hidden).  </P> <P> And, however much better the technology gets, some people feel it still does  not match the quality of communication of a face-to-face encounter.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Venkatachala G. Hegde: "Far-Reaching </F> Implications"]    [Text] Extending intellectual property protection to  agriculture and the possibility of introduction of patenting of  seeds will have a far-reaching impact on the development of  Indian agricultural sector and more particularly research  concerning biotechnology.    Further, in an indirect way, it will also greatly affect the  preservation of biodiversity in the context of developing  countries. The issues concerning the patentability of an  invention is embodied in the "Agreement on Trade-related Aspects  of Intellectual Property Rights, including Trade in Counterfeit  Goods," as Annexure III of GATT agreement.    Article 27 (1) of this agreement specifies "..tents shall be  available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in  all fields of technology." This rule is, however, subject to  three very important requirements, such as (a) it should be new;  (b) it should involve an inventive step, that is, it should not  occur in the normal course of its evolution; and (c) it should  be capable of industrial application.    The agreement does not define these requirements in any way.  Accordingly, the assessments as to what factors should  constitute these requirements are to be decided by the domestic  legislation.    A new technological advancement in the arena of automobiles,  for example, should fulfill these requirements so as to become  patentable.    Newness or novelty, as it is called, is taken into account  in  the context of inventions made anywhere in the world. The  efficacious search for novelty depends on the efficiency of a  patent system in locating the latest additions of that  technology.    There is, however, no defined rule as to how a search should  be conducted. In other words, the factors which influence an  "effective search for novelty" are very highly subjective and  contextual.    Patent offices and the patent examiners play a crucial role  in this regard.    The Indian Patent Act, 1970, for example, provides for these  criteria of patentability in a substantive manner while  enunciating "opposition proceedings to a patent specification."    Patent specification, it is said, describes the patentable  invention in a best possible manner in such a way that a skilled  worker in that particular area of technology should be able to  understand it and work it.    This gives rise to the following questions: What could be  considered as the best possible manner of description of an  invention in a patent specification? And how exactly should one  define the scope of these patentability criteria in the context  of a developing country where technological advancement might  have remained at an infant state? Moreover the subjectivity  inherent in the procedural aspects and its application will  surely create gaps in the legislative standards of developing  countries on the one hand, and developed countries on the other.    The contents of Article 27(2) outline the contexts which  provide for exclusion of patentability of inventions. These  contexts relate "to protect public order or morality, including  to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid  serious prejudice to the environment.    "The evaluation of these contexts call for an extensive  subjective assessment of these legal norms within a country.    How to define situations which could cause serious prejudice  to the environment? It is impossible to incorporate such  probable situations in any domestic normative set up.    Which authority will conclusively decide the necessity for  exclusion of certain sectors from patentability? On what grounds  a nation's perceptions to preserve its public order, morality  and environment could be questioned? The implications of this  provision when put into practice is too uncertain.    Interestingly, there is no reference made in Article 27(2)  to  the issues concerning "national interest and security." On these  grounds a country can always take measures which are  appropriate; in this case, it may decide to exclude certain  investions from patentability.    Even though the agreement does not make any specific  reference to these issues, a sovereign country can always invoke  these as a golden rule. Even the GATT's Dispute Settlement  Mechanism cannot overlook these factors on pure objective  grounds. A perusal of the proposals submitted by a few developed  countries, mainly the United States, Japan and European  Community shows us that they sought exclusion of inventions from  patentability on the grounds of "national security and public  interest."    The most controversial provision with long-term implications  on the patenting of life is embodied in Article 27(3). It allows  the exclusion of two categories of subject matters from  patentability, namely (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical  methods for the treatment of humans or animals; and (b) plants  and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially  biological processes for the production of plants or animals  other than non-biological and micro-biological processes.    A provision at the end of the paragraph, however, creates an  exception by making it mandatory for the parties to "provide the  protection of plant varieties either by patents or by any  combination thereof."    It also provides for the revision of this provision after  four years of its entry into force. Before examining the  implications of this provision, it may be worthwhile to recount  its ramifications as elaborated by many specialists in the  recent times. The Ministry of Commerce holds the view that the  provision does not impose any compulsion regarding patenting of  seeds or other propagating material.    Sui generis protection, according to the Ministry, would  imply a system which is different from other categories of  intellectual property protection and is thus in a class by  itself. In this regard, however, the Ministry of Commerce seeks  to make a reference for guidance to outline the sui generis  protection of plant varieties to the International Convention  for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, better known as  the UPOV Convention.    Further, in its view, the rights granted by the UPOV  Convention of 1978 extend only to production for commercial  marketing of the propagating material, whereas in the case of  patents, it extends to production per se. In other words, plant  varieties protected by patents would not allow farmers to retain  even a part of their produce for sowing in the following season.    Sui generis system envisaged by the UPOV Convention of 1978,  on the other hand, allows the farmer to retain the seeds. A  revised UPOV Convention of 1991 moves that system of plant  variety protection closer to patent system by imposing  restrictions on the right of the farmer to retain the  propagating material even for use on his own holding. Another  significant change in this Revised Convention relates to the  extension of this right not to a few genera or species but to  the whole plant kingdom.    The UPOV Convention of 1991 outlines the scope of the  breeder's right in almost absolute terms. The authorisation of  the breeder is required as per Article 14 (1) for (a) production  or reproduction (multiplication); (b) conditioning for the  purpose of propagation; (c) offering for sale; (4) selling or  other marketing; (e) exporting; (f) importing; and (g) stocking  for the above mentioned purposes.    In Article 14 (2) it is, however, made clear that "in  respect  of harvested material, including entire plants or parts of  plants, obtained through the unauthorised use of propagating  material of the protected variety shall require the  authorisation of the breeder, unless the breeder has had  reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to the  said propagating material."    There are three exceptions to the breeder's Rights: (a) acts  done privately and for non-commercial purposes; (b) acts done  for experimental purposes; and (c) acts done for the purpose of  breeding other varieties. The effect of these provisions in  conjunction with Dunkel Proposals could be stated in the  following way. For example, if a farmer gets a seed in the  initial stages, he cannot legally sell that produce to a  co-farmer. Therefore, every year each farmer will have to buy  seeds.    In order to overcome these difficulties in any system of  protection following features should be incorporated: (a) free  flow of genetic resources between public and private sectors;  (b) compulsory release and certification of varieties even for  public agencies to check spread of unadapted varieties; (c)  companies to compensate the public sector for the use of genetic  stock cultivated by them; and (d) the farmer's rights and  breeder's rights not to be changed in any way.    The apprehensions as regards the operative styles of  multinational seed companies in India should also be addressed  and proper legal mechanism should be formulated to check their  uncontrolled growth. It is necessary in the interest of hundreds  of indigenously managed seed companies whose priority is to  supply uncontaminated and viable seeds.    The system envisaged by the Dunkel proposal will inevitably  force most of these companies to close down or be bought over by  the big companies. The role of these small comapnies in  collaboration with growing co-operative sector in the arena of  farming and effective distribution of seeds should 'be  considered in greater detail'.    In the area of gene sequences, Ministry of Commerce has  stated that it would not allow the patenting of "naturally  occurring genes." On the other hand, genetic material which has  been evolved by human intervention would be allowed to get the  protection of patents. However, the Ministry should construe  strictly the operational part of this mechanism while  differentiating naturally occurring genes from artificial year.    A condition should be strictly imposed by calling for  payment  in commercial terms for the uses of genetic resources extracted  from the Indian territory. These resources constitute the source  material for the development of biotechnology and other related  fields.    In conclusion, it should be stated that with the completion  of these negotiations the global trade will enter into a new  phase which may not be in the interest of developing countries.  Multilateralism, for majority of the developing countries, seems  to be a better option than the "walk alone" into an unknown and  unspecified future. Acceptance of Dunkel proposals, on the other  hand, may also not offer any better solution. In fact, it is no  choice at all.</p>

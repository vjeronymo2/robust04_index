			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROSPERO WILL BE NAMED ASSISTANT COACH AT CHAPMAN  </P> <P> Rich Prospero will remain at Chapman College as an assistant basketball coach,  a source in the athletic department said Thursday. School officials are  expected to make the announcement today.  </P> <P> Prospero, 25, was the Panthers' interim coach last season. He and Jerry DeBusk  will assist new Chapman coach Bob Boyd.  </P> <P> Boyd met with Prospero on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of Prospero  remaining with the program.  </P> <P> Prospero will be the team's top assistant coach and will handle some of the  recruiting, according to a source. He was an assistant at Chapman for two years  before replacing Kevin Wilson, who was fired.  </P> <P> Before coming to Chapman, Prospero coached four years at Tustin High School as  a varsity assistant and lower-level coach.  </P> <P> Prospero's contract is expected to be in excess of $30,000 per year. Besides  coaching, he also will teach at least one class.  </P> <P> DeBusk, who coached at Newport Harbor High School last season, accepted the  Chapman job Wednesday.  </P> <P> Prospero also was a candidate for the job as head coach. He was one of five  candidates interviewed.  </P> <P> Under Prospero, the Panthers finished 17-12 and were third in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. Chapman had a successful season despite some  off-court distractions.  </P> <P> In October, Wilson resigned effective at the end of the season. He was fired  seven weeks later for his published comments regarding the distribution of  funds at Chapman.  </P> <P> Lindsay Strothers was named interim coach. However, after the team threatened  to boycott, Prospero became the interim coach.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMELDA MARCOS ASKS DISMISSAL OF CASES  </P> <P> Imelda Marcos, wife of former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, asked  an anti-graft court Monday to dismiss lawsuits filed against her by the  government of President Corazon Aquino.  </P> <P> Marcos's lawyer in Manila, Sergio Apostol, filed a motion stating that the  former first lady has immunity because she was following the orders of her  husband during his 20-year rule over the country.  </P> <P> The court has already declared Imelda Marcos in default in more than 30 civil  cases filed by the government after she refused to present legal papers in her  defense. The government is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars from the  Marcoses for allegedly looting the national Treasury.  </P> <P> Imelda Marcos was acquitted by a New York court July 2 of fraud and  racketeering charges.  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Charter to reduce links with S Africa The proportion of shares held by South African investors in Charter will fall from 20 per cent to 16 per cent as a result of last month's Pounds 93m rights issue by the diversified industrial conglomerate. Exchange controls prevent South Africans taking up their rights in the 1-for-4 issue, made to help fund Charter's recommended Pounds 390m offer for Esab, the Swedish manufacturer of welding products. The rights issue was in the form of an entitlement to Charter convertible stock units. The prospectus said South Africans would be able to sell their entitlements, nil paid, in London but if they did so they would be obliged to repatriate the proceeds to South Africa in commercial rands. The South African authorities have now granted a listing for all the units in Johannesburg in nil-paid form with effect from yesterday, so investors will be able to sell their shares without suffering any adverse currency effect. The acquisition, which more than doubles the size of Charter, is the culmination of a restructuring which last year unwound its links with Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group, by unscrambling its ties with Johnson Matthey and Minorco. Charter's offer was agreed by Incentive, the Swedish investment group and Esab's biggest shareholder, which speaks for 49 per cent of the voting rights. Charter has since bought shares in the market to increase the share of Esab's voting rights it has secured to 52.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Observer: Pyramid victory Don't cross Peter Munk. After 15 years pursuing Egypt through the courts, the hotelier turned gold-bug has again come out on top. The country is paying him Dollars 17.5m to settle a long-running row. He is best known these days for his Canadian gold and oil property businesses encompassing American Barrick Resources, one of the biggest gold producers, and Horsham. But back in 1974 he led a group of investors in Southern Pacific Properties, which launched the first big development project in Egypt in line with President Sadat's 'open door' policy for western investment there. In a joint venture with the Egyptian ministry of tourism, SPP was to develop hotels and tourist resorts near the pyramids, and at Ras el Hekma on the Mediterranean coast. The project angered Islamic fundamentalists; it was defiling the pyramids and insulting ancient Egyptian civilisation, they said. Sadat caved in, the government pulled out and the scheme collapsed. Munk has been seeking compensation for SPP ever since. He won his first court case at the International Chamber of Commerce Tribunal in Paris 10 years ago, when Egypt was ordered to pay Dollars 12.5m plus interest. Its government appealed, and did so again even after the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington awarded Munk Dollars 27.6m. But now the parties have agreed a settlement. Although often told he was flogging a dead camel, multi-millionaire Munk pressed on. The same tenacity has been felt by UK stockbrokers James Capel, which in 1989 incensed him by buying shares in Consolidated Gold Fields on its own account after being instructed to build a stake in Gold Fields for American Barrick. Two years later, without admitting liability, Capel settled out of court for about Pounds 2m.</p>

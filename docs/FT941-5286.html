			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / EU weighs up the votes and the cod A handful of votes in the European Union's council of ministers, and a few thousand tonnes of Norwegian cod, last night stood between the EU and its biggest ever enlargement, to take in Sweden, Finland, Austria and possibly Norway as new members. As negotiations at foreign minister level broke up - to resume today - only the dimmest glimmer of how to resolve the two rows could be discerned. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, European affairs minister of Greece, warned that if a solution was not found by lunchtime today, EU heads of government might have to step in to solve the 'crisis', possibly at an emergency summit. The two issues must be settled so that the European parliament can decide on Thursday whether to start approval of the accession treaty in time for the newcomers' entry next January. All applicants except Norway have settled their entry terms. But the dispute over votes could jeopardise prospects of early entry for all four. Spain and the UK insist for different reasons on maintaining the right of two large and one small member states to block EU measures in the council, under the EU's weighted majority voting system. If the 'blocking minority' is maintained at 23 votes, then the threshold of assent rises from 54 votes out of 76 to 68 out of 90 once the four new members enter. A majority of the 12 want the blocking minority moved to 27. Votes in the council are distributed roughly according to size of country. But with four small newcomers, the British argue that the relationship between size of population and voting strength is being stretched beyond the bounds of democratic legitimacy. 'You could have a failed blocking minority representing 41.5 per cent of the Union's population,' a UK official complains. Spain worries that a move to 27 could see the South out-voted on Mediterranean policy issues. The Benelux countries, Ireland and France are firmly in the 27 votes camp, but other countries are ambivalent. Italy, on the EU's federalist wing, wants easier passage for Euro-laws, but equally wants to protect interests like agriculture. Germany, which after unification gets only one vote in Council for every 8m Germans, against Luxembourg's one vote for every 200,000 of its inhabitants, is nevertheless concerned above all to ensure enlargement goes ahead, preferring to put off voting reform until the 1996 constitutional review. Euro-MPs are threatening to stop accession unless the blocking minority is changed, and the Dutch and Belgians warn that their national MPs might halt ratification if Spain and Britain get their way. Mr Ken Collins, chairman of the European parliament's influential environment committee, warned last week that retaining the 23-votes blocking minority could undermine generally higher green standards in the applicant states. The four have been allowed to keep different environmental norms for four years, during which the EU will review standards and possibly upgrade them. Making it easier to block upgrading threatens this carefully crafted formula. Some EU negotiators speculated last night that some form of 'solemn declaration' alongside the accession treaty might break the impasse. Spain would have to be assured its interests would be taken into account; the UK would at the very least need some guarantee that the 1996 review would match inhabitants to votes more closely. The votes dispute seemed to be encouraging Norway to dig in its heels on fish, in the hope that if Spain got some satisfaction on voting it would moderate its equally insistent demands for Norwegian cod. Spain wants 7,000 tonnes to restore its 'historic' catch, before it was barred from Norwegian waters in 1981, and its roughly half share of the 11,000 tonnes Norway cedes to the poorest Union members under this year's European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone treaty. Under EEA arrangements for mutual access to waters, Norway also allows the EU 40,000 tonnes of its cod quota from this year. But it is adamant that it will surrender not one fish more - and even suggesting it could withdraw these quotas if it joins the EU and its membership of the EEA therefore lapses. However, a Spanish fisheries official said: 'It doesn't matter to us where these tonnes of fish come from. But we cannot go home without them. This is not a bluff.'</p>

At the meeting, discussions on defining the principles  of exchange of information and cooperation were discussed. It  was noted that there was a great need for the constant exchange  of accurate information due to the frequent distortion of  information on resolutions passed and work done at the regular  meetings of these organizations. Agreement was attained on this  and measures for quickly completing the technical preparatory  work have been defined.    The situation created in connection with the stoppage of  publication of the press organs of a number of parties and  independent newspapers was also discussed at the meeting. An  appeal was dispatched to the National Assembly and international  organizations.    At the meeting the question was also raised about creating  the opportunity for the newspapers that have stopped printing to  speak out in the party organs which continue to publish.</p>

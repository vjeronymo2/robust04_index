			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: The Dedication Orchestra - 100 Club, Oxford St Treating a New Year's hangover with full tilt avant-garde jazz in a smoky basement club with a relative humidity of 99 per cent would not be the average citizen's cup of purgative, but the grimy 100 Club in Oxford Street was full to the rafters anyway. That's because the Dedication Orchestra, which employs some of the country's most liberated improvisers, was performing there and for a good cause. The musicians involved have all collaborated at some time with South African jazz refugees The Blue Notes - Johnny Dyani, Mongezi Feza, Chris McGregor, Louis Moholo and Dudu Pukwana - who arrived here in the 1960s. Only Moholo remains, the others have all died. But such was the lasting effect on the London jazz composing scene of the characters that their peers have established a bursary, The Spirits Rejoice Foundation, to help fund young South African musicians' study in Europe. All proceeds from the concert, and sales of the CD to follow, will go into the fund. When the Blue Notes first arrived in London from South Africa in 1965 (multi-racial music making was not possible at home), their fiery township-inspired impro was unlike anything the trad or bop fraternity here was used to. The sound of the Dedication Orchestra is not yet easy listening. Pianist Keith Tippett, who with his lamb chop sideburns, collarless shirt and waistcoat looks like a refugee from the Onedin Line, often leaves his stool to tinker beneath the instrument's lid with wooden blocks. His wife Julie, with whom he once had a band called Ovary Lodge, is so involved a vocalist her violent spasms seem likely to carry her off the stand. They are but one-twelfth of the ensemble and the whole makes a formidable sound. The horns include the crazed sopranos of Lol Coxhill and Evan Parker, with Django Bates directing from behind a tenor horn. The brass features Kenny Wheeler, absent for the set I caught, amply compensated for by Harry Beckett and Jim Dvorak while Louis Moholo, the surviving Blue Note, grins out from behind a quivering kit. Original Blue Note compositions all, the material is arranged in an invigoratingly shambolic way by current personnel. Out of this crafted chaos comes the sounds of Soweto rhythms and swing big bands, as in 'Manja' (now), written by Chris McGregor and arranged by Mike Westbrook. In 'Dancing Damon' trombone slides bristle vigorously while in 'Sonja' Evan Parker shows uncharacteristic restraint and melody with the ballad, sometimes actually breathing between notes. The Dedication Orchestra will never rival Paul Simon in popularising South African rhythms but the CD deserves to be a success, for historical as well as charitable reasons.</p>

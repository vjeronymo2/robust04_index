			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Book Review: Glimpse into the mandarin's mind HONG KONG MEMOIRS Xu Jiatun United Daily News Press, Taipei, 1993 (in Chinese) 2 vols Four years ago, Xu Jiatun, a member of the central committee of the Chinese Communist party, bade farewell to his family in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, and slipped into the colony. Three days later he was in Los Angeles. Xu was one of the top 300 or so people ruling more than 1bn Chinese people. Now living in a Buddhist monastery, he is the most senior member of the Chinese Communist party ever to defect to the west. The significance of his memoirs is thus considerable. They give the first insider's account of its workings that has not been filtered through Beijing's thought police. For students of the Chinese Communist party, the memoirs give a unique insight into the workings of the party at the highest level; for those interested in how the party set about laying the foundations of its rule over Hong Kong, when UK sovereignty expires in 1997, they are essential reading. As head of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Group - Beijing's title for the group of the most senior Communist party members in Hong Kong - Xu was China's top man in the colony. He was an experienced party man; immediately before Hong Kong, in mid-1983, he was Communist party chief in Jiangsu province. In Hong Kong, however, he faced a more challenging time; he had been instructed by Beijing to reform the New China News Agency, a cover for the Chinese Communist party's organisation in the colony, which was regarded as remote from, and was widely distrusted by, the Hong Kong Chinese. Beijing recognised a need to improve its image in the eyes of the local population. Senior staff at the agency were also hostile to Xu's appointment; at the time, the agency was run by a hardline southern Chinese clique which resented the appointment of a northern Chinese official. Xu's immediate predecessor, a Maoist of the old school, had opposed the creation of 'special economic zones' which he argued (rightly) were anathema to communism. Xu decided on a two-pronged reform plan for the agency: an internal shake-up and a campaign to rehabilitate its public image, and thereby that of Beijing. Before he arrived in Hong Kong, the local Communist party had been organised into two 'cells', local supporters and mainland diplomats and businessmen sent by Beijing. By merging the two wings, Xu increased his control over the organisation. But his most important work - and enduring legacy - was his effort in creating the 'United Front', a coalition forged among the elite in Hong Kong who could be relied on to support China. The United Front's significance is not only that it created the appearance of support for the party across a broad section of society; it also ensnared people in an active relationship with Beijing. Sensing the deep-seated anti-communism in Hong Kong at the time, Xu decided to 'put aside everything about ideology'. Most of Hong Kong's population were refugees from the mainland; the inflow had been particularly strong at the time of the Cultural Revolution. Xu describes his guiding principle in the following terms: 'On the love of China, support for Deng Xiaoping's reform and open policy, and national reunification we share a common view. On criticism of Mao Zedong and the Communist party we can accommodate our differences.' Xu soon made himself the acceptable face of Chinese communism. That helped in the important task of co-opting Hong Kong's businessmen, which had been high on Xu's agenda when he arrived in the colony. He quickly found the measure of the colony's capitalist class, writing: 'I perceived, shortly after my arrival in Hong Kong, that a businessman's political inclination is normally linked to (the fortune of) his business.' An early example of this was the bail-out of the Bank of East Asia, one of Hong Kong's leading Chinese banks. In 1983 the bank not only faced a split among its founders, but Societe Generale, a French bank, was seeking to take it over. Xu relates how Mr David Li Kwok-po, the chief executive of the bank, approached the agency for help. After deliberation, 'we decided to stand behind the bank', Xu writes. The United Front's political use of the Bank of China, and other large Chinese-owned companies, stands out as one of the chief ways in which the Communist party sought to strengthen its influence over Hong Kong's business community. Xu's work is one of the main reasons why business leaders now line up behind China in its fight with the UK over Hong Kong's democratic development. In late 1989 - a few months after the Tiananmen Square massacre - Xu retired as director of the New China News Agency and moved to Shenzhen in southern China. He had tried to convince Beijing to take a softer line towards the demonstrators; he recalls in the book how he travelled to the Chinese capital to petition the party leadership. He took as evidence video tapes of Hong Kong TV coverage of the demonstrations to try to convince the leaders that the protests taking place on their doorstep had been patriotic, not subversive. In Beijing, he met Zhao Ziyang, the then head of the Communist party. After Tiananmen, realising the bad favour in which he was held in Beijing, Xu retired voluntarily. But when his successor launched an inquiry into his activities at the time of Tiananmen, Xu decided to leave the country. He believed he had done nothing wrong, but felt he would not get a fair hearing. How he fled, however, is unclear: the presumption is that the US helped him. So far, Xu's memoirs are available only in Chinese, although the Hong Kong government has made an unofficial translation. A proper edition, with an index and notes, would be an invaluable insight into how Beijing set about the task of returning Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty.</p>

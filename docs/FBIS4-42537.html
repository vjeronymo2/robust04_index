			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, June 3 (AFP) -- Kyrgyzstan, the  self-styled "Central Asian Switzerland," won a pledge of $550  million from international aid donors Friday [3 June] as  President Francois Mitterrand hailed the ex-Soviet republic's  strides toward democracy.    The international financial community pledged to deliver the  aid over the next 12 months but the funding might even be  increased in the next few months, sources said at the Paris  office of the World Bank.    The announcement came as Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev  signed  the Paris Charter of the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe on the third and final day of a visit here.    Kyrgyzstan's donors include France, Germany, Japan, Russia,  and the United States, as well as a dozen international  organizations.    The donors meeting in the French capital welcomed  application  in the small republic of 4.5 million people of a program of the  International Monetary Fund in the wake of the collapse of the  Kyrgyz economy following the breakup of the Soviet Bloc. But  they insisted on the need for speeding up industrial  restructuring efforts and for strengthening the social security  system.    Kyrgyzstan is also trying to attract foreign investors, and  Akayev told some French business leaders on Friday that his  republic would be "a good bridgehead for an effort to conquer  Central Asian markets."    Mitterrand hailed the country for making "a real effort" to  move "toward a democratic status" after Akayev signed the  Charter at the Elysee Palace, a document which the French  president described as "the act by which the Cold War ended."    Akayev said he hoped the European Union would help his  country remain "the Central Asian Switzerland." [passage  omitted].</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television It is getting late in the Thatcherfest and the BBC is nearing the bottom of the barrel. Admittedly, it was not such a bad idea to wheel on Sir Bernard Ingham for What The Papers Said (BBC2, 7.45). He analyses the five syndromes which afflicted the press in its coverage of the Thatcher government, including 'Columnar Pox' - wilful refusal to check facts. However, it seems daft to make a programme about people's recollections of what they were doing when Mrs Thatcher resigned? The Day She Went (BBC2, 9.30) hits the barrel base with a thump. Thus far Plant Life (C4, 9.00) hovers around GCSE level in its explication of plant physiology. Many viewers will be disappointed that it was not more intellectually ambitious. Demob (ITV, 9.00) is a comedy drama as limply wet as pondweed. It stars Griff Rhys Jones as a demobbed soldier who joins up with a spivvish friend to become variety show entertainers. Cellist Jacqueline Du Pre is remembered in The Marquesa's Memoirs (Radio 3, 9.55), the enjoyable musical recollections of the Marquesa de Cadaval.</p>

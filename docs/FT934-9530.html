			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent 22% up despite rising bad debts LEEDS PERMANENT, the UK's fifth largest building society, yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 186.2m for the year to September 30 in spite of increased provisions for bad debt. The provisions, which rose from Pounds 105.2m to Pounds 131.1m, reflected a fall in property values of about 5 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 which increased losses on properties held in possession. However, provisions in the second half of the year were down by 44 per cent compared with the first half. There was also a deduction of Pounds 50.9m from net interest received to reflect irrecoverable interest on properties in possession and arrears. But a sharp increase in net interest received - from Pounds 342.1m to Pounds 428m - contributed significantly to the society's improved profitability. Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, said the increase was largely because of the society's active Treasury operation, as well as the opportunity for widening margins as interest rates fell in the aftermath of sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last autumn. He said a 14 per cent increase in management expenses to Pounds 220.4m reflected in part the depreciation of earlier investment in information technology. Mr Boyes confirmed that the Leeds was still looking for other opportunities after its plans for a merger with National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth largest society, were called off at the eleventh hour last month because of cultural differences. The society has also resumed its search for a new chief executive, but it is now unlikely that anyone will be in place before the end of the year. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said the results both set the trend for the building society sector in improved profitability and capital strength, and confirmed Leeds' 'viability as an independent financial institution' even though it had lost out on the added benefits of the proposed merger. The results were typical for the sector only because in covering the last quarter of 1992, they included provisions for bad debts which would have been included in other societies' results for 1992-93.</p>

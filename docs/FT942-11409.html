			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (12): Colony acts as a springboard on to the mainland - An internationally-accepted financial and legal framework makes Hong Kong an attractive base for multinationals tapping into the huge emerging market across the border / Trading hubs, Hong Kong EXPORT STRATEGIES: various means are being employed to gain market access, from using one trading centre to enter another to exploiting regional networks With its 1.2bn population, developing wealth and growing middle class, and its strong appetite for both consumer goods and machinery, China is the exporters' dream. But it can also be a nightmare, replete with all the worst things that can be imagined about trading with a communist country: bureaucracy, restrictions applying to foreigners, reliance on personal connections and petty corruption. A growing number of multinationals - and smaller businesses - are setting up shop in Hong Kong, which they see as a springboard into China. A presence in the colony allows them to operate in an internationally-accepted financial and legal framework while at the same time tapping the massive emerging market across the border. The trend is evident from Hong Kong's trade statistics: last year, some 79 per cent of the colony's total exports were re-exports and one third of these re-exports, which in total accounted for some HKDollars 823.2bn, went to China. Anna Lai, assistant executive director at the Trade Development Council  - a semi-governmental body promoting trade in the colony - says more and more overseas companies are setting up networks in Hong Kong as a platform for doing business in China. 'To do business in China you need to take part in a lot of personal meetings and to make guanxi (connections) so you know who you are dealing with. It is not enough just to communicate by fax, mail or telephone.' Hong Kong scores, she argues, because of its closeness to important business areas within China. When Anixter, one of the world's leading distributors of wiring systems for data, voice, video and multimedia networks, made the decision to tackle the China market, its first step was to set up in Hong Kong. 'This is going to be our hub,' says Mr Joshua Barton, a sales executive for Anixter in Hong Kong. 'Everybody is here. It is the meeting place for Asia. It is central, the business environment is permissive, it offers a well-trodden path, as well as a well-understood one.' The freedom which is available to those operating in Hong Kong is thrown into sharper relief by the restrictions which persist across the border in mainland China. Business ventures can find themselves facing a string of curbs: unexpected laws and taxes can hinder even the best-laid plans. As Mr Barton puts it: 'You can have a good idea, but if you are the first, you can also face a lot of unpleasant surprises. The only unpleasant surprise in Hong Kong is the escalating costs.' Alan Ho, director of medium sized garments company, Lim Ying Ying in Hong Kong, says China traders can face sudden changes in the law on both the exporting and importing sides. 'The rules change without our knowing, so we have to be able to respond quickly, and in Hong Kong we are able to. For instance, sometimes there are restrictions on the geographical distribution of garments that we can sell. 'Frequently you do not know in what way and at what time the rules have changed, so the only way to sort it out is to send someone to the distribution point to be there to react. Again, it is a question of Hong Kong's geographical proximity and culture,' he says. Hong Kong offers businesses, both domestic and foreign, a level playing field and clear-cut laws on key issues such as tax, investment and unemployment, which are accessible to everyone. Backing this up is a dense legal and financial infrastructure offering support, and a range of capital-raising facilities. While establishing a network in Hong Kong is not cheap - spiralling wage and rental costs reflect the property boom and severe constraints on land and labour in the colony - traders who have chosen this route say it is a cost well worth bearing as it eliminates the expensive errors that can come about by trying to approach China directly. There is also the question of distribution: a company looking to sell its goods to both Beijing and Shanghai - respectively, the Washington and New York of China - as well as the coastal boom provinces and greater China - Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao - will be plagued with difficulties if it sets up shop in either Beijing or Shanghai. Distribution within China is hampered by poor transportation as well as the fluctuating lines of power. Quotas allotted by the individual provincial governments may the next month re-emerge under central government control, and vice versa. Beyond mainland China, political sensitivities are a handicap to trade between Taiwan and China trade. Conversely, a Hong Kong base is both a free port and a well functioning one which will only improve when the new airport and container terminals come on line. However, delays in shipping and the loss of goods mean that companies such as Anixter are still keen to establish distribution bases in China in the future. Sales offices in the mainland also feature on long-term agenda, highlighting the need to maximise face-to-face contact. For the time being, Hong Kong-based directors make frequent visits across the border. Anixter, which has an annual turnover of USDollars 1.6bn and some 3,400 employees worldwide, is further capitalising on its Hong Kong base to launch a personnel drive: picking up trilingual staff (speaking Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese, plus English) who are used to working within more Western style corporate structures. These bi-cultural staff will be ideally placed to play key roles in offices in China when these are set up.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Short moves closer to millionaire status NIGEL SHORT will be on the brink of becoming Britain's first chess millionaire today when he sits at the board for his 13th game against Jan Timman, the Dutch champion. Originally Kasparov had planned to defend his title in August in Los Angeles with a Dollars 4m prize fund, but backers were not interested in a series between two Europeans. The International Chess Federation has re-opened bidding for the prize fund. Chess organisers in Barcelona say that city will bid Dollars 4m, while Jakarta may offer a still higher figure. Berlin and the Spanish university town of Santiago de Compostela are also in contention. Bids must be submitted to the federation by February 8. In most cases the city authorities would be heavily involved in financing the prize money, seeking private sponsorship to help fund the event and regarding its spending as an investment in a higher international profile and an increased number of visitors. Statistical forecasts based on ratings say Kasparov would win, but Short would collect the three eighths of the prize fund that goes to the loser. He would add this to the Pounds 35,000 for beating Karpov and Pounds 80,000 for eliminating Timman. Business sponsorship of chess has declined. City institutions such as Grieveson Grant; UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the London investment banking arm of Union Bank of Switzerland; and Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, have dropped out since their mergers into bigger groups. The Greater London Council sponsored an international event in London in 1986, but was itself abolished soon afterwards. There is still City sponsorship - from Lloyds Bank, Leigh Interests, and Duncan Lawrie, the private bank - as well as from the East Sussex town of Hastings, which holds a tournament every year. Declining sponsorship has left leading players struggling for a living. Mr Peter Wells, 27, an Oxford economics graduate and head of the British Chess Academy, which represents young professionals, says: 'There are too many players chasing too little money and in European opens we now have to contend with a huge influx of ex-Soviets.' Players rely on coaching, writing books and European league games to survive. Mr Wells adds: 'Our only real hope is that the economy will improve and that there will be a spin-off from Nigel's match with Kasparov.' Chess column, Weekend XIX</p>

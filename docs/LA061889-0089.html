			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORA BORA TRAVEL  </P> <P> The article Hulse wrote on Bora Bora brought back wonderful memories of our  vacation last summer. We want to share two tips with readers who might be  looking for a more economical way to enjoy Bora Bora and the neighboring  islands of Raiatea and Huahine.  </P> <P> Chez Pauline is a simple campsite, very popular with young Europeans and on the  picture-perfect beach near the Marara and Moana Beach hotels. One can camp for  about 800 francs (about $8 U.S.) per person per day, or rent a simple bungalow  for 4,000 francs per person. Reservations need to be made well in advance,  especially for July and August. Contact: Chez Pauline, P.O. Box 215, Vaitape,  Bora Bora, French Polynesia.  </P> <P> Also, Claude and Claudine Goche have been in the charter business in the  Leeward Islands since 1972. Their yacht, the Danae III, has four double  staterooms. It sails each Monday from either Huahine, Bora Bora or Raiatea on  six-day cruises, dropping anchor in magnificent lagoons and allowing guests to  snorkel, to explore white sandy beaches or to search for shells. Claudine  prepares the catch each day in her tiny galley and creates gourmet dinners . .  . for about $800 per person for six days.  </P> <P> For a voyage away from tourist paths with genuine South Seas experiences, we  recommend our friends on the Danae III as the best guides. Contact: Claude and  Claudine Goche, Danae III, P.O. Box 251, Uturoa, Raiatea, French Polynesia.  </P> <P> JUDY AND PIERRE  </P> <P> D'ALBERT  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

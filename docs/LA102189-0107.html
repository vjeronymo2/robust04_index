			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTS ON THE TIMES' NEW FORMAT  </P> <P> Friends, I just got through reading today's (Oct. 11) Times, which I have  subscribed to for about 25 years. I was thoroughly disappointed with your new  concept of publication.  </P> <P> Why a really great newspaper like The Times would want to mimic a publication  like USA Today is beyond my sense of belief.  </P> <P> Your second page Top of Today's News will only discourage many people from  reading your paper in depth. I will never buy another USA Today and if The  Times continues to fall to that level I will certainly discontinue my  subscription to The Times.  </P> <P> MICHAEL PISCITELLI  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

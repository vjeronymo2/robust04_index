			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Defense Ministry report for 11 April 1994"--read by </F> announcer]    [Text] Taking advantage of the peace prevailing for some  time now, the Armenian armed formations resumed their extensive  offensive in the north of Karabakh. As always, the enemy again  used the talks on a temporary cease-fire to revive its spent  forces, and by misleading the international community it greatly  strengthened its troops for a new round of offensives.    Employing some 2,000 troops and armored cars, the Armenians  launched an attack against Gulistan in Geranboyskiy  [Shaumyanovskiy] Rayon and Talish [in northeast of Mardakertskiy  Rayon] yesterday morning. The enemy temporarily gained the  initiative in certain places during the battles.    Following a fierce artillery barrage today, the Armenian  infantry troops launched an attack against our army's positions  along the Terter-Agdam line at 0630. According to reports, the  battles are continuing. The border settlements in our republic's  Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons came under artillery shelling  today from the military bases in the Armenian Republic.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORY SAYS UNLV PAIR GOT CASH;  </P> <P> MAGAZINE REPORTS MOSES, SCURRY WERE PAID BY GAMBLER  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas basketball players Moses Scurry and David Butler reportedly  received cash last October during a lunch at Caesars Palace with a man who  twice has been convicted of sports bribery, according to a story in Time  magazine's April 3 edition, which was on newsstands Monday.  </P> <P> But Butler said by telephone from the UNLV basketball office Tuesday that he  did not receive any money at the Oct. 18 lunch with a man he knew only as Sam  Perry, who coached Scurry as a youngster in New York City.  </P> <P> Scurry could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Butler, asked if Scurry received money, said: "I really don't know. You'd have  to ask Moses about that."  </P> <P> The magazine reported that Perry told Art Ross, a former coach in the  Continental Basketball Assn., "I gave them a hundred bucks, so what?"  </P> <P> UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said his understanding is that Scurry was given no  more than "$20 to pay the tip for lunch or something."  </P> <P> Perry, also known as Richard (the Fixer) Perry, according to the magazine, was  convicted in 1974 in connection with a betting scandal at Roosevelt and Yonkers  raceways in New York, and pleaded guilty in 1984 to conspiring to commit sports  bribery as part of a Boston College point-shaving scheme, the magazine said.  </P> <P> Tarkanian said Monday that he knew Perry as Sam Perry and that Perry had told  him he was "in commodities."  </P> <P> Tarkanian said he met Perry in 1986 when Perry was one of a number of people to  tell him that Lloyd Daniels, a talented New York high-school dropout, was  interested in playing at UNLV.  </P> <P> Daniels signed a letter of intent to attend UNLV in 1986. In 1987, he was  arrested in Las Vegas for allegedly attempting to buy rock cocaine.  </P> <P> Tarkanian announced afterward that Daniels would never play for UNLV, and says  that Perry was outraged at that announcement and that he has not spoken to  Perry since.  </P> <P> Tarkanian said UNLV has "no relationship in any way" with Perry, and that he  "didn't know anything" about Perry's background until the magazine approached  him.  </P> <P> National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules prohibit athletes receiving extra  benefits from people defined as representatives of a school's athletic  interests, a category that includes those who do such things as contribute  money, attend booster functions or provide scouting information at the request  of the staff.  </P> <P> "The whole thing is ridiculous," Tarkanian said. "We have no relationship with  Sam Perry. We have a million people come to Las Vegas. He coached (Scurry) or  knew (Scurry)."  </P> <P> Rick Hilliard, a director of enforcement for the NCAA, said he was unaware of  the report until asked to comment on it, but said that "potentially there could  be a problem anytime a student-athlete receives money," and that the key  consideration could be whether the individual is classified as a representative  of the school's athletic interests.  </P> <P> "If he were involved in gambling or a known gambler, we would always be  interested in reviewing the matter," Hilliard said. "That's always a sensitive  matter. . . . Not only would the NCAA be interested, but also the Justice  Department."  </P></p>

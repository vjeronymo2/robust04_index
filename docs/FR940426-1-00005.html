The Board of Directors of the FDIC has concluded that the notices required of depository institutions which seek to establish or relocate a remote service facility under the proposed regulation will not constitute a ``collection of information'' as defined in 5 CFR 1320.7 which has not already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Consequently, no information has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the FDIC hereby certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC has reached this conclusion because the effect of the rule, if it is ultimately promulgated in its current form, will be to reduce the recordkeeping, reporting and compliance requirements that are imposed upon small entities rather than to increase them. This is because the proposed rule seeks to create a blanket approval process for requests that must receive the prior written consent of the FDIC. The proposed rule imposes no new recordkeeping or reporting requirements upon small entities since notices required are abbreviated versions of letter applications currently required of banks. Furthermore, most institutions would not be required to give public notice of the transaction which would reduce burden on the requesting institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC desires to reduce the regulatory burden on banks seeking to establish or relocate RSFs. Currently, banks desiring to establish an initial RSF must comply with all the application and publication requirements applicable to the establishment of a ``brick and mortar'' branch office. See 12 CFR 303.2(a) &amp; (c). Successive RSFs may be established or relocated without a formal application pursuant to somewhat less involved requirements. See 12 CFR 303.2(c). The existing regulation does not differentiate based upon the condition of the institution submitting the application; the only difference it recognizes is whether or not this is an initial application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the limited investment represented by an RSF and the fact that all the information in the FDIC's possession indicates that consumers are of the opinion that RSFs are a convenient and desirable banking service, the FDIC is proposing that its existing regulation concerning the establishment and relocation of RSFs be revised to lessen the application and notice requirements which an institution must satisfy before it may establish or relocate an RSF. Furthermore, unlike the existing regulation, the proposal sets forth even more streamlined procedures for banks with Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) ratings of satisfactory or better.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the proposal revises &sect;303.2(c) of the FDIC's regulations to provide that a state nonmember bank or an insured state-licensed branch of a foreign bank whose most recent CRA rating is Satisfactory or better may establish and operate or relocate an RSF by filing a letter with the appropriate FDIC regional director. The letter shall contain the location of the RSF and either a representation that the site is not included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or written verification that in the opinion of the appropriate state historic preservation officer the establishment or relocation of the RSF will have no adverse effect on a historic site. Unless the institution is notified otherwise by the FDIC within seven days of receipt of the letter, the institution may establish or relocate the RSF. The FDIC is proposing that the existing public notice requirements be dispensed with in this case. See proposed &sect;303.2(c)(2). However, if the institution cannot make such representations concerning compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it shall proceed pursuant to &sect;303.2(c)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that the state nonmember bank or insured state-licensed branch's most recent CRA rating is not Satisfactory or better, proposed &sect;303.2(c)(3) provides that the institution shall file the letter described in &sect;303.2(c)(2) of the proposal and comply with the existing notice provisions of &sect;303.6(f). Unless the institution is notified otherwise within fifteen days after completion of processing of the letter, the institution may establish or relocate the RSF. In the event that a protest is filed or other objection is taken, the institution may not proceed until the FDIC provides written notice of its approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

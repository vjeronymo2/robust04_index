			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Writing With the Eyes"] </F>   [Text] "I am pleased to have a new house." Lucie is a  tetraplegic child, incapable of correct speech, but she was able  to "type" this sentence on a computer in just a few seconds --  simply by looking at it. This moving demonstration is the fruit  of the work of Jacques Charlier, an optical engineer and  researcher at the National Health and Medical Research Institute  (INSERM) in Lille, on an eye-controlled system. The device,  which can be adapted for use with any microcomputer, includes a  sensor that measures line of sight and an assignment table  containing the alphabet and a few word processing function  symbols. The sensor, placed behind the assignment table, scans  eye movement through a central orifice. A method for processing  the eye image, based on an identification of specific pupil  shapes and the corneal reflection, makes it possible to overcome  artefacts such as parasitic reflections. Charlier explains:  "Data can be entered at the rate of one to two characters per  second. The control principle is not specific to computers --  household appliances can also be controlled in this way." This  system, with the backing of the Delta 7 humanitarian society,  should benefit several hundreds or even thousands of severely  handicapped people in France. Unfortunately, the system --  costing around 100,000 French francs -- will not go on sale for  another two to three years, giving home reeducation centers time  to evaluate and perfect the system.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Repossessed homes down 9% in 1992 THE NUMBER of homes repossessed because of mortgage arrears fell last year from the record level of 1991, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said yesterday. There was a sharp rise, however, in the number of households six months or more in arrears with payments. Repossessions totalled 68,540 last year, a fall of 9 per cent from 1991 when 75,540 properties were repossessed. But more than 350,000 households were in serious mortgage arrears at the end of last year, 28 per cent up on the 1991 total of 275,350. Sir George Young, the housing minister, said the figures showed that government initiatives taken in conjunction with lenders in 1991 had started to take effect. He predicted that falling interest rates would further ease pressures on borrowers. He said: 'The best mortgage rescue scheme is lower interest rates.' But Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the lenders council, attributed the fall in repossessions largely to actions by lenders. Had lenders not agreed to be flexible, the number of repossessions could have exceeded 120,000, he said. Halifax Building Society, the largest lender, said that it had halved the number of its repossessions over the past year. Mr Boleat said the steep increase in mortgage arrears was caused by lenders agreeing to lower monthly payments instead of repossessing. Arrears had also been lengthened by the fall in interest rates, since monthly arrears figures are calculated by dividing the total outstanding by the monthly payments. When monthly payments fall, the arrears total remains unchanged. But the number of months needed to pay them off goes up. Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, described those in arrears as on 'the waiting list for repossession'. Rising unemployment would only add to the problem. 'Possessions will continue to plague our country for the next two or three years,' Mr Wriglesworth said. Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the charity for the homeless, said: 'The problem of mortgage debt is not diminishing, it is just shifting from repossessions to long-term arrears. The crisis has been postponed, not solved.' Mr Boleat conceded that government mortgage rescue initiatives had made some contribution to the fall in repossessions. More than 10,000 homes had been saved from repossession because of the payment of the mortgage interest part of social security benefits directly to the lender rather than the borrower. Only 1,000 homes have been saved as a result of the mortgage to rent schemes, however. Mortgage lenders sold 71,000 properties during last year but held 64,970 unsold properties at the end of the year.</p>

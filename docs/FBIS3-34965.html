He  added that these changes comes in response to requests submitted  by a number of ministers recently. They asked to be relieved of  their ministerial responsibilities.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he pointed out that  these requests have not been accepted because the country is  going through a critical phase requiring complete cooperation  among its members to return the situation to what it was before  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    He said that the picture has not yet become clear with  regard  to the ministers who are going to move to other posts inside the  government. He stressed that the change will not include the  Interior, Information, and Foreign Ministries.    Dr. Hayati said that "some ministers have not kept pace with  the aspirations of the government, the people, and the National  Assembly, thus new faces are needed -- faces capable of making  decisions to reinforce the Kuwaiti citizens' confidence in the  government."    However, Deputy Ahmad Baqir, secretary of the National  Assembly, has denied recent media reports about a cabinet  reshuffle. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that this is "absolutely  baseless."

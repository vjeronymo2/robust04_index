			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON, DIVAC KEY LAKERS;  </P> <P> NBA: YUGOSLAV CARRIES HIS WEIGHT AGAINST MAVERICKS' DONALDSON. MAGIC SCORES 38.  </P> <P> Vlade Divac is the size of, well, a Yugo compared to the Mack truck that is  Dallas Maverick center James Donaldson. Divac, the Lakers' rookie center,  easily gives up about 40 pounds as well as almost a decade of experience to the  bulky Donaldson.  </P> <P> It was not the best set of circumstances for the Yugoslav to make the second  start of his NBA career on Monday night. But with Mychal Thompson out because  of a hyper-extended right knee, the Lakers had no choice.  </P> <P> Divac scored 21 points, four shy of his season high, and had 11 rebounds in the  Lakers' 113-106 victory before 17,505 at the Forum.  </P> <P> Divac's play may not have been the overriding factor in Lakers' 58th victory --  Magic Johnson had a season-high 38 points, including a career-high 19 free  throws -- but the center matchup could have been a major problem without  Thompson to defend Donaldson.  </P> <P> "I thought Vlade did a hell of a job against Donaldson," Laker Coach Pat Riley  said. "I really questioned starting him. We thought a lot about not starting  him and going with a small lineup. But Vlade did a good job."  </P> <P> Monday's victory, the Lakers' seventh in a row, all but wrapped up the club's  bid for the NBA's best record. The Lakers (58-17) lead the Detroit Pistons by  four games in the loss column with seven to play.  </P> <P> Johnson was undeniably superb in jump-starting the worn-out Lakers, playing  their fourth game in five nights, and Divac provided stability in the middle on  a night they needed it.  </P> <P> Divac had problems adjusting to Donaldson, who made all four shots he attempted  in the first quarter. By halftime, though, Divac had 14 points and six rebounds  and Donaldson had been shut out in the second quarter.  </P> <P> And, even though the Lakers pulled away from the Mavericks by using a smaller  lineup and a half-court trap in the third quarter, Divac finished with his most  points of the season against a true NBA starting center. His season-high 25  points came mostly against Sacramento's gimpy Ralph Sampson on Jan. 15.  </P> <P> "I (was) much better against Donaldson," Divac said. "When I play against  Donaldson, I know I have to push. I play physical now. Before, I couldn't do  that."  </P> <P> Johnson's performances no longer surprise Riley or his teammates. Included  Monday night was a 55-foot basket at the halftime buzzer and a series of  impressive drives to the basket. And many of his eight assists were  spectacular.  </P> <P> In addition to Johnson and Divac, the Lakers were led by A.C. Green's 15 points  and nine rebounds and Byron Scott's 13 points. Rolando Blackman and Sam Perkins  had 19 and 18 points, respectively, for Dallas. Donaldson finished with 11  points and three rebounds.  </P> <P> Although the Lakers shot only 46.2% and had 17 turnovers, they beat Dallas  because of Divac's steady play and the idea that Johnson would not let this one  get away.  </P> <P> Of his 55-foot shot, Johnson said:  </P> <P> "I just got a good look at it and got my feet together and it was shot on a  line," Johnson said. "It was one shot that goes in every 100 times. I guess  this was my 100th time."  </P> <P> He went to the free-throw line 22 times, a career high. The Lakers seemingly  had the game won with about two minutes to play, leading by 15 points. Out went  Johnson and the rest of the starters. But the Laker reserves squandered most of  the lead, forcing Riley to bring back Johnson with 30 seconds left and the  Lakers leading by only five points.  </P> <P> Not to worry, though. Johnson sank two more free throws and the Lakers pulled  out the victory.  </P> <P> "It's unconscionable that I would have to put Earvin back in the game," Riley  said.  </P> <P> For the most part, however, Riley was pleased.  </P> <P> "It was a great win," he said. "Playing four games in five nights, they rose  the the occasion -- Earvin and James (Worthy). This is as competitive as I've  seen us during the regular season."  </P></p>

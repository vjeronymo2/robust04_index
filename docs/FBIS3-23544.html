			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Col (Res) Viktor Aleksandrovich Matafonov by </F> Aleksandr Davidyuk under the rubric "The Ataman Will Speak":  "Viktor Matafonov: Our Line Is 300 Years Old"]    [Text] Viktor Matafonov was born in the year of the  Victory. He completed a construction tekhnikum and then, as an  external student, passed the exams for the Omsk Higher  Combined-Arms Command School. He served 26 years in the  Transbaykal Military District. He is a colonel in the reserve.  Last April the military district of the Transbaykal Cossack Army  recommended his transfer from the position of ataman of the  Chita Cossack District to adviser to the head of the oblast  administration for Cossack affairs.    [Davidyuk] To my knowledge, Viktor Aleksandrovich, the  position of adviser for Cossack affairs to an administration has  been established for the first time in Russia. What brought this  about?    [Matafonov] We have a lot of things for the first time. I  shall get back to that. It is just that they have begun  considering us. We have developed from a group initiating the  rebirth of the Cossack community into a powerful force. There is  a Cossack population of more than 60,000 in the Transbaykal  today. These are patriotic-minded people. Even the oblast  authorities have turned to us. Right now a special group is  being set up under the administration, which will work on a  comprehensive program of economic and cultural rebirth for the  Transbaykal Cossacks.    [Davidyuk] We have never had a shortage of good programs.  But  so many plans have remained just on paper....    [Matafonov] That will not be the case with us. I am now  working directly with top oblast authorities. In areas with a  dense Cossack population the atamans are frequently deputy  chiefs for social support for the population in the rayon  administrations. What do we have to show for this. It is far  easier to resolve all pressing matters--the allocation of land,  for example. I am not even referring to the preparation of the  youth to serve in the army. We are in many ways the first in  this as well.    The first Cossack subunit in the Russian Army has been  created in the Transbaykal Military District. This is the  Daurskiy Cossack Company based with the Port Arthur Regiment.  People throughout the nation have expressed thanks to "your  Cossack outpost." I believe that this positive undertaking will  be supported also in other regions of Russia.    Two Cossack outposts have been set up on the border with  Mongolia and China. They guard the border jointly with the  border troops. We have concluded an agreement on this matter  with the district command element, although the legal aspect has  not yet been completely worked out. I am confident that this  will be done in the immediate future, however.    A Cossack patrol has been set up and is operating by  agreement with the oblast administration and the governing body  of the Transbaykal Cossack Army. It accompanies every train into  the border zone together with law-enforcement agencies. It  combats crime in rail transport.    [Davidyuk] In short, when the rider mounts a horse rearing  to  go, he had better find the stirrup at once, as the Cossacks say.  From every indication, the Transbaykal Cossacks have done so,  have they not?    [Matafonov] Yes, they have. There have been many obstacles  on  the path, though. The main problem is obtaining the money. We  cannot pay wages. Thank you, Col-Gen Valeriy Stepanovich  Tretyakov, district commander. He is coming to our rescue. The  local administration is also chipping in. But this is all just  kopecks. We need a lot of money to do a real job. Take the  construction of villages, for example. There are many people who  want to acquire their own farms. Right now 28 families want to  move here from Kazakhstan. They are hereditary Transbaykal  Cossacks, the Lonshakovs. They want to build a village on the  Argun river. It is on the border with China. We shall try to  help them. We have asked the government of Russia for help in  paying for rail cars to move their household goods....    Some officers released into the reserve also want to remain  here. We plan to settle them along the Argun. There are  fantastically beautiful places there, and hunting and fishing.  It is our strategic mission to settle the border region. There  are empty areas, the villages are deteriorating, and neighbors  are glancing our way with increasing frequency. We welcome  guests, of course, but they will not receive any land. The  situation is tense there. The question of the islands in the  Argun has come to the fore once again, and demarcation is  underway. We are keeping a close eye on the situation, and we do  not intend to be sideline observers.    [Davidyuk] You have with you an officer's saber. Where did  you get it?    [Matafonov] It was given to me by the district commander.    [Davidyuk] Are you a hereditary Cossack?    [Matafonov] Our Cossack line on my mother's side, the  Razmakhnins, is around 300 years old. My grandfather Vasiliy  Ivanovich Matafonov commanded the 1st Cavalry Regiment in the  Civil War. His life, by the way, is described in the novel  "Zabaikaltsy" [The People of the Transbaikal] by the well-known  writer Vasiliy Balyabin. We are bringing up the new generation  in our line, our Cossack children, properly and responsibly. But  I digress. Let us get back to public matters.    We have reached agreement with local television people. We  are going to have our own program. The same goes for radio. In  general, you will not stop us now. There is probably no force  which could stop a Cossack. Or do you not agree?    [Davidyuk] Not agree with you!...</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Hungary goes west with a new urgency: The challenge is to compensate for a shrinking Soviet market MR LASZLO Csaba, adviser to Hungary's finance minister, calls it the country's moment of truth: can it gain access to the west - which means the European Community - quickly enough to offset the shrinking of eastern markets? Last year Hungary succeeded in increasing exports to the west almost as fast as those to its eastern neighbours fell. But now it has to run even faster just to stand still. Some decline was feared when the region abandoned the old system of state-to-state trading at the beginning of the year. But the extent of the disintegration of the Soviet Union's economy has taken everyone by surprise. There is, say Budapest officials, simply no one to talk to about trade and not the hard currency in the Soviet Union to pay for it. Exports to the Soviet Union, which was Hungary's largest trading partner, have plummeted to a fraction of their former level. It is a collapse with few peacetime precedents. There is also doubt about whether the EC will match its supportive rhetoric with what Hungary needs most: an association agreement which gives market access, especially for agricultural products. Moreover, economists are unsure how much longer Hungarian companies can keep up their export drive to the west. Eastern Europe's move to trading on a commercial basis in dollars from the beginning of this year was a leap inthe dark. The new picture, now that its outlines are emerging, are ugly. The Soviet Union took only Dollars 85m, or 4 per cent, of Hungary's hard-currency exports in the first quarter. The level of trade falls well below contracted exports of nearly Dollars 1.5bn for the whole of 1991. It is an even smaller fraction of the Soviet Union's former weight. In 1980, the Soviet Union took 31 per cent of Hungarian exports; in 1989 the figure was still as much as 25 per cent. The only relief is that it is by definition hitting bottom and it is no longer so painful to write off a recovery in Soviet demand. The advice from Mr Csaba, who is Hungary's leading independent expert on east European trade, to those still relying on the Soviet market is blunt: 'Forget it as quickly as possible.' But companies dependent on Soviet customers and their allied bureaucrats cannot forget so easily. The old way of exporting to eastern Europe was comfortable. Exporters dealt with undemanding customers who ordered in huge quantities. Not only that, but they were paid in domestic currency by their own central bank as soon as goods crossed the border. The central authorities were left to settle the bills in a unit of account called the transferable rouble. Hungary's exporters were so enthusiastic that they left the central bank with a shaky trade claim of Dollars 1.8bn against the Soviet Union. Trade officials, fearing for the 500,000 jobs dependent on the Soviet Union, restrained exporters less than they might have. The willingness to continue funding exports to an insolvent customer was 'fundamentally mistaken', Mr Csaba says. 'It was based on the premise that, once the Soviet government says it will pay, it will be in a position to pay.' But, having been burnt itself, Hungary is now seeking help from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for a trade credit to bring hard-currency exports to the Soviet Union to life. Another hope, less fraught with danger, is that the Soviet authorities will lift their ban on barter. Then deals of Ikarus buses in exchange for Tyumen oil and management advice for marble could proliferate without the need for rare hard currency to lubricate the exchanges. But whatever happens, Hungarian economists are counting on a decline in trade turnover of more than half. The only market which could make up for the loss of Soviet orders is the EC. Exports to the EC rose by a quarter last year, overtaking exports to eastern Europe, which fell by a quarter. But Hungary needs to repeat that performance. So far the signs are good. Exports to the EC were Dollars 1bn in the first quarter of 1991, 56 per cent up on the year-earlier period, impressive even after discounting for seasonal factors. The performance helped to give Hungary a Dollars 150m current account surplus in the first quarter. Nevertheless, most of the exports which could easily be re-orientated have been. Further export growth will depend on Hungary's association and asymmetric free-trade agreement with the EC, which is being negotiated and is scheduled to come into effect in January 1992. The EC has conceded symbolic ground to break an impasse on negotiations. But the Community has made no concrete concessions on Hungary's agricultural exports to it, which make up a third of deliveries. All it has said is that products of particular national importance will be given better treatment. Hungary hopes this includes beef. But even an open EC will not save some Hungarian products - those so tightly bound to the Soviet market that they will live or die with it, such as table wines. Some were produced - by accident almost - from vines planted to stabilise sandy earth. The best that could be said of the products is that they are cheap and serviceable, and in demand in the Soviet Union. Mr Csaba is less charitable when he explains why they cannot be sold anywhere else: 'They are unfit for human consumption.'</p>

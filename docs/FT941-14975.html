			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Technology: Europe's newest interpreter - A computer system which makes decisions based on constantly changing variables What do a London-based cancer research fund, Greek tourism, French aerospace and pollution in Venice have in common? All four are guinea pigs in a new project, partly funded by the European Union, to develop a ground-breaking computer-programming language to help decision-making where thousands of constantly changing variables are involved. The four ventures are part of a research project under the EU's Esprit information technology initiative, combining state and private-sector bodies. The three-year Ecu3.5m (Pounds 2.7m) venture, now at its half-way stage, brings together the Munich-based European Computer-industry Research Centre (ECRC), a joint venture between ICL (British-based and Japanese-owned), Bull of France and Germany's Siemens, with a variety of state and private-sector end users. Sophisticated computer software to process long strings of information in parallel, as opposed to one piece of data after another, is nothing new. In meteorology, supercomputers work round the clock to predict weather patterns, based on huge quantities of data on wind speeds, atmospheric pressures and a plethora of other variables. However, computer-based weather forecasting largely involves processing complex mathematical formulae, explains Alex Herold, a group leader at the ECRC. What is different about the new venture is that it combines four distinct types of software writing to produce a result which is closer than any predecessor to logical human thought. 'Hence the name: Applause - Applications and Assessment of Parallel Processing using Logic,' he says. The new language differs from existing products in that it is designed not only to absorb vast amounts of data, but also to interpret them and draw appropriate conclusions. Applause involves combining four programming technologies - logic programming; constraint programming (in which various conditions are imposed); parallel processing and database connection - to produce a high-level programming language for very high performance computers. If the ECRC cracks the nut, a vast range of applications could unfold. The new language could assist any group confronted with thousands of variables and the need for very fast processing to reach real-time decisions based on potential changes between the factors involved. If the project succeeds, it would embody the lofty aims of the controversial Esprit scheme - into which large amounts of money are being pumped by the EU and individual information technology companies - to marry pure university-based research with potential commercial applications. For their work to bear fruit, the Munich researchers must not only develop a suitable language, but also show that it has practical uses. Only by developing the software alongside realistic applications can the scheme realise its full potential. And potential users must be persuaded that the new language is effective if they are to have the confidence to take it up for themselves. Hence the four very different ventures with which the ECRC researchers are collaborating. All are in different parts of the EU, helping to counter criticisms that Esprit is tailored exclusively for the EU's richer northern members. The projects also deliberately cover different disciplines, even if the underlying software is the same, to build confidence in the new technology being developed in Munich. In London, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund is working with the ECRC to use the software for research on protein synthesis. 'The molecular biologists and physicists in London are trying to predict the structure of proteins,' explains Herold. If it works, the software should help the laboratory researchers analyse how protein molecules react under different circumstances. In Athens, the ECRC is working with Expert Systems International, a Greek software specialist, the Greek National Tourism Organisation and the University of Athens, to create a database and decision support system for visitors. Tourists will be able to combine information about their holiday time, budget and preferences with a vast domestic database. The co-operation with Dassault in France could hardly be more different. At the aerospace group's Toulouse works, the project is being tailored to the needs of a busy aircraft production line, where engineers and production staff need to work on advance scheduling for future manufacturing needs. In Venice, the ECRC is co-operating with Systems and Management, a leading Rome-based software house, to help design a new system for the city's water authorities to control pollution in one of the world's most beautiful, but also most contaminated, lagoons. The relationship between the Venice-based water magistrature and Systems and Management, predates Applause. The software house had already been working with ICL on a new language for banking software in high-performance computing. Separately, in 1991, the magistrature's anti-pollution chief, Giorgio Ferrari, received long-awaited funding to compile a voluminous database on the possible sources of pollution in the shallow, overcrowded lagoon. 'Although everyone complains about the pollution in Venice and the lack of action, the first laws recognised the need for action back in 1936,' says Ferrari. 'The problem is that although the law appears very rigid, there is an ample margin for error. We needed an instrument which would help us decide if an emission could be damaging, even if it was below the legal limit, because of its potential impact with other substances in the lagoon.' Before suggesting changes to the legislation, let alone taking draconian steps such as revoking licences for local industry, Ferrari needed a database cataloguing levels of pollution, its sources and the type of emissions pouring into the waters. The team has already completed its 'census' of potential pollutants in Porto Marghera, the big industrial complex near Mestre, Venice's industrial alter ego on the mainland. Attention has now switched to Venice itself and the neighbouring island of Murano, famous for its glass-blowers. Both are huge hazards. 'People forget that in Venice we have no drains,' points out Ferrari. That means vast quantities of human waste flow into the lagoon every day, alongside other residues from the thousands of service industries such as hotels and restaurants which make up Venice. Murano adds other pollutants such as lead and arsenic, widely used in the glass industry. The database will be supplemented by frequent chemical analysis of lagoon water and by a handful of automatic pollution sensor stations now operating experimentally. More automatic sensors would improve the coverage, but their installation remains prohibitively expensive, says Giuseppe Sardu, one of the research directors at Systems and Management. Huge processing power is required to handle the quantity of information in the database, and information from the regular water samplings, and take into account the hydraulic effects caused by the heavy tidal action in the lagoon. Once the data has been collected, Ferrari will use it alongside the new ECRC software. Combined, the two systems should make it possible to forecast pollution patterns and take decisions on any issues related to water pollution by simulating the potential environmental impact. Combining the new software with the established database 'will help us decide on granting future licences to businesses and, possibly, on revoking authorisation for others seen to be creating unmanageable pollution', says Ferrari. No software currently on the market meets such complex needs, he adds. If the research proves successful, it is precisely such a commercially viable product that the ECRC hopes to create. Says Sardu: 'We are already looking at other applications, and have identified transport fleet management as one area with considerable potential for the new language, although full-scale commercial exploitation is still probably two to three years off.'</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTHING GETS IN THE WAY OF IRVINE THEATER KICKOFF  </P> <P> By all rights, it should have been postponed.  </P> <P> But when it came time to turn the first official shovelful of dirt at the  Irvine Theatre construction site Saturday, things went off without a hitch.  </P> <P> After dozens of delays and setbacks, and 15 years of dreaming, hoping and  planning, members of the Irvine City Council and arts community, along with UC  Irvine officials, celebrated the beginning of work on the $17.6-million,  750-seat theater.  </P> <P> "We have come a long way," said UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason. "We have just  a little bit more to go. And then it will be opening night."  </P> <P> The university is one of three partners on the project. The city and the Irvine  Theatre Operating Co. are also sharing in construction and operating costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bid Higher Than Budgeted  </P> <P> Three months ago, it looked like the theater might never get built. The lowest  construction bid -- $17.6 million -- came in considerably higher than the $12.2  million that had been budgeted, which itself was almost twice as much as the $7  million originally estimated in 1983, when UC regents approved the idea of  building a theater on the campus.  </P> <P> But the Irvine City Council approved an additional $1.8 million for the theater  in December, bringing its total investment to $11.3 million. The university and  theater operating company also pledged an additional $1.8 million each,  allowing crews to actually begin work on the project before the year's end.  </P> <P> The ground-breaking ceremony was delayed until March to allow many people  involved in the planning to be able to attend, said Douglas C. Rankin, general  manager of the theater.  </P> <P> Sally Anne Sheridan, a City Council member who has worked on behalf of such a  theater since she was a community services commissioner 15 years ago, said the  theater's opening next year will be a milestone for the city. "The city is  beginning to have its soul," she said.  </P></p>

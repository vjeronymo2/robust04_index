			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno; from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President-elect Rafael Caldera has met with members  of the Presidential Committee to Reform the State [Copre] to  study constitutional reforms. Copre members have handed to the  president-elect a document containing the main reforms, which,  according to this group, should be implemented during the next  constitutional term. Three salient points are highlighted:  profound reforms of the constitution and public administration,  and decentralization.    Among the major changes are a reorganization of the Congress  of the republic, a review of the Supreme Electoral Council, and  the possible creation of a post that already exists in most  European countries; that is, that of prime minister.    [Begin Copre President Trino Marquez, as identified by  caption, recording, in progress] ...agrees with this proposal.  President Caldera told us about the need to reform the  Constitution to allow the creation of the post of prime  minister, because certain regulations restrict the relationship  between the Executive Branch and other branches; thus, a  constitutional reform is needed. This was one of his proposals.  We must firmly promote a comprehensive reform of the  Constitution. [end recording]    At any rate, the president of the Republic cannot create a  new ministry. As a last resort he could create a ministry  without portfolio, however, solely to give him advice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>   [Text] KABUL, June 26 (AFP) -- Forces loyal to Afghan  President Borhanoddin Rabbani on Sunday [26 June] stormed and  took over the final Kabul strongholds held by Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar's militia.    Hekmatyar's military presence in Kabul was crushed around  8:00am (0330 GMT) when pro-Rabbani troops stormed Maranjan Hill,  opposite the ancient fortress of Bala Hesar, an AFP  correspondent said.    The fortress in eastern Kabul was captured from Hekmatyar's  Hezb-e Eslami faction on Saturday afternoon. The pro-Rabbani  troops are led by Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, a former Afghan  defence minister who already controls much of central Kabul.    Bala Hesar and Maranjan hills were the two main strongholds  in the capital of Hekmatyar and his military ally General Abdol  Rashid Dostam. Most of the shells that have rained down on  Kabul over the past six months have been fired from there.    Sources said Hezb-e Eslami and their Uzbek allies under  General Dostam were pushed out of the Old Microrayan housing  complex below Maranjan an hour later, under pressure from  advancing infantry backed by tanks and armoured personnel  carriers.    One group of Pro-Rabbani troops on Maranjan told AFP they  had  captured around 60 Uzbek prisoners.    Mortar shells crashed into Maranjan as pro-Rabbani tanks and  men poured up the hill. "Let everyone understand the Islamic  State of Afghanistan is not weak," jubilant fighters yelled.    Tanks and guerrillas fired down onto the far eastern  outreaches of Kabul where they could see fleeing Uzbeks and  Hezb-e Eslami fighters.    General Baba Jan told AFP the president's forces would march  on neighbouring Bagrami next as part of an attempt to take  Hekmatyar's headquarters at Charasiab, 25 kilometres (15 miles)  further east.</p>

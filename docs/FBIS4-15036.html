			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 5 Apr -- Ukraine President Leonid  Kravchuk has assured Crimean Government Vice Prime Minister  Yevgeniy Saburov that in the future, visits by representives of  the leading departments of the Ukraine and the Crimea will be  made with his knowledge and be agreed upon with the leadership  of the Crimean Republic. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told  this by Valeriy Grishankov, head of the Crimean president's  staff.    It was reported earlier that a large group of top officials  of the leading ministries of the Ukraine -- the ministries of  defense, national guard, and internal affairs -- led by Anatoliy  Lopata, chief of staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, had  suddenly arrived this afternoon in the Crimea from Kiev.    The head of the Crimean president's staff also said the  reason for such a mass and unexpected visit by the top military  brass to the Crimea was explained by officials of the Ukrainian  president's staff as being a coincidence, since it turned out  that each of the generals had his own plans for the peninsula.</p>

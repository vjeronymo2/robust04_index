			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 9 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) today in Mexico City  dismissed the possibility of an immediate cease-fire  declaration, thereby rejecting the position of the organized  business leaders and Guatemalan Army. To attach utmost  importance to their position is to reduce the negotiation "to a  simple laying down of weapons by the URNG, without having  resolved any of the causes that generated and perpetuates the  armed conflict," the guerrillas said.    The Coordinating Committee of Farming, Commercial,  Industrial, and Financial Associations and Guatemalan Defense  Minister Mario Enriquez said last week that there must be a  cease-fire before the peace dialogue resumes.    In a communique broadcast in Mexico City, the URNG General  Command insisted that "a cease-fire declaration at this time  will not resolve this problem," referring to the situation in  the Central American country. The Guatemalan guerrillas also  reiterated that the creation of a Truth Commission "is not only  essential but unpostponable in view that it is a substantial  component of eradicating impunity."    The government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the  URNG are scheduled to meet in Oslo, Norway, at the end of May.  In March, they agreed that in the meeting they will discuss the  establishment and operation of this commission.    The release of the rebel document coincided with remarks by  De Leon Carpio, who in San Jose, Costa Rica, viewed as  inadvisable the creation of the commission because it might  deepen wounds and hinder the peace negotiations. For the URNG,  the president has "only one choice" and that "is to fulfill and  enforce the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and give  concrete signs of wanting to achieve progress in the  negotiation."    The government and the URNG have been engaged in a process  of  talks aimed at ending an armed conflict that, according to  humanitarian organizations, has left about 175,000 dead in 34  years.</p>

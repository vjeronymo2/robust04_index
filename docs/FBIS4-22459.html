			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Namoz Normumin, secretary of the ERK DP Council </F> in Surkhondaryo Oblast: "The Fourth ERK Congress"]    [Text]  <H5>  I. </H5>   A basic condition for the functioning of political parties  is  freedom of speech and the press. These play a basic role in  linking party administrative organs and party members through  mass information. Beginning in 1993 the ERK Party was forbidden  from publishing its own newspaper. The party chairman and other  members of the leadership operated under pressure and  persecution. Despite this the ERK Democratic Party was able to  communicate its own position to the Uzbek people through the  foreign press, and in this way attempted to preserve the  connection between the party leadership and party members.    The 4th Congress of the ERK Democratic Party took place  under  difficult conditions for the party. The appeal to the government  made at the 16 May 1993 meeting of the party central council  remained unanswered. This demonstrated once again that no  compromise is possible between the government and the opposition.    It must be said that the difficult conditions for the party  caused a state of depression among some party members. Their  lack of will and weakened beliefs caused a deviation from the  basic principles stated in the party statutes and led them to  seek a way of uniting with the present government which is  attempting to maintain the old order. I want to dwell on this  question in detail: the government, making use of the political  inconsistency of the likes of Shodi Karimov and Sodiqjon  Yigitaliyev, is acting to blacken the reputation of the ERK  party and give it a bad name among the people. The persons  mentioned above have accused ERK of an unwillingness to  compromise. Fine, in what way could there be compromise between  the government and the opposition? Specifically, what are the  conditions for compromise between the ERK Democratic Party and  the present government?    For a compromise to be reached between the government and  the  opposition their codes in the sectors of politics, economics,  and social issues would be in conformity and the government has  to consider the opposition code as a variant of its own code.  This is a normal situation in democratic countries.    As for our critics, they are ultimately thinking of  compromise in a primitive manner and see compromise in the form  of personal interest. For example, it was suggested by the  president that Muhammad Solih, chairman of the ERK Democratic  Party, be given high rank. The entrance of an opposition leader  into the government -- if it were possible to accommodate the  code of the opposition -- would make it possible to excuse him.  On the other hand, it is possible that an opposition leader  entering the government would be turned into one of today's  shadow cadres. Muhammad Solih did not accept the "high rank"  because he does not accept the government's policy of arbitrary  action and terror.    As for Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev, they have begun to  follow a path of rapprochement with the government. Undoubtedly,  their personal interests have caused this. Had Muhammad Solih  left the party ranks and they themselves became the leaders,  they would have accepted the "high rank" because, unlike  Muhammad Solih, they would not have the courage to reject rank  for belief. The historian Sh. Karimov must have planned entering  history this way all of a sudden.    I have sound reasons for saying this. Events I witnessed  personally before and after the Congress can prove it..  <H5>  II. </H5>   It was the beginning of September 1993. I was called to the  office of the chief physician; he said that presidential advisor  Mavlon Umrzokov was coming to Termez and said he wanted to meet  with me. I went to the offices of the viloyat administration at  the appointed time. Professor Sh. Karimov was waiting for me  here. He said "we came with Mavlon Umrzakov," and stressed the  word "Umrzakov." We went into a separate room and conversed. Sh.  Karimov talked about the situation which had manifested itself  in the party, and began to heap all the party's sins on Muhammad  Solih. "We have to massage the president and the governors, and  act on our own policy," said Sh. Karimov. "We have to examine  this issue at the party congress and reelect the leadership." I  understood Sh. Karimov's goal but kept my own council. If I had  protested to him or expressed my ideas openly, it would have  become known to those in this government and endangered my  participation in the congress... "The congress will resolve  everything," I said to Sh. Karimov. Our talk did not last long  "Mavlon has to hold a meeting," said Karimov. "Let us go and  join them..."    We went outside and ran into one of the viloyat leaders. "We  can talk about everything with Namoz," said Sh. Karimov. "If God  wishes, our congress will go well." I was surprised at this talk  because the date of the congress had still not been announced.  Above all, what was the connection of the viloyat head with our  congress?    We went with Sh. Karimov to the reception room of the  viloyat  governor's office where he had to meet with M. Umrzokov. We sat  down in the room. Whenever we heard a voice, Sh. Karimov rushed  outside. He would come back in and say "Mavlon still has not  arrived." This happened a number of times. Finally, they said  that M. Umrzokov had arrived. I kept sitting in my place. As for  Sh. Karimov, he said "I am ready" and hurried to the meeting  with another person. But he quickly returned and said "They said  that Mavlon is in a hurry and cannot meet with us." Sh. Karimov  and M. Umrzokov returned to Tashkent together. The fact that the  presidential advisor and Sh. Karimov traveled on the same road  together has symbolic meaning because the roads we select and  the road the present government selects are completely  different...    I found out later that during Sh. Karimov's "trip" to  Kashkadaryo the "Erkists" claimed that Samad Murod did not agree  to his proposal. At this, Sh. Karimov said "if he does not  agree, we will beat him up." Sh. Karimov kept his word. After  the Congress Samad Murod was brutally beaten. This is the true  face of Professor Sh. Karimov! "Professor"-terrorist! This event  is clear proof that he is working together with the security  organs to destroy Erk as an opposition party. In this way Sh.  Karimov also wrote a report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs  about recognizing ERK member Safar Bekjon, who is now sitting in  prison, from Ellikkala, and stated this himself at a meeting of  the Khorazm Viloyat chapter of the ERK DP.    Now "professors" like him have organized a new party. We  have  no doubt that it is an organization of KGB agents...    Before we went to the congress Jovburi Abdulhakimov, first  deputy governor of the viloyat, summoned me to his office.  Because this person had only recently been appointed to his  position we were unacquainted. "The ERK Congress should be held  soon, do you know anything about it?" he asked. I said I did  have information about it. J. Abdulhakimov talked a long time  about the president's policy. Finally, he said: "Now the  president is God, no one can stand against him...Your leaders  are insignificant next to him. Thus, my advice to you is to  think about what you do at the Congress... Recently an ERKist  professor came to Termez (he meant Sh. Karimov). If you were to  elect such a man as that to the leadership, it would be  acceptable."    The deputy governor repeatedly ordered me not to stare at  him  sullenly or look to the viloyat leaders. Naturally, I could not  protest strongly to J. Abdulhakimov. Had I done that, I would  have been imprisoned on the spot and could not have taken part  in the congress. It is true, however, that I read the letter of  party leader Muhammad Solih at the congress and bothered the  deputy governor thusly.  <H5>  III </H5>   I do not conceal the fact that, when I went to Tashkent to  take part in the congress. it was with a feeling of trepidation  that something would happen there. When Sh. Karimov and S.  Yigitaliyev had reached an arrangement with the government, I  know that they had traveled through all the viloyats. As it  became known later, none of the ERKists went to speak to them.  Talks I held with Hamidullah Nurmuhammad, secretary of the ERK  Party's Central Council, Nasrullo Said, secretary of the Bukhara  viloyat's central council, Samad Murod, secretary of the  Kashkadaryo viloyat council, and Sulaymon Murod, secretary of  the Samarkand viloyat council confirmed this. A day before the  congress a meeting of the party executive committee was held at  which Central Council secretaries and party viloyat secretaries  attended. Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev also took part in the  committee meeting. We went over the planned organization and  daily agenda. The Central Council committee decided that Council  Secretary Otanazar Oripov would open the congress and I would  read the letter of the party leader. In an article in KHALK SOZI  S. Yigitaliyev sid: "Despite the sentence passed against  Otanazar Oripov, he opened the party congress. Is this respect  for the law?" First, Professor Otanazar Oripov was judged by  lies. And then, the Central Council committee told him to chair  the congress meeting. And S. Yigitaliyev voiced no protest over  this at the committee meeting...    The congress was opened at 10 a.m. on 25 September, 1993 at  the Railroad Workers Palace of Culture in Tashkent. The  executive committee, mandate commission, and other commissions  were elected. The daily agenda was confirmed. Central Council  Secretary and Chairman Professor Otanazar Oripov read  congratulatory telegrams from leaders of political parties in  foreign countries and introduced the congress guests to the  delegates. Among the guests were Kirgizboyev of the presidential  office and representatives from the Tashkent city governate and  representatives from political parties and movements as well as  the well known poet Dadakhon Hasan and Shukhrat Ismatullayev,  cochairman of the BIRLIK people's movement. Correspondents from  the republic and foreign press came to cover the congress.    The meeting was turned over to me to read the party leader's  letter. The sociopolitical situation in the republic was briefly  analyzed in the letter, repressions directed against the  opposition were criticized, and the fact that the ERK Party will  not deviate from the road to freedom was reconfirmed.    Congress delegates listened to the letter attentively. I  have  to say that the letter added spirit to the delegates' spirit and  strength to their strength. I should add that the discussions  which began after the letter was read continued in this spirit.  All viloyat delegates, including S. Yigitaliyev, took part in  the discussions. The cochairman of the BIRLIK People's Movement  Shukhrat Ismatullayev spoke. Kirgizboyev, the responsible  official from the presidential office, gave a report for half an  hour. This is clear proof that the congress was held in a  democratic manner. Sh. Karimov's words were repudiated by the  delegates, and he was driven from the podium by prolonged  clapping and catcalls because he renounced his party principles  to the congress, found common language with the government for  his own personal interests, and had gone down the path of open  betrayal.    After a recess congress delegates discussed questions of  making changes in the party statutes. S. Yigitaliyev  participated in this actively. The powers of the party leader  were abbreviated in the statutes.    The last question was reelections to the party Central  Council. Three party members from every viloyat were elected to  the Central Council. After this the congress delegates passed on  to the question of electing the party leader. Muhammad Solih's  candidacy was endorsed unanimously and welcomed with applause.  Both Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev was taken aback by this  endorsement of Muhammad Solih. When the congress chairman asked:  "Any against or abstaining?" No one raised their hand. Why did  party members support Muhammad Solih to this extent? Because he  is the true leader of Uzbekistan's democrats. When it comes to  the question of leadership, there are many who want the job, but  few true leaders. Leaders manifest themselves not through their  own person, but through the people. The leader does not vote for  himself, the people vote for him. Sh. Karimov and S. Yigitaliyev  wanted to be leaders themselves; they came to the ERK congress  and were thrown into confusion. After this they have tried to  besmirch Muhammad Solih and the ERK Party. If the ERK Party  leader did not recognize himself in the leadership, the people  did and followed him, and no one else. Even before Uzbekistan  entered its "reconstruction" Muhammad Solih was recognized by  the people through his poems and articles on the national  struggle. If he was on Central Committee Ideology Secretary R.  Abdullayeva's "blacklist" during the time of I. Osmankhojayev,  and on Central Committee Secretary Anishchev's "blacklist during  the time of R. Nishanov, so is he now on I. Karimov's  "blacklist." As Sh. Karimov has written, after Muhammad Solih's  talent and activities became known he organized ERK.    ...The last question at the congress was electing a general  secretary of the party's Central Council. A number of party  members put forward their candidacy for the general  secretaryship. Among them were Otanazar Oripov, Ibrohim Hakkul,  Shodi Karimov, Sodikjon Yigitaliyev, Samad Murod, and myself.  Everybody but Samad Murod withdrew their candidacy and he was  elected general secretary. Why did not Sh. Karimov and S.  Yigitaliyev put up a fight for the position of general  secretary? There are a number of reasons for this. First, they  were burdened by the government with the duty of distancing  Muhammad Solih from the party leadership. They were unable to do  this at the congress. Second, had they put up their names for  the general secretaryship, they only would have received two  votes; i.e., S. Yigitaliyev would have voted for Sh. Karimov and  Sh. Karimov would have voted for S. Yigitaliyev. The congress  delegates are men of high principle and spiritual purity. A vote  by them for hypocrisy is unthinkable. When we come to Samad  Murod, who was elected general secretary of the ERK DP, he is  one of the inspired sons of the nation who has struggle for the  independence of the fatherland and democracy. Samad Murod was  put under pressure for his views and imprisoned. After having  been elected general secretary of the party, they beat him  mercilessly. Despite this, he continues to fulfill his duties.  <H5>  IV </H5>   The last decisions of the congress were ratified.    On the day after the end of the congress, I returned to  Termez. It was Sunday, the 26th of September. Later, there was a  loud knocking on my door. I opened it, and a policeman stood  there. "I am Officer Berdiyev," he said. "You are to go with me  to the court." I said: "I am not going anywhere" and sent the  policeman on his way. An hour later the chief of police  accompanied by some of his officers came and took me to the  viloyat internal affairs offices. Viloyat Chief of Internal  Affairs Colonel Sharipov and viloyat department chief of the  National Security Service Bozorov began to ask me questions. I  refused to answer their questions and demanded to meet with the  viloyat Governor Jora Noraliyev. The next morning more police  came and took me to Sharipov's office. I expressed my wish to  meet face to face with the governor. Viloyat Governor J.  Horaliyev sent Colonel Sharipov out of his office and we began  to talk. As we were talking First Deputy Governor Jovburi  Abdulhakimov came in. He had an angry face and was obviously  incensed. He did not sit down but came over to me and asked,  "You confuse me. Who gave you permission to read Muhammad  Solih's report?" I said to Governor Noraliyev "if this person  does not change his tone of voice, nothing will come out of our  talk." The deputy became even angrier: "What are you? You are  the son of a peasant. Why do you keep silent about what you are  doing?" Without saying good-bye, I left the governor's office.    The next day national security officials paid a visit to the  Termez offices of the ERK Party and removed all our papers. They  sealed the door of our offices. A few days later a trusted  friend who works in the government came to me, sayingthat they  were opening a criminal case against me and that, if I did not  leave the viloyat, I was in danger of being thrown in  prison...On 10 October I left Termez secretly.</p>

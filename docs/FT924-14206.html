			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: LTU confirms talks with Owners Abroad LTU, the German travel group, confirmed that it had talks with Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest tour operator, but said it had spoken to other companies as well. The statement by LTU follows days of speculation that a bid for Owners Abroad was imminent. Earlier this week, Owners Abroad said it received a tentative approach from a potential purchaser but that no bid had been made. The approach is thought to have been made by Airtours, the third largest UK operator. LTU said yesterday: 'We're just checking out the European market. If you're thinking about 1993, you have to talk to companies all over the place. We've spoken to Owners Abroad as we've spoken to many, many companies-and not only in England.' Asked whether LTU might offer its services as a white knight if Airtours was to bid for Owners Abroad, the German company said: 'We don't think there's anything to that.' Owners Abroad refused to comment on its attitude to a possible bid from LTU. Its shares closed up 3 1/2 p at 73p. LTU bought Thomas Cook, the travel agency, earlier this year. A move to buy a full or partial stake in a tour operator would be consistent with the current consolidation taking place in the travel market. Airtours last month purchased the Pickfords Travel agency chain from NFC, the transport group, for Pounds 16m. Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, said owning a travel agency chain would improve sales of the tour operator's holidays.</p>

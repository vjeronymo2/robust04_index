Vlasov; UDC 542.61:547.21]    [Abstract] The use of n-paraffin hydrocarbons as diluents  for alkylphosphate extractants in operations involving solutions  of spent nuclear fuel is encumbered by the separation into two  layers of the metal-containing extracts upon reaching a certain  (critical) concentration of metal (thorium, plutonium,  strontium, etc.). These layers are not water-soluble and make  the extraction process more difficult (possible disruption of  the hydrodynamics of the process and raising the danger of a  nuclear accident resulting from poor prognosis in the  accumulation of highly concentrated fissionable material in the  apparatus). Various methods are known for increasing the volume  of the extractant such as raising the temperature, introducing  aromatic compounds and alcohols, and using an isoparaffin as an  extractant diluent. Known advantages of the latter include low  freezing point, and low viscosity of products in aqueous  solutions, as compared to normal paraffins. In the present work  a study was made of dynamic viscosity and density of isoparaffin  diluents of tributyl phosphate as functions of temperature. It  was demonstrated that it is possible to raise the volume of the  extractant in respect to plutonium. Empirical relationships are  presented for computing maximum extractant volume (tributyl  phosphate in isoparaffin solvents) as functions of mobility.

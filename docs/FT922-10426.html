			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: AT&amp;T criticises Brussels rules on telecom market THE European Community was criticised yesterday for protecting its telecommunications companies from foreign competition by a senior executive of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US telecommunications group. Mr Randy Tobias, AT&amp;T's vice-chairman, said that the market to provide telecommunications services throughout the Community was largely controlled by state-owned monopolies and that these monopolies favoured 'national champions' to supply them with equipment. 'There are large numbers of both formal and informal constraints that keep markets closed,' Mr Tobias said. 'We will all be better off when we get to a fully open, competitive environment.' Mr Tobias focused his attack on the EC directive on public procurement, which he said could require telecommunications operators to buy only equipment with more than half its content made in Europe. This directive has been a bone of contention between the US and the Commission, with the former threatening sanctions if it is not altered by the end of the year. The Commission has countered by arguing that the US market is closed. Mr Tobias, however, said the US market was much more open to competition than Europe. He said AT&amp;T only had 41 per cent of the US market for telecommunications exchanges, while foreign companies had 52 per cent. By contrast, Alcatel of France had 92 per cent of the French market and Germany's Siemens had 85 per cent of its home market.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Common sense policy-making - Jeremy Kahn on an overhaul of US environmental regulation Carol Browner, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, thinks she has discovered what has been missing from US environmental policy - it's called common sense. Years of EPA anti-pollution effort have left 'a complex and unwieldy system of laws and regulations, and increasing conflict and gridlock,' says Browner, who has proposed a big shake-up in the way the agency is organised and looks at pollution. The Common Sense Initiative, announced by Browner last week, advocates looking at pollution on an industry-sector basis, rather than targeting specific pollutants. The EPA has had some successes. It has effectively banned the chemical DDT and successfully fought against asbestos. But the agency too often gets entangled in its own conflicting policies, such as supporting smokestack scrubbers that cleaned up factory air emissions but added to water contamination. Such conflict would lead to internal clashes as the water and air divisions worked at cross-purposes. Under Browner's initiative, the EPA may eventually be reorganised along industry lines with divisions representing, say, oil and gas refining or automobiles. The EPA chose six sectors for the pilot programme of Common Sense: iron and steel, electronics and computers, metal plating and finishing, automobiles, printing and oil refining. These make up 15 per cent of US gross domestic product and collectively release 345m lbs of toxic waste per year. That is 12.5 per cent of all toxic waste emissions reported to the EPA. The new strategy aims to encourage closer, more amicable contact between business groups, environmentalists and the EPA. Browner wants to make US environmental policy more proactive, with regulation based on long-term planning rather than coming in response to crises, such as the much-criticised Superfund, which provides federal funds to clean up hazardous waste. Common Sense has strong supporters, among conservation-ists and the business community. The Printing Industries of America, a national lobby group which developed its own joint anti-pollution effort with the Environmental Defence Fund, strongly endorses the EPA reforms. Mary Marra, director of the environmental quality division of the National Wildlife Federation, said the EPA changes 'are probably a good idea'. But some, including environmental groups, are sceptical. The National Audubon Society - the environmental group which led the fight to ban DDT in the late 1970s - criticises the EPA for abandoning an approach that seemed to be achieving success and for limiting the flexibility and range of future options. Maureen Hinkle, Audubon's director of agricultural policy, says: 'Some of the other approaches are being thrown in the waste basket and I don't think they should be so summarily discarded.' She also fears that environmental groups would be at a disadvantage in the time-consuming negotiations advocated under the initiative, as they lack industry groups' resources. Others, such as Greenpeace, like the sound of the new approach but worry that Browner may be pulling a public relations stunt. 'It's way too early to judge it, but I think Common Sense has great potential,' Rick Hind, legislative director for Greenpeace's toxics campaign, says. However, Greenpeace is 'dubious about the concern about minimising environmental and industry conflict,' and he adds that the best way to minimise conflict is to have a good pollution prevention programme. Browner's supporters point to her record in reforming the Superfund legislation. When talks on Superfund reauthorisation collapsed, she stepped in to get them started again to forge new compromises between the government, business and environmental groups. It is now up to Browner to convince others - including in her own agency - that Common Sense makes sense.</p>

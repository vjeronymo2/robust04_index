			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Israel holding secret talks over Golan An Israeli minister yesterday confirmed for the first time that Israel is holding secret negotiations with Syria, with the aim of reaching a peace accord involving an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who holds the housing and construction portfolio and is a close aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, compared the contacts with Syria with last year's secretive negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Oslo that led to the signing of the Israel-PLO autonomy accords in Washington last September. 'Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer confirms there were secret contacts with Syria, not at the ministerial level, but at the same echelons that led, in his words, to the dizzying success in other peace agreements,' the radio reported. Over the last few weeks, the Israeli media has carried a stream of reports of secret contacts, quoting anonymous government officials saying negotiations are being personally overseen by Mr Rabin, assisted by the army's chief of staff Gen Ehud Barak and intelligence chief Uri Saguy, with Israel's ambassador to Washington, Mr Itamar Rabinovitch, and his Syrian counterpart Mr Walid al-Muallam serving as intermediaries. Israeli opposition leaders have charged that a deal is already close to completion, and that Mr Rabin has agreed in principle to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights strategic ridge in exchange for fully normalised relations with Damascus. Publicly, Mr Rabin has offered to sanction a 'significant' withdrawal from the Golan, after a three-year test period of normalised relations with Syria, but has neither confirmed nor denied that he is ready to approve a complete pullout. Members of Mr Rabin's Labour party yesterday held an ill-tempered debate on the issue of the Golan, at which the prime minister and Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, angrily criticised a small minority of Knesset members who are vowing to fight a Golan pullback. While confirming that contacts with the Syrians were taking place, Mr Ben-Eliezer told Israel Radio yesterday that they were not at the ministerial level. The Israeli army has set up a unit to remove obdurate Jewish settlers from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights, according to the Ma'ariv newspaper yesterday.</p>

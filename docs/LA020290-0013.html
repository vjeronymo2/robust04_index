			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS CUP;  </P> <P> U.S. SUBS ARE READY FOR MEXICO  </P> <P> If this is the Davis Cup, there must be turmoil, so leave it to the United  States to get the ball rolling.  </P> <P> The U.S. team, which hasn't won the Davis Cup in eight years, starts searching  for it again today at La Costa as the heavy favorite in a first-round match  against Mexico.  </P> <P> But first, some questions need answering:  </P> <P>  -- Where's Andre Agassi?  </P> <P> Probably color-coordinating his shirts at home in Las Vegas, where he chose to  remain after being passed over. Then, afforded the chance to reconsider, Agassi  just said no.  </P> <P>  -- Where's John McEnroe?  </P> <P> Certainly not in Australia or posing for any airport photos, not after his  wallet was $6,500 lighter because of fines and after he poked his finger at a  photographer at LAX upon his return home. McEnroe doesn't play Davis Cup  first-rounders, anyway.  </P> <P>  -- Where are Ken Flach and Robert Seguso?  </P> <P> Earlier this week, they were in Abilene, Tex., playing a doubles exhibition.  They were not preparing for Davis Cup because the Ken and Bob Show is off the  air after absorbing its first Davis Cup loss last summer in West Germany.  </P> <P> "We lose one lousy match . . . " said Seguso.  </P> <P>  -- Where are Rick Leach and Jim Pugh?  </P> <P> They were up there on the dais at Thursday's draw, introduced by referee Javier  Sansierra of Spain as "Leets" and "Poog."  </P> <P>  -- Where's Chucky Adams?  </P> <P> In keeping with the theme of this Davis Cup, practice player Adams got his big  break here. He broke a bone in his foot, joining Michael Chang, who has a  separated bone in his hip, and Aaron Krickstein, who has a pulled groin, on the  U.S. all-hospital team.  </P> <P> All set? Let's play ball. Jay Berger plays the first singles match today at  noon against Jorge Lozano, followed by Brad Gilbert against Leonardo Lavalle.  The four will switch opponents Sunday after Leach and Pugh play Lozano and  Lavalle in Saturday's doubles match.  </P> <P> Half of the U.S. team is new, or at least different from the squad originally  selected. When Chang and Krickstein could not play because of injuries, U.S.  captain Tom Gorman named Gilbert and Berger to replace them.  </P> <P> But to many, the real question is not who is playing, but how long it will  take. A 5-0 sweep? Let's just say the United States is confident.  </P> <P> When he was named to play against Mexico as a substitute for Chang, Gilbert  said four or five different U. S. teams could beat Mexico. He was more  conservative Thursday when asked about American prospects.  </P> <P> "I like our chances," Gilbert said. "I think even though this is the  replacement team, we are not quite like the scout football players. I see  things looking good for us."  </P> <P> For Mexico then, the view must not be quite so good. Coach Antonio Palofax  acknowledged that his players would be bucking difficult odds.  </P> <P> "For us to win, yes, it would be an upset, but there is always a chance," he  said.  </P> <P> Gilbert, who has experienced difficulty with Lavalle, has at least already  swamped him in the rankings. Gilbert is No. 4 in the world, Lavalle No. 157.  </P> <P> Lavalle is 3-1 against Gilbert but lost to him in 1986 in their only previous  Davis Cup encounter.  </P> <P> Berger has not played Lavalle or Lozano. He is ranked No. 11 in the world, and  Lozano is No. 348. Named to the team only last Saturday after Krickstein was  forced to pull out and Agassi passed on Gorman's invitation, Berger arrived  Sunday at La Costa, only five days before his match.  </P> <P> "I don't care if I had to travel three times around the world, I'd be here to  play," Berger said.  </P> <P> What they're playing on is a medium-fast hardcourt, resurfaced a couple of  weeks ago. The legendary Pancho Segura, La Costa's director of tennis, believes  the surface will favor neither team.  </P> <P> His pick?  </P> <P> "I only hope that it is 1-1 after the first day so there is a lot of  excitement," Segura said. "Then, as you know, anything can happen in Davis  Cup."  </P> <P> Davis Cup Notes  </P> <P> The displaced doubles team of Ken Flach and Robert Seguso is gone, but not  forgotten, at least for this round. Seguso believes that Rick Leach and Jim  Pugh will do all right in their Davis Cup debut Saturday. "They're a very good  team," he said. "They're very eager. That's what doubles are all about -- all  eagerness. I'm sure they shouldn't have too much trouble." Flach said he  understood when U. S. Captain Tom Gorman told him he was turning to Leach and  Pugh to get them some Davis Cup experience. . . . If the U. S. team beats  Mexico this weekend, its second-round opponent is expected to be  Czechoslovakia, which plays Switzerland this weekend. "I'll miss La Costa,"  Flach said. "I told Gorman, 'Let us play La Costa and send Leach and Pugh to  Czechoslovakia.' "  </P></p>

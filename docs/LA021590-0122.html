			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN CELEBRATES CLARK MARK;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS: THE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE FUZZY, BUT IF BILL WALTON'S SEASON  SCORING RECORD ISN'T OFFICIALLY GONE YET, IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BE FRIDAY.  </P> <P> With 10 seconds remaining in the Christian High boys' basketball game at  Coronado Wednesday night, Christian's Tony Clark was taken out of the game,  given a standing ovation and congratulated for breaking Bill Walton's  20-year-old section season scoring record.  </P> <P> Clark had made two free throws with 24 seconds left to bring his game total to  36 points, which by most accounts had taken him past Walton's 960 for a season.  </P> <P> Following Christian's 66-50 victory, which tied Coronado for first place (at  5-2) in the Harbor League with a game to play, the celebration of Clark's  accomplishment continued.  </P> <P> Kids were asking him to sign their tennis shoes, pictures were being taken, and  people were chanting "Tony, Tony."  </P> <P> There's a slight catch, but one Clark should take care of easily in his final  regular-season game against Clairemont Friday. In the statistics kept by  Christian, Clark had 925 entering the game, needing 36 to break Walton's  record. Statistics kept by The Times had him needing just 35 to break. But one  other statistical source had him needing 37, saying that Christian had wrongly  credited him with a basket not included in the home scorebook for a game at  Santana way back on Dec. 13; the home book is official for record purposes.  </P> <P> Whatever. Christian (12-10 overall) decided to celebrate Clark's accomplishment  Wednesday, and the first few minutes of Friday's game will almost certainly  eliminate any doubt.  </P> <P> Clark, who is averaging 44.1 points a game, had only scored 22 points in the  first three quarters but added 14 in the fourth.  </P> <P> "Coronado had to give up something," Christian Coach Randy Wright said. "When  the score got spread out eight to 10 points, they had to play more straight up.  When people play straight up, the worst he's done is 49 points."  </P> <P> Coronado used a box-and-one defense, but when Adam Smith collected his fourth  foul in the third quarter, Clark was able to take avantage of the situation.  </P> <P> "The kids did a good job on defense but then kept thowing the ball away,"  Coronado Coach Bob Stanton said.  </P> <P> Clark said his main concern was winning the game, not Walton's record.  </P> <P> "I never had any idea how many points I had," Clark said. "If I did it, I did  it. It didn't make any difference. I was more interested in the 'W' "  </P> <P> Christian took a 20-14 lead after a quarter and never trailed. Coronado fell to  15-8, 5-2 in the league.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Ministry  of Foreign Affairs today expressed hope that Tsutomu Hata's  election as Japan's prime minister will promote "the positive  development of the whole range of bilateral relations and  consistent and constructive movement toward genuine partnership  and good-neighbourliness on the basis of the strategic policy  laid down during the Russian-Japanese summit meetings."    In a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, a  high-ranking official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation reaffirmed Moscow's immutable policy toward  the development of comprehensive relations with Japan on the  basis of the Tokyo Declaration adopted during Russian President  Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October. Koji Watanabe,  Japan's ambassador to Russia, expressed a similar stand in a  recent interview to ITAR-TASS.    The Russian diplomat recalled that during Tsutomu Hata's  visit to Moscow last month while in the posts of deputy prime  minister and minister of foreign affairs, "the positive mood  that has been predominant in Russian-Japanese relations recently  was very clearly demonstrated".    The foreign ministry official noted that the two sides "face  a major task to fill in specific details to the agreements  reached in Tokyo last October and to bring them to a practical  level." He expressed hope that "this work will succeed through  joint efforts in line with the key interests of the Russian and  the Japanese people."    The Russian diplomat said that "active political dialogue  with Japan, including top level contacts, will help" to achieve  these aims. He recalled that an invitation to visit Russia was  handed to the Japanese prime minister last October and confirmed  in March; it remains in force despite the change of government  in Japan. Bearing in mind that the Russian head of state  visited Japan last year, the diplomat said, it is now the turn  of the Japanese.    According to the high-ranking official from the Russian  Foreign Ministry, "there is every reason to look with optimism  at the future of Russian-Japanese relations, even though both  sides will naturally have to make intense efforts to further  these relations -- a point on which the two countries see eye to  eye."</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: An army undaunted by the smell of stale socks  -Away from the TV lights, a gritty and gruelling general election campaign is being fought IN constituencies across the country, the election contest is being co-ordinated from cramped, dishevelled offices smelling faintly of mildew and stale socks, by men and women poring over ward maps and electoral registers. A sharp-suited agent clutching a mobile phone is popping in and out. The lavatory reading matter is usually restricted to booklets with titles like 'Campaigning in the 1990s'. Staple ingredients include candidates trudging affably from door-to-door, or from old-people's home to shopping precinct, pressing the flesh and trying to sound interested, getting close enough to see the whites of constituents' eyes. They include armies of volunteers folding leaflets, licking envelopes and sticking on stamps. They include adoption meetings in dingy school assembly halls reeking of polish with the caretaker rattling his keys in the background. Strict legal limitations on election expenditure at local level have superficially kept changes to a minimum in the humdrum often dreary business of trying to win a Westminster seat. But it would be a mistake to be fooled by the tawdry trappings. In the best campaign teams, there is no shortage of innovation; the grimy net curtains obscure a carefully co-ordinated strategy where resources are deployed with military precision. One important recent development is the availability of increasingly sophisticated computing and desk-top publishing packages at affordable prices. These are used to prepare spreadsheets and lists, and produce ever more imaginative promotional literature. Mr Greville Janner, defending Leicester West for Labour, addresses the Asian voters in his constituency in four different languages: Hindi, Urdu, Gujurati and English. One Labour candidate defending a Scottish seat intends to send a personally addressed letter to each of the 5,000 or so professed Scottish National Party supporters in his constituency. Mr Kevin Lomax, Labour candidate for Dudley West, has taken to sending constituents letters instead of leaflets - 'because we know they (leaflets) tend to be thrown straight in the bin.' In Basildon, Labour's agent Ms Linda Webb has made it a priority to catch up with the Tories in terms of electronic power. 'We spend our money on technology rather than on the fabric of the building,' she says, staring at the tumbledown campaign headquarters. A consequence of this growing dependence on computers is an increased emphasis on security. The Cheltenham Liberal Democrats have their main computer securely locked up in the candidate's house and not at party headquarters. This reduces the risk of break-ins, says Mr David Figeon, the local agent. Candidates are also continually honing their canvassing and targeting techniques. Many are intending to exploit the lighter evenings produced by last weekend's clock change to indulge in an extra hour's nightly campaigning, extending their evening forays until 9pm. In Amber Valley, the Tory team of Phillip Oppenheim, who is defending the seat, arrives in a road in its Volkswagen battlebus. Anyone wishing to raise an issue on the doorstep is immediately notified to the candidate, who spends about five minutes talking and taking details. He has a his own special blue form for waverers: a mini-questionnaire asking them to tick boxes to indicate why they are hesitating. Labour's Derby campaign headquarters has produced a detailed booklet of instructions to campaigners. The doorstep question has changed from the old formula in which a candidate or assistant asked: 'Can I rely on your vote?' Now the question is more likely to be a much gentler 'Have you thought which way you are voting?' or 'Which party do you normally support?'. Face-to-face debates, often arranged by religious groups, are a feature of the campaign in a number of constituencies. The involvement of central party organisations is increasing too - especially in the marginals. Conservative Central Office says many London constituencies have joined a central printing scheme for the sake of economies of scale. At a recent Tory rally in Battersea attended by party members from throughout London, a selection of artwork 'cleared by the Research Department' was available, for use on 'any leaflets you might be considering'. So orchestrated is Labour's Greater London masterplan that the party pulled workers out of safe seats at the weekend to concentrate on marginal constituencies. With a close race in prospect the routine for getting the vote out on polling day is likely to be pursued more ruthlessly and single-mindedly than ever before. The Derby Labour instructions say: 'Knocking-up continues throughout the day, if necessary calling on the same people over and over again.' They even advise knocker-ups to volunteer to baby-sit so that mothers can leave their family to vote. Additional reporting by David Marsh and Roger Matthews</p>

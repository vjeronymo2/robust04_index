			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Tighter rules on university status Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday tightened the criteria that higher education institutions must meet to achieve university status. He told the Higher Education Quality Council, the self-regulating body, that institutions would need to have taught degree courses to at least three year-groups - taking five years in total for three-year courses - before they could award degrees in their own right. They would then need a track record of not less than three years of 'successfully maintaining degree standards'. Only about five or six higher education colleges are interested in becoming universities.</p>

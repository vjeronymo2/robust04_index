			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr rebels likely to claim first blood in family feud The rebel shareholders of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust were ready to claim first blood today in the family feud over the future of the motor and leisure group. Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, seemed likely to lose the vote on the board's proposals to reform the two-tier share structure at its EGM in Leeds. The company is understood to have received proxy votes representing more than 50 per cent of ordinary voting shares from the rebels, led by Mr Barr's nephews, Nicholas and Robert Barr. They have pledged to vote down the board's plans to enfranchise the non-voting A shares, owned almost entirely by institutional shareholders. The Barr brothers have called on their uncle to step down as chairman, as part of their strategy to run the group's two divisions as stand-alone businesses. They have also requisitioned their own EGM next week to unseat Mr Brian Parker, the chief executive and Mr Brian Small, the finance director. Negotiations between the warring parties failed to arrive at a compromise yesterday, despite an earlier offer from Malcolm Barr to resign as chairman. The brothers yesterday announced they had changed the trustees holding their own shares, after discovering that their previous trustee also held shares for Mr Parker and Mr Small. Nicholas and Robert Barr, who are the sons of the late managing director Stuart Barr, speak for almost 30 per cent of ordinary shares. Malcolm Barr, who is also the outgoing chairman of Leeds Permanent Building Society, owns 16 per cent of the ordinary shares.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (11): Topics in the next issue - Software at Work / Readers' response to 'feedback survey' THIS issue of Software At Work deals with two main subjects: project management (PM) and electronic data interchange, EDI. These two 'user topics,' topped the voting list of topics in our recent 'feedback' report from readers. As a result, we have held over our third topic - rapid application development - until our summer issue in June. We have taken note of your preferences, and covered both PM and EDI extensively in this issue, as well as replacing Desktop publishing with Teleworking as a topic for our next issue. We would also wish to thank readers who took the trouble to reply to the Feedback Survey, as the votes have given us valuable guidance. Replies are still coming in, following our winter issue, (December 6, 1992). We intend to do a full analysis, and report on the full results. The next issue of Software At Work in June will look at: Teleworking (see details, right). Facilities Management and outsourcing. Rapid Applications Development, (held over from the March issue). Teleworking has appeared on the agenda of many companies wishing to cut down office overheads, and make staff in the field more effective. The increasing power of laptop and personal computers has been accompanied by software which has become easier to use, and therefore more practical for 'sit-alone' users. We are looking for stories which demonstrate positive business benefits in teleworking. Facilities management deals with another move outside, as large computer-users divest themselves of in-house IT operations. Companies are contracting-out to FM specialists with the aim of concentrating on the core business. The first two 'user' topics, follow the usual pattern of interviewing users of various products and services. Users and suppliers wishing to participate in the survey should contact Software At Work at the following address, stating which topic is of interest and requesting the relevant forms.

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA ATTEMPTS TO GRAPPLE WITH 18.5% INFLATION  </P> <P> China, struggling to stem record inflation and public unrest over the spiraling  cost of living, announced a series of measures today to restore central  government price controls that were dropped under the country's economic  reforms.  </P> <P> The measures, the latest taken by the government in a sweeping retrenchment of  the market-oriented reforms launched by senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978,  were announced by a Chinese official at a meeting of the ongoing session of  China's Parliament.  </P> <P> The package included a ban on local governments' approving price hikes without  authorization from Beijing. The meeting was reported by the official New China  News Agency.  </P> <P> Price reform -- ending artificially set low prices and allowing the market to  reflect major commodity prices -- has proven the most controversial of the  economic reforms. Although giving incentive to producers, it has contributed to  record inflation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vast Consumer Demand  </P> <P> Inflation, unknown in China until recent years, ran officially at 18.5% last  year and is estimated unofficially at more than 30%, in part reflecting vast  consumer demand on a still-inefficient supply system and erratic monetary  policies.  </P> <P> Premier Li Peng, in a speech Monday to the opening session of the National  People's Congress, the nominal legislature, called inflation the key problem  the country faces and warned of several years of tighter central control and  austerity.  </P> <P> At an NPC session today, Ma Kai, vice director of the State Price  Administration, said the State Council, China's cabinet, would set "price  control goals" for provincial and local governments.  </P> <P> At the same time, he said, officials would "concentrate pricing power in the  central government," adding that no local government would be allowed to  approve price hikes on goods without State Council authorization.  </P> <P> The measures also include efforts to increase the supply of daily necessities,  tighten controls on prices of energy, raw materials and agriculture-oriented  products, possibly through price ceilings, and establish a system by which  local governments would apply in advance to hike prices of major commodities.  </P></p>

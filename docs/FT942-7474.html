			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Towles still in red Towles, the clothing manufacturer, saw losses increase from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 236,000 in the year to February 28. The result was disappointing, directors said, mainly because of a poor performance at HE Godkin's leisure wear activities. The company was also the main factor in group turnover falling to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 16.2m). Losses per share were 7.71p (4.38p) but the board proposes to maintain the single, final payment of 0.25p.</p>

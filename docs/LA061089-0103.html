			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Oakland Athletics slugger Jose Canseco, the American League's most valuable  player in 1988, will plead no contest to gun charges and will get rid of the  Jaguar linked to many of his recent troubles, according to one of his  attorneys.  </P> <P> "He's not going to fight the courts," Michael Stepanian said. "He's got the  pennant to fight for."  </P> <P> Canseco was cited for driving the 1989 car at more than 125 m.p.h. on a Florida  freeway and for running a red light in Phoenix. He is also accused of having  illegally carried a loaded handgun on the floor of the car in Berkeley.  </P> <P> A formal plea agreement in the gun case, which likely will include payment of a  fine, is expected in a few weeks, Stepanian said.  </P></p>

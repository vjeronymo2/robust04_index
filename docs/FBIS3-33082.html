"The German Government's position is widely known, as we  oppose that EU decision," said Schafer, making statements to the  press after meeting with Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro.    The German vice chancellor, who arrived in Managua the night  of 13 February for a three-day visit to this country, mentioned  that Germany filed a recourse last year at the former European  Community Court of Justice requesting that the application of  the trade quota for bananas be suspended.    The new EU import regulations, effective since July 1993,  set  the Latin America importation quota at 2 million tons (108  million boxes), 500,000 less than the previous year.    "The German Government opposes this kind of EU decision and  has filed a recourse at the Court of Justice to revoke it and  rebroaden the markets for bananas, which is something we want,"  Vice Chancellor Schafer said. He did not comment on the recent  GATT ruling condemning the importation quota, however.    The Union of Banana-Exporting Countries (UPEB), which  consists of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Panama, Guatemala,  Colombia, and Honduras, termed the GATT resolution as important,  because it allows the strengthening of its position to seek a  compatible commercial agreement between the EU and Latin America.</p>

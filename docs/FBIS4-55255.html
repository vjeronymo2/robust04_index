			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- If their offensive on  the Serb town of Brcko fails, the Bosnian Muslims are planning  to cause an ecologic catastrophe by blowing up the chemical  facilities in Tuzla (northern Bosnia), Belgrade POLITIKA said on  Thursday. The Tuzla chemical works are similar to that in the  Indian town of Bopal which caused the death of 2,500 people and  seriously injured 150,000.    Tuzla is held by the Muslims who have over the past few days  been massing major forces in the south and southwest of this  city, also confirmed by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  spokesman in Sarajevo on Wednesday.    The Seventh Brigade of the Bosnian army, well-known for its  fundamentalism and lightening-speed offensives, has been  transferred to the Kladanj-Olovo region (south of Tuzla) in  preparation of military actions in this region, REUTER said.    The threat of an `ecologic strike' from Tuzla could be a  desperate measure since poisons cannot tell the difference  between one's own army and civilians and those of the enemy, the  Belgrade paper said. Another possibility is that NATO would  fulfill Muslim expectations and help them if they are  unsuccessful, as in the case of Gorazde.    The Muslims could blow up several tanks containing poison  substances and, in keeping with the already proven scenario and  with the support of the Western media, blame the Serbs and then  ask for NATO's help, POLITIKA said. The threats by the Tuzla  Muslims would cause the death of thousands of people and  seriously hurt over hundreds of thousands.    Before the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia, Tuzla was a  major center of the chemical industry which had stores amounting  to about 1,300 tonnes of chlorine, 1,100 tonnes of ammonium, 60  tonnes of sulfuric acid and 3 tonnes of phosgene.    The release of chlorine into the atmosphere would threaten  life in an area ranging from 1.5km - 76 km, while the ammonium  would affect an area from 1 km - 28 km depending on the weather,  POLITIKA learned from Dusan Rajic, a contamination expert of the  Yugoslav army's techinical institute in Belgrade.    The use of phosgene would affect only the centre of the city  or the cite from where it was released. Those who are  threatening to cause an ecologic catastrophe could use this  element since, by sacrificing their own people, they would  achieve their aims -- to force international military aid, Rajic  said.    The Muslims have already applied this scenario of  sacrificing  their own people to turn the international public against the  Serbs. Last year they caused the massacre in the Vase Miskina  Street in Sarajevo, while this year they caused the death of  innocent civilians at Sarajevo's Markale Market in the same way.    Both times the aim was achieved -- the international  community reacted with lightning speed and blamed the Serbs.  Subsequent reports by UNPROFOR representatives about who was  really to blame had no effect.</p>

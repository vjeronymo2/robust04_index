			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Sharp drop in executives' pay rises ALMOST 15 per cent of private-sector employers froze the pay of their executives while average pay awards for executives fell sharply in the third quarter of this year, according to IDS, the independent pay research group. Pay awards for executives averaged 4 per cent in the three months to October compared with 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter, the group says in its survey of more than 105 organisations. Pay awards for all staff in the private sector averaged 4 per cent in October and November. In its survey IDS says: 'Economic uncertainty and the recession have had a dramatic impact, leading to a sharp fall in the general level of salary increases.' The survey adds to the evidence that a recent spate of very large pay rises for executives runs counter to the norm. The survey, by the IDS Top Pay Unit, shows that executives continue to win pay rises above the rate of inflation. The Treasury forecast in the Autumn Statement that underlying inflation, measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage-interest payments, would be at 3.75 per cent by the end of this year and would rise at the same average rate next year. At a large employer which awarded the highest rise among the companies in the survey, junior and middle managers received a salary increase of 4.5 per cent, as well as individual merit increases averaging 2.5 per cent. Leadership is only the fifth most important characteristic of a good top manager, a survey suggested yesterday. Most important was ability to manage change, said the report on more than 1,000 private-sector and public-sector bodies questioned by management consultancy Kinsley Lord. Next was enabling staff to make best use of their skills and improve performance. IDS Top Pay Unit Review 142. IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

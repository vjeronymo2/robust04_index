			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling unmoved by rate cut STERLING was virtually unmoved against both the D-Mark and the US dollar yesterday, after Britain's chancellor announced that UK base rates would be cut by 1 percentage point from today, writes James Blitz. However, the French franc derived considerable support from the Bank of France's decision to cut its two main dealing rates for the second time in ten days. According to one analyst, yesterday's moves may have set the scene for the franc to appreciate against the D-Mark well into next year. The 100 basis point cut in UK base rates had been generally priced into sterling's exchange rates before the statement. The pound was at DM2.4105 at the start of Mr Lamont's speech, rose to DM2.4150 by the end, and later closed at DM2.4200, more than  1/2 a pfennig up on the day. Against the dollar, the pound closed slightly weaker at Dollars 1.5240. But this was more the product of dollar strength than an instantly negative response to the chancellor's statement. Mr John Hall, an international economict at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, said that the government had given so many steers on the content of the speech that there was little for the market to react to. 'The amount of fiscal stimulus was exactly what was anticipated, and the pound could even show a little upside following these moves,' he said. However, Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said that the chancellor showed less commitment to economic growth than he had expected, and that sterling could weaken further before the end of the year. 'Underlying institutional money is desperate to find a home where there is economic growth,' he said. 'But the message of the statement was that Britain is not moving fast enough in that direction.' The rise in the public sector borrowing requirement would also make the market wary about the increased supply of government bonds, which may weaken sterling's exchange rate in the longer term. Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros, was particularly bearish about the pound's prospects. 'The chancellor was tinkering at the edges rather than getting to the heart of the problem,' he said. 'There was nothing significant in the chancellor's package, and much about which one could cast doubt.' He expects sterling to dip below the floor of its current range, DM2.40 to the D-Mark, before the end of the year. The French franc continued to rise against the D-Mark in spite of the Bank of France's decision to cut its two key lending rates yesterday. The franc closed at FFr3.3740 to the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.381. The French currency's rise has prompted speculation that the hard currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism - including the D-Mark and French Franc - will move to narrower bands next year.</p>

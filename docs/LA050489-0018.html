			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DEPECHE MODE 101' IS AN OIL-WATER MIXTURE THAT TREATS BAND UNFAIRLY  </P> <P> Depeche Mode is a fascinating pop group, and director D. A. Pennebaker can be  an interesting musical documentarian, but their pairing proves to be a classic  oil-and-water mismatch in "Depeche Mode 101."  </P> <P> The oil here is teen-favorite Depeche Mode, an English synthesizer group that  combines deep and unremittingly dark themes with slick, pre-programmed,  ominously compelling dance music. The water is unslick, spontaneity-loving  Pennebaker and his film collaborators, David Dawkins and Chris Hegedus, who  never once attempt to delve below the service to peek at what substance might  lie beneath. The result makes the band and its young followers look much, much  sillier than they deserve.  </P> <P> Pennebaker's documentary technique is usually to let the hand-held cameras roll  and trust that something interesting will happen. When you're filming a roving  Bob Dylan at the peak of his powers, as Pennebaker did in "Don't Look Back,"  catching interesting things is a given. But figuring out what makes reticent  Depeche Mode or its rabid following tick would take a bit more work -- work  that hasn't even been attempted in this remarkably unrevealing product.  </P> <P> The grainy "101" intercuts between uneven but great-sounding concert footage,  scenes of backstage banality with the band and its crew and scenes of an even  more banal crop of East Coast teen-agers who have been hired to follow the tour  out West on a bus, especially for the film. If the point was to deflate Depeche  Mode's godlike standing among its fans, or to portray those fans as uneducated,  trendy twerps who have no idea what the music is all about, it's been well  accomplished here. But one suspects that there is no point, or point of view,  to all this random cinema verite.  </P> <P>  Depeche Mode is not yet a national superstar act, but in some cities,  especially Los Angeles, where a Rose Bowl concert in June drew more than  60,000, Mode mania resembles Beatlemania at its peak. Indeed, at a screening  for radio contest-winners earlier this week, female screams rendered the first  few minutes of the loudly projected film inaudible. A quick flash of singer  David Gahan in his underwear almost brought down the house.. A few scant  moments in "101" capture fans' sexual/philosophic mania in something close to a  meaningful context, like one extended, telling shot of a hysterical girl  shouting along with the bitter lyrics of "Blasphemous Rumours," which includes  the chorus: "I think God's got a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect  to find him laughing." (Watching Gahan exhort the crowd to sing and clap along  with dour ditties, you may intuit that someone besides the Almighty has a sick  sense of humor.)  </P> <P> But Pennebaker, Dawkins and Hegedus query neither band nor followers about the  content or appeal of the music. One former Pennebaker subject, Dylan, used to  sing about a Mr. Jones who knew something was happening around him but didn't  quite know what it was; this time, Pennebaker seems to be that Mr. Jones. What  a waste of a phenomenon.  </P> <P>  "Depeche Mode 101" opens Friday at the AMC MainPlace in Santa Ana, playing  Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays only. Information: (714) 972-8500.  </P> <P> </P></p>

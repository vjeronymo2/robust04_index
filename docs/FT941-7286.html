			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better to lock in directors with options - or offer them a riskier route? (2) Sir, Mr Alan Judes (Letters, February 19) laments that the value of share options is not made clear at the time they are granted. But is he not asking for the impossible? Even if, as he suggests, 'the value of traded options is reported on a daily basis', it is misleading to suggest that the application of a standard valuation formula (such as Black &amp; Scholes) to directors' remuneration will move corporate governance any further forward. The real problem with share options is that no one really knows what they will be worth. Executives and companies alike quite rightly take the view that at the time of grant the value lies in an as yet unrealised prospect of gain. The solution lies not in the 'proper disclosure of the value of the option grants' but in changing the role of shares in long-term incentive schemes for top management. By granting shares (not options) on the basis of the company's performance and then locking up those shares for a holding period, the company can show a real prospective value to both executive and shareholders. This arrangement, unlike share options, makes a shareholder of the executive who, like other investors, will lose money if the share price falls. The larger companies are now replacing directors' share options with this kind of scheme, so the joke of it is that by the time the accounting standards board finally determines a basis for disclosing the value of share options in the report and accounts, share options may no longer represent a significant part of directors' remuneration packages.

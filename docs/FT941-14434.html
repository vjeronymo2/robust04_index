			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: London Scottish Bank 18% ahead to Pounds 4.54m London Scottish Bank, the consumer finance company, announced an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the year to the end of October 1993. The company highlighted the restoration of profitability in consumer credit in taking their pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.54m compared with Pounds 3.85m in the previous year. Income from interest on loans rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 19.59m (Pounds 18.96m), while commission on debt collecting rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 6.41m (Pounds 5.51m). Finance costs for funding lending fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 2.62m), as a result of low interest rates. In August, the company bought a debt portfolio from RLJ Finance, which includes debts spread over a period of a few years. Income from debt portfolios acquired came to Pounds 333,500. Income from the sale of Christmas hampers, which rose sharply in the previous year to make a marked contribution to profits, was down slightly to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.16m). There was, however, a slight fall in insurance income to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 3.84m). Mr Jack Livingstone, chairman, emphasised the efficiency improvements that the company, which makes consumer loans and collects debts on behalf of other companies, had made at the worse performing of its 106 branches, and also the investment it had made in a new computer system. Mr Livingstone also announced his intention to retire in March 1995, and the appointment then of Mr Martin West, the chief executive, as chairman. Mr Livingstone will be a non-executive director after he steps down. The bank is already looking for a new chief executive and hopes someone will be in place in October to begin a transitional period. The whole executive team is due to retire over the next few years. 'There are a lot of wrinklies on the board now,' Mr Livingstone said. The board proposes an increase of 15 per cent in the final dividend to 2.37p (2.05p) making a 3.4p (3p) total. The shares put on 6p to 112p.</p>

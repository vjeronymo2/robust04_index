			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Food and Drug Administration chemist was charged with accepting cash payments  from companies whose products need FDA approval, and a pharmaceutical executive  was charged with giving an illegal gratuity to an FDA employee, federal  prosecutors said. "These charges represent the first of what I expect to be a  series of prosecutions against government employees, consultants and  pharmaceutical concerns and their executives," U.S. Atty. Breckinridge Willcox  said. The charges stemmed from an ongoing investigation of the FDA's Division  of Generic Drugs in Rockville, Md., which is responsible for the review and  approval of applications submitted by manufacturers seeking to market generic  drugs.  </P></p>

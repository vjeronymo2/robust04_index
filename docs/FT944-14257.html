			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Depositary Receipts One of the fastest growing businesses for London-based investment banks has passed a small milestone. Tuesday marked the start of trading in the first Global Depositary Receipts listed on the London Stock Exchange. GDRs are negotiable certificates representing shares traded on exchanges not easily accessible to foreign investors. By issuing shares in GDR form, tradeable in major financial centres, the sponsor can offer the liquidity that foreign institutions need. Although smaller than the long-established American Depositary Receipts market, the less demanding listing requirements for GDRs provide a cheap and easy way to tap international investors and have proved increasingly popular with emerging economy companies. Since the first GDRs were issued in 1990, more than 100 companies, a third of them Indian, have raised a total of over Dollars 10bn. Last week's issue sponsored by Merrill Lynch was fairly typical, raising Dollars 40m for India's second largest hotels group, East India Hotels. Much of the business is done from London, with Goldman Sachs and Robert Fleming the leading sponsors, and 90 depositary receipts are already traded via SEAQ International. But they have until now been listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In August, the London Stock Exchange changed its rules to allow GDRs to be listed. The move, part of the London exchange's campaign to attract more international companies, is to be welcomed, though it is odd it has taken four years.</p>

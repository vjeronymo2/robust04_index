			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLARK LEADS PADRES PAST ASTROS, 10-2  </P> <P> With one powerful swing of the bat, Jack Clark not only sent a ball over the  Astrodome fence Monday night, he began to openly cleanse himself of the  confusion and frustration that has stalked him through the worst start of his  13-year career.  </P> <P> The two-run homer was only part of a 10-2 Padre victory that ended the Houston  Astros' club-record 10-game winning streak and broke a three-game Padre losing  streak.  </P> <P> But after the game, Clark didn't want to talk so much about the home run, his  first since May 16, as his he did about what has gone through his mind the past  few months.  </P> <P> His off-season trade to the Padres from the New York Yankees was supposed to be  a new start, instead it began as the worst time in his baseball life. Not  because of San Diego, not because of the Padres, not because of the fans, but  because of what was swirling in his mind.  </P> <P> "Coming over here was a breath of fresh air, but it doesn't last forever,"  Clark said. "They expect you to hit. Where are the results? I felt bad for Jack  (McKeon) and for the fans. I felt bad for San Diego.  </P> <P> "I probably was not enjoying baseball as much as ever."  </P> <P> On the field, Clark was struggling. A .273-career hitter, his average stood at  .193 on May 24. That was before he started a 10-game hitting streak (15 for 37)  that has raised his average to .240, his highest of the season.  </P> <P> "I don't consider myself a .300 hitter," Clark said. "But I knew I'm better  than a .190 hitter. If that is the best I can generate, I don't deserve to be  playing. But what do they do? Sit down a guy making all that money? But they  figure they have to play me. They have to get their money's worth."  </P> <P> Clark said the streak has coincided with a change in how he views his role with  the Padres. He decided to just get hits, any hits. Forget about home runs, just  get on base.  </P> <P> He took it slowly. Until his home run and a double in the fifth, 12 of the  previous 13 hits in his streak were singles. The only exception was one double.  </P> <P> McKeon had talked to Clark a few days ago on just that topic.  </P> <P> "I told him forget about the home runs," McKeon said. "I told him the Jack  Clark I remember in St. Louis was hitting balls in the gaps, singles, doubles.  If he does that, the home runs will come."  </P> <P> But recent events began to make Clark think. He watched Mike Schmidt break down  in tears while announcing his retirement from the Philadelphia Phillies. And he  was moved.  </P> <P> "You hear a Mike Schmidt say that the edge isn't there like it used to be,"  Clark said. "I sort of lost that, too, maybe. If it is not fun anymore then  maybe I shouldn't be trying to play. You wonder how long you want to continue?  That hit real close to home with me."  </P> <P> He saw the pictures of the protesting students in Beijing dying in the cause of  freedom. And he was moved.  </P> <P> "I make an error like last night and everybody is down," Clark said. "Then I  look at the world situation in China and that puts it in perspective. I realize  baseball is not that big a deal."  </P> <P> Yet Clark said he had put too much pressure on himself -- because of baseball.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do well there (in New York) because people in St. Louis would have  said, 'See he failed anyhow and with all that money -- 2 million bucks.' Even  in San Diego people expect to get $2 million of hits out of Jack Clark. But  money doesn't buy the hits. If it did, I would spend most of it to get them."  </P> <P> What 18,238 in the Astrodome saw Monday was the Padres' biggest offensive  performance in 239 games. Not since a 10-2 victory over Houston on Sept. 12,  1987, had they scored in double digits, the longest such drought in the majors.  </P> <P> Their 17 hits were a season high, topping the 14 against Philadelphia May 30.  </P> <P> They saw Ed Whitson's seventh consecutive victory. And a four-for-five night  from Tony Gwynn to raise his average to .344.  </P> <P> The Padres wasted no time picking on a Houston pitching staff that had been  stretched to the limit after two extra-inning, weekend victories over the  Dodgers that totaled 35 innings.  </P> <P> They scored four times in the first three innings off starter Mark Portugal to  give Whitson a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> Portugal, who was acquired in the off-season from Minnesota, was called up  Monday from the Astros' triple-A team in Tucson. The Astros needed him because  the scheduled starter, Jim Clancy, pitched the final six innings of a 5-4,  22-inning victory over the Dodgers in a game that took seven hours and 14  minutes to play and lasted until 2:50 a.m. CDT Sunday.  </P> <P> Right fielder Bip Roberts started the game with a single, the sixth consecutive  game as leadoff batter he started the Padres with a hit. After Roberto Alomar  struck out, Roberts stole second. He scored when Gwynn singled to left. It was  the fourth time in those six games that Gwynn drove in Roberts after he opened  with a hit.  </P> <P> The Padres stretched their 1-0 lead to 4-0 in the third.  </P> <P> The Padres, who hit only two home runs in a weekend three-game series in  Cincinnati, hit two in the third inning off Portugal. Both to right field.  </P> <P> Alomar broke out a zero-for-14 streak with a one-out, solo homer, his second  and first since May 7 in Pittsburgh. And after Gwynn singled, Clark homered  into the screen above the left-field wall.  </P> <P> The two homers in the same inning were the first time the Padres had done so  since April 18 against Rick Reuschel in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The Astros cut the lead in half to 4-2 in the bottom of the inning on an RBI  single by center fielder Gerald Young and a run-scoring single by second  baseman Bill Doran.  </P></p>

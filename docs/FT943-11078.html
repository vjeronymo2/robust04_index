			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / East Germans work harder East Germans work longer hours and take fewer holidays than west Germans, as shown by figures of per capita working time among the workforce, according to a report published by the Halle Institute for Economic Research. The Institute, one of the six economic think-tanks which advises the federal government, also believes the fall in the unemployment rate in eastern Germany has stopped and patterns of employment in the region will eventually converge with western Germany. Mr Hilmar Schneider, author of the report, expects unemployment in eastern Germany to stabilise at around 15.8 per cent. However, contrary to previous estimates that unofficial unemployment, including those on on job creation schemes, short-time work, or those who have taken early retirement, make up an additional 25 per cent of the labour force, the Halle Institute puts the figure as low as 12 per cent. It concludes that the total unemployment figure in eastern Germany is 28 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: R&amp;D AND CHANGING U.S. PRIORITIES  </P> <P> With this column, Murray Weidenbaum rejoins the Times Board of Economists after  an eight-year absence that began with his appointment by President Reagan to  chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Weidenbaum, an economist who received  his doctorate from Princeton University, served on the council in 1981-82  before returning to Washington University in St. Louis, where he is director of  the Center for the Study of American Business. This academic year, he is on  leave while serving as distinguished scholar at the Center for Strategic and  International Studies in Washington. He is the author of numerous articles and  books, the latest of which is "Rendezvous With Reality: The American Economy  After Reagan."  </P> <P> In this period of necessary concentration on reducing federal deficit spending,  there is great danger that, inadvertently, support for science and technology  will be downgraded. Scientific research and technological development make  vital contributions to economic progress, national security, international  commerce and other key aspects of national life -- including the ability to  bear the burdens of a large national security establishment. However, little  attention is being given to these linkages in the current public debate on the  budget.  </P> <P> Public and private decision makers rarely make conscious decisions to finance  research and development, aside from comparatively modest support of basic  research. In the case of the public sector -- which sponsors and pays for half  of all the R&amp;D performed in this country -- most R&amp;D support results  from spending money on specific program areas.  </P> <P> Thus, the really large governmental outlays for science and technology flow  from decisions to strengthen the national defense, to promote energy  independence, to seek cures for diseases and to explore outer space. The entire  budget of the National Science Foundation -- the one agency devoted to  promoting research and development per se -- is less than 3% of total federal  outlays for R&amp;D.  </P> <P> The R&amp;D intensity of individual federal agencies varies greatly. NASA  devotes more than 45% of its budget to research and development, while the  ratio is less than 1% in the case of the Veterans Administration. Over 42% of  the Energy Department's budget is allocated to R&amp;D; less than 2% is  budgeted for R&amp;D at the Agriculture Department. The implications of these  differences are profound.  </P> <P> A shift in budgetary priorities from NASA to Agriculture or from Energy to the  VA represents a de facto (though unintended) commitment for the federal  government to spend less on R&amp;D and more on other activities.  </P> <P> Two inconsistent trends are now in evidence. First, the United States is  increasingly reliant on the fruits of scientific and technological activity to  maintain its basic strength. We attain our military strength not by having the  largest army or navy or air force. Rather, we rely on the most technically  sophisticated and up-to-date arsenal of weapons.  </P> <P> Similarly, high-tech companies experience a favorable balance of trade, while  low-tech companies have suffered most severely from foreign competition.  R&amp;D-intensive industries experience greater increases in productivity than  the less R&amp;D-intensive ones. Clearly, outlays for science and technology  are a key to the continuation of this country's military and economic power.  </P> <P> However, the second trend is adverse to this relationship. Most of the  R&amp;D-oriented departments and agencies of the federal government are  experiencing substantial budget squeezes, notably Defense, Energy and NASA.  Simultaneously, the "entitlements" (ranging from Social Security payments to  farm subsidies to veterans' pensions) are continuing to grow rapidly. These  latter agencies devote insignificant portions of their resources to R&amp;D.  </P> <P> At the same time, we are now witnessing a slowdown in private outlays for the  support of R&amp;D. Hostile takeovers are resulting in many companies cutting  back discretionary expenditures, no matter how valuable, in order to maximize  short-term cash flow. Moreover, companies that have taken on staggering debt  loads -- either as part of a change in corporate control or to head it off --  often are forced to cut back outlays that do not generate an immediate return  on the investment.  </P> <P> Moreover, there is a complex set of relationships between public  sector-financed R&amp;D and that sponsored by the private sector. Major defense  contractors both perform R&amp;D under government contracts and sponsor their  own research and development, a portion of which may be charged to the  government as overhead on defense procurement contracts. At a time when the  entire military budget is under pressure, there is a natural tendency for the  Department of Defense to cut back on the company-initiated R&amp;D that will be  reimbursed as overhead on government contracts.  </P> <P> This reduction in "independent" R&amp;D reimbursements is likely to force  high-tech companies to avoid new high-risk ventures. They will increasingly  focus their funds on more modest extensions of current product lines. Such a  strategy may be safe for an individual company, but it reduces the  effectiveness of the total U.S. effort on R&amp;D.  </P> <P> Many nations with which the United States competes have been devoting rising  shares of their gross national product to research and development. Moreover,  far larger proportions are assigned to commercial projects than is the case in  this country.  </P> <P> Setting national policy on research and development is especially difficult  because so many seemingly unrelated factors are involved. A rise in corporate  takeovers or a bailout of insolvent thrift institutions -- by squeezing budgets  for other purposes -- can exert far more influence on the availability of funds  for R&amp;D than an enhanced budget for the National Science Foundation.  </P> <P> What can and should be done? Decision makers, in both the public and private  sectors, need to focus more directly on the important role of R&amp;D in making  their plans and voting on budgets for what they consider to be broader  purposes.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, senior officials involved in economic and budgetary  decision-making rarely have adequate understanding of the substantive issues  involved in determining the amount and allocation of funds for research and  development.  </P> <P> In some past presidential administrations, a science adviser was appointed who  also served, at least informally, as representative of the science community.  At times, the adviser became a public spokesman for the administration in  office, but that is not the basic function of the position. The fundamental  point is that decision-making on key national issues should be more fully  informed of their scientific and technological aspects.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, we should not neglect the one-half of R&amp;D sponsored and  paid for by the private sector. It is not a lack of government money but rather  a traditional attitude that forces American companies to assign less of their  engineering talent to production than do the Japanese. By devoting more of  their professional work force to detailed product design and quality control,  Japanese firms often enjoy quicker responsiveness to market opportunities,  lower costs, and better quality output.  </P> <P> Some American scientific leaders contend that the striking competitiveness of  Japanese industry is due not so much to the magnitude of the R&amp;D resources  that are available to them but to their more effective use by the private  sector. Thus, much of the time, the line between high-powered research  laboratories and enhanced competitiveness may not go through Washington at all  -- but through the corporate offices of American industry.  </P></p>

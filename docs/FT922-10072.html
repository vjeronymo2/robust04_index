			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Hong Kong banks cut rates Hong Kong's two note-issuing banks yesterday said they would be cutting their prime lending rates by 0.5 percentage points to 8 per cent on Monday, after the government signalled its desire for lower borrowing costs, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The rate cut - designed to preserve the Hong Kong dollar's fixed rate with the US dollar - followed publication of inflation figures for March which showed annual inflation down to 9.5 per cent from 10.4 per cent in February.</p>

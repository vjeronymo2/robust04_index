			<p>BFN     [Text] The currently reorganized special force Vympel will  combat nuclear terrorism, Commander of the Russian Interior  Troops, Colonel General Anatoliy Kulikov announced on Tuesday.    He said that Vympel would be directly controlled by the  interior minister.    He also pointed out that the tactics of the interior troops  guarding nuclear power plants and nuclear defense facilities  have become outdated in as they were mostly oriented against  individual terrorists, not organized criminals. The interior  troops also lack armored equipment and special security devices,  said Kulikov. There are plans to equip servicemen with gas  weapons, he stated.    He also complained that the interior troops were 49 percent  understaffed.</p>

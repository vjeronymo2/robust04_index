			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Balladur urges caution in market access talks MR Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, yesterday called for caution in the Uruguay round market access negotiations and singled out labour-intensive industries for special treatment. In a rare personal presentation to the European Commission, Mr Balladur said that the high rate of unemployment in Europe meant that EC customs duties on textiles, aluminium, steel and chemicals should be gradual and accompanied by strengthened Gatt disciplines. The French prime minister also repeated that the US-EC agreement last year on farm export subsidies, known as the Blair House agreement, was unacceptable in its present form. EC officials had been braced for the ritual denunciation of Blair House, but Mr Balladur's remarks on market access were viewed as potentially troublesome. One senior EC official said it showed that France intends to keep Sir Leon Brittan, the Commission's chief trade negotiator, on a tight leash as market access negotiations by the EC, US, Japan and Canada enter a critical stage. Sir Leon, however, remained unruffled. 'Nothing has changed. The Commission thinks the Blair House agreement is a good agreement and we should stick to it.' He added that all sides agreed on the need to make progress in the Uruguay Round and to advance rapidly to an ambitious market access package for goods and services. The aim was an outline agreement at the G7 industrialised nations' summit in Tokyo next month. Talks would return to agriculture only at a later stage, he said. Mr Balladur's visit to Brussels was seen as a chance for the prime minister to let off steam on trade, two days after France had quietly agreed to ratify the EC-US agreement on oilseeds, a vital building block for an overall deal in the Uruguay Round negotiations. In his speech to the Commission, Mr Balladur said that trade reform should aim at opening protected markets in high-growth zones of Latin America and south-east Asia. Europe must not be exposed to stiffer competition from countries which had weak social security and lax environmental safeguards, or those which engaged in deliberate currency depreciation in order to expand export markets. Mr Luc Guyau - president of the main French farmers' union, FNSEA, also in Brussels yesterday - welcomed Mr Balladur's rejection of the Blair House accord. 'If necessary, (French) farmers will take to the streets to make our European partners understand we won't capitulate to the Americans,' he said.</p>

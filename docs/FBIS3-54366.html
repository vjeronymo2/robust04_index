			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by territories correspondent Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Text] Speaking at a news conference at al-Watani Hotel in  East Jerusalem, Faysal al-Husayni, who recently returned from a  visit to Saudi Arabia said: "The main goal of the Palestinian  delegation in negotiations with Israel is to establish an  interim rule that will incorporate the foundations for the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the  future," noting that "no amount of pressure or repressive  policies, such as land expropriation and the systematic  violation of the spirit of the agreement will help Israel  prevent this, and Israel must take this fat into account if it  seeks to achieve real peace. If the peace process fails,"  al-Husayni asserted, "this will not be good for the future of  democracy in Israel or for the country's very existence."  Al-Husayni explained that "Israel may be able to enforce its  presence to a certain degree in the future by using force;  however, it should bear in mind that whoever lives by the sword  is also destined to die by the sword." At the news conference,  Israel was accused of systematically expropriating land in the  territories and expanding settlements, even after the signing of  the Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians on 13  September.    The news conference was organized by four bodies, including  the Palestine Geographic Research and Information Center, which  belongs to the East Jerusalem association of Arab studies headed  by al-Husayni; the Palestine Human Rights Information Center;  The Saint Ives Society for Human Rights (a Catholic  organization); and the committee for land research.    The representatives of these bodies accused Israel of  expropriating 46,000 dunams along the Green Line and around  Jerusalem for military and public use after the document of  principles had already been signed, of expanding the settlements  of Daniyel and Bet El by another 1,025 dunams. They also  claimed that Israel had set up eight nature reserves on the West  Bank, paved eight roads leading to settlements; initiated two  development projects, encompassing 5,520 dunams, in settlements  in the Hebron area; and forcibly evicted 46 extended families  from the expropriated lands as well as destroying 63 houses.    The Palestinians claimed that Israel was employing three  main  methods to implement its settlement policies, which indicated  that it had no intention of withdrawing from the territories.  One of these methods focuses on development activity and on  formulating new master plans to expand existing settlements (for  example plans that were prepared for the settlements of 'Anatot,  Tapuah, Qedumim, and Qiryat Arba').    Another method is defining certain areas as "nature  reserves," "green areas," and "open areas," in order to prevent  the Palestinians from using the land for agriculture and  construction purposes. The areas that were so defined, the  Palestinian representatives claimed, are later used to build  settlements. The Palestinians gave Rekhes Shu'fat as an  example. This settlement was first defined as a "nature  reserve" and later used to construct homes for ultra-Orthodox  Jews.    The Palestinians complained that since the signing of the  Oslo agreement, numerous wide-ranging plans for an Israeli  "Greater Jerusalem" have been formulated in a similar fashion,  while the Palestinians are being prohibited to build in these  areas. They pointed out that since September 1993, eight areas  near Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Nabulus have  been declared natural reserves.    The third method used by Israel is based on laying the  infrastructure for the future expansion of settlements and their  linkage with Israel.</p>

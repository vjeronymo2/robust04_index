			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week (Cineraria hybrida) These greenhouse plants are now known botanically as Senecio hybridus but seed catalogues still use the old name. They are all bushy perennials that are grown as biennials, the seed being sown between May and July without extra heat for flowering in winter and spring. There are several different types, varying in size of flower and in habit, but the large-flowered, compact varieties such as Spring Glory and Venus are the most popular. The large, single, daisy-type flowers come in a wide range of colours, often with a white zone around the central disc. Plants are nearly hardy and can be grown in an unheated frame or greenhouse during the summer. In autumn and winter, they should be kept in a greenhouse or sunny room at a minimum temperatures of 13`C (55`F) and be watered moderately directly to the soil, keeping the leaves dry.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson weak Conglomerate Hanson stood out as a weak feature among leading internationally traded stocks which were boosted by a surge in the dollar. Interest in the shares was said to have been dampened by particularly heavy selling in New York late on Monday. Dealers said Goldman Sachs the US investment bank sold two blocks of 750,000 American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at Dollars 18 and Dollars 18 1/8 , equivalent to 7.5m shares at around 228p a share, on behalf of a client. The London traded shares eased slightly to 228 1/4 p yesterday with 6.5m traded by the close. Elsewhere, Zeneca remained restrained by the reported attempt of one UK investment bank to place 2m shares and closed 2 lighter at 805p. However, pharmaceuticals rival Glaxo jumped 13 to 585 1/2 p as the group announced that 14.68 per cent of its shares were held in the form of ADRs. The figure was down from the previously recorded 15.88 per cent but much as expected. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries jumped a further 9 to 450p, its shares helped by takeover speculation in the insurance sector.</p>

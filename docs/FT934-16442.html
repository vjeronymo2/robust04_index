			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ulster TV results overtake 'unsustainable' business plan MR ALAN WRIGHT, the independent television producer who failed to win the Northern Ireland commercial television franchise with his TVNI consortium, is one of the most frustrated would-be broadcasters in the UK. The Independent Television Commission threw out TVNI's business plan, based on a Pounds 3.1m-a-year bid, as unsustainable. However, Ulster Television, the incumbent which survived with a bid of Pounds 1.03m, is already performing better in the battle for advertising revenue than TVNI's projections. 'We were projecting advertising revenues of Pounds 25.25m for 1993 and a share of net advertising revenue of 1.65 per cent,' Mr Wright said yesterday. Last month Ulster Television announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.97m on revenues of Pounds 13.2m for the first six months. Last year Ulster had higher revenues in the second half and this year there are signs of rising ITV revenues this autumn. The advertising industry believes that Ulster's share of the ITV total has risen to 1.78 per cent, boosted by a growing tendency for large companies to buy their advertising on an all-Ireland basis. Mr Wright, who was director of programmes in the TVNI consortium, says his company would have been profitable at the advertising levels now being earned by Ulster despite the higher bid. 'My reaction is is one of enormous frustration, particularly because we did not have the opportunity to test the ITC's judgment in court.' TVNI and TVS applied for a judicial review of the ITC's decisions but were turned down by the High Court because of delay. The application came eight weeks after the ITC decision following Television South West's granting of a review, which ultimately failed. The ITC declined to comment, although the authority would clearly argue that it made its best judgment on the facts available at the time.</p>

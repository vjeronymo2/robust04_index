			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Extra hurdle for Emu IN PRESSING for the plan for European economic and monetary union (Emu) to be based firmly on price stability and fiscal discipline, the German government and the Bundesbank have done Europe a service. The principles of economic management which have fostered the strength and stability of the D-Mark are the only ones suited to guide the journey towards a single European currency. The Emu treaty agreed at the Maastricht summit in December does not fulfil all Germany's wishes. But it ensures that the criteria for selecting the countries taking part in Emu, and for operating the system when and if it becomes a reality, will embody the Germans' own standards of financial rectitude. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl keeps pointing out, the legal statute for the mooted European central bank is more unambiguously geared to fighting inflation than the 1957 Bundesbank Law. Despite these successful features, Maastricht was not a triumph for either German or EC diplomacy. There is still ample opportunity for upsets; and one now seems to have emerged, with the likelihood that the German parliament will ratify the Maastricht treaty this summer only with important strings attached. The procedural details have not yet been worked out. But both chambers of parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, are expected to insist on the need to re-examine the Emu treaty in 1996 as a prime condition for passing the Maastricht agreement this summer. Final say German officials say that adding an extra hurdle to the ratification process is necessary for fundamental constitutional reasons. The German line is that parliament, not the executive, has to have the final say in deciding whether Emu really will conform to Bundesbank-style 'stability-first' principles. German officials declare that this does not add up to a backdoor escape route from Emu. Nonetheless, insistence on fresh parliamentary appraisal in four years' time throws an undoubted spanner into the Maastricht works, which could disturb the ratification machinery in other countries too. If it is enacted, the Bonn proposal would significantly weaken the 'irreversible' procedure agreed at Maastricht, under which Emu would enter into force by 1999 at the latest (assuming at least two countries meet the agreed criteria for economic convergence). More to lose Behind Bonn's wish for extra conditions, there are some undoubted similarities to the motives which led Britain to negotiate its celebrated 'opt out' clause. In view of the D-Mark's status as Europe's strongest currency, the Germans have much more to lose through Emu than anyone else. Though in different circumstances to Britain, Germany shares the same reluctance to give up its monetary sovereignty unless it is sure that its national interests will be met. That is a legitimate anxiety. But, having signed up for Emu at Maastricht, Mr Kohl will now need to make maximum efforts to ensure that a wish for extra safeguards is not interpreted in other EC capitals as a sign of flagging interest. The 'irreversible' element to the Emu plan contradicts the Bundesbank's basic position that Bonn should agree nothing which sets down an automatic expiry date for the D-Mark. Furthermore, Mr Kohl received only the vaguest of commitments by the other EC countries to proceed towards European political union - a goal which Mr Kohl himself had set as the prime condition for giving his blessing to Emu. Mr Kohl's dilemma is a delicate one. By appearing three months ago to make Emu virtually a fait accompli, he bowed to the demands of the Emu protagonists in France and Italy - but has reaped antagonism from important parts of the German body politic. Mr Kohl will not be able to please both groups. Germany is right to insist that conditions be met before the move to Emu takes place. But the way this requirement is being reintroduced is bound to awaken doubts about the credibility of its European commitments.</p>

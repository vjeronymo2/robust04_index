			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Plan to extend life of marginal SA gold mine WESTERN Deep Levels (WDL) and neighbouring Blyvooruitzicht (Blyvoor), two South African gold mines, have reached an agreement which should extend the troubled Bylvoor's life by about eight years. The logic of the deal, which involves Blyvoor mining 92 hectares of the WDL lease area, is that Blyvoor has easier access to the area covered by the deal than WDL. Working profits and capital expenditure will be shared, with WDL, which is owned by Anglo American, receiving 55 per cent and Blyvoor 45 per cent.</p>

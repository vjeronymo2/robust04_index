			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Annual reports marked 'could do better' ANNUAL reports of British companies vary widely in their ability to communicate information, according to an analysis by Meridian Design Associates, a consultancy firm. It says the typical report is 56 pages long, printed on A4 paper; contains a vacuous 'vision statement'; has five sub-standard photographs; and a reader needs 75 seconds to pick out the five most important facts about the company. Allied Lyons, Tesco and Tate &amp; Lyle rated highest among the top 100 quoted companies on a scale assessing the financial information, illustrations and lay-out of their annual reports for 1990 or last year. The survey contains valuable lessons for businesses hoping to improve the presentation of information provided to shareholders. 'Most companies could easily do a better job of conveying basic information,' it concludes. Meridian argues that annual reports have become 'big business', particularly as a result of expanded share ownership. It estimates that 25m copies of annual reports were produced last year. It says reports should have two main tasks: to provide comprehensive and accurate information and to convey a company image. The firm concedes that annual report designers are often accused of preferring pictures to words and graphics to information content. 'Fundamentally unsound companies often employ fancy devices to distract attention from the unpalatable realities,' it says. As a result, it attempted to produce an objective index by which to judge annual reports, based on three criteria: Financial information: the number of seconds (ideally no more than 100) in which a busy analyst could find earnings per share, net asset value, and three other facts which give a feel of the company and could be used to support a buy, sell or hold recommendation. Clarity: marks were awarded for signposts to help the reader, including a contents page (Reed International did not have one), an index (only six reports had them), a corporate profile and a vision statement (55 per cent had one of the two), and a direc-tory of main subsidiaries with contact phone numbers. Visuals: an assessment of the use of photographs and graphics, with points deducted from a base score of 20 for poor quality and irrelevant or confusing pictures. Too often report pages present 'a jumble of different images' with too many illustrations, Meridian says. Photographs are frequently blurred, badly lit or have the appearance of being taken in photo booths. Sun Alliance, the insurance company, and P&amp;O, the shipping and property group, were the only reports which had no photographs at all. Privatisation appears to have had little impact on the quality of reports. The electricity companies generally had few comments on prospects as well as poor photographs. Water company reports suffered from 'dull pictures, tedious text and no real signposting'. The Annual Report. Meridian Design Associates, 424 Kingston Rd, London SW20 8LL. Pounds 365.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut: "A Stern U.S. Letter on Cyprus"] </F>   [Text] Washington--U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher has conveyed a stern letter to Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin on Cyprus. He urged Ankara to persuade TRNC  [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas to  agree to resolve the Cyprus problem. The letter, dated 31  March, held Turkey and Denktas responsible for the lack of  movement toward a solution in Cyprus.    Christopher recalled the guarantee the Ciller government  gave  to the United States some time ago to the effect that it will do  everything it can to contribute toward the effort being made to  find a solution to the Cyprus problem and said that until now  Ankara has failed to make any move in accordance with that  guarantee. Stressing that the absence of a solution in Cyprus  was largely due to Rauf Denktas' negative approach, Christopher  said: "Had Turkey used its influence on Denktas in the right  way, the existing negative conditions would not have been  created in Cyprus."    Christopher also informed Cetin that the UN secretary  general  moved to prepare a strong UN Security Council resolution against  the Turkish Cypriot side when it became apparent that the talks  were heading toward a deadlock.  <H5>  Ciller Must Fulfill Her Promise </H5>   The date of Warren Christopher's stern letter led to  interesting comments in Washington. The U.S. Administration is  aware of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's wish to hold talks with  President Clinton in Washington when she visits the United  States on 13 April. In view of that, Warren Christopher's  letter can be regarded as a high-level reminder to Ankara by the  U.S. Administration that "Ciller is expected to take a step on  Cyprus before she embarks on her visit to the United States."  <H5>  The United States Expects a Concrete Step </H5>   The reason for the pressure the U.S. Administration has  directed against Turkey on the Cyprus problem is the guarantee  Tansu Ciller gave to President Clinton when she visited the  White House some time ago to the effect that "Turkey will take  the necessary steps to have that problem resolved as soon as  possible." Ciller gave that guarantee both in the talks she had  with President Clinton in camera and in the joint news  conference she held with him later. In view of that, the U.S.  Administration expected the Ciller government to take concrete  steps to contribute toward the effort being made to find a  solution to the problem between the two communities in Cyprus.    Naturally, the term concrete step is a reference to the  pressure Washington expects Turkey to direct on Denktas to force  him to change his approach, which the United States believes is  "irreconcilable." Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that  President Clinton has clashed with the influential Greek lobby  in the United States on matters related to The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia. In view of that, he attaches significant  importance to an opportunity to satisfy the Greeks and Greek  Cypriots by paving the way for the solution of the Cyprus  problem.</p>

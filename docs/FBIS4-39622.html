			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Morozov commentary: "Korean Bomb Gives Whole World </F> a Headache"]    [Text] Almost 10 years has gone by since the concept of  the "Korean nuclear problem" was invented, which, to the man in  the street, means the possession of a bomb by the "unpredictable  regime in North Korea." In that time both international  organizations, including the United Nations, and the press have  talked sometimes of a bomb that has already been created, and  have sometimes said that it is on the point of being  manufactured. However, so far no one has produced evidence of  the bomb -- neither the Americans, nor the Koreans themselves.  Pyongyang is continuing to insist that it is not even dreaming  of having its own nuclear cudgel. Meanwhile, the United States  is preparing to implement economic sanctions against the DPRK  and persuade the rest of the world to do the same -- the  Americans themselves have never had trade dealings with the  DPRK. There has even been some talk of a military solution to  the problem.    It is hard to object to sanctions, which could solve the  problem, although they threaten the emergence of yet another hot  spot on Russia's borders. But will sanctions provide the answer  to a number of very important questions?    First of all, why has Pyongyang taken such a long time to  furnish itself with a nuclear bomb (the first nuclear reactor in  the DPRK was started up in 1965)? Why, by analogy with the  "Korean nuclear problem," does the world not know about the  "Israeli," the "Pakistani," or anyone else's problem? No one  can guarantee the absence of a bomb in those states. How much  will it cost Russia to suddenly discontinue economic relations  with the DPRK as a trade partner of many years' standing? The  wise Chinese will most likely refuse to participate in the  sanctions. Why at the time was there no such concern about the  acquisition by Pyongyang of MiG-29 aircraft? After all, it is  clear to the most pathetic expert in distant France or Great  Britain that the use of these airplanes (with conventional  weapons) against the nine nuclear electric power stations in  South Korea is no less dangerous than the detonation of a  nuclear munition.    It is also unclear why all the "interested" parties,  including the DPRK, have unambiguously failed to support the  Russian idea to convene an international conference to break the  "deadlock," while the United States is moving increasingly  toward the use of coercive methods. Is not the present massive  pressure on the DPRK connected with the U.S. President's  statement that the campaign for freedom which began with the  landing of the allied troops in Normandy in 1944 did not end  with the demise of the USSR? You get the impression that the  United States, Japan, South Korea, and indeed Pyongyang itself  are not worried by the problem as such of the nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons, but that each of these countries is  exploiting it merely to achieve its own political ends.</p>

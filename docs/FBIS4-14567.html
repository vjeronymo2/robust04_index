			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Golovachev, TRUD political observer: </F> "Baykonur No Longer a Bone of Contention. Russia Leases Space  Launch Facility for 20 Years"]    [Text] After the collapse of the USSR, Baykonur suddenly  became a "bone of contention," a "disputed issue" between Russia  and Kazakhstan. This immense and extremely complicated complex,  which occupies tens of thousands of hectares and has 12 launch  pads, as before, embodies the cutting edge of scientific and  technical progress. Who would have thought, 40 years ago, when  they were selecting the site of the "harbor of the Universe,"  that in time the space launch facility would end up on the  territory of another state?    Baykonur was built entirely by the Soviet Union, which  invested immense material funds in it (and the lion's share came  from Russia). Many of our present difficulties could have been  avoided if the separation of the USSR into individual states had  proceeded, as it were, more smoothly, taking into account the  complex problems and mutual interests, and if issues of  fundamental significance for Russia (including Baykonur) had  been resolved in a calm situation, enlisting experts, on the  basis of in-depth preliminary development.    But history had its own ideas. After the collapse of the  USSR difficult times befell the space launch facility. The  ambiguity of its status, the general confusion, the rupture of  economic ties, the sharp reduction of financing under conditions  of the severe crisis being experienced by Russia--all this  placed Baykonur on the verge of ruin. Buildings and roads are  being destroyed, the spacious installation and testing  facilities are in need of repair... Not so long ago there were  100,000 people living in Leninsk--the capital of the space  launch facility--and today there are no more than 60.    It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the  discipline so necessary in the space center. Recently a fire  was reported in the assembly-testing facility, which previously  would have been quite impossible to imagine. But, still, more  than 20 planned launches were carried out from Baykonur last  year. But this required immense efforts...    At the same time Kazakhstan, which had received the space  gift, had to decide what to do with the space launch facility  after that. Negotiations with Russia began. And then from  somewhere came the figure of $7 billion--as much as was  initially demanded by representatives of Kazakhstan for "damage  caused to the earth in Kazakhstan" during all the time of  Baykonur's existence. This is evidence not only of an  unrealistic approach to the problem but also of a desire (in  general, understandable) to "squeeze" as much as possible out of  the situation that had developed. Russia began to think  seriously about building a new space launch facility near the  missile compound Svobodnyy-18 in Amur Oblast and expanding the  Plesetsk space launch facility in Arkhangelsk Oblast. In turn,  Kazakhstan and Ukraine tried to interest the United States in  Baykonur, but that turned out to be not so easy...    It became clear that deciding the fate of Baykonur could not  be put off any longer. Recently negotiations have been  proceeding on a more even-handed, realistic basis.  Representatives of Kazakhstan were asking hundreds of millions  of dollars as payment for rent. Before the meeting of Presidents  B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev, things became especially heated in  the negotiations among the experts; it was, as musicians say, a  "crescendo." The specialists met daily including last Friday,  and Saturday, and Sunday, and sometimes the discussion became  very bitter. Clarification of disputed issues sometimes dragged  out until after midnight.    Ultimately their positions came closer together, although a  number of disagreements still remained. The Russians agreed to  pay $82 million a year for rent. But Kazakhstan was insisting  on 150 million. The presidents would have to find a compromise.  And they found it; they settled on the sum of $115 million.    Of course, this is a considerable sum. Let us recall that,  by participating in the creation of the international orbital  station, Russia will receive $100 million from NASA (United  States) each year. This, as we can see, is less than the rent  for Baykonur for a year. Moreover, Russia is bearing the  immense costs of maintaining the space facility. Last year it  amounted to R39.6 billion (in last year's prices) and this year,  according to estimates from specialists, it will take more than  250 billion.    But still, adding up the pluses and minuses, one can say  with  confidence that the agreement signed by the presidents of the  two countries concerning Baykonur is a very important and  mutually advantageous step which can only be welcomed. Russia  has neither the forces nor the money to build a new space  facility today. And linked to Baykonur is the implementation of  large-scale, long-term international programs (in particular, it  is planned to have repeated flights of American astronauts to  Mir within the framework of the project for creating a  Russian-American orbital station). These programs produce  considerable currency revenues, without which it would be hard  for domestic space science to survive. On the other hand,  Kazakhstan too will receive a great advantage from leasing the  space facility to Russia.    It is especially important to emphasize that, in keeping  with  the conditions of the agreement, the rights to ownership of  movable and immovable property which has appeared since 31  August 1991 in Baykonur will belong to Russia. That is, now  Moscow can invest money in Baykonur without fear of losing if  there is an unfavorable development of events.    The agreement specifies that the term of the lease will be  20  years with an option to extend it another 10 years. The space  facility will be serviced by Russian citizens.    The agreement signed by the presidents is a "framework"  agreement. On its basis will be developed a leasing agreement,  which is to be signed in the near future.    And so, after two years of uncertainty, negotiations that  would become lively and then die down, mutual suspicions and  reproaches, Russia and Kazakhstan have finally taken a serious  step toward one another, resolving in a civilized manner one of  the most difficult and painful issues in relations between our  countries. A good sign!</p>

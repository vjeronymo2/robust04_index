			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Polish row over control of state banking Poland's two-party coalition government has been plunged into an internal struggle over control of the state banking and insurance sectors, following the dismissal of Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy finance minister, by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister. Mr Marek Borowski, a deputy premier and finance minister, has demanded an explanation in writing from Mr Pawlak by tomorrow. The dismissed deputy minister, who has been responsible for banking and financial services since 1989, said he had been told by the prime minister that he was being dismissed as a result of 'a review of my work and plans for the privatisation of banks and insurance companies'. The dismissal follows the privatisation of Bank Slaski, whose shares soared from the public offer price of 500,000 zlotys (Pounds 15.40) to 6.7m zlotys, valuing the bank at the equivalent of about Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.94bn) last week. The prime minister, who heads the PSL farmers' party, appears to be using the outcry over the disposal to make political inroads at the finance ministry. When the coalition was formed last autumn, the finance ministry, like the privatisation ministry, was assigned to the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), which is the dismissed minister's party. Mr Borowski says he has asked the NIK, the state audit and general control body, to investigate the bank sale. So far two big banks have been privatised and a further six are to be sold by the end of 1996. The Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy is to be sold by mid-1994 and a flotation of the state's holding in the Warta insurance company is also planned.</p>

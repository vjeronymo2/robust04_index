			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO FREEWAY CAR-POOL LANE DRAWS RECORD NUMBER OF DRIVERS  </P> <P> While work on 10 miles of southbound car-pool lane on the San Diego Freeway is  not expected to be completed until next week, the northbound commuter lane has  gotten off to a fast start, California Department of Transportation officials  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> After less than a week of operation, the northbound lane has attracted more  cars during the peak morning commute hour than any new commuter lane in Orange  County, authorities said.  </P> <P> The new 10-mile stretch of car-pool lanes, which extend from the Santa Ana  Freeway to the Corona del Mar Freeway, links to a 14-mile segment completed  last summer between the Corona del Mar and San Gabriel River freeways to form  the longest continuous commuter system in the state.  </P> <P> Between 6:45 a.m. and 7:45 a.m., the lane drew more than 800 cars, about 200  more than were lured to the car-pool lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway during its  initial days of operation, said Joe El-Harake, Orange County commuter lanes  coordinator for Caltrans. The new lane drew about 250 more cars than were  attracted to the 14-mile segment on the San Diego Freeway when it opened last  September, he said. ERIC BAILEY  </P></p>

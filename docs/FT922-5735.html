			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Chicago brokerage charged THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Stotler &amp; Co, once a leading Chicago futures brokerage, and its top four executive officers with defrauding investors and deceiving the commission about the real state of the firm's financial condition. The agency is seeking to recover at least Dollars 15m. The charge is that Mr Thomas Egan, president and chief operating officer of Stotler, and three other executives engaged in various schemes to defraud investors and cover their wrongdoing with 'unlawful, contrived and bogus transactions.' The suit alleges, for example, that Dollars 2.2m of the proceeds from Stotler's initial public offering in 1988 were diverted to certain partners. Stotler was a futures commission merchant and a commodities pool operator, as well as a broker-dealer in US government securities. No criminal penalties are sought but the SEC, beyond seeking that partners give up gains alleged to have been illicit, requested that Mr Egan never again be allowed to act as a director or officer of a public company. The scandal at Stotler, which went broke nearly two years ago, enveloped one of the futures industry's biggest names, Mr Karsten 'Cash' Mahlmann. He was chairman of Stotler, and was forced to resign from the chairmanship of the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, two days after Stotler declared bankruptcy in August 1990. Mr Mahlmann was not charged with any wrongdoing in the SEC complaint, but was named as one of 17 partners from whom the agency will seek money that should have gone - it is alleged - to the investors but was distributed to partners.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aida Castillo] </F>   [Text] At a news conference following the signing of an  agreement between Nicaragua and the EU, Manuel Marin, EU vice  president for Latin America, Asia, and the Mediterranean Region,  said the EU does not agree with the United States on the move to  remove the financial aid offered to the Nicaraguan Government  should the property issue remain unsettled.    The agreement, called "The Consolidation of the State of Law  and the Promotion of the Economic Takeoff in Rural Nicaragua,"  offers $20 million to small- and medium-scale producers in the  Nicaraguan northern and Pacific zones. This donation will be  disbursed within five years.    The agreement's main objective is to authorize the use of  and  issue property titles to more than 220,000 manzanas belonging to  small- and medium-scale producers. This plan approves the use  of 70 percent of the country's land.    In addition, the agreement will sponsor the creation of a  savings and loans network (30 branches) as a  financial source for peasants, who will also be legally and  physically trained to keep their properties.    Marin ratified the support for the Nicaraguan Government  with  the signing of this development project and pointed out that  within the peace process this project will "be used to attract  investors to Nicaragua, which needs them greatly." He added  that, along with other donor countries, the EU is supporting the  Nicaraguan effort to have the Paris Club forgive its foreign  debt. However, he maintained that receiving "this much economic  aid" is unhealthy, adding "Nicaragua should be attempting to  receive less."  <H5>  Blandon Talks About Paris </H5>   Since 1990, the EU has given a third of the economic aid  this  organization allocates for Latin America -- more than $80  million -- to Nicaragua.    The EU official met yesterday morning with President Violeta  Chamorro, who was accompanied by Deputy Foreign Cooperation  Minister Sergio Mario Blandon. He stressed the results of the  Paris meeting held by the World Bank Advisory Group, in which  Nicaragua was offered $750 million in economic aid for this  year. Blandon pointed out the amount of money deemed necessary  to "close up and implement" the Enhanced Structural Adjustment  Policy Program signed with the IMF was obtained at the Paris  meeting.    Questioned on how the disbursements will be made, the deputy  minister explained the Nicaraguan Government will try to have  the funds "disbursed as soon as possible." He also said  "payments are made according to schedules, because not only  countries but also international financial institutions are  involved." Blandon stressed that $60 million in economic aid  for this year are included in the $750-million package. "This  means these additional funds will be available to be invested in  production." The government had previously said that additional  funds for 1994 would amount to $75 million.</p>

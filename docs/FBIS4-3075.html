			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- An appeal by Xi Yang,  a reporter of the MING PAO newspaper based in Hong Kong, against  a 12-year prison sentence on charges of stealing state secrets  was turned down here today.    The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court rejected Xi  Yang's appeal, upholding the sentence of the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court of 12 years' imprisonment, depriving  him of political rights for two years.    Xi's abettor, Tian Ye, was sentenced by the original trial  to  15 years' imprisonment and deprived of political rights for  three years. Tian, who was formerly deputy chief of the General  Office of the Bureau of Overseas Affairs of the People's Bank of  China (PBC), did not appeal.    Assigned by the MING PAO newspaper, Xi Yang stayed in  Beijing  during the period from June to July, 1993, under the pretext of  covering the Sino-British talks and the establishment of the  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress.    However, he did not send his applications for interviews to  departments concerned as the state regulations demand, but  incited Tian Ye to steal and spy out government financial and  economic secrets.    Tian provided Xi with many top secrets including samples of  Chinese bank notes, information about the PBC's selling gold in  the international market, the PBC's plan about readjusting the  exchange rates between Chinese renminbi and foreign currencies,  and the PBC's decision about raising again the interest rates of  the deposits as of July in the year.    Besides, Tian stole and illegally provided Xi Yang with a  confidential document entitled "illustration on the provisional  rules about overseas-funded financial institutions' engaging in  business of renminbi." After receiving the secrets, Xi  immediately wrote stories about them and sent the stories to the  headquarters of the MING PAO newspaper for publication, thus  causing the state to suffer heavy economical losses.    On December 14, 1993, the Beijing Municipal People's  Procuratorate instituted proceedings against Xi Yang and Tian Ye  according to the law.    Since the case involved state secrets, the Beijing Municipal  People's Court held closed hearings on the case, according to  the 111th provision of "the Law of Criminal Procedures of the  People's Republic of China."    During the hearings, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  People's Court found that some of the evidence in the case  should be further verified, thus sending back on January 27 this  year the case to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate  for further investigation.    On Feburary 15, the case was sent again by the Beijing  Municipal People's Procuratorate to the Beijing Municipal  Intermediate People's Court for trial.    Both the defendants Xi Yang and Tian Ye said before the  trials began that they would defend themselves and did not  invite any lawyer to act for them. During the trial, both of  them admitted their guilt, showed repentance and asked the court  to be lenient.    The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court held that  Xi Yang had ignored China's laws, gathered and spied out state  financial and economic secrets, and published them in a  newspaper overseas, thus committing the crime of stealing and  spying state secrets, an exceptionally serious case.    The court held that as a staff member of a government body,  Tian Ye had violated the state regulations on maintaining  confidentiality and stolen, spied and illegally supplied state  secrets, thus committing the crime of stealing, spying and  illegally supplying state secrets, also an exceptionally serious  case.    The criminal facts of Xi Yang and Tian Ye are clear and the  evidences are conclusive and full, according to the court.    "The supplementary regulations on crime of leaking state  secrets" adopted by the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress stipulated that those whose case of stealing,  spying, buying or illegally supplying state secrets for overseas  institutions, organizations or persons is serious should be  sentenced to penal servitude for a definite period longer than  10 years, penal servitude for life, or sentenced to death and  should be deprived of political rights for some time.    Since Xi Yang and Tian Ye admitted their guilt and showed  repentance, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court  decided to punish them leniently and on March 28, 1994,  sentenced Xi Yang to 12 years' imprisonment, with the term  starting from September 27, 1993, and depriving him of political  rights for two years, and sentenced Tian Ye to 15 years'  imprisonment with the term starting from September 24, 1993, and  depriving him of political rights for three years.    Xi Yang appealed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's  Court against the sentence.    After its appeal hearing, the Beijing Municipal Higher  People's Court rejected Xi Yang's appeal and upheld the original  ruling of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court.</p>

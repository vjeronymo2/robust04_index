			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS OFFER GOOD REASON TO SLEEP IN  </P> <P> Over the past few years, Saturday morning cartoons have undergone a minor  renaissance. The appearance of "The Gummi Bears," "My Pet Monster," "A Pup  Named Scooby-Doo" and "The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" seemed to promise a  happier era of higher standards in children's programming.  </P> <P> But the new shows for the 1989-90 season, which debuted on the past two  Saturdays, break that promise: Parents will need a post-hole digger to find the  standards used in making them. These series suggest a return to the bad old  days of the '70s, when storytelling in cartoons vanished like the vitamins  Uncle Ben supposedly sealed into rice, and "animation" meant images that were  drawn, rather than images that moved.  </P> <P> This decline can be attributed to a number of factors: the falling value of the  dollar and the concomitant rise in overseas production costs; breakneck  production schedules; reduced network license fees on Saturday morning; the  limits that anti-violence pressure groups have placed on slapstick comedy and  dramatic conflict. But assigning blame doesn't alter the result: American  children are getting inferior entertainment.  </P> <P> Here's an overview of the new Saturday morning lineup -- and it seems  appropriate that the same word would be used to describe this array of shows  and suspected criminals.  </P> <P> NBC Programs  </P> <P> "Camp Candy." A formula cartoon sitcom with a caricature of John Candy ineptly  riding herd on a standard assortment of smart-mouth kids. There's a snooty  Valley Girl, a "cool" boy ("Dude!"), a nerdy little boy with glasses, a tomboy  obviously modeled after Peppermint Patty. Although billed as a "live  action/animated comedy," there was no live action in the first episode -- and  precious little comedy.  </P> <P> "Captain N: The Game Master." A formula cartoon adventure about Kevin, a  teen-aged boy who somehow gets sucked into an animated world of computer games.  Naturally he's a whiz at Nintendo games, and uses his skills to aid beautiful  Princess Lana in her battle against the evil Mother Brain, a disembodied  monster whose voice sounds like a Little Richard album played at about 30  r.p.m. This premise has been used before ("TRON," "The Last Starfighter"), but  all these characters seem to do is plug the various games.  </P> <P> "The Karate Kid." This cheapo adventure based on the popular films ranks as the  worst new show of the season. The first episode had Daniel, Mr. Miyagi and a  girl named Taki rafting down the Amazon in pursuit of a magical "shrine." How  they got to South America, where Taki came from and the source of the shrine's  powers, were never explained. A more significant puzzle is why Miyagi talks in  the sort of fortune-cookie dialogue that went out with Charlie Chan movies  ("Honorable gentleman is what Daniel-san call 'real jerk' "). Isn't NBC's  standards and practices department supposed to prevent racial stereotyping on  children's shows? And why did Pat Morita -- who supplies the character's voice  -- lend his talents to this turkey?  </P> <P> "ALF Tales" puts the cartoon version of Alf into various classic fairy tales.  The writers seem to be trying to redo Jay Ward's irreverent "Fractured Fairy  Tales," but the results are utterly flat. It's also not clear that children  will understand the references in some of the punch lines: "I'll have to check  the warranty on my liposuction." No worse than a trip to the dentist without  anesthetic.  </P> <P> CBS Programs  </P> <P> "Dink, the Little Dinosaur," owes a lot to Don Bluth's "The Land Before Time."  Both focus on cute-as-a-button baby dinosaurs of different species who learn to  play together. (Their behavior is supposed to offer a subtle lesson in  tolerance.) The enormous size of the dinosaurs is one of the principal reasons  for their enduring popularity with children, but "Dink" robs them of that epic  scale and reduces them to so many saccharine squeeze toys.  </P> <P> "The California Raisins." Will Vinton's commercials of animated clay raisins  dancing to old rock songs launched a marketing phenomenon. The Raisins are so  popular on toys and T-shirts, it was probably inevitable that someone would get  the semi-bright idea of using them in a children's show. The drawn animation in  the series, however, fails to re-create the slick, funky motions of the clay  characters. Rather than make the animators draw a lot of wrinkles, the Raisins  have been redesigned with smoother bodies, which makes them look like the  California Eggplants. The net result, an inane comedy about a show-biz group  with a hapless manager, resembles a lame retread of the old "Alvin Show."  </P> <P> Kidvid attempts to go hip in "Rude Dog and the Dweebs": The title character and  his garish canine followers are drawn in an angular, new wave style.  Unfortunately, these with-it designs only look good from one or two angles and  tend to fall apart when the artists try to move them. Underneath a lot of  pseudo-cool gnarlyspeak ("Yo, Dudes, get rude!") is an ordinary cartoon sitcom  about a pack of talking animals living in an otherwise normal city, in the  dubious tradition of "Top Cat" and "Foofur." Yo, Dudes, get the "off" button!  </P> <P> The one new ABC series, the regrettable "Beetlejuice," already has been  reviewed. Despite the inclusion of "Beetlejuice" and "Slimer and the Real  Ghostbusters" in its schedule, ABC offers the best Saturday morning fare: "A  Pup Named Scooby-Doo," "The Gummi Bears/Winnie the Pooh Hour" and "The Bugs  Bunny and Tweety Show."  </P> <P> Finally, anyone who doubts the negative impact of the former Reagan  Administration's decision to loosen the restrictions on the number of  commercials shown on Saturday morning should try watching an hour of kidvid.  Young viewers are deluged with ads for toys, chewing gum, sugar cereal and  other over-sweetened treats. The cereals may be presented as "a part of this  balanced breakfast," but this plethora of commercials hardly constitutes  balanced viewing.  </P></p>

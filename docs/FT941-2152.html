			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Indian investment log-jam bypassed An Edinburgh-based fund manager has struck an agreement with an Indian custodial bank, allowing a log-jam of securities transactions in India to be bypassed. The log-jam has been responsible for a dramatic slowdown this year of foreign investment in India. The fund manager, Martin Currie, is to raise an additional Dollars 150m through an issue of convertible preference shares in the Indian Opportunities Fund. The IOF, managed jointly by Martin Currie and Indian merchant bank Indbank, raised Dollars 100m in an initial placing of ordinary shares last July. A further tranche planned for earlier this year had to be postponed after difficulty arose at custodial banks in India. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, the leading custodial bank in India, which acts as Martin Currie's custodian, told its customers it was temporarily unable to handle any further increase in foreign investments in India. Custodial banks hold share certificates for safe keeping, collect dividends and follow instructions to pass shares to new owners when they are sold. In India each share has its own certificate and the volume of paper this creates has raised serious administrative burdens for large, active institutional investors. Martin Currie has struck an agreement with Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, which acts as a sub-custodian for several large US banks. The local fund managers will have a period of six months in which to invest cash raised by the latest issue.</p>

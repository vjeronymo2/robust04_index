			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PIANIST HORACIO GUTIERREZ AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> In a light introduction to an otherwise demanding recital at Ambassador  Auditorium Saturday evening, Horacio Gutierrez invited actress Mariette Hartley  to join him in Satie's "Sports et divertissements" for piano and narrator.  Hartley charmed and pantomimed her way through the narration (in Virgil  Thomson's translation) prefacing the 20 satirical sketches, while Gutierrez  gave the programmatic salon music a tongue-in-cheek seriousness.  </P> <P> But Gutierrez brought true seriousness and utmost integrity to his  interpretation of Schumann's Fantasy in C. His approach was decidedly  unromantic, allowing the work's own romanticism to speak instead through  thoughtful clarity. He permitted himself few liberties with internal tempos. He  pedaled for delineation and emphasis.  </P> <P> The final movement benefited most from a quiet and simple approach. Modulations  worked their own subtle effect, imparted by a master of quiet shading without  the warning flags of prior tempo changes.  </P> <P> The Fantasy is as demanding as it is romantic, but Gutierrez has a facile  technique that leaves even the devilish coda of the second movement seeming  naturally effortless. This technique served well for the agonized rumblings and  frenzied nervousness of Prokofiev's 8th Sonata, which received the same  attention to melodic delineation and shading that had illuminated earlier  offerings.

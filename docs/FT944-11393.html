			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes To The Polls: Despair or joy for hurricane Newt Gingrich Tomorrow could be the greatest day in the political life of Newton Leroy Gingrich, known as Newt. It could also be the night of his greatest disappointment. In the rosy scenario, he could end it Speaker-presumptive of the House of the Representatives and conceivably with Republican majorities in both chambers. In the nightmare, he could wind up saddled with the blame for raising Republican expectations too high and for the commission of grievous tactical errors that excited the Democrats sufficiently for them to hold on. Rarely has a party's national campaign been so shaped by a single person as has this year's midterm effort by the 51-year-old, Pennsylvania-born radical conservative congressman who has represented Georgia's sixth district, now encompassing the spreading northern suburbs of Atlanta, since 1979. Other prominent Republicans have done their bit, but many, like Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and even Phil Gramm of Texas, have seemed to have at least half an eye on a still bigger election in 1996 or, schooled in political pragmatism rather than confrontation, wondered if the party was not going too far to the right. Such ambitions and reservations have never clouded Newt Gingrich's mind. An articulate ideologue by conviction and a guerrilla fighter by nature, he has always seen the Reagan era as one with much unfinished business and the Bush and Clinton presidencies as inconvenient interruptions. A political product of a Congress he professes to despise, he is intent on changing not only its faces but also its collective mind. It was Mr Gingrich who first demanded that the midterm elections be turned not into a series of local battles but first and foremost into a national referendum on the Clinton presidency. Republican candidates beyond number have sought to identify their Democratic opponents with Mr Clinton, often using commercials where a candidate's face metamorphoses into one of the president. It was Gingrich, too, who in September trotted out more than 300 Republican candidates for the House on to the steps of the Capitol to sign the 10-point 'contract with America' - instantly assailed by the wittier Democrats as a mob-style 'contract on America'. This committed them to introduce, within 100 days of the convening of the new Congress, legislation to balance the budget by constitutional amendment, to establish the budget line item veto (empowering a president to eliminate any specific item of spending), to limit the terms served in Congress, to cut taxes, and other items long on the conservative wish-list. He has never been shy about his purpose or his methods, rarely less so than in an interview with the Washington Post last month encapsulating the logic behind the twin strategies. 'We reached two conclusions about May. One was that we might win a majority. . . the other that the country was going to be so negative about Clinton that if we went as negative as the country was, we would drive down participation because people would be sick of the process. And so we consciously designed the contract around these two observations.' Dissuading people from voting might seem an odd way to win elections, but not for a party which normally benefits when the turn-out is low. Reasonably secure of his own re-election, he has personally visited about one third of the House's 435 districts in the last two months, energising Republicans with his own fiery brand of take-no-prisoners oratory. Not for nothing is he known as Hurricane Newt or his political potion as containing Eye of Newt. Yet, until the strategic decisions were taken on this campaign and until he led the successful Republican attempt to block virtually all that remained of the Clinton legislative programme, he had sometimes co-operated with the White House. Steeped in opposition and obstruction, he will find tomorrow if he also gets a slice of real power. If he does, his exercise of that authority will make him either Bill Clinton's worst bete noir or his political saviour or both. Newt Gingrich would ask for nothing less.</p>

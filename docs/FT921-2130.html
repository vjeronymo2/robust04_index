			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ALUMINIUM prices broke above chart targets on the LME to end firmer. Dealers said three-month metal moved above resistance around Dollars 1,320 a tonne when US speculative buying touched off buy-stops, although profit-taking emerged above Dollars 1,330 a tonne. LME stocks today are forecast to rise by up to 3,000 tonnes. NICKEL moved off earlier lows on talk that the Kambalda strike was escalating. The initial declines towards Dollars 7,400 a tonne for three-month metal attracted Chinese buying and merchant covering, dealers said. Fresh arrivals of Russian nickel are expected, and will keep the market under some pressure. LME warehouse stocks are likely to rise today. Nearby London COCOA prices closed ahead after rallying on the dollar's strength against sterling. Dealers said short-covering, some industry offtake and talk of fund buying all helped to support prices, lifting the market off lows reached on unconfirmed rumours of origin sales. The market was still looking for estimates of the Ivory Coast mid-crop which could be more than 125,000 tonnes. In Chicago widespread market talk of large-scale damage to WHEAT crops in the High Plains region contributed to firmer prices by midday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

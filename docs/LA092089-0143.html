			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TON OF COKE AT COLOMBIA OFFICIAL'S HOME;  </P> <P> U.S.-BOUND COCAINE SEIZED; 2 MORE ASSASSINATIONS IN MEDELLIN  </P> <P> Police announced today the discovery of more than a ton of U.S.-bound cocaine  at the home of a local government official and reported two more assassinations  in the hometown of the Medellin drug cartel.  </P> <P> Colombian authorities said they found 2,200 pounds of cocaine in cigarette  boxes bound for the United States at the home of Pedro Rodrigeuz, a former  council member of the Atlantic Department, of which the city of Baranquilla is  the capital.  </P> <P> Announcing the discovery, Col. Luis Lopez Aponte, the region's police chief,  said four people were arrested in the search Tuesday night and the hunt was on  for Rodrigeuz.  </P> <P> The seizure came just hours after Atty. Gen. Alfonso Gomez said that  infiltration of the government and military by the narcotics traffickers is  interfering with the war on drugs.  </P> <P> In Medellin, gunmen shot and killed a military intelligence officer, Lt. Cesar  Garcia Saavedra, and veterinarian Guillermo Leon Uribe in a restaurant Tuesday  night, the Ministry of Defense reported in Bogota.  </P> <P> The killings are the latest in a string of assassinations and bombings since  "the Extraditables," a hit squad linked to the cocaine cartels, declared "total  war" on the nation in response to President Virgilio Barco Varga's  reinstatement of a treaty with the United States to permit the extradition of  drug traffickers.  </P> <P> In an interview published today, a former Brazilian official said eight of  Colombia's 12 most-wanted drug barons are hiding in Brazil.  </P> <P> Laercio Pellegrino, former president of Brazil's Federal Drug Council, citing  what he said was information from the State Department, told the newspaper O  Globo the kingpins have been trafficking from their hideout in Brazil since  Barco launched his massive anti-drug offensive in August.  </P></p>

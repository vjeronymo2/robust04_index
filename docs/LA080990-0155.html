			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 8 COUNTY STUDENTS GET A SUMMERTIME FEEL FOR THE ARTS  </P> <P> For almost a month now, eight Ventura County students have been living in  dormitories at Oakland's Mills College and attending the California State  Summer School for the Arts. This is how some of them spent their summer  vacation:  </P> <P> * Working in ceramics, Pablo Weiss created an Amazonian chief, who sits naked  on a couch, watching a nuclear bomb explode on television. The couch sits on a  map of South America; the TV set, atop a miniature Aztec temple.  </P> <P> "So it's kind of a metaphor for how Indians want couches and things these  days," Weiss said, "and how they may be oblivious" to the damage technology  does to the natural world.  </P> <P> The program, Weiss said, gives them "intermittent theory -- lectures and slide  shows. But for the most part, we're really cranking out the work, and getting  our money's worth."  </P> <P> Stephanie Sunwoo, 16, who will be a junior at Oxnard High School this fall,  took classes in photography, design and drawing, and video, learning to work  with moving images and a 4-by-5-inch still camera for the first time.  </P> <P> "A lot of projects you can't finish during class. You have to come after," she  said. On the nights she wasn't coming in after class, there were on-campus film  screenings to consider.  </P> <P> " 'Citizen Kane,' or 'The Fabulous Baker Boys,' or 'Doctor Strangelove' -- they  try to accommodate everybody's tastes," Sunwoo said. "Today is 'Children of a  Lesser God.' "  </P> <P> * Paul Disbrow, 17, of Simi Valley High School, studied visual arts -- and was  struck by the teachers' attitudes.  </P> <P> "You can talk to them on a one-to-one basis and really feel equal," he said.  "They don't say, 'Well, that's not quite what I had in mind.' They let you do  what you want to do, and I think that's one of the most important things."'  </P> <P> * "I made this saber-toothed tiger with armored stuff on it," said Jeff  Plamenig, a 17-year-old visual arts student from Simi Valley High School. "And  I have this armored rider on it, and he's holding on to a staff with a blade on  the end. He has a helmet on, with horns on the top. I just thought it up."  </P> <P> Plamenig took courses in ceramics, design, printmaking and drawing, along with  an Issues in Art discussion group that met at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> "You really have to get up early around here," Plamenig said.  </P></p>

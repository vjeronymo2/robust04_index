			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: GA's preferred option General Accident's announcement that it will follow Commercial Union into the preference share market underlines the gaping hole blown by recession in the balance sheet of the UK insurance industry. An issue of perhaps Pounds 150m should be feasible given GA's excellent connections among Scots institutions, many of which are increasing holdings of fixed-interest securities. This would improve GA's solvency margin by around 5 percentage points. Yet the margin fell by that amount in the last eight months alone. With an investment portfolio delivering little or no growth, no retained earnings to rely on and the cost of maintaining an uncovered dividend, GA is running just to stand still. The uncut interim pay-out drained Pounds 43m from net assets in the first half alone. A slug of preference capital would certainly improve the odds in favour of the dividend being maintained from here on. More than anything this may explain yesterday's 2 per cent rise in the share price. However, yesterday's interim results also suggest that GA has reached the turn at an operating level. The biggest concern must be that profitability is so far being restored at the expense of market share. UK premium income in the first half was virtually unchanged over last year, despite sharply higher rates on some lines of business. A sceptic might question the wisdom of shedding so much business at the bottom of the cycle. One suspects that GA is only too aware of the conflict. A preference issue may give it breathing space to preserve market share until conditions improve.</p>

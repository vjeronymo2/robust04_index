			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / SIB warning for investment body THE Personal Investment Authority has been told by the Securities and Investments Board that it will not receive authorisation to become the new super-regulator of retail financial businesses unless it can prove it will radically improve the regulation of the market. A confidential letter from Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, to Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of the authority, says the board wants a 'step change in regulatory standards across the whole marketplace'. If the authority is unable to deliver the necessary improvements, SIB warns, 'we will look to other ways of achieving them'. The letter represents the toughest action to date by Mr Large to try to improve standards of financial regulation since he became SIB chairman last summer. Senior life insurance and financial services company officials warned yesterday that SIB's tough stance might make it impossible for the PIA to be formed as the regulator, because of opposition from the financial industry. 'This is the end of the PIA,' said one member of the authority's formation committee. The authority is intended to be formed by the merger of two self-regulatory organisations - Lautro for unit trust and life companies, and Fimbra for financial intermediaries. As the letter says, it is intended to be the lead regulator for firms selling 'life, pensions and unit trust products'. Mr Large says: 'We now need to deliver a higher standard of investor protection in this market place than has been possible hitherto.' The seven-page letter sets out detailed conditions the authority must meet if it is to gain SIB approval. The letter emphasises the authority cannot automatically accept all members of Lautro and Fimbra, saying: 'SIB expects members of the PIA to be subjected to a rigorous assessment of fitness, properness and financial standing.' The process of vetting the potential 7,000 members must start now and ought to be largely completed by the middle of the year, SIB says. SIB also says the authority must demonstrate that it will have the resources for improved monitoring of retail financial businesses and for more effective enforcement of rules governing the industry. 'We are looking for a substantial commitment of top-quality resources and it is obvious that this will be expensive,' the letter says. 'SIB is aware that this will be unwelcome to PIA members, particularly the smaller ones.' The letter also criticises the authority's proposal to have a board of 30 directors. It says that number should be halved. In response to complaints from consumer groups that the authority would put the interests of financial firms above those of investors, the SIB says that a majority of the PIA's board members should be 'public-interest directors' rather than representatives of the financial industry. The SIB has responded to consumer complaints in a second respect. It is insisting that the authority unify its procedures for handling complaints from the public immediately, rather than continuing to operate the existing complaints procedures of Fimbra and Lautro in tandem. The Consumers' Association welcomed the letter's position on public-interest directors and on the tough procedures for admitting members to the authority. However, Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumer Association's money group, criticised Mr Large's vision of the scope of the authority for not including mortgages and deposit-based products.

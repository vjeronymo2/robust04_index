			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Leo Custers: "The Reemergence of Mobutu Sese </F> Seko"]    [Text] Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko is using the  drama in Rwanda to give his international standing a good  clean-up. His new importance is not due to himself, but to  Zaire's crucial position in Central Africa. The only safe way  for the French soldiers who President Francois Mitterrand wants  to send to Rwanda is through Zaire and not through Tanzania  because the entire eastern side of Rwanda is in the hands of the  RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. Ugandan President Museveni is on  the RPF side. In the southern Sudan, there is a total war  between the government army and the south in revolt.    At the OAU summit in Tunis last week, Mobutu called for a  military intervention to end the slaughter and fighting, if the  warring parties did not succeed in doing so on their own.  Mobutu used the same words as French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe, also indicating that the proposal to send a multinational  peacekeeping force to Rwanda was a French-Zairian initiative.  By supporting Paris's stance, Mobutu increases his own  importance.    Mobutu immediately capitalized on his higher status as a  French ally in the Rwandan drama. At the end of the OAU summit  in Tunis last week, Mobutu commented ironically on his "Belgian  friends." "Belgium and Zaire," Mobutu said, "are two totally  different things. They have nothing to do with one another. My  only concern is that everyone should be able to make their bed  as they like to sleep in it." In other words: Belgium, mind  your own business. There is nothing in Zaire for you any more.    His new self-assurance was also shown in his treatment of  opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi. Tshisekedi is officially  still the prime minister, appointed by the Sovereign Conference.  First, Mobutu gave Tshisekedi a lesson by "arresting" him and  keeping him overnight. The argument went that Tshisekedi was on  prohibited military territory. Mobutu wanted to make it clear  that Tshisekedi was a normal citizen like any other, without  special rights and privileges, and that he should no longer have  any illusions. Then Mobutu had the Transitional Parliament, in  the absence of the Radical Opposition, appoint the old faithful  [Joseph] Kengo wa Dondo as the new head of government. As far  as Mobutu is concerned, Tshisekedi is a "negligible quantity."  And who is disagreeing with him: The groups who supported the  UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] leader in the  past are completely silent now.    The objections against Mobutu expressed in the past,  including by France, have now been forgotten. The French  paratroopers who, according to Paris, are going to end the  bloodbath in Rwanda, must after all not only have safe access,  but also a safe exit route. And that only goes through Zaire.  For this reason it is important for Paris that Mobutu is on  France's side at this moment. Moreover no one can predict  whether and when "something" will happen in Burundi. And in  that case too Mobutu is the only point of support, not only for  the French, but also for the Belgians, at least if the Belgians,  who would then be caught like rats in a trap, are to be  evacuated.    In any case, the Zairian president is seizing the  opportunity  offered to him with both hands to promote himself as the key man  in Zaire. For the last three years, he has been given the cold  shoulder by Belgium, France, and the United States. The Rwandan  drama shows that in the present circumstances they can no longer  allow themselves to do so. Mobutu knows that.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii expressed hope Wednesday [1 June] that Japan and the  United States would reach a trade agreement before the July  summit of leading industrial nations.    He said his ministry, which is in charge of the insurance  sector in the talks under a bilateral trade "framework," will  make "utmost efforts" to reach an accord by the July 8 start of  the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Naples, Italy.    The insurance talks started earlier in the day, three and a  half months after breaking down on February 11 over how to  measure progress in opening Japan's markets.    Fujii told a regular news conference he knew nothing of the  details of the day's Tokyo talks, as he had been in Diet  hearings all day.    On the economy, despite a surge in the stock market and  upturns in several economic indicators, Fujii said he cannot yet  judge that the economy has hit bottom as "not necessarily good"  factors continue to cloud the emerging bright signs.</p>

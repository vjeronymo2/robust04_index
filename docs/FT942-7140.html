			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (5): International role denied - Foreign relations Brazil's foreign ministry holds a privileged place in the country's capital, Brasilia - overlooking the Congress building and opposite the Palace of Justice. The location is deserved because the ministry, known as Itamaraty, is one of the country's most able and important. But it is a cruel punishment for the diplomats, who are forced each day to look at the cause of their frustration - politicians. Despite Brazil's size and potential, it is unable to play the international role many in Itamaraty seek. Instead, its importance and negotiating strength are compromised by the political failure to stabilise the economy and bring down inflation. Brazil's economic instability is also acting as a brake on the development of Mercosul - the free-trade zone formed between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay which is due to come into force on January 1 - and plans for a wider free trade area to incorporate most of South America. Mercosul has progressed much faster than cynics first suggested. But longer-term questions remain unanswered, and it would not be surprising if key partners such as Argentina chose to link with the US-led North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) grouping, rather than remain tied to Brazil's bumpy ride. Brazil's cultural and trading ties have traditionally been with Europe, original home to much of the country's population, and the US, which emerged as Brazil's biggest foreign investor early this century. But the relationship with the US is complicated, and often troubled. Itamaraty is itself sometimes accused of being anti-American, although this partly reflects the broad range of subjects where the two countries' interests do not coincide. Brazil's concerns about a proposed linkage by the US between social and environmental issues and trade is the latest example of underlying tension. Relations have improved this year, however, with the Brazilian Senate's approval of a treaty to allow inspections of some of its nuclear installations and Brazil's acceptance of US demands on patents and copyrights. Last month's completion of Brazil's foreign bank debt restructuring, achieved without IMF blessing, also removed another stumbling block. But it is Mercosul, and Brazil's future within South America, where most change is occuring. The Mercosul treaty, signed in March 1991, calls for a customs union to be ready by next year through the implementation of a common external tariff. Tariffs have already been reduced on many goods, and trade within the group has grown extremely rapidly - more than doubling since 1990 to about Dollars 8bn last year. This partly reflects the complementary nature of the two biggest economies, Brazil's industrial strength being offset by Argentina's competitiveness as a producer of primary products such as foodstuffs and oil. Difficulties remain - for example, Brazil's desire to retain high tariffs to protect its computer and telecommunications industries. As a result, the common external tariff is likely to apply to only about 85 per cent of products. Remaining goods will only be harmonised from 2001. Brazil is now proposing to use Mercosul as the base for a wider trade agreement among all South American countries. This would be a simple free trade agreement rather than a customs union, and would be jointly negotiated by the Mercosul nations. 'We hope to use Mercosul as a platform for further trade liberalisation throughout South America,' says Ambassador Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, in charge of Mercosul issues at Itamaraty. Brazil's economic dominance of the continent means that most countries will be interested in joining, although Chile's priority clearly lies in gaining entry to Nafta. Even if countries do not formally join, there is an increasing move towards lower tariff barriers and more open trade. Argentina's position is more complicated, and at times the country commitment to Mercosul has appeared in doubt as it contemplated its chances of entry to Nafta. Complaints by senior Argentine leaders about Brazil's economic instability have also angered the Brazilian side. Argentine claims of dumping against Brazilian companies are rebuffed by Brazil's suggestion that the Argentine currency is overvalued. Teething problems and tensions are hardly surprising, but they hide a longer-term problem. Brazil's big industrial economy is far from ready to compete within a US-led trade area such as Nafta, suggesting that an Americas-wide agreement is still many years away. But if more countries such as Chile opt for the North America model, there is a chance Brazil will be isolated. Back at Itamaraty, the diplomats must hope the politicians sort out Brazil's many other problems in time.</p>

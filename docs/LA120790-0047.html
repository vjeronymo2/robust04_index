			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: HYPNOTIC FOCUS ON RURAL POOR IN 'MUD'  </P> <P> It's not easy for the urban mind to conceive the reality of the bitterly  disenfranchised world of Maria Irene Fornes' "Mud," at Waterfront Stage. But  for those of us who have seen that world first-hand, it's all too real.  </P> <P> Set in the hills of Appalachia, the three-character drama focuses on the  hopeless quest of a young woman named Mae to educate and free herself from the  shackles of ignorance and oppression that bind her endlessly in the futility of  false dreams. She goes to school but isn't beyond the simplest rudiments of the  three R's.  </P> <P> Mae is also hog-tied to Lloyd, a boy her father brought home years ago to keep  her company. "Like animals," she says, when they were old enough to "mate" --  they did. Lloyd is now riddled with infection and his resulting impotence is  like a stake driven between them. Enter Henry, to drive the stake further.  </P> <P> "Mud" creates an uneasiness in the mind, but it's the uneasiness of recognizing  counterparts outside its primitive setting. The mud in which Mae is sinking  still seeps into the lives of America's uneducated. The expert delineation of  motifs and moods in Frederique Michel's direction helps settle this uneasiness  in the hypnotic warmth of the production.  </P> <P> The cast is an immeasurable part of the effect. Katherine Burke's marvelous  honesty and power as Mae are excellent counterpoint to the delicious naivete of  John Blevins' beautifully modulated Lloyd. Duane Whitaker unfailingly reads the  simpleton's pomposity in Henry's sense of superiority in the trio's colorful  dance of death.  </P> <P> "Mud," Waterfront Stage, 250 Santa Monica Pier, Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m.  Indefinitely. "12.50; (213) 393-6672. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Candles' Waxes Poetic as 'Carlotta'  </P> <P> Wallace Stevens' 1919 theater-piece "Carlos Among the Candles" translates well  into "Carlotta," the opening one-act in the Fountain Theatre's "Alone." Under  Leslie Paxton's taut direction, Deborah Lawlor is intricate and imposing as a  lonely soul who finds visions of her self-imposed psychic estrangement in the  dim flickering of mesmerizing candles.  </P> <P> The poetic brevity and scope of "Carlotta" makes an interesting contrast to the  longer "Lit 305," which follows. Ralph Hunt's one-man play zeroes in on another  private world, that of Prof. Feeney, a poetry instructor whose life is falling  apart and has left him to hold on to his last iamb for dear life. We watch his  final class as he injects among his few remaining students his deep,  debilitating fears of failure in life.  </P> <P> Dan Mason is monumental as Feeney, his quick glances at his students and the  anger in his physical movements illuminating the character as much as his  words. This compelling performance is directed by Guy Giarrizzo.  </P> <P> "Alone," Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood; Tuesdays-Wednesdays,  8 p.m. Ends Dec. 11. $12; (213) 663-1525 TDD (213) 663-2235. Running time: 1  hour, 35 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Rites of Passage for a Gay Chicano  </P> <P> Growing up gay and Chicano is bad enough -- but Luis Alfaro did it in Boyle  Heights. Fortunately he had a couple of cholos as guardian angels. They're only  two of the characters that populate Alfaro's memories, characters which he  views with the exact, discerning eye of a poet.  </P> <P> In his performance piece "Downtown," Alfaro digs into his formative years for  the building blocks of his personality, and it's a tasty selection of images,  from his rotating electric Virgin Mary that turned on its pedestal to bless the  whole room, to the night his mother broke taboos and dragged his father from a  neighborhood bar, to his image of Lupe -- an illegal alien who slaves all week  at a sewing machine to dance in splendor on Saturday night.  </P> <P> Tom Dennison's direction is imaginative and forthright, and the one quibble  would be that Alfaro hasn't given himself enough time to expand the images that  flash too quickly across the imagination.  </P> <P> "Downtown," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18 St., Santa Monica;  Friday-Sunday, 8:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $10; (213) 453-1755. Running time: 1  hour.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Snappy Satire at the blak &amp; bloo  </P> <P> After a delightful satire on the opening numbers of musical revues, the cast of  "Cut to the Chase" promises not to do that kind of show. Then they go ahead and  do that kind of show, right on the tiny stage at blak &amp; bloo.  </P> <P> Most of it is charming, some of it is funny, and the cast of five sparkles.  Most of the sparkle comes from Judy Nazemetz and Rick Crom. Both are good in a  familiar sketch about a restaurant where the waiters sing opera -- and so do  the customers -- in which Crom has a hilarious operatic death aria after  stabbing himself. His characters throughout are funny and dead on, particularly  in the quickies "Dean Martin Forgets" and as a Bogart Santa testifying in "The  Candy Cane Mutiny." Nazemetz breaks the place up with her incisive portrait of  a soused employee bemoaning Christmas in general and her office party in  particular.  </P> <P> If all the sketches (by Crom and Mike Colasuonno) aren't laugh-getters, the  original score by Crom is, and it fills in the gaps brilliantly.  </P> <P> "Cut to the Chase," blak &amp; bloo, 7574 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood;  Wednesdays-Thursdays, 8 p.m. Ends Dec. 20. $7.50 (two drink minimum); (213)  876-1120. Running time: 1 hour. 10 minutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Firing Chamber' an Exercise in Banality  </P> <P> The script of David Matzke's "The Firing Chamber," a play about untalented  pseudo-artists in L.A., should have been left in the artists' studio when it  was burned down for the insurance money. Even two directors (Jim Holmes and  John Otrin) couldn't pull it together.  </P> <P> The actors don't have any better luck surviving the banality of the writing,  though one scene between Ron Max (who hammers a lot on a strip of metal trim)  and Bo Zenga (an "IBM sculptor") does provide a wonderful lesson in how boring  Method acting can be when no shred of technique is involved.  </P> <P> The "art" provided by Tim Callahan for the central character's "gallery  installation" would be turned down by a yard sale.  </P> <P> "The Firing Chamber," Coast Playhouse, 8325 Santa Monica Blvd.;  Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinee Sun., 3 p.m. Ends Dec. 23. $10-$12; (213)  650-8507. Running time: 1 hour. 50 minutes.  </P></p>

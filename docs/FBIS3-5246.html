"Thai military helped fresh Khmer Rouge troops come through  Thai soil from Pailin," General Khin Yean said referring to the  Khmer Rouge's main headquarteres in northwest Cambodia.    The general said there was no doubt the guerrillas were  helped by the Thai military in retaking the base at Anlung Veng  which served as the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for guerrilla  operations in north and central Cambodia.    "I am 100 percent sure, not 99.9 but 100 percent sure," the  general said, speaking at this rear control base about 50  kilometres (30 miles) west of Anlung Veng.    All around the base troops were carrying out repairs on  tanks  and bringing up supplies for what government officers said would  be an imminent government counter-attack. The general was  emphatic in saying he did not blame the Thai government for  Phnom Penh's defeat at Anlung Veng.    "But we blame the Thai military and Thai businessmen who  co-operate together to make money from logs," he said.    The fresh Khmer Rouge troops, who numbered up to 500, were  joined by small groups of guerrillas from surrounding areas and  by several hundred hill-tribe fighters, the general said.  Government troops said they were frightened by the  hill-tribesmen. "We shot at mountain people but they kept on  coming, it's like they were not afraid to die," said one  soldier, who retreated through the jungle for two days without  food and water.    "I think the Khmer Rouge gave them some special medicine and  they get drunk. They came at us like they didn't seem to care,  like life was not important," private Penn Nouvat said. Some of  the Montagnards were in Khmer Rouge uniform but others were  dressed in civilian clothes, government soldiers said.    General Khin Yean said the Montagnards were from the Kouy  tribe who came from Cambodia's remote northern and northeastern  provinces. Ta Mok, the notorious one-legged Khmer Rouge general  and commander of Anlung Veng, hired them as mercenaries and was  paying them handsomely, he said. The Khmer Rouge were not short  of money, he said, as they sold concessions to log in the rich  forests surrounding Anlung Veng to Thai business interests, many  of them controlled by the military.    A government official in the provincial town of Siem Reap  said the Thais were helping the Khmer Rouge as they had a lot of  money tied up in logs that had been cut but were still lying on  the ground around Anlung Veng.    "There was about 150,000 cubic meters of wood lying there  when we went in and a cubic meter (35 cubic feet) of top quality  timber sells for around 80 US dollars," the government official  said. Government officers confirmed reports that trucks crossed  over from Thailand to start collecting the wood soon after the  base was recaptured by the Khmer Rouge on February 24.  Government officers said the guerrillas were equipped with  sophisticated anti-tank weaponry, which they believed to be  German made "Armburst" anti-tank missiles.    "I think that Thailand sold this kind of weapon to the Khmer  Rouge because we have never seen them use it in action before,"  tank commander General Ben Hort said. But a government military  source in Phnom Penh said the weapons may have been given to the  royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia] forces and the  non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF)  and then sold to the Khmer Rouge who were their allies in the  resistance war against the Phnom Penh regime.    The war ended with the signing of the 1991 Paris peace  accords which paved the way for United Nations supervised  elections and the formation of a coalition government made up of  the Phnom Penh regime, FUNCINPEC and the political wing of the  KPNLF.</p>

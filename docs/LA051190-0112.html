			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS AWARDED $8.1 MILLION FOR DEFECTS  </P> <P> In what was believed to be the largest award in a construction-defect case in  San Diego, a Tierrasanta homeowners' association has won an $8.1-million  judgment against a builder, who, in the jury's opinion, constructed homes that  were unlivable and unsafe.  </P> <P> The verdict, amounting to $162,000 for each of the 50 single-family homes, was  delivered Tuesday to El Cajon Superior Court Judge Dennis Adams and announced  by the homeowners' association Thursday.  </P> <P> The action against Christiana Community Builders was first filed in March,  1985, and may be appealed, attorneys said.  </P> <P> At issue in the suit were leaky roofs, poorly compacted soil, inadequate  foundations and substandard attic framing that homeowners in the Villa  Dominique Courts residential development in Tierrasanta say were caused by  Christiana.  </P> <P> The homes were constructed from 1978 to 1980 on Mayita Way, Oporto Court,  Oporto Place, Ocana Street and Quito Court and, according to the lawsuit, were  beset by leaky roofs almost immediately. Christiana agreed to make repairs  until late 1984, but ignored all requests after that, the suit alleged.  </P> <P> "We expected Christiana to honor their contractual obligation," said Jim Price,  president of the homeowners' association since 1985. "What we got were bubble  gum and Band-Aids. Nothing they did made our homes livable."  </P> <P> "Elated? Very much so," said J. Michael Reed, the lawyer for the homeowners.  "The verdict was a little bit better than we expected."  </P> <P> Reed said he believed that the outcome of the case hinged on the testimony of  expert witnesses, such as architects and soil experts, who said the homes would  suffer extensive damage in the event of an earthquake greater than 6.0 on the  Richter scale.  </P> <P> "The jury told us our architectural expert came across as the most honest  person they'd ever met," Reed said. "Whereas, they said the soils person for  the other side was not credible. They said even his body language gave him  away."  </P> <P> Reed said symptoms of the damage included water leaking into the home "every  time it rained," in addition to cracks in the foundation slabs, "entire roofs  having to be replaced," and so on.  </P> <P> Price, the president of the homeowners' association, said, "The problems were  so bad that many owners sold their homes and left the area."  </P> <P> Reed said that, if the decision is not appealed, money could be awarded to the  plaintiffs' fund within 60 days, with improvements commencing almost  immediately.  </P> <P> Executives with Christiana were unavailable for comment.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEILENSON SEEKS $6 MILLION FOR WATERWAY PROJECTS  </P> <P> In a bid to revitalize the Los Angeles River and expand recreational facilities  in the Sepulveda Basin, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) will make his  case for $6 million in proposed federal funding before a congressional panel  today.  </P> <P> If Beilenson's visions of a greener San Fernando Valley are to become reality,  however, they must first survive stiff competition for money in the tight  federal budget.  </P> <P> Beilenson will ask for $1 million to study the river's recreational,  transportation and water conservation potential. He is acting at the behest of  Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who hopes to transform the waterway -- used  primarily for flood control for decades -- into a greenbelt featuring bike  paths and riding trails.  </P> <P> At the same time, Beilenson will request $5 million for additional landscaping,  trails and open space in the Sepulveda Basin, which has been called the  Valley's Central Park. The proposal includes $3 million to create parkland from  80 acres at Burbank Boulevard and Woodley Avenue, now leased for sod farming.  </P> <P> Beilenson, whose 23rd District includes the West Valley, plans to present the  financing proposals to the energy and water development subcommittee of the  House Appropriations Committee at its annual "California Day" hearing today.  </P> <P> During this Capitol Hill rite of spring, the subcommittee sets aside several  hours to hear from California lawmakers as well as representatives of state  agencies and the public about proposed flood control, navigation, harbor,  irrigation and water supply projects.  </P> <P> The panel will decide which specific proposals from California and other states  will be included in the national Energy and Water Development bill for the  1990-91 fiscal year.  </P> <P> A senior subcommittee staffer said that because of next year's extremely tight  federal budget, projects now receiving funding are far more likely to be  financed than new proposals.  </P> <P> "The decision-making process involves more than simply following certain  guidelines," said a Beilenson aide familiar with the process. "There's a lot of  politics, and there's a lot of subjective judgments involved about which  projects will be funded and which won't. At this stage, there are just too many  unknowns to predict whether our efforts will be successful."  </P> <P> Under Bradley's initiative, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains  part of the flood control channel, would conduct an 18-month study of various  proposals to enhance public use of the river. They include establishing bicycle  paths, improving existing flood controls and removing concrete paving along the  riverbed to create a more natural river environment.  </P> <P> Another proposal to be studied calls for water treated by two sewage plants  along the river to be diverted into a cleared area and permitted to seep into  the soil, recharging the ground water tables. The treated water now flows into  the river and out to the Pacific.  </P> <P> The river begins in the southwest Valley and flows east along the northern base  of the Santa Monica Mountains and past downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach.  </P> <P> Bradley's plan represents only one of several competing visions for the river,  which has experienced a recent renaissance in public awareness.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda) wants to build a three-lane freeway in  the riverbed. The Los Angeles County Transportation Committee has set aside  $100,000 to study Katz's initiative, which would integrate the roadway with  parks, businesses and housing along the river banks.  </P> <P> The Army Corps of Engineers, meanwhile, is studying a proposal to spend about  $250 million to raise the river's flood control levees, which are between 20  and 25 feet high, by several feet.  </P> <P> And state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) is pursuing a plan similar to  Bradley's. Torres persuaded a Senate committee last week to earmark $200,000  for the Coastal Conservancy to prepare a master plan to turn the river into a  park and recreation area.  </P> <P> Much of the 2,150-acre Sepulveda Basin is leased by the Corps to the city of  Los Angeles for recreational purposes. In the mid-1980s, Congress appropriated  $10 million, which the city matched, to develop 160 acres as a park and 60  acres as a wildlife reserve.  </P> <P> Lake Balboa Park, built around a 26-acre fishing and boating lake, will be open  to the public later this year. The wildlife area was completed and opened  earlier this year.  </P> <P> The $5 million sought for next year would include $1 million for traffic  barriers and additional landscaping at Lake Balboa Park; $1 million for trails,  terracing and plantings to enhance the creek that runs through the basin; and  $3 million for landscaping, parking, picnic tables and restrooms at the 80  acres now leased for agricultural use.  </P> <P> The city, in turn, would put up a matching $5 million for construction of the  park's water supply system and would assume the expenses of operating and  maintaining the facilities.  </P> <P> "Green space and outdoor recreation areas are scarce in the San Fernando  Valley," Beilenson said in testimony prepared for delivery today. "These parks  will go a long way toward meeting the recreation needs of the 1 1/2 million  Valley residents."  </P></p>

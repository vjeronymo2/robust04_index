			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Crumbling Prague cries out for renovation: Urgent action is needed to restore the city of Bohemian kings IN THE alleyways behind the Gothic and Baroque facades of old Prague, railway sleepers are propping up the city of the Bohemian kings. Timbers wedged between the street and crumbling piers hold ancient bricks in place. Heavy scaffolding like miners' trestles, protects passers-by from masonry which threatens to topple. Many of the historic buildings in the federal capital's showpiece quarters are falling down; the need for renovation is pressing, and not just for aesthetic reasons. Prague needs the space - primarily for housing, which is at a premium, and for offices and other development. 'We have whole gypsy villages living in a few rooms (in the centre),' says Mr Ivan Plicka, principal engineer in the city architect's office. Much of what is inhabited is inadequate: 40 per cent of flats in the inner city have only a kitchen and one other room for living space. Fifteen per cent lack a bathroom, a toilet or both. Refitting unused and skeletal properties - some of them very old - and converting sub-standard ones is a way of 'growing' within the confines of an existing municipal plan. The city authorities want this to happen. It would take pressure off the public transport system, which carries too many commuters to bleak and services-poor estates on the periphery. There is also an environmental consideration - modernising heating systems would reduce the current dependence on polluting brown coal as a fuel. But the task is large: 70,000 flats (14 per cent of Prague's total stock of 500,000 housing units) need 'thorough renewal', according to a report prepared by the city planning office. And, says Mr Ivo Oberstein, the chief architect, 30,000 new apartments are required. No-one, however, is sure where the money will come from. No public funds have been earmarked for restoration work. New legislation on heritage issues  -expected to define priorities and the division of responsibilities - is still being debated. Mr Miroslav Base - an architect at Surpmo, the national institute for the reconstruction of historic towns and monuments, estimates that Koruna 1bn (Pounds 20m) is needed annually for the next 10 to 15 years simply to halt the decay of old edifices within the 775 hectares of historic Prague alone. 'This is not so ambitious, but it is like constructing a bridge - you have to put a lot of stones, invisibly, under water before the columns appear above. It is the same story with the reconstruction business,' he says. Private landlords - of whom a number are beginning to re-appear - are discouraged from improving properties by the maintenance of controlled rents. Yet changes are afoot: the government plans soon to lift rent ceilings in three or four steps, the first by an estimated 180 per cent, according to Mr Oberstein. This should help to stimulate greater individual domestic investment. Prague is at the same time courting foreign investors. Last month, the city hosted a two-day workshop on its urban development which attracted architects from Finland, The British are pursuing professional ties and joint ventures. Trehearne &amp; Norman, the London architecture firm, maintains a small staff in Prague which is advising Surpmo on the way property is valued and managed in a market economy. DY Davies International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Richmond-based firm of architects DY Davies, collaborates with Prazsky Projektovy Ustav, the Czechoslovak architects, engineers and planners, in attempts to develop sites for offices and hotels. But progress is slow. Legal uncertainties dog works which manage to get under way. DY Davies had to abandon finished plans to rehabilitate the Kounicky Palace in Panska Street when a local bank contested the title under a recent law designed to reverse the expropriations made by the communists between 1948 and 1989. The palace - one of the few to retain an unspoiled courtyard - was once the address in Prague of the British Council, which had intended to return to the building after an absence of nearly 40 years. Some unorthodox conversion initiatives are more successful. Mr Daniel Spicka, one of two restorers of Chateau Valtice, a Baroque palace in Moravia, 270km from Prague, normally works from a three-room garret in the capital. When he first rented the premises it had only two rooms. Suspicious of one wall, he took a heavy hammer and knocked it down - to reveal a third vaulted chamber behind, in which he and the other members of his early music ensemble now practise.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHRYSLER ANNOUNCES PRICE HIKE  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. officially announced today that tentative retail prices on its  domestically built 1991 model cars will rise an average 0.9% from final 1990  prices, although its redesigned minivans could rise as much as 3.8% when  compared with similarly equipped 1990 versions.  </P> <P> But a base-to-base price comparison of similarly equipped models shows  Chrysler's new car prices could rise an average of 1.3% overall, with price  cuts placed on some of its slower-selling car lines such as the Dodge Monaco  and LeBaron coupe to spur their sales, Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett E.  Bidwell said during an informal press briefing.  </P> <P> Prices on its aging Jeep Cherokee have tentatively been reduced by an average  4.4%, in answer to increased competition in the four-door sport utility vehicle  market from new models like Ford Motor Co.'s Explorer, Bidwell said.  </P></p>

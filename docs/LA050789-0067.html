			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUR-YEAR SAGA OF WILLIE ED HARRIS;  </P> <P> GUN DEALINGS LEAVE TRAIL OF FRUSTRATION FOR LAWMEN  </P> <P> Gun shows seem harmless enough, on the surface.  </P> <P> There is even a festive, make-believe quality to these weekend events held at  county and state fairgrounds and at civic convention centers all over the  state.  </P> <P> Sometimes men dress in soldier of fortune camouflage outfits and walk around  carrying assault rifles. A man wearing a buckskin shirt with a six-shooter  strapped to his hip is just part of the crowd.  </P> <P> Many of the men who buy, sell and trade guns at the shows seem to truly adore  and appreciate these weapons. One federal firearms agent likens gun shows to  the gatherings of model train collectors. The guns are so plentiful and are  handled so casually that they don't seem to be quite real.  </P> <P> But they are real. And while most participants in these events are probably  just plain law-abiding, gun-loving folks, law enforcement officials say that  some of the transactions conducted at the shows are not only illegal but can be  dangerous to society.  </P> <P> Gun shows, say law enforcement officials, can be a marketplace for stolen  weapons and a source of firearms for criminals because weapons transactions at  these events frequently go unrecorded and handguns often are sold in violation  of state law requiring a 15-day "cooling-off" period and a criminal records  check of the purchaser.  </P> <P> The shows are sometimes linked, say investigators, to street gangs and  narcotics dealers and to international gun smuggling.  </P> <P> Take the case of Willie Ed Harris.  </P> <P> When police arrested Harris at a gun show in Pomona on May 5, 1985, it looked  like just another misdemeanor handgun sale.  </P> <P> After all, Harris was only one of 32 people charged with breaking California  law by selling handguns cash-and-carry to undercover police officers at the  weekend show. The miscreants could expect to be fined a few hundred dollars and  sent on their way.  </P> <P> But Harris' arrest proved to be not just another misdemeanor case. It was  instead the first step in a twisting, frustrating four-year journey that led  investigators from gun shows to violent street gangs in Los Angeles, to a drug  dealer, to a Filipino gun-smuggling operation and to a Los Angeles County  sheriff's reserve deputy who allegedly ran an illicit firearms business,  according to court records and interviews.  </P> <P> Pomona police realized that Harris was not simply guilty of a misdemeanor when  a criminal records check revealed two previous felony convictions: assault with  a deadly weapon involving a pistol in 1978 and lewd acts with a child under the  age of 14 in 1971.  </P> <P> It is against the law in California for a convicted felon to possess a  concealable weapon. It is also against state law for a person convicted of a  felony involving a gun to possess any type of firearm. In other words, Harris  was prohibited from possessing handguns, rifles or shotguns.  </P> <P> On May 15, 1985, 10 days after his arrest at the gun show, Pomona police  officers served a search warrant on Harris' home on Redondo Boulevard in a  working-class neighborhood west of downtown Los Angeles. They found two  handguns, a blackjack, a billy club and at least a dozen empty firearms boxes,  according to court records.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No-Contest Plea  </P> <P> On June 13, Harris pleaded no contest in Los Angeles County Superior Court in  Pomona to three felony counts of being a convicted felon in possession of  handguns and two felony counts of possessing illegal weapons: the blackjack and  billy club. Superior Court Judge Loren Miller Jr. put Harris on two years  probation without supervision, over the objections of Deputy Dist. Atty. Harold  W. Hoffman Jr. A condition of Harris' probation was that he not possess any  firearms.  </P> <P> Miller, in an interview, defended giving Harris probation rather than jail  time, stating:  </P> <P> "I remember how chicken I thought it was to arrest somebody at the gun show. I  thought that (selling guns) was the purpose of the gun show. . . . People are  roaming around the street killing each other and they (police) are all camped  out at the gun show arresting people."  </P> <P> On July 25, 1985, just over a month after he was put on probation, Pomona  police officers went back to Harris' home, accompanied by Los Angeles police  officers, and found two loaded AR-15 assault weapons and 12 boxes of  ammunition, according to court documents. Harris was again charged with  illegally possessing firearms and with child endangerment, because his children  allegedly had easy access to the guns.  </P> <P> Harris posted bail and remained free as the case worked its way through the  Superior Court system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Involvement  </P> <P> In the meantime, Los Angeles police and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms agents began taking a closer look at Harris.  </P> <P> In 1985, gangs in Los Angeles were beginning to use assault weapons in street  killings. In mid-April, 1986, police got a tip that "an individual by the name  of Bill was selling fully automatic weapons to (Rolling 30s Crips) street gang  members, as well as handguns," according to a search warrant affidavit on file  in Los Angeles Municipal Court.  </P> <P> The affidavit, signed by Los Angeles Police Detective Jaime Samaniego, stated  further that, "Your affiant learned through departmental channels that 'Bill'  is Willie Ed Harris."  </P> <P> On April 29, 1986, detectives from the LAPD Gang Activities Section arrested  Harris for allegedly selling an informant a Mac-10 assault pistol equipped with  an illegal silencer, according to court documents.  </P> <P> At the same time, police found an AR-15 assault rifle under Harris' house and  seized two boxes of bullets with explosive tips and nearly 1,000 rounds of  other ammunition from inside the home, according to court documents.  </P> <P> Harris told police that he had bought the Mac-10 assault pistol at a gun show.  </P> <P> "Defendant stated that (he) had sold numerous weapons at gun shows," says a  police report on file in Superior Court. "Defendant stated that he made extra  money by buying and selling weapons. He sold weapons to anyone, including  (narcotics) dealers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denies Gang Link  </P> <P> Harris told The Times that he did buy the Mac-10 and the silencer at a gun show  and that he sold them to an acquaintance nicknamed "Way Out" who turned out to  be working with the police. But he denied allegations that he sold weapons to  gang members or drug dealers.  </P> <P> The LAPD subsequently turned over its case against Harris to agents of the  federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  </P> <P> Ken Cates, who is now working for U.S. Customs, was a federal firearms agent on  the Harris case more than two years ago.  </P> <P> "My partner and I were working gangs," Cates recalled. "We identified him  (Harris) as an individual who in our estimation bought . . . quantities of guns  and then . . . sold them to black youth gang members."  </P> <P> Serial numbers on handgun boxes that had been seized from Harris were traced by  firearms agents to a federally licensed gun dealer in Highland Park.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strange Combination  </P> <P> James Glen Boyd and Willie Ed Harris would seem to be an odd couple to form a  partnership of any kind.  </P> <P> Harris, 46, is black, over 6 feet tall and overweight. One of his eyes stares  off into the distance as he talks. Harris says he suffers from high blood  pressure, gout and diabetes. And there are the multiple felony convictions.  </P> <P> Boyd, 52 at the time of the investigation, was described as white, tall and  handsome with gray hair. A firearms agent said he looked like actor Peter  Graves of "Mission Impossible." And whereas Harris was a convicted felon, Boyd  had been a Los Angeles County sheriff's reserve deputy since 1968 -- a position  with all the authority of a regular peace officer. He resigned in 1986 -- in  April, the same month that Harris was arrested with the Mac-10 and silencer.  </P> <P> Boyd did not operate a regular gun shop. Instead, he sold weapons out of his  home in Highland Park and at weekend gun shows.  </P> <P> Harris says he met Boyd at a gun show and began to peddle weapons for him on  consignment.  </P> <P> "Any weapon that Willie Harris could acquire," Cates said, "he would sell it to  anybody who wanted to buy it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Falsified Forms  </P> <P> During their investigation, firearms agents discovered 64 federal weapons  purchase forms that Harris and Boyd allegedly falsified apparently to conceal  the fact that Boyd was delivering weapons to a felon.  </P> <P> In the meantime, federal agents also discovered that during 1985 and 1986, Boyd  was falsifying firearms forms to sell large numbers of handguns to Nestor  Atacador, a citizen of the Philippines, who was smuggling the weapons out of  the country in microwave ovens for resale on the black market in the  Philippines and other countries, according to court documents and interviews.  </P> <P> Six of the handguns turned up in Japan on June 6, 1986, according to court  documents.  </P> <P> An informant told federal agents that Atacador met Boyd in a bar, but Cates  says he believes the two became acquainted at a gun show while Atacador was  looking for weapons.  </P> <P> On Oct. 31, 1986, a federal grand jury indicted Atacador for allegedly  attempting to smuggle 41 pistols out of the country and on nine counts of  allegedly falsifying federal firearm documents.  </P> <P> With Atacador under indictment, federal agents continued to put together their  case against Boyd.  </P> <P> But in December, 1986, Atacador jumped his $50,000 bond and disappeared. He  remains at large.  </P> <P> Still trying to build their case against Boyd, federal prosecutors struck a  deal with Harris in January, 1987, to gain his cooperation. In exchange for his  promise to testify against Boyd, prosecutors agreed to reduce pending charges  against Harris.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death Ends Inquiry  </P> <P> But none of this would prove to be enough to put Boyd in prison.  </P> <P> As federal agents in Los Angeles worked on their case against him, the gun  dealer moved to rural Virginia and bought an old colonial style home.  </P> <P> Then, some time after the deal with Harris was made, firearms agents in  Virginia called Los Angeles. Boyd was dead. Natural causes. Case closed.  </P> <P> On July 9, 1987, Harris, who remained free, was finally tried on the charges of  possessing the two assault rifles discovered in his home by Pomona police two  years before.  </P> <P> Harris pleaded guilty to one felony count of being a felon in possession of a  gun. He was sentenced by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer  to three years in state prison, but Ringer suspended the sentence and instead  placed Harris on three years supervised probation. Again, a condition of  probation was that Harris was not to possess firearms. Harris was also given  180 days in jail.  </P> <P> "You'll do 180 days in County Jail," said Ringer. "No work furlough. No work  release. No county parole."  </P> <P> But Ringer stayed the jail time for a month to give Harris time to straighten  out his personal affairs and on Aug. 4 the judge granted a motion to modify the  sentence to 120 days at a private halfway house to be served Wednesdays through  Saturdays at Harris' expense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still in Business  </P> <P> Harris served the halfway house time but, according to a federal search warrant  affidavit filed last January, has continued to deal in firearms. The affidavit  says that Harris drives a 1988 Lincoln Town Car as well as a 1988 Mustang and  sometimes conducts his weapons business by car phone.  </P> <P> The affidavit maintains that Harris used a woman acquaintance -- sometimes  paying her with cocaine -- to buy handguns for him. The woman apparently was  able to pass the state-required criminal background check that is made before a  handgun can be legally purchased.  </P> <P> The federal affidavit alleges that when Harris and his female companion were  apprehended with three brand new handguns on March 7, 1988, Harris admitted the  weapons had been purchased for a known narcotics dealer.  </P> <P> "Harris added that he was supposed to telephone (the drug dealer) on his car  phone once he got the firearms and then meet him to make delivery," says the  affidavit. "Harris stated that (the drug dealer) had already paid him for these  firearms and that he had sold (the drug dealer) other firearms in the recent  past."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drug Dealer Arrested  </P> <P> Harris then led federal agents to the narcotics dealer, according to the  affidavit, and delivered the handguns to him while agents waited nearby to  arrest the dealer on firearms charges.  </P> <P> The affidavit alleges that Harris continued to arrange purchases and sales of  guns through last fall and winter and finally on Jan. 23, firearms agents  searched his home with a federal warrant.  </P> <P> The results must have been disappointing to the agents. They found a couple of  hundred rounds of ammunition, several gun bags and cases, a couple of holsters,  but no guns.  </P> <P> Still, the agents apparently think they have enough on Harris to make a federal  firearms case stick. They turned their information over to a federal prosecutor  this month for consideration as a grand jury case.  </P> <P> Harris, in the meantime, is still free.  </P> <P> He sat on the front porch of his home one recent morning, one eye on a reporter  and the other askew, gazing off it seemed toward the traffic rolling by on  Redondo Boulevard.  </P> <P> "The feds have been trying to build a case on me," he said. "They've been  trying to nail me with something."  </P> <P> But Harris insists that he is innocent and says he doesn't mess with guns  anymore.  </P></p>

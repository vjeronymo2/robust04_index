			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Audit change arouses anger Credit-rating agencies yesterday reacted with surprise and anger to the chancellor's proposals to remove the annual audit requirement for smaller companies. In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Institute of Credit Management warned that smaller companies would find it more difficult to obtain credit and the potential for fraud would be increased. Mr Clarke's proposal to waive a statutory audit for limited liability companies with an annual turnover below Pounds 350,000 contrasted with proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry in the spring to exempt those with turnovers below Pounds 37,600. The institute warned that credit granters would be less willing to rely on unaudited financial information. The letter said: 'To relax the audit requirement at the low level proposed in the consultative document would have been serious enough. To propose extending the regime to companies with a turnover of up to Pounds 350,000 could be positively dangerous.' About 500,000 of the 1.1m limited liability companies which currently must obtain an annual audit would be exempted under the government's plans. There would be no requirement for companies with turnover below Pounds 90,000 - twice the new threshold for companies to register for value added tax. Those above this level but with turnover below Pounds 350,000 a year would need only a compilation report by an independent accountant. Any companies below this limit which are public limited companies, part of a group structure or subject to statute-based regulation, such as the Financial Services Act will not be exempt from the audit. The exemptions would still require unanimous approval by shareholders in the companies - but in many cases the directors are the shareholders. All limited-liability companies would still be required to maintain proper books and records and to file annual accounts with Companies House. Lord Strathclyde, minister for small businesses at the DTI, said the government would provide details of the measures early in the new year and put them into force by the middle of 1994.</p>

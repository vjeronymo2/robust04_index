			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET 'ANTI-ARMY HYSTERIA' DECRIED  </P> <P> A group of Soviet military leaders and politicians published an angry attack on  liberal critics Thursday for inspiring "anti-army hysteria" and scornfully  dismissed talk of a planned coup.  </P> <P> "The idea of a military coup . . . is being put around by those who want to  play 'the army card' in the political game for power," a letter published in  the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda said.  </P> <P> The letter, signed by 77 people, including deputies to the Soviet and Russian  parliaments and military officials, sharpened a public dispute between liberals  and military top brass who have been accused of teaming up with conservatives  to block army reforms.  </P> <P> The letter was published as a retort to liberal politicians and academics who,  in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda on July 4, called for radical measures to  bring the armed forces under parliamentary control and free them from party  influence.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICKEY MOUSE EVENTS NO WORSE THAN MINNIE  </P> <P> If Minnie Minoso had played continuously for six decades, that would truly be  something to be proud of.  </P> <P> However, being stuck in a game for one or two at-bats is no accomplishment, for  Minoso or the White Sox. Sure, Nolan Ryan is still playing -- he wins games, he  strikes people out. If the Sox are willing to put Minoso in for one game, they  should be willing to have him on the team. Permanently.  </P> <P> MARY LEER, Riverside  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukui, May 22 KYODO -- Japan's new plutonium-fueled  fast breeder reactor "Monju" on the Sea of Japan coast went  "critical" through its entire core at 12:43 a.m. Sunday [22  May], the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel  Development Corp. said.    Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in  the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction  without outside stimulus.    The loading of Monju with fuel was completed Friday, when  the  last of the 198 fuel assemblies was installed in the core.    Since then, the government agency has been gradually  removing  the neutron-absorbing control rods allowing the reactor to reach  full criticality.    The fast breeder reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture,  reached criticality for the first time April 5, with 168 fuel  assemblies installed.    The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide  and uranium oxide, is believed to have the potential to use fuel  60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors.    The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further  tests in this chain reaction stage before its output will  gradually be increased in February next year.    The 600 billion yen plant is scheduled to go on line  generating electricity from April 1995 and become a commercially  operating supplier by December the same year.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gibbs and Dandy back in the black with Pounds 850,000 Reductions in costs and interest charges and a halving of bad debts helped Gibbs and Dandy, builders merchants, turn in a profit for 1993 after three years of losses. The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 852,000 for the year to December 31 against a loss of Pounds 124,000, helped by a cut in interest charges from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 136,000 and the reduction of bad debts to Pounds 208,000. Turnover for the year was 4.2 per cent ahead at Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 22.6m). Earnings per share were 7.4p, against losses of 1.4p. The return to profitability by the end of the first half gave the company the confidence to pay its first dividend for more than three years, an interim of 1p, and to anticipate a second interim of at least 1p. This is now to be paid at 1.5p, with the payment as a second interim instead of a final making earlier payment possible and giving a 2.5p total for the year.</p>

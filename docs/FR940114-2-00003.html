Dead and dying trees would be cut, and a green tree thinning component is also proposed to improve forest health. Jeffrey pine beetle suppression comprises part of the project. The proposed action also uses prescribed fire and analyzes post sale treatments, including watershed improvement projects. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and the public are invited to participate at any stage of the process; however, the Forest Supervisor requests that individuals concerned with the scope of the analysis comment by February 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments concerning the DEIS should be sent to the responsible official, Forest Supervisor, LTBMU, 870 Emerald Bay Road, Suite 1, South Lake Tahoe, California, 96150. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Direct questions concerning the proposed action and alternatives to Scott Parsons, Interdisciplinary Team Leader, (916) 573&hyph;2600 or the above address. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately 8,000 acres of an 11,000-acre study area. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands, over about 2,000 acres, some of which overlap the salvage acreage, and some of which is separate. Some of the 30 to 40 million board feet removed will be useful lumber; much of the timber removed will have no commercial value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Trees would be removed from gentle slopes by tractor skidding systems. Trees would be flown from steeper terrain by helicopter. No new permanent roads would be constructed; however, construction of additional temporary access roads and landing sites would be required, as well as reconstruction and restoration of existing historic roads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed action includes treatments that will follow removal of the trees. This includes (but is not limited to) site preparation, planting, treatment of slash generated by the project, obliteration of temporary and unneeded roads, and restoration of landings. Monitoring how effectively the project prevents future beetle attacks is part of ``post sale'' work. The use of prescribed fire will be analyzed, both as a post-harvest treatment and as a long-term management tool. This alternative treats the most acres with prescribed fire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heritage (historic archaeological) resources are dispersed throughout the study area. Most are the remains of 19th century logging, and not all of them will be protected. In addition to mitigation negotiated with the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation, a key component of the analysis is to seek and address enhancement opportunities for representative heritage properties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Watershed restoration projects, road closures, and mistletoe reduction opportunities may also be included in the proposed action if they are, in the language of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ``connected'', ``cumulative'' in their effects with the removal of dead trees, or are ``ripe for decision''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is proposed because of current forest mortality stemming from historical activities. Beginning in the 1850's many of the 200&hyph;500 year old pine trees around Lake Tahoe were harvested in support of silver mining activities of the Comstock Lode. Earlier, the forest and consisted of diverse species that resisted drought and insect attacks. After logging slowed in the 1890's, the area began to revegetate naturally. But a new and different forest grew to replace the old. In the absence of frequently recurring fires, dense thickets of moisture-loving fir trees replaced much of the open pine forest that had been cut. The drought that began in 1987 weakened and killed those fir trees that had sprouted after the massive Comstock cutting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb 26 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Friday night Malaysia's  decision to exclude British companies from government contracts  was a form of economic arm-twisting which we learnt from Western  countries.    He said if the West could threaten to withdraw the  Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) purportedly because  Malaysia did not respect human rights and the environment,  Malaysia also could do likewise. He said it was unfortunate  that the government's action would also affect several genuine  British companies but then we cannot take action against them  one by one, but he believed that there were companies which had  hurled slander at Malaysian leaders, particularly against him.    Dr. Mahathir said this to reporters when commenting on the  government's decision not to award contracts to British  companies as announced by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim  earlier in the day.    If we give contracts to British companies, we'll be accused  of all kinds of things, he said, adding that the government  would not seek an apology or lodge a protest over the attitude  of the British media which he felt had played a major role in  slandering the Government of Malaysia.    He said the government's decision would not affect relations  between Kuala Lumpur and London as the government did not have  problems with the British government.    We are only responding to the action of the British media.  Apparently their media still has the colonial thinking and  believes that non-whites can be easily bribed and can be bribed  at anytime, even for a sum of US$50,000, Dr. Mahathir said.    Asked until when the Malaysian Government would adopt this  stand, he said we'll continue with this until the British media  changes its attitude.    He said only contracts which had not been signed or were in  the process of being signed would be affected by the  government's decision while those which had already been signed  would be honoured.    Probably, in view of this decision the Kuala Lumpur  International Airport project will be affected a little but,  never mind. Others can carry it out, he said. An Anglo-Japanese  consortium is involved in the airport project.    Dr. Mahathir said the British High Commissioner met him this  evening to persuade the government to review its decision but he  felt that Duncan Slater's move came too late as the decision had  already been made and announced.    He said Slater regretted the latest development.    Asked whether Malaysia was prepared for retaliatory action  from the British Media, Dr. Mahathir said we'll wait and see  further developments.    Dr. Mahathir said he felt that the government's action was a  lesson to the free press of the West which, in the end, could be  abused to the detriment of the nation.    He said the Malaysian Government supported press freedom but  such freedom should go along with responsibility. He said that  in Malaysia the press was very responsible.    The prime minister said that initially the government  tolerated the attitude of the British media even in their  attempt to topple the government of Prime Minister John Major  but when it tried to involve Malaysia's interests, effective  action had to be taken.    Initially we were patient, they tried to involve us with  Pergau [Dam project], MOU [Memoradum of Understanding], BMF  [Bumiputra Malaysia Finance] and others, more so with  allegations of corruption to the extent we cannot accept it  anymore, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said he felt that among the media involved in  hurling such slander was that owned by Rupert Murdoch.    He said he wanted the British media to report only the truth  and not twist their reports with nonsense.    This (reporting the truth) they cannot do because they do  not  understand what is meant by the truth, he said.</p>

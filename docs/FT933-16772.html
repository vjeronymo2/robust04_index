			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Moscow urged to toughen line on Estonia THE Russian parliament yesterday called on the government to put pressure on Estonia in retaliation for its adoption of a law on aliens which obliges non-ethnic Estonians to apply for citizenship and pass a language exam within a year. The resolution, which said pressure should be applied 'politically, economically and in other ways including the suspension of the withdrawal of (Russian) troops', was a rare case of unity in the usually bitterly divided Russian parliament. The unity reflects the depth of feeling among Russians over what is seen as discrimination against their ethnic kin. Nearly 600,000 Russian-speakers live in Estonia in a population of 1.6m - most of whom went afterthe war to work in the newly-established Soviet factories. The resolution says the adoption of the aliens law and a further electoral law, 'could not be regarded as a purely internal affair' of Estonia. The wording shows that Russian law-makers believe they have the right to intervene in their neighbours' internal politics when Russian rights are in question. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has already warned the Estonian government to change its mind on the issue - a threat which made Mr Lennart Meri, the Estonian president, say that he would not ratify the law until he had sought expert advice from the Council of Europe and the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Estonia's Russian population has been infuriated by the new law . The citizens of Narva, the mainly-Russian city in the north-east, have said they will hold a referendum on July 16 and 17 on forming an autonomous state, a move which Mr Eerik Truuvyali, Estonia's highest judicial authority, said breached the constitution. On Wednesday, 5,000 demonstrators gathered in the town of Sillamyaz, near Narva, to protest against the aliens law and demand that the referendum on autonomy goes ahead.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra] </F>   [Text] The policy of issuing zero-coupon bonds is  conditioned by the financial crisis, and the Central Bank of  Venezuela (BCV) finds itself obliged to absorb part of the  liquidity that is injected into the banks being aided.    Chief of Cordiplan [Office of Coordination and Planning]  Enzo  del Bufalo made this statement yesterday, when he was asked if  the increase in yield that this financial paper had experienced  during the last auction conducted at the BCV did not contradict  the administration's strategy for stabilizing the economy.    One of the results produced by the most recent sale of  zero-coupon bonds was an increase in their yield by slightly  more than 2 percent, which caused an increase in the ceiling of  the cost of money to 72.13 percent.    Del Bufalo said that it would not be possible to correct  this  problem until the financial crisis is resolved. When asked  whether the BCV's actions are aimed at preventing capital  flight, he recalled that an increase in interest rates also  serves to "direct savings toward the domestic market."    Referring to the controversial Tax on Bank Debts (IDB), he  said that, with or without the Value Added Tax (IVA), the IDB  would go forward, even though it had been proposed only "to deal  with the emergency."    He also stated that the tax reform presented by the  administration to the National Congress could generate more  revenue than it was estimated IVA would produce. Nevertheless,  he made clear that "even so, a gap would remain" in the budget,  and because of this the IDB had been proposed. It is "an  instrument that is essential in order to reduce the deficit to  less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)."    The head of national planning also said that within a couple  of months, he will present what will be the long-term strategy  of President Caldera's government. He stressed that growth  without inflation would be among the basic principles of the  plan, the Ninth National Plan, as it was in the eighth plan, The  Great Turning. "But this growth must be maintained by productive  investment and not by spending by the state."    Del Bufalo's statements came after his participation in the  forum, State Intervention vs. Free Economy, organized by the  Venezuelan Institute of Finances.    In his presentation, the chief of Cordiplan said that in  Venezuela, tax payments represent less than two percent of GNP  [gross national product], in sharp contrast to the fact that in  a "normal country" taxes generally exceed 10 percent of GNP.    He said that an economic policy "of doubtful efficacy" had  been tried in the country, and that it had been politically  nonviable. The previous government, he said, thought that an  open economy and market mechanisms would be sufficient to  overcome this model. "It was a conceptual and empirical error to  leave the functioning of the economy to market dynamics, and  that has been our basic discrepancy with that administration."    There had been no long-term planning, and it is the state  that must produce the appropriate economic policy to create a  market that does not yet exist. He said that the alternative to  be followed must become a reality with the cooperation of the  private sector, "which is responsible for financing part of the  increase in costs with its earnings."    "The state must resolve the structural problem that is  causing inflation, but while the fiscal deficit is a problem of  the state, it is also true that it is a responsibility of  business, because business does not pay taxes."    In addition, he maintained that although he does not believe  the maxi-devaluation is feasible, "this dark horizon will become  more probable, if the Congress does not do its duty."</p>

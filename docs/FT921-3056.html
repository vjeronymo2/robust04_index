			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (4): Square holes for square pegs - The impending Single Market gives new urgency to standards harmonisation THE CONCEPT of Open Systems has won powerful proponents among users and suppliers over the past decade and has helped thrust standard setting for Information Technology out of obscurity and into the limelight. Now the impending arrival of the Single European Market and accompanying moves to harmonise regulations and practices across Europe has given added impetus to standard setting in all fields and led the European Commission to try to streamline and hasten the process. This, coupled with the faster pace of technological change, is putting pressure on standard setters to anticipate developments and not just pick the best from the past. Mr Chris Cheetham, chief executive of DISC, the part of the British Standards Institution (BSI) responsible for Information Systems standards, says that 'users are increasingly reluctant to use new technology if there are no suitable standards'. The idea behind Open Systems in information technology is deceptively simple. In an Open Systems environment, IT hardware is built to a set of common standards so that equipment from one manufacturer can work with equipment from another, and software can be easily moved from one machine 'platform' to another. Today, there is little dispute, in Europe at least, that Open Systems standards lie at the heart of users' future ability to integrate and fully exploit information technology systems in every sector of commerce and industry - from cross border mobile telephones to networked computers and database structures. The pressure from IT users for Open Systems began in the early 1980s after General Motors told its suppliers to meet a protocol based on the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standard developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). European users and computer suppliers were also among the early advocates of Open Systems which they saw as a means to loosen IBM's grip on the mainframe equipment market and provide an alternative to IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) which had become a de facto standard. Under pressure from users IBM itself has now swung firmly behind Open Systems. Tony Jeffree, a principal consultant with Sema Group Consulting, sees Open Systems developments as the product of two relatively recent developments: the IT consumer's realisation 'that the availability of standards-based IT products can break the strangle-hold once exerted over them by the fact that interconnection and interfacing techniques were incompatible between different manufacturers' equipment. The availability of products based on Open Systems standards provides them with a better choice of equipment, and with the protection of their investment against the potential hazards of single-sourcing.' the realisation by the IT supplier 'that the wide use of Open Systems standards actually has the effect of increasing the size of the potential market for IT products, and that this more than compensates for the fact that the open nature of the standards does not 'lock in' their customer base'. Nevertheless, implementation of the Open Systems concept has brought problems as well as solutions. Because Open Systems reduce computing equipment to a series of commodity products, price becomes a dominant factor in purchasing decisions and fierce price competition is one factor behind the recent sharp downturn in most major computer manufacturers' financial fortunes. In Europe, the move towards Open Systems was given further impetus by the EC's decision in the mid 1980s that member governments' major public sector IT contracts should be based on Open Systems standards. This led to the development of the Government information systems profile (Gosip) in the UK, and equivalents elsewhere in Europe. Profiles select from the options within a set of standards and ensure that IT suppliers make OSI products which are compatible with each other. Since the public sector is a major IT purchaser, Gosip and the European Procurement Handbook for Open Systems, Ephos have become very influential in determining the implementation of standards. Indeed many industry observers argue that standards have become the single most important issue in European IT. They suggest that the increasingly widespread adoption of Open Systems means that those responsible for setting standards have assumed great power. As a result there has been a proliferation of user groups seeking to ensure their voices are heard and needs are met, and of supplier groups who try to influence those standards that concern them. Predictably this proliferation has alarmed some of the older Open Systems groups who argue that it causes unnecessary duplication. Rivalry also developed between groups supporting different versions of Unix, the software language which has become closely associated with Open Systems. Competing versions of Unix are available from several suppliers including Unix International, which helped establish the Unix version from AT&amp;T Unix System Laboratories (USL) in the market, and Open Software Foundation which developed a Unix version called OSF/1. Arguably, rivalry between the two organisations has delayed more widespread adoption of Unix. But there are now strong signs that the two groups are moving closer together, in part as a result of pressure from X/Open which was set up by suppliers in an effort to bring together enough standards to cover all the basic functions of Open Systems under a common application environment (CAE). The 'Unix wars', as they have been called, may be close to resolution, but they have underlined the fact that standardisation itself is not without problems. 'A good standard must be widely acceptable both to the customer base and to equipment suppliers,' says Tony Jeffree, who has direct experience with standards development in ISO and the Institution of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). 'To achieve this the standard must address a wider set of requirements than is usual in equivalent proprietary solutions. 'This leads to inevitable conflicts and trade-offs between versatility and complexity, and occasionally to the worst of all solutions, which is complexity without versatility,' he says. He argues that a good standard must also have an eye to future requirements, sometimes resulting in the standardised product being less competitive in the short term. A good example of this effect is the current rise of TCP/IP, a set of networking protocol standards originally developed for use by the US Defense Department's 'Arpanet' network. TCP/IP is widely available, works, and is simpler than the corresponding OSI offering. However, it was designed in the days when it was reasonable to assume that any one organisation would own a handful of computers, and the total number of subnetworks in the world that would require interconnection would be numbered in the 100s or 1,000s. Such assumptions, although ludicrous now, resulted in TCP/IP being implemented with severe addressing limitations that prevent its use as a global networking solution, and will probably relegate it to the status of a local area networking protocol before long. But Tony Jeffree argues that the most serious problem with standardisation at the moment is the impact the worldwide economic slowdown/recession is having on the ability of both supplier and user organisations to participate in the standard setting process. 'Manufacturers of IT equipment are cutting back on their standards budgets, similarly user organisations, which have never been well represented in the standardisation process, are finding it increasingly difficult to participate,' he says. 'In the UK, government departments, particularly the DTI, have traditionally been a considerable source of support for standardisation activities, but present policy has reduced DTI support for OSI standardisation to an extremely low level. 'Given the potential importance of the IT sector in helping to bring us out of the recession, this must be viewed as a dangerous trend.' Although Open Systems standards are usually associated with the computer sector of information technology, the urgent need for widely accepted standards is apparent in many other IT and consumer electronics sectors. For example, it was the need to develop common European telecommunications standards which led to the formation of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (Etsi) in 1988. More recently the difficulties faced by the EC in defining a standard for high definition television (HDTV) have served as a timely reminder that in some areas of European standard setting national politics and industrial rivalry still play a major part.</p>

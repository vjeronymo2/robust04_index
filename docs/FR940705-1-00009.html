			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes. The CAA advises that the gauge size of the galley feeder cables installed on these airplanes is not compatible with the rating of the toilet services fuses. In the event of a fault condition, the incompatibility of these items could result in the cables becoming overheated, which could lead to the generation of smoke and fire in the cabin. There have been no in-service incidents of such faults or consequent smoke and fire, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawker-Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SB.25&hyph;75&hyph;25A698A&amp;B, dated February 10 1994, that describes procedures for installing Modification 25A698A&amp;B on airplanes that were furnished with an ``open plan'' galley. This modification consists of changing the gauge size of the galley feeder cables (from fuses F1 and F2 on panel WFA to the left and right galley) from size 10 to size 8; changing the toilet services fuse F3 from 50A to 30A amperage; and adding a new 20A fuse to the left and right galley.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawker-Raytheon Corporate Jets also has issued Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SB.25&hyph;75&hyph;25A699A, dated February 10 1994, that describes procedures for installing Modification 25A699A on airplanes that were furnished with a ``traditional'' galley. This modification consists of changing the gauge size of the galley feeder cables (from fuses F1 and F2 on panel WFA to the galley) from size 10 to size 8; changing the toilet services fuse F3 from 50A to 30A amperage; and adding a new 20A fuse to the galley.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA classified both of these service bulletins as mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services fuses. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,520, or $1,380 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

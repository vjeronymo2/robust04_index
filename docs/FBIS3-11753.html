			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Gladys Bernal Barzola] </F>   [Text] Atalaya-Ucayali, 16 Mar -- The president of the  Republic, Alberto Fujimori, admitted here the existence of ties  between some bad Armed Forces elements and drug trafficking, and  noted that the courts of law and military courts must not allow  these crimes to remain unpunished.    The president said: "It is not that there are alleged ties.  There actually are ties. Therefore, the Military Court Supreme  Council has punished many of the elements involved."    Concerning the case involving drug trafficker Demetrio  Chavez  Penaherrera [alias "Vaticano"], the president indicated that the  courts of law have opened proceedings to investigate the  existence of any ties the drug trade might have with police and  the military.    Celebrating the opening of another proceeding in the  military  courts, the president noted that, had this proceeding not been  opened, the drug trafficker called "Vaticano" suddenly might  have been released.    After his activities in Atalaya-Ucayali, Fujimori  emphasized:  "We will be drastic and inexorable. To this end, however, it is  necessary for the courts of law and the military courts to work  in coordination to guarantee that serious crimes like these will  not remain unpunished." Fujimori was accompanied by Japanese  Vice Foreign Minister Shozo Azuma [name as published] and other  Japanese Government officials who delivered a number of  donations to families afflicted by natural disasters throughout  our country.    Moving on, Fujimori noted that the circulation of an Army  document stating that the media are engaged in a campaign to  discredit the Army is part of the freedom in our country.    Fujimori stressed: "Everyone in our country, without  exception, has a right to voice his or her opinion. Since there  is freedom of the press, there is also freedom of expression for  the people and the institutions."    In Fujimori's opinion: "This freedom of expression would not  be allowed in any other country." He mentioned some examples of  impersonation, involving people or institutions, that would  warrant lawsuits in other countries.    Fujimori noted: "These cases do not happen here because  there is full freedom of the press and freedom of expression."    Within this context, Fujimori was asked about the habeas  data  right [by which a citizen can ask a government to supply all  personal data it has on him or her] included in the  Constitution, a right that has been described by various  segments as a threat to freedom of the press.    Fujimori stressed: "I agree with championing freedom of the  press and freedom of expression. The way this habeas data right  will be regulated, I am sure it will guarantee these freedoms.  Therefore, those remarks about the existence of threats to these  freedoms are groundless."    Moving on, President Fujimori announced that the draft of a  letter of intent scheduled for signature with the IMF one and  one-half months ago did not deserve his or the Council of  Ministers' approval because it changed some of the government's  goals that had been duly established.    These goals include investments in the social field  involving  infrastructure improvements in education, health, highways, and  so on.    Fujimori noted: "I am sure the IMF will understand our  goals. The economic stabilization and pacification goals are  maintained. Nevertheless, a social program is required. We  already have explained this social program to (IMF managing  director) Michel Camdessus, who supports it, but we want it  mentioned in the letter of intent."    Another issue discussed by the president involved the  reorganization of the National Police, especially Dincote  [National Counterterrorism Directorate], and the recent  terrorist actions that elicited criticism in the sense that the  government had lowered its guard, which was ruled out by the  president.    Fujimori said: "This government actually has an effective  antiterrorist strategy. The attacks do not represent a Shining  Path revival or an ability to recover. Rather, they represent a  weakness that we will use to our advantage within the same  strategy."    Fujimori admitted that the police are experiencing an  adjustment process, but explained that it represents an  adjustment to a new situation in order to enhance effectiveness.    Fujimori stressed: "In this field, we will not lower our  guard an inch. The change of commands has been criticized, but  the National Police have been strengthened and organized to such  an extent that they fulfill their duties under any command."    The presidential entourage landed at Atalaya airport,  changing their initial course to a location in the Andean  mountain range because of weather problems.    In Atalaya, Fujimori visited some hamlets and then went by  helicopter to the San Jose de Cutivireni base where about 1,400  Ashaninkas, rescued by a religious mission from the Shining  Path, have been living since 1991.    Of the 1,400 Ashaninkas, of whom 350 are children, 465  presented themselves voluntarily and 200 recently sought shelter  under the Repentance Law.</p>

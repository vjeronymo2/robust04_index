			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TANKER TRAFFIC OFF SOUTHLAND IS 'MODERATE TO HEAVY'  </P> <P> The tanker that spilled oil off the coast of Huntington Beach on Wednesday  night was one of as many as two dozen tankers that sail the waters off Southern  California in any given 24-hour period, industry officials said.  </P> <P> "It's a busy coast," said Joseph Bradarich, manager of BP Oil Shipping, the  company that chartered the tanker. "We're not the only company chartering ships  out the coast here, and I'd describe the traffic as moderate to heavy."  </P> <P> As few as 10 and as many as 25 tankers per day make calls in Los Angeles, San  Pedro, Long Beach and other Southern California destinations, officials said.  One of the busiest terminals is Berth 121 in Long Beach, which is operated by  Atlantic Richfield Co., Bradarich added.  </P> <P> Tankers can also make their way to offshore moorings several miles off the  coast at Huntington Beach and El Segundo, where Chevron Corp. has a major  refinery. At such moorings, tankers can tie up and pump their cargoes directly  into a pipeline that runs under the sea back to shore. The offshore mooring at  Huntington Beach was where the tanker was headed Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The tankers come from all over the world and from Alaska, where North Slope  crude oil is loaded onto tankers for shipment to refineries up and down the  West Coast. In addition, tankers may ferry finished products or intermediate  feedstocks between refineries along the coast.  </P> <P> After delivering its load to Golden West, the American Trader was to have  returned to Long Beach to discharge the rest, Bradarich said.  </P> <P> The volume of traffic does not normally present a hazard, Bradarich said.  </P> <P> But the prospect of an accident is enough to generate concern among residents,  said Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), one of several congressmen who  voted to require double hulls on oil tankers in a House session Wednesday.  </P></p>

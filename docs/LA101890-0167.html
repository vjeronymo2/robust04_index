			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH JANICE;  </P> <P> THE REMATCH  </P> <P> Although my triple bet didn't get off to a good start, I was still able to come  out $2 ahead when Just Deeds finished second in the seventh. It goes to show  that picking the right horse is important but so is money management. Today my  selection is $10 to win, place and show on Pocket Veto in the fourth race.  </P> <P> Janice Goldinger's Wed. bankroll: $2,124  </P> <P> Wednesday's Profit: $2  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $2,126  </P> <P> SURELOCK's exacta came up short Wednesday when Great Communicator came back to  show his past class in the eighth. Today's wager is a $10 exacta box, Really  Brilliant-Saratogan-Charging Raj, in the eighth race.  </P> <P> SURELOCK's Wed. bankroll: $760  </P> <P> Wednesday's Loss: $60  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $700  </P> <P> Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in.  SURELOCK does not own horses.  </P> <P> Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.  </P></p>

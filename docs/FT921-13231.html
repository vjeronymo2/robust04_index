			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ICI and Ferro call off paint joint venture IMPERIAL Chemical Industries and Ferro of the US have called off their joint venture to form the world's largest manufacturer of industrial powder paints because of wrangles over who would run it and how it would be financed. The venture, which would have had annual sales of Dollars 200m (Pounds 112m), was announced last August and was supposed to start operating on January 1. Neither side would comment on the failure yesterday, but talks cannot have been helped by the previously fast-growing powders market being stopped in its tracks by the recession. ICI planned to take a 51 per cent stake in the venture, which would have been based in Cleveland, Ohio, where both Ferro and ICI's Glidden paints subsidiary have their headquarters. The chairman was to have been Mr John Danzeisen, who runs Glidden. Ferro managers are understood to have been concerned about their role, while ICI grew worried about the new business's likely increasing demands for working capital as markets tightened.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin's  current visit to Spain, NATO bombing raids on Serbian positions  near the Bosnian city of Gorazde, and the Cosmonautics Day which  is marked in Russia today are the leading topics in Moscow-based  newspapers.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Spain. The newspaper points out that the Spanish journalists,  upon the arrival of President Boris Yeltsin in Spain on Monday,  drew the attention of their Russian counterparts to the fact  that a Russo- Spanish treaty of friendship and cooperation would  be signed in Moncloa Palace where the Moncloa Pact had been  signed. The pact "made it possible to take Spain out of the  crisis and lay foundations of civil peace".    We hope, they said, that an agreement on achieving civil  accord in Russia, which is to be signed in Moscow on Yeltsin's  initiative, "also has a chance to go down in the history of the  motherland".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the bombing of Serbian positions in the  area of Gorazde by U.S. F-16 jetfighters: "As Russia begins to  play an increasingly active diplomatic role in the Balkans, the  Western countries' attitude to the Serbs grows tougher. "This  time Russia has been confronted with an acomplished fact, for  fear, probably, that a military conflict would be prevented  diplomatically with her help. "Some people do not like,  apparently, that Russia ceases to be an obedient executor of  Western countries' decisions and tries to play solo in the  diplomatic orchestra".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (Independent Newspaper) on Russia's not  being consulted about air strikes in Gorazde area. "The failure  to consult with Russia prior to the delivery of an air strike  fits quite well into an increasingly distinct new U.S. attitude  towards her. Nevertheless, no one, it seems, is in a hurry to  write off her role in a settlement of the Balkan conflict".    TRUD and PRAVDA quote Yeltsin as saying at Vnukovo Airport  prior to departure for Spain that "I insisted and continue to  insist that such matters as the bombing of Serbian positions  should not be decided upon without prior consultations between  the United States and Russia".</p>

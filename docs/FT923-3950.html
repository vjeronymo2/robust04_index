			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Bush taken to task over Nafta SENIOR Democratic senators have taken President George Bush to task for endangering the North American free trade agreement's chances of passing through Congress by seeking to use it as a campaign issue. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, a staunch supporter of the Nafta negotiations between the US, Canada and Mexico, complained yesterday that Mr Bush was 'deliberately politicising' the agreement. Mr Bush and other Republicans have accused Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, of equivocation by saying he is in favour of free trade but refusing an outright endorsement of Nafta. 'Politicising this agreement will not help its prospects in Congress,' Mr Bentsen warned, adding that Mr Clinton could not be expected to decide on the 2,000-page agreement when its full text had only just been made available. Senator Max Baucus of Montana went a step further and accused the administration of rushing Nafta through in time for last month's Republican convention in Houston - giving short shrift to concerns over environmental protection and job displacement. Mexico's trade deficit deteriorated sharply in the first half of this year to Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 4.72bn), more than double that in the same period last year, according to the Finance Ministry, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.</p>

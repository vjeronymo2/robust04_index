			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Sunderland car plant to be expanded SIR ROBERT McALPINE &amp; SONS has been awarded a design and management contract worth Pounds 3.7m by Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) for the further expansion of its car manufacturing plant at Sunderland, Tyne &amp; Wear. The contract is for a 5,300 sq metre extension to the press shop facilities. The 17-metres-high, single-storey building will be constructed of structural steel frame on reinforced pad foundations, clad with composite steel panels and roofing to match the existing buildings. A large machine pit, 40 metres x 13 metres x 8 metres deep, will be constructed within the press shop extension. It will entail excavating in solid rock up to 4 metres below the surrounding water table level. Work on the extension, which is due for completion in May 1992, includes the installation of a gas-fired factory heating system, all building services and the provision of beams and rails for the overhead gantry cranes. McAlpine Design Group is responsible for the design of the building and services. Turner &amp; Townsend will be quantity surveyors.</p>

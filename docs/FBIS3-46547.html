Holding that reforms are for improving systems that  form the core of the country, he stressed that the government  will sharpen the national competitive edge and pursue reforms  through improving systems and operations rather than punishing  public officials.    [Begin Yi Hoe-chang recording] I think that the improvements  of the bureaucratic society and the state administration are  intended for improving the country's systems and operations, not  for punishing public officials. [end recording]    Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang said in particular that he will  map out concrete measures at an early date to improve the public  servants' welfare in order to raise their morale because they  are the same ordinary people who have to carry on with their  lives. He said that he has already drafted a formula on  improving the promotion system.    [Begin Yi recording] Public officials' income will be  increased by 6.2 percent in 1994. However, I cannot possibly  say that such an increase will bring better treatment to public  officials. [end recording]    Prime Minister Yi disclosed that the government is  reexamining the overall agricultural policy in the wake of the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round and will set up necessary  measures by fully reflecting the farmers' opinions and sharing  the pain of the rural areas through field administration.</p>

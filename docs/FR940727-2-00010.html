The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteers programs previously supported by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this summer, and most of the others will be operational by this fall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purusant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept, hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money, or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 170. The Corporation may also ``solicit and accept the voluntary services of individuals'' to assist the Corporation in carrying out the national service program. 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation is striving to build innovative public/private partnerships that support national and community service programs throughout the country. The Corporation's primary goal is to foster strategic linkages between private sector companies, foundations, government agencies, and community service organizations, in order to multiply their combined abilities to address shared community problems. To this end, the Corporation seeks to leverage its federally appropriated resources with donations of goods and services form private sector companies, foundations, and individuals.

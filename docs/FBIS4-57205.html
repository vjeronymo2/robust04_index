			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Channel 7 News" newscast; passages within </F> quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] The UN preliminary commission left the country after  spending a week in Guatemala where they established the  importance of the Human Rights Verification Commission.  According to remarks by mission members, they left the country  in high spirits because the current situation in Guatemala is  quite encouraging. Leonardo Franco, head of the UN delegation,  commented on their work in Guatemala:    [Franco] "Through meetings held over the past two weeks [as  heard], we have reached a very significant consensus within  Guatemalan society concerning human rights.    ``First, there is consensus on the importance of the General  Human Rights Agreement signed on 29 March which, in everyone's  opinion, marks a very encouraging phase in the Guatemalan peace  process.    ``Second, there is also consensus on the international  verification mission, which was requested on the one hand by the  government and on the other by the URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] command in the general agreement and which  the broadest sectors of society view as a very positive factor  for the observance of human rights in the country.    ``Finally, on the issue of consensus, the mission's  government and nongovernment interlocutors also unanimously  agreed that the verification mission should arrive in the  country as soon as possible. We will recommend this to the UN  secretary general.    ``"Third, this consensus will undoubtedly prompt an adequate  response from the international community concerning the  Guatemalan people's efforts to achieve human rights and peace.''    Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez commented on the  remarks  made by the UN preliminary mission members regarding the  immediate installation of the Human Rights Verification  Commission in Guatemala.    [Enriquez] "They have, of course, a general impression of  the  country, which will serve as the foundation for their  recommendations to the UN secretary general concerning  verification, which I hope will take place as soon as possible.  I believe the Guatemalan community, in general, agrees that the  Verification Commission should come to Guatemala as soon as  possible."    The defense minister also commented on the invitation  extended to him by the Permanent Refugee Commissions [CPR] and  said he is willing to talk with the URNG commanders.    [Enriquez] "They have invited me to visit them and I will  certainly go. I would like to tell you that certain reports  have been published which, perhaps, are the result of a  misinterpretation by the person who wrote them because I, as  defense minister, will not go looking for the subversives and  the terrorist criminals in Ixcan. No. If they were to invite  me to a meeting supervised by the United Nations, I would go  because I have nothing to fear. I have spoken with the URNG  leadership and I believe that for the sake of peace we should  reach an agreement."    Enriquez also reiterated a desire for a cease-fire in the  area of the Ixcan and Xalbal Rivers, about which the Guatemalan  Episcopal Conference has issued a statement.    [Enriquez] "The Defense Ministry accepts that statement 100  percent because, I believe, the person who has done the most to  promote it has been the president, of course, but through me. I  advocate a definitive cease-fire between the Xalbal and Ixcan  Rivers and also that the refugees, repatriates, and CPR's allow  themselves to receive full aid without influence and looking  only to the future, a better future for our new generations and  so they themselves can live in peace and tranquility in that  area."</p>

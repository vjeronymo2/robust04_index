Phalangist Secretary General Karim Paqraduni told AFP that  the party wanted to recover the Lebanese Broadcasting  Corporation (LBC), Lebanon's most watched television station  which has been run by the militia since 1985.    He said that the LBC was set up in 1980 with Phalangist  funds  after a political decision was taken by the rightwing party. It  began broadcasting five years later.    "The dissolution of the LF has opened the way for us to  recover what rightfully belongs to us," he said.    Paqraduni added that the party had already filed lawsuits  against the LF to retrieve cooperatives and buildings controlled  by the former militia.    Last week the government outlawed the Lebanese Forces as  part  of an investigation into the bombing in February of a Maronite  Christian church that killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54.    The authorities charge that seven out of nine suspects are  LF  members, including the former militia's deputy Fu'ad Malik.    The LF was set up in 1976 by assassinated president elect  Bashir al-Jumayyil to be the military wing of the Phalangist  Party, which was founded in 1936 by al-Jumayyil's father Pierre.    It grouped a string of Christian militias until the  government disbanded the militias in 1990. One year later the  LF formed a political party under the leadership of Christian  warlord Samir Ja'ja'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Li Haitang (2621 3189 1016): </F> "Only the `Basic Law' Can Guarantee That the Hong Kong People  Will Enjoy the Essence of Democracy -- Comments on and Analysis  of Chris Patten's `Constitutional Reform Package'"]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan (XINHUA) -- In approximately three  months after Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten had been in office,  he hastily dished out his "constitutional reform package,"  saying again and again that he wanted to assume "a moral  responsibility" for Hong Kong and to promote its  "democratization" as quickly as possible. Clinging obstinately  to his course, he promoted the sale of his "constitutional  reform package" in the past year or so regardless of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements and  understanding reached between China and Britain, as if whoever  opposes his "constitutional reform package" opposes democracy.  Thus, Chris Patten suddenly transformed himself from a colonial  dictator into a fighter for "democracy."    Such a practice on the part of Chris Patten is  incomprehensible to many people: There has never been a tiny  bit of democracy in Hong Kong, which has been under British rule  for over 150 years; "royal instructions" are followed in all  [government] affairs there; and the Hong Kong governor alone is  in control of all the powers. What makes him think of giving  democracy to the Hong Kong people just before British colonial  rule is about to end? Even Mr. Sharp [name as received], former  chairman of the Britain-China Trade Association, also said that  he could not understand why Chris Patten was in such a hurry to  promote democratization in Hong Kong.    China has repeatedly declared that the focal point of our  differences with Britain is not a question of whether democracy  should be implemented but rather a question of whether one's  promise should be kept. Democracy is an important mark of  social progress. The Chinese Government has all along been for  the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong, and it was  China that was the first of the two countries to propose the  implementation of democracy in Hong Kong and the democratic  rights of a "high degree of autonomy" for the Hong Kong people  under "one country, two systems" during the Sino-British talks  back in 1982. Then, China spent as long as four years and eight  months formulating the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region of the PRC" and putting forward the  principle of proceeding in an orderly way and step by step for  the implementation of democratic reform in Hong Kong.    The "democracy" hastily bestowed by Chris Patten as a favor  obviously violates the law of development. All matters in the  world have their own law of development. Like many matters, the  democratic system has a process of coming into being,  development, and taking shape. It is not accomplished in one  step. The process of the development of the modern democratic  system explains this point. The transition from feudal  dictatorship to the capitalist democratic system of our time  took several hundred years. For example, passing from the  bourgeois democratic revolution in 1688 to the establishment of  the one-person, one-vote election system in 1948 took Britain  nearly 300 years; and the United States took 200 years to go  from the formulation of its Constitution and the beginning of  the implementation of democratic reforms in 1787 to the exercise  of one-person, one-vote rights in general elections by 18-  year-old citizens in the 1980's.    Very obviously, Hong Kong's democracy cannot be accomplished  overnight. Accelerating the democratization process by force in  violation of the law of development will inevitably result in  drastic social turmoil and chaos, affect social stability, and,  furthermore, have an impact on Hong Kong's investment  environment. The broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots do not  want to see such things happen.    On account of the aforementioned consideration, the "Basic  Law" states that Hong Kong will have both direct elections and  indirect elections in the first 10 years after 1997 and that the  transition to general elections will be achieved according to  the procedures prescribed by law by the year 2007. The 10-year  transitional period, compared with 200 to 300 years in Britain  and the United States, is actually very, very short. Therefore,  it should be said that the process of democratic reform  stipulated by the "Basic Law" not only takes into consideration  the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong but also conforms to  the law governing the development of democracy itself.    In the process of drafting the "Basic Law," China has  extensively solicited the opinions of the people of all walks of  life and social strata in Hong Kong and has taken into full  account their 40 to 50 proposals concerning Hong Kong's  political system. When it was promulgated, the "Basic Law" was  well received by the Chinese people, including the compatriots  in Hong Kong, and by the people of the world. They universally  held that the "Basic Law" not only embodies the Hong Kong  people's aspirations but also conforms to the interests of  economic development in Hong Kong and to the requirements for  its stability. Even the British Government has spoken highly of  the "Basic Law." In Britain, both the prime minister(s) and  ministers have expressed their satisfaction with the "Basic Law"  on many occasions, and the British side has repeatedly promised  to converge with it.    However, at a time when the "Basic Law" needs to be further  publicized, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten dished out his  "political reform program" in an attempt to "expand democracy"  in Hong Kong. This is an openly perfidious act.    People cannot but ask: Why does Patten want to go against  the objective law and ignore Hong Kong's safety? People who  know the history of colonial rule can see the real purpose of  the Hong Kong Government: It is vainly attempting to help,  through so-called democratic elections, a group of pro-British  persons gain power, especially those who dare to challenge the  central government, so as to make the government of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] powerless after 1997.  In doing so, Britain can attain its goal of ruling Hong Kong  without Britons -- continuing its colonial rule over Hong Kong  in another form.    When he met with Geoffrey Howe on 31 July 1984, Deng  Xiaoping  said: "I hope that the Hong Kong Government will not form a  leading body of its own during the transitional period and then  impose it on the government of the Hong Kong SAR." Today, his  prediction with profound insight has been proved accurate.    History has shown that before withdrawing from its colonies,  Britain would invariably pursue a policy of division and create  contradictions and confrontations to facilitate its manipulation  and control in an attempt to maintain its political and economic  interests in its former colonies. The same shameful tricks of  this old-brand imperialist have been employed in many of its  colonies in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not only were they not  successful, but they were condemned as shameful tricks by the  people of the world. Therefore, what Britain is doing with  regard to the Hong Kong issue is obviously a replaying of the  same old tricks. The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are  able to see through these tricks.    What the Hong Kong Government did more than 20 years ago  can help us see through its shameful tricks. In the 1970's,  Britain applied two international human rights conventions to  Hong Kong, but it omitted the portions on democratic elections  so that those would not be practiced in Hong Kong. In  displaying the big banner of "democracy" at a time just before  its withdrawal, is it not clear now as to what its ulterior  motives are? In sharp contrast to this situation, the Chinese  side included democracy in the "Basic Law" when there was not an  iota of democracy in Hong Kong.    Faced with iron-clad facts, a slight change seems to have  taken place in the tune of "democracy" sung by Chris Patten. He  claimed in a high-sounding manner that his arrangements on  direct elections are "open, just, and accepted by the Hong Kong  people." This new argument seems beautiful, but is actually  pale and weak.    It is known to all that during the five years of drafting  the  "Basic Law," China had carried out a very open and democratic  way of discussions on all issues, both primary and secondary  ones, especially on the method of selecting the chief executive  of the government of the Hong Kong SAR and the forming of the  Legislative Council. Members of the drafting committee could  say what they wanted to say and could express their views  freely. Every article and every annex of the "Basic Law" was  passed with a two-thirds majority by all members of the drafting  committee in a secret ballot. Members of the drafting committee  visited Hong Kong many times to solicit the opinions of the  people from all walks of life regarding the method of selecting  the chief executive and the method of forming legislative  organs. Many revisions were made regarding this question. The  processing of drafting the "Basic Law" was highly transparent:  A news communique was published after each meeting. In four  years, nearly 100 news conferences were held by the Political  Group. Therefore, only the method of selecting the chief  executive of the Hong Kong SAR and the method of forming the  Legislative Council prescribed by the "Basic Law" are open and  just. Moreover, the masses of people in Hong Kong are satisfied  with them. In contrast, Chris Patten's "political reform  program" is not open and democratic. He arrived in Hong Kong in  June 1992, and in September he dished out his "political reform  program." Except for his premeditations with the British  Government in concocting this program, he had no prior  consultations with anyone, nor did he solicit the opinions of  the people of Hong Kong. It can be said that Chris Patten  dished out his "political reform program" without an iota of  democracy at all.    The essence of democracy is that the people enjoy the rights  to their own interests and happiness. The biggest interest of  the Hong Kong people is the maintenance of Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability. Only the "Basic Law" can satisfy the  wishes and demands of the masses of compatriots in Hong Kong;  only the "Basic Law" can bring about true and real democracy in  Hong Kong; and only the "Basic Law" can guarantee the most  important interest of the Hong Kong people. This has become the  consensus of many people.    "Democracy" under Chris Patten's signboard is not only very  deceptive but also extremely dangerous. Just imagine -- what  good does it do the economy of Hong Kong if Chris Patten leaves  behind a legislature that divides the Hong Kong people and  challenges the future SAR government? What consequences will  such a situation bring to investors in Hong Kong?    The masses of compatriots in Hong Kong are very patriotic.  We are convinced that in the transitional period before 1997,  more and more Hong Kong people will see through the real purpose  of the British authorities in Hong Kong and work jointly with  the people from the motherland to maintain Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability. Hong Kong -- the brilliant pearl of  the East -- will certainly be able to return smoothly to the  embrace of the motherland!</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 8: Market remains remarkably robust - Germany / Broadly-spread economic growth and investment ensure less vulnerability and more resilience ONCE AGAIN, Germany's property market has bucked the trend. While the other large property markets in the world have turned from boom to bust, it has remained remarkably robust. Prudent bank lending and tight planning controls have resulted in very low vacancy rates. At an average of less than 2 per cent, they are well below the level in other markets. Admittedly, the market does not have the buoyancy it had a year ago. Then, promoters of German property cited the promising economic outlook for the 1990s, the additional economic benefits from reunification and the increased interest from foreign investors. The force of these arguments has weakened as the German economy lost steam, the costs of reunification mounted and foreign investors were forced to retreat by problems in their own territory. Some agents are concerned about the amount of development over the past two years, particularly in suburban areas. This is likely to result in an oversupply in some areas, says Zadelhoff Deutschland, a property consultancy. Mr Robert Orr of Jones Lang Wootton is cautious about a few locations such as the outskirts of Dusseldorf or land close to Munich Airport. In general, however, he believes that the oversupply will be modest by comparison with the English-speaking markets. The deterioration in rental growth prospects, along with higher interest rates and bond yields, has caused yields on commercial property to lengthen over the past 18 months. So too has the downturn in foreign markets which has caused overseas investors to reign in their activities (although French players are still active and there may yet be investment by Japanese life companies). But the market still inspires considerable confidence. Domestic investors have stepped up their investments in the past nine months, partly because of reduced competition from overseas investors. So far, the lengthening of yields has been a modest affair. In 1991, yields weakened by about 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent for city centre properties and 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent for secondary and suburban properties, according to Zadelhoff Deutschland. The fragmented nature of the German property market leads to investment decisions being made on a city-by-city basis. The reunification of Germany, which has shifted the relative importance of cities, has made it even more pertinent. Hamburg, Hanover and Frankfurt are generally considered the greatest winners on the western side of the country from reunification. Hamburg is now firmly established as the leading northern German city. Hanover has also recovered much of its hinterland and is no longer on the eastern fringe of the country. Frankfurt's position as the financial heart of Germany has been enhanced by reunification. Jones Lang Wootton expects rental growth of between 7 per cent and 12 per cent a year. On the eastern side of the country, the dearth of modern commercial property has created opportunities for investors and developers, particularly in Dresden and Leipzig. But despite tax incentives, investors are deterred by legal, planning and contamination issues and the difficulties of estimating future supply and demand. Most of the running has been made by domestic investors. According to Mr Nigel Fletcher of Hillier Parker, foreign investors are being too cautious. 'I am not sure they are fully aware of the opportunities,' he says. Berlin stands out as the city which promises the greatest opportunities from reunification. That is assured by the decision to restore it as the seat of government and also by its position as a gateway between east and west Europe, which makes it a magnet for businesses. 'There is no doubt that Berlin will, in future, be one of the most important property markets, if not the most important, property market, in Europe', says Zadelhoff Deutschland. But the extreme shortage of office space in the city has bid up rents to more than DM 90 per square metre per month in Berlin, sparking worries that there may be a speculative bubble. The concern is heightened by high land prices and the large number of developments on the drawing board.  However these worries are shrugged off by those who point to the long lead times of the developments and the strong long-term prospects of the city. The renewed strength of Berlin conjures up the possibility that it could dominate the country in the way that London dominates the UK and Paris dominates France. But commentators are virtually unanimous that Germany will not lose the decentralised character it adopted after the fall of the Third Reich. The federal nature of Germany is one of the strengths of its property market. With its broadly-spread economic growth, the amount of investment attracted by any single city is limited, making German property markets less vulnerable to overheating than their rivals. Although this does not make it immune from a downturn - as investors discovered in 1973 - it gives it added resilience.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 17-30 per cent of annual rent, of a building               very often paid by the tennant  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: 17-30 per cent of annual rent, of a building               sometimes paid by the landlord                             Service charge: 10-15 per cent of rent                             VAT: 14 per cent                             Internal repair costs  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sale costs by investor      Legal fees or owner/occupier           Agents fees: 3 per cent-5 per cent,                             paid by the buyer in many cases  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase costs by investor  Transfer tax: 2 per cent or owner/occupier           Legal fees: 1 per cent                             Agents fees: 3-5 per cent  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Healey &amp; Baker  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

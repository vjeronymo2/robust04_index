			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nigerian government has not abandoned economic reforms Sir, Permit me to comment on your article 'Nigeria turns away from market economy' (January 12). It is not true that Nigeria has abandoned economic reforms. Neither can this present government be accused of abandoning the policy of transparency and financial accountability. The present government headed by General Abacha is in fact conducting in-house probes of key ministries whose functions impact on the economy of Nigeria and is thereby setting the standards of probity and accountability by which this government will be judged by its successor. The present policy of fixing the rate of the Naira is needed to ensure the financial stability necessary for economic development. Our government's decision to reduce interest rates from the prevailing 45 per cent to between 12 to 15 per cent, coupled with controlled and judicious use of foreign exchange, would lead to an increase in capacity utilisation in our industrial sector from the present level of 35 per cent. We witnessed in the recent past uncontrolled capital flight as a result of wholesale liberalisation of the banking sector. All the so-called merchant banks were nothing other than foreign exchange traders with little or no interest in production. You will agree the interest rate regime is not the only element of a policy of structural adjustment. It is true that producer prices of various export commodities may fall because of our decision to fix the Naira rate. However, the anticipated decline in the inflation rate would obviate the effect of this fall. It is certainly better to bring down inflation through increased production in all sectors of the economy rather than encourage trading in paper money which the interest rate hitherto prevailing encouraged. As for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, we have done virtually everything they wanted us to do in the last 10 years without the promised financial assistance. We have put in place a solid policy including cutting bureaucracy, privatisation, abolition of Commodity Boards, increasing the cost of energy by 500 per cent and reducing all social welfare costs. Also, we are presently embarking on measures to ensure transparency and accountability in government. The IMF and the World Bank must accept that a doctrinaire approach to economic development has never worked anywhere, as can be seen in the collapse of the economies in Russia and eastern Europe and those of most countries in Africa, with attendant social cost and political instability. Nigeria hopes the international community will assist in making us a good partner of our trading partners.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Seiroku Kajiyama, a  powerful Diet member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), sued the ASAHI SHIMBUN on Monday [31 January], demanding  100 million yen in damages over reports he received 10 million  yen from a construction firm.    The lawsuit, filed with the Tokyo District Court, also  demands the mass-circulation daily publish an apology.    The written petition of the suit said the reports libeled  Kajiyama, 67, an LDP House of Representatives member, and were  detrimental to his credibility.    On January 9, the ASAHI SHIMBUN carried a front-page story  that Mitsui Construction Co. gave 10 million yen to Kajiyama to  gain his influence in obtaining a public works contract.    The money was handed over around the spring of 1991 after a  Kajiyama representative allegedly asked then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio  Takeuchi to favor Mitsui Construction in bids for a 25 billion  yen dam project, the article said.    The ASAHI said Takeuchi, 76, related the transaction to the  Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which is investigating  a series of scandals involving politicians and general  contractors over public works projects.    Mitsui Construction asked the Kajiyama side to exert  influence on the governor so that the dam contract would be  awarded to the company, the report said.    Also on January 14, the paper reported that prosecutors  began  questioning executives of Mitsui Construction in connection with  the suspected payment to Kajiyama.    Lawyers for Kajiyama released a statement Monday that he  never requested nor received money from the Tokyo-based  construction firm. Kajiyama himself will soon hold a press  conference to prove his innocence on the issue, his office said.    The lawyers also criticized the Tokyo District Public  Prosecutors Office for leaking false information to ASAHI  SHIMBUN reporters.    According to the lawyers, Kajiyama has decided not to file a  complaint against the prosecutors office over the alleged leak,  saying the case will not be investigated fairly.    Tetsuzo Hori, head of the City News Department of the  ASAHI's  Tokyo headquarters, said the reports are based on sufficient  coverage and the paper is confident they are true.    Kajiyama, elected eight times since 1969 from Ibaraki  Prefecture's No. 2 Constituency where the dam is to be built,  has served as home affairs minister, international trade and  industry minister, and justice minister.    For two years from December 1990, Kajiyama was the LDP's  chief parliamentary strategist as chairman of the Diet Affairs  Committee. He later served as LDP secretary general between  December 1992 and last August.    Takeuchi was indicted last year for allegedly taking a total  of 95 million yen in bribes from major contractors Hazama Corp.,  Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Tobishima Corp.    A former vice president of Mitsui Construction is on trial  for allegedly giving a 10 million yen bribe to former Sendai  Mayor Toru Ishii.</p>

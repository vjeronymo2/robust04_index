			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha, May 7 (AFP) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salih Basindwah called on southern leaders to surrender  Saturday [7 May] saying northern forces had the upper hand as  fighting raged near Aden.    Basindwah, a northerner, told Qatar's state-run radio that  southern forces loyal to Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid had  fired 13 Scud missiles at the capital Sanaa since fighting  erupted on Thursday.    But he said northern forces backing President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih still had the advantage, saying 12 southern al-Bid  warplanes had been shot down since Thursday.    "The military situation is not developing in the favour" of  southern leaders he said, calling on them to "turn themselves in  immediately", pledging that they would receive "a fair trial."    "Fierce fighting is raging near Aden," the main southern  port- city, "between the (northern) army and the rebels",  Basindwah said in a reference to al-Bid's forces.    He added that Aden was under a northern blockade to "force  the outlaws to surrender."    Diplomats in Yemen said that a large concentration of  northern troops was seen 50 kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden.    Meanwhile Basindwah said the situation in Sanaa and all the  northern provinces was "calm."    He also said northern Yemenis were opposed to an emergency  meeting of the Arab League to discuss the spiralling civil war  as it was an "internal affair."    His comments came just before the Arab League was due to  hold  an emergency meeting in Cairo to discuss an Egyptian proposal to  send a peacekeeping force to Yemen.</p>

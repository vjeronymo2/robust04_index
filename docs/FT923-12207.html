			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / EC to meet east Europe leaders BRITAIN is to invite eastern European leaders to two EC meetings in October to highlight the emphasis which the UK is seeking to place during its presidency of the Community on enlargement eastwards. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday got EC colleagues to agree to meet foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia at their regular Luxembourg session on October 5. He also floated the idea of a October 28 summit in London between the eastern European states' prime ministers, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors president of the European Commission. France said the summit should include all EC government heads, rather than just Mr Major. France, with Italy's support, also urged that the meetings be extended to include leaders from Romania and Bulgaria, which are following central Europe's example in negotiating so-called 'Europe agreements' for eventual free trade over 10 years. UK officials said the Balkan leaders' attendance depended on the pace of their negotiations with Brussels. EC foreign ministers also formally approved negotiating guidelines for a trade and co-operation agreement with Slovenia.</p>

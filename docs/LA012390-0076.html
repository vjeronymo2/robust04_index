			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CRUELTY ON A LONG LEASH IN JAPANESE 'HARRAS'  </P> <P> "Harras" (at the Little Tokyo Cinemas) is yet another of those  ultra-sentimental animal pictures so beloved by the Japanese. However, not only  is it predictably tedious and smarmy, it is also -- unintentionally and  unattractively -- the story of a couple who never learn how to care for the dog  they supposedly love like the child they never had.  </P> <P> Consider this: The couple are the unexpected but not ungrateful recipients of  an adorable little puppy, which the husband names Harras. As they sit reading  in their comfortable suburban living room every evening, they let Harras bark  and cry, chained outside, until the neighbors complain. The husband reacts by  beating the puppy severely.  </P> <P> Twelve years pass, and the husband decides to give Harras a treat by taking him  along on a trip to a ski resort in the dead of winter. You guessed it: The  now-elderly dog gets lost in the snow. Miraculously, he survives, but the  following year is afflicted with a tumor the veterinarian is convinced is  malignant. Do the couple humanely put Harras to sleep? Of course not; it never  even occurs to them to do so, which means we have to watch Harras suffer until  he at last mercifully dies.  </P> <P> It is depressing to note that "Harras," which plays as one long contrivance,  was written by Tora-san creator Yoji Yamada and his longtime writing partner,  Yoshitaka Asama, but directed (routinely) by Tomio Kuriyama. In this synthetic  heart-tugger (Times-rated Mature), the various dogs who play Harras lend the  only natural touch to the film. Go Kato, who plays the obtuse husband, and  Yukiyo Toake, cast as his highly emotional wife, are veteran professionals who  deserve all our compassion.  </P> <P> 'HARRAS'  </P> <P> A Shochiku presentation. Director Tomio Kuriyama. Screenplay Yoji Yamada,  Yoshitaka Asama; from a book by Koji Nakano. Camera Kosuke Yasuda. Music  Shinichiro Ikebe. With Go Kato, Yukiyo Toake, Yoshikio Nakada. Toru Masuoka,  Yumi Kusaka, Narimi Arimori. In Japanese, with English subtitles.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 46 minutes.  </P></p>

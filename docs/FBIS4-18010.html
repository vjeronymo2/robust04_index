			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol [no date as received]--Yevgeny Saburov,  deputy prime minister of the Crimea Republic, recently gave  assurances in an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent  that it is not the policy of either the Crimean or Ukrainian  leadership that threatens most of all the practical  implementation of his concept of reforming the economy, but it  is the "fear of unpopular methods with which the people are  filled."    "I sensed the same fear during the meeting with Leonid  Kravchuk in Kiev, and this is very dangerous. I warned him that  I could not coordinate my economic actions with the incompetent  people who led Ukraine to such a state. I know that Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy is not a supporter of my economic concept and will  never become one. This is why I asked Kravchuk to check the  observance of the laws of Ukraine that delimit the powers of  Ukraine and Crimea," he said.    Replying to a question on the possible time of introducing  the reforms in compliance with the decrees, Saburov said that he  did not dare to affirm when these would get under way because  they touch upon many structures in Ukraine, the National Bank in  particular. Meanwhile, to implement the decrees on currency  regulation and on banking activity, permission is necessary to  licence the activity of not only Ukrainian banks but foreign  banks as well.    Saburov reported that he was not yet familiarized with the  economic programs of Ukrainian economists, but "there will be no  problems" as far as the coordination of actions with the future  Government of Ukraine is concerned, "if the sides abide by the  laws on the delimitation of powers and coordinate their actions  on this very basis".    The Crimean deputy prime minister resolutely rejected any  connection between the introduction of economic reforms and the  political situation on the peninsula. In his opinion, the mass  media unjustly assessed "the fuss in high places during the  election campaign" as political instability in Crimea. "It is  normal for politicians to win over to their side. I believe  that the tragic nature of the situation in Crimea is far-fetched  in many respects. There is no Abkhazia here," he assured, and  also emphasized the "gross violations by Ukraine of its own law  on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea  Republic, according to which all economic activity, including  the signing of international agreements, is the prerogative of  Crimea."    Saburov spoke out for the necessity of setting up joint  working groups of Ukraine and Crimea to conduct negotiations and  work out the documents acceptable to both sides, "as this has  been done by Russia and Tatarstan," and to search for a  compromise, which "always requires a certain amount of courage."    In reply to the question, "Who would you like to see as the  president of Ukraine?", Saburov said that he had seen neither  worthy politicians nor appropriate economic programs at the  election in Ukraine."    "They were blaming Russia, although one could at least see  the differences between political forces there. As far as  Ukraine is concerned, political life here is in embryonic  state," he said.    In Saburov's opinion, Leonid Kuchma and "insignificant,  little-known persons, who represented the interregional Bloc of  Reforms, gained victory only because they had a certain program  and people were voting for it."</p>

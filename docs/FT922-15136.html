			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / People: Non-executive directors If the experience of Peter Walker and Norman Tebbit is any guide, ex-Tory cabinet ministers should have no difficulty picking up a clutch of impressive non-executive directorships. There is therefore some surprise at Cecil Parkinson's first foray into the boardroom since being free from Parliament. He has been appointed a non-executive director of Usborne, a relatively small firm of grain merchants and pig producers with a market capitalisation of just Pounds 10m and an unimpressive share price record. It is understood that Parkinson and David Frame, Usborne's chief executive, did their chartered accountancy articles together and have known each other for a long time. Parkinson's office said yesterday that he was likely to take up other non-executive directorships. In the meantime his construction expertise should come in handy as Usborne extricates itself from an ill-timed venture into property development. ***** Eric Kinder, chairman of Smith &amp; Nephew, as chairman of MERCHANT RETAIL; Michael Swan, formerly executive chairman, becomes non-executive deputy chairman. ***** Evelyn Matthews, formerly md of Bass (UK), at MARSTON, THOMPSON &amp; EVERSHED. ***** Neville Bowen, chief executive of Citibank Global Asset Management, at IRISH LIFE.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rights issue fears overshadow shares AN EARLY powerful per-formance by London's equity market, triggered mostly by the first big post-election takeover bid, ran out of steam in reaction to three bearish factors yesterday. These were bad money supply figures from Germany; a steep slide in the Footsie's important pharmaceutical stocks after US group Merck was suspended for a while on Wall Street due to a backlog of selling orders; and worries that a hefty rights issue from one of the Footsie constituents is imminent. The FT-SE 100-share index ended a volatile day only marginally higher on balance, up 2 at 2,609.8. For much of the session, however, the market had run ahead, with buying spurred by suggestions that UK interest rates could be set to fall in coming months. The interest rate stories had been fuelled by sterling's strong performance of late, with the currency consolidating its position yesterday. Added to the currency's firmness was a feeling of confidence generated by recent surveys on the UK economy suggesting it is fast emerging from recession. The day's most positive news, however, came with the much-heralded takeover bid for Dowty Group, launched by TI Group, which prompted a flurry of bid-inspired activity in other areas of the market. The Footsie, which began the day around 3 points higher, picked up momentum as the morning wore on and reached the day's peak of 2,630.1, or 22.3 points to the good, just after midday. This coincided with bad money supply figures from Germany, which many observers said dented lingering hopes of Frankfurt interest rate cuts and could postpone rate cuts elsewhere, including the UK. The news 'knocked the stuffing out of equities', as one dealer put it, with the Footsie future coming under pressure. The emergence, later in the day, of the rights issue worries, together with a poor opening on Wall Street and a big drop in Merck shares, put the skids under London, with the Footsie relinquishing all of its hard won gains and dipping into negative territory  -posting a 2.1 decline at one point - before stabilising. The slide in Merck shares on Wall Street caused a wave of selling pressure in Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome, which together accounted for nearly eight points on the Footsie. Rights issue speculation centred on, among others, Kingfisher, BTR and Courtaulds. Dealers were heartened by the increased levels of activity in the equity market. Turnover topped 612m shares. Stock Exchange figures revealed that the value of customer business on Wednesday exceeded Pounds 1.5bn. Tuesday, when attendance in the market was affected by the Easter holiday, has been the only post-general election session in which the value of retail business has fallen below Pounds 1bn. The strategy team at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew remains bullish of the equity market. Mr Mark Brown said: 'With the Tories back in, the last party for the UK equity market is on again. Yields can fall further in response to a better mix of inflation and growth.'</p>

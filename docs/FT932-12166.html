			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Administrators find buyer for Platt PLATT SACO Lowell, the Accrington-based textile machinery company which was put into administration in February, has been sold as a going concern to a consortium led by Mr James Eke, its chairman. Platt makes spinning and fibre preparation equipment and is one of the world's biggest textile machine producers. Its turnover has dropped from Pounds 16.6m in 1988 to Pounds 10m last year following a worldwide slump in orders. The company has been run by a team of administrators from KPMG Peat Marwick for the past two months. In March, 120 people were sacked as part of a survival plan, leaving a workforce of just over 70. Mr Eke's consortium has bought for undisclosed terms the business, plant, machines and stocks, together with a licence which will allow it to continue operating on its present 750,000 sq ft Globe Works site in Accrington for the next six months. However, KPMG said negotiations for the sale of the building were continuing, and it understood that a deal was imminent. A meeting of some of Platt's 1,000 creditors on April 1 had given the joint administrators, Mr Mike Seery and Mr Peter Terry, four weeks to attempt to sell the business and assets of the company, which has debts estimated at Pounds 5m. Mr Seery said: 'It is difficult to sell even businesses with international reputations as is currently evidenced by a number of well-publicised cases in Lancashire alone. 'Therefore we are delighted in this particular climate to have been able to sell Platts as a going concern in a relatively short time and in a way which will realise a significant dividend for the company's creditors.' For the past 11 years Platt was owned by the South Carolina company John D Hollingsworth on Wheels, which bought it from the receivers of Stone-Platt Industries.</p>

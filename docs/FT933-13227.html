			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Renewed tightness for September COPPER in the afternoon on the LME helped the three-month price to rally smartly back above Dollars 1,900 a tonne, erasing early losses to close steady. Business in the other base metals was largely subdued, said dealers, as the summer run-down in trade interest exercised its usual dampening impact on activity. Chicago SOYABEAN prices were boosted by concerns over production following USDA Secretary Mike Espy's statement last Friday that 20m acres of US crop land had been affected by the Mississippi-Missouri flooding. Chicago WHEAT futures jumped on the strong soyabean surge, with independent strength coming from worries about cuts in US wheat production, traders said. New York COTTON prices soared by almost the 2 cent limit in early trading on prospects of a drop in Chinese production, as well as in sympathy with soaring soyabean prices and dry weather concerns in the south-east. GOLD edged ahead on the London bullion market. Dealers said the tone remained bullish, citing last week's support at Dollars 390 a troy ounce despite almost flat US inflation data.

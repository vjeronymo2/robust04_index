			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Czech Republic (6): Western ties cemented - Foreign policy THE withdrawal of Soviet forces from central Europe and the consequences which flowed from the failed Moscow coup of August 1991 have lifted the danger of military or political pressure from the east after decades of domination by Moscow. But, ideally, the Czech Republic, like the other liberated states of the former Soviet empire, would like to guarantee its future role in Europe by membership of an extended European Community and a restructured Nato. 'Since the Czech Republic shares the same democratic values with the Nato countries, and since it is resolved to defend these values, it considers full-fledged membership in Nato as its long-term and irreversible goal,' according to a foreign policy statement from the foreign ministry. For good measure it adds: 'The republic considers an American military presence as a guarantee of long-term European stability and also sees Czech membership in the West European Union as its long-term goal.' As Mr Josef Zielenic, the foreign minister, points out, the Czech divorce from Slovakia underlines the western character of the new state. It no longer has a common border with Hungary or Ukraine and has severed the Danube link which physically links southern central Europe with the Balkans. Specifically the divorce also leaves Prague free from entanglement in the international dispute between Slovakia and Hungary over the future of the controversial Gabcikovo dam, south east of Bratislava. The maintenance of good relations with Slovakia has become a foreign policy, not an internal matter, but no less important for that. Slovakia's desire for its own international status and symbols was one of the main driving forces behind the divorce. The two states retain important trade, financial and, above all, human links which will have to be fostered on a new basis. Further to the east, the potential for economic decline spilling over into unpredictable political instability, remains considerable and the Czech Republic, again like other states in the region, fears becoming an uncomfortable buffer zone between hungry job seekers from the east and an increasingly protectionist west. But while diplomats speak of 'monitoring' developments in eastern and south-eastern Europe and seeking opportunities for business and economic co-operation, the main emphasis of Czech diplomacy and business will be 'to strive for the balanced relations of partnership and co-operation with Germany'. This is hardly surprising given the chequered history of relations between the two states in this century and the importance of Germany as the republic's main trade partner and most important source of future investment. Beyond Germany the Czech Republic also seeks to 'extend friendly relations with the US, France and Britain and other member states of the EC and EFTA with whom it sees its future to be ever more closely linked'.</p>

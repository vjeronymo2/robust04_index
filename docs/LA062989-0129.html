			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES CENTRAL AGENCY FOR ENVIRONMENT POLICY  </P> <P> In a step that acknowledges the growing concern over Los Angeles' many  environmental problems, the City Council on Wednesday authorized the creation  of a Department of Environmental Affairs to seek solutions to problems ranging  from air quality to water pollution.  </P> <P> Environmentalists watching the vote in the council chambers hailed the  unanimous decision, which will make Los Angeles the first big city in the  nation to have a centralized way of setting policy and coordinating actions on  environmental issues.  </P> <P> "There are all kinds of environmental concerns, but what's happened is there  hasn't been one (central) office to coordinate, to manage or to set policy on  all these various issues," said Joan Milke Flores, who called for creating the  department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Realistic Solutions  </P> <P> By "its independent evaluation of environmental problems, the department will  help lead the city to realistic solutions and put an end to approaching  environmental issues in a fragmented way."  </P> <P> In a period when Los Angeles is being confronted with myriad environmental  problems, the new department will assist the council and mayor by analyzing  issues and making policy recommendations. Its staff will also monitor citywide  environmental programs and disseminate information to the public.  </P> <P> Environmentalists applauded creation of the new office as a long overdue  solution to a bureaucracy that they say has mired environmental actions in  individual departments rather than finding comprehensive answers that could be  applied citywide.  </P> <P> "There were instances in which environmental concerns would fall into the  cracks because different agencies would be involved with different parts of the  projects," said Jill Ratner, a member of Citizens for a Better Environment, a  statewide group that monitors enforcement of environmental legislation. "I  think (the new office) will give us a place to go."  </P> <P> Added Bonnie Holmes of the Los Angeles-area Sierra Club, who attended the  council session along with Ratner, "it's a long overdue, crucial step to  provide the integrated response we need for this city's environmental  problems."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 13 Departments  </P> <P> Currently 13 city departments exert some jurisdiction over environmental  matters, a control system that spurred Mayor Tom Bradley to initially oppose  the creation of the department. Fearing that such a centralized office would  touch off a turf war among other departments handling similar issues, Bradley  instead proposed an air quality management office with more limited authority.  </P> <P> However, the mayor is expected to approve the department's creation, said  spokesman Bill Chandler, and the duties that would have been assigned to an air  quality management office will fall under the jurisdiction of the new  department.  </P> <P> The department is expected to have a first-year budget of approximately  $700,000.  </P></p>

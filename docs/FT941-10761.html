			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / People: Loudon quits M&amp;G board George Loudon, the former Midland Montagu chief executive who lost his job when HSBC Holdings acquired the Midland Group, is stepping down as a non-executive director of Britain's largest independent unit trust company M&amp;G after just under a year. 'M&amp;G is a terribly conservative place and maybe that is not apparent to an outsider,' says group managing director Paddy Linaker. 'We are a bit of a tortoise rather than a hare. Loudon is a high-powered financial type used to doing mega-deals on a regular basis.' M&amp;G has recently been surprised by the degree of controversy sparked by the renewal of its executive share option scheme, which was in fact approved by a majority of shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting last week. But Linaker is firm that Loudon's departure is quite unconnected with that episode. 'He was totally behind the company's stance,' he says. Dutch-born Loudon, whose varied international experience had included spells with Amro Bank in Amsterdam, Lazard Freres in Paris and the Ford Foundation in New York and Jakarta, may have been disappointed that M&amp;G's plans to expand into continental Europe have not taken shape faster, according to Linaker. But it was not one sole issue, rather a general difference of philosophy, that prompted the cooling which was already apparent last September, the M&amp;G boss continues. Two other non-executive directors are stepping down from the board; Lord Rees-Mogg after seven years' service and Alan McLintock after 14, while Barry Sherlock, chairman of the life insurance and unit trust self-regulatory organisation Lautro, comes on in a non-executive capacity, but Linaker says there is 'no tremendous hurry' to make further appointments.</p>

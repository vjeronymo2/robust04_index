			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Crash of the bedpan still reverberates at Westminster: Why political realities may affect moves to reform the NHS hierarchy PRIORITY holiday reading for Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, and her senior colleagues this summer will be the report of the National Health Service Functions and Manpower Review - proof that the document is not as dull as its unglamorous title suggests. The review's recommendations are set to stimulate an autumn political controversy over the extent to which the internal market created by the 1991 NHS reforms should be freed from central control. In the reformed NHS, hospitals provide services and district health authorities and fund-holding family doctors purchase them. But this market activity - now the mechanism that drives the NHS - takes place within a bureaucratic structure that can be traced back to the 1940s. Several thousand officials in the Department of Health in Whitehall, the NHS management executive in Leeds, and regional health authorities and management executive outposts throughout the country continue to manage and supervise the service above pur-chaser-provider level. Many hospital and health authority managers believe much of the higher-level structure has been rendered redundant by the reforms. The NHS currently resembles a huge conglomerate in which slimmed-down subsidiaries are struggling to reform an unwieldy head office. Mrs Bottomley set up the review to examine management structure and allied issues. Its report will, however, advance options rather than a single blueprint - pushing decisions back to ministers. Mastering bureaucratic and political skills have always been natural elements of the job for NHS managers. Many were initially hesitant about the government's NHS reforms, which brought a more commercial edge to management style. But, after only two years of the new system, there is pressure from managers for more freedom, with a scaling-down of central and intermediate management structures. 'Organisations throughout the world are flattening their structures and setting managers clearer objectives,' says Mr Ray Rowden, director of the Institute of Health Services Management. 'The British health service cannot isolate itself from those trends.' Advocates of a flatter structure reject suggestions that the establishment of trust hospitals, running their day-to-day affairs, has increased the need for supervision to ensure public accountability. 'It is possible for too much bureaucracy and a culture of management-by-circular to get in the way of true accountability,' says Mr Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts (NAHAT). 'A system in which ministers set policy goals, with the management executive, health authorities and trusts delivering them against strong performance targets, could clarify objectives and increase accountability.' Mr Rowden agrees. 'It is possible to have both greater accountability and less structure. There is an elaborate regional structure at the moment, but a lack of clarity about how accountability is supposed to work within it.' The review team was chaired by Ms Kate Jenkins, a former head of the Thatcher government's efficiency unit and a member of the NHS policy board. Her antecedence as one of the originators of the government's Next Steps programme that established executive agencies, delivering services at arms-length from government, made it certain that such a solution would be considered for the NHS. Most managers doubt whether ministers will be prepared to turn the NHS management executive, which runs the service on a day-to-day basis on behalf of Mrs Bottomley, into an executive agency. But they do hope the review will create a stronger separation between ministers' responsibilities for deciding policy and priorities, and the management structure in which these decisions are executed. Ministers are certain to want to retain an intermediate tier between Whitehall and the market. They may simply opt for a smaller management executive and a reduction in the number and size of the 14 English regional health authorities. On paper, this would not look like radical change - but the most important issue is the way government allocates powers between the various levels of the NHS structure. 'We need slimmer central and intermediate structures that support, facilitate and broker local market activity rather than try to direct it,' says Mr Hunt. A comment by Aneurin Bevan, founder of the NHS, that 'when a bedpan is dropped on a hospital floor, its noise should resound in the Palace of Westminster' is still much-quoted in the service. Managers pressing for more devolution use it to illustrate the absurdity of the modern NHS, one of the world's largest organisations, trying to function as though all decisions flow from ministers. Yet health is a highly political subject and, while managers may make most of the decisions, ministers get the blame when things go wrong, The distant crash of the bedpan is an alarm signal, and politicians are apprehensive about dismantling the bureaucratic structure through which the soundwaves reverberate upwards.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: London The monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on Wednesday is likely to dominate market attention this week. Although the meeting has been brought forward by a week, Mr David Walton, UK economist at Goldman Sachs, is not expecting any immediate action on interest rates. 'Economic activity looks relatively buoyant,' says Mr Walton, pointing to the recent CBI industrial trends survey. He also thinks today's figures for M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, will show strong growth. The consensus forecast is that M0 will have risen 5.8 per cent in the year to January. Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg Securities argues that 'the Treasury will surely want to see January retail sales figures and to gauge the follow-through from the buoyant CBI survey' and he doubts that a rate cut will be sanctioned. The market may spend part of the week digesting last week's disappointing auction of 2010 stock. Foreign investors normally prefer 10-year stock but Yamaichi International (Europe) argues that the lack of overseas demand has set alarm bells ringing as to whether next year there will be as much take-up of gilts by foreign investors as seen in the current financial year.</p>

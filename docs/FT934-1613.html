			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti given trading ban in Canada Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the Italian financier, has agreed to settle allegations of Canadian securities law violations with a CDollars 2.7m (USDollars 2m) payment and a lifetime trading ban. Under the terms of a settlement approved yesterday by the Ontario Securities Commission, Mr Cragnotti and his business associate Mr Robert Marziale have also been banned for life from serving as directors or officers of any public company in Ontario. The allegations against Mr Cragnotti and Mr Marziale involve Lawson Mardon, the packaging group in which Cragnotti and Partners, the Milan-based investment group controlled by Mr Cragnotti, has a 52 per cent voting stake. According to a statement of facts, nominee accounts controlled by Mr Cragnotti accounted for 48 per cent of all trades in Lawson shares in the six weeks prior to an equity offering by the company in October 1992. The statement said that these purchases increased market liquidity and buoyed Lawson's share price. Mr Cragnotti and Mr Marziale initially claimed they were not involved. But according to the statement, they 'subsequently corrected their evidence and co-operated with (the commission's) staff'. A spokesman for Mr Cragnotti said he had agreed to the settlement to expedite a proposed takeover of Lawson Mardon by Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss industrial group. Alusuisse, in the middle of a due diligence assessment of Lawson, has indicated that the case against Mr Cragnotti will not affect its decision whether to proceed with its CDollars 555m offer. An OSC lawyer said yesterday that the penalties confirm 'the commission's resolve to ensure compliance with rules designed to protect investors in the capital markets'. Mr Cragnotti was questioned by Italian police last month about his involvement in the Enimont bribes scandal. He has subsequently been released.</p>

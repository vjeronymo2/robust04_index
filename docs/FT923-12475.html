			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 2.6% on new probe rumours RUMOURS of an investigation by the new securities watchdog commission into loss compensation and share price manipulation contributed to a 2.6 per cent fall in the Nikkei average yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei lost 439.59 to 16,548.07, the intra-day low, for a 1.4 per cent fall on the week. The index opened at the day's high of 16,969.29, but later fell on index-related selling and arbitrage unwinding. Volume remained flat at 180m shares. Declines led advances by 794 to 131 with 143 isses unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.44 to 1,271.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 5.84 to 992.17. Some investors cited money supply figures, announced after the market closed, as an excuse for the inactivity. Reports of banks' large outstanding loans to housing loan companies also shook investors. Housing loan companies were set up in the 1960s to provide individuals with low rate housing loans. However, in the late 1980s, many of the housing loan companies increased exposure to small and medium sized real estate companies through cheap funding by banks. Nippon Housing Loan, the sector leader, fell Y20 to Y255, a new low for the year. Banks and real estate companies were also affected, with Industrial Bank of Japan falling Y50 to Y1,730 and Mitsubishi Estate down Y16 to Y804. Daito Trust Construction, which plunged on Thursday on rumours of its connections with Watakyu Kensetsu, a Tokyo-based real estate developer missing two payment deadlines, fell a further Y120 to Y3,700. In spite of denials by Daito, investors continued selling the stock. Dealers closed their positions on short-term speculative issues ahead of the weekend. Meiji Milk Products lost Y34 to Y945 and Sumitomo Chemical declined Y15 to Y436. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 357.52 to 19,093.39 in volume of 7.9m shares. Roundup SENIOR markets were fairly subdued in the Pacific Basin yesterday, but there was life in New Zealand and Thailand. South Korea was closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG offered its equivalent of a sideways move after yet another new record on Thursday, the Hang Seng index breaking a five-day winning streak as it shed 34.47 to 6,128.06, still 2.5 per cent higher on the week. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 4.2bn to HKDollars 2.8bn. SYDNEY fell as Thursday's support for resource stocks waned, industrials continued to lose ground and a slight fall in the price of bullion bruised gold shares. The All Ordinaries index lost 9.7 to 1,629.5, 0.9 per cent lower on the week, in turnover up from ADollars 120m to ADollars 192m. SINGAPORE recovered from steep falls to close just above a technical support line, the Straits Times Industrial index ending 11.47 lower at 1,451.14, down 2.4 per cent on the week, as volume remained thin at an estimated 37m shares. NEW ZEALAND closed at its highest level since September, 1990, as recent falls in domestic interest rates encouraged investors to chase high-yielding stocks. The NZSE-40 index reached an intraday high of 1,604.08 before drifting back to close at 1,597.45, up 8.22 on the day and 1.9 per cent on the week. BANGKOK traded heavily in property and finance shares, which led the market higher in strong turnover. The SET index rose 8.33 points or 1.1 per cent to 758.71 in turnover of Bt10.43bn, the biggest business since June 11 when Anand Panyarachun was appointed interim prime minister. Bangkok Land was the second most active stock in turnover of Bt713.4m as it gained Bt4 to Bt151. The company said that it was interested in applying to build a mass transit system in Bangkok.</p>

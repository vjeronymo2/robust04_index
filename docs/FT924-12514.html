			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (17): Heir to the Iacocca legend / Profile of Robert Eaton, Chrysler's next chairman IT IS hard to follow a living legend, but that is the task that faces Mr Robert Eaton who will take over as chairman of Chrysler from Mr Lee Iacocca, the man who oversaw the company's return from near financial death at the start of the 1980s. Bob Eaton was named last spring as the surprise choice to succeed Mr Iacocca. The Big Three US motor manufacturers usually pick their chairmen from within, but Chrysler went outside to rival General Motors, plucking Mr Eaton from his position as president of GM's European unit. But while Mr Iacocca will be a tough act to follow, Mr Eaton has at least joined the company at a good time, when its fortunes have suddenly rallied. Just two years ago some motor industry analysts questioned whether Chrysler could survive as an independent company. After its remarkable escape from near bankruptcy in the early 1980s, the company seemed to rest on its laurels, diversifying into non-automotive businesses and failing to develop quickly a new range of cars to replace its ageing K series models. It was heading into a recession with a stretched balance sheet, losing market share and facing huge financial demands to develop new models. But adversity has bred resilience. The balance sheet remains weak but Chrysler can at least now see glimmers of light at the end of the tunnel. It has slashed its operating costs and revamped its method of developing new vehicles to the point where some analysts are now calling it a model for the US industry. Above all, it looks as if it has a succession of critical hits on its hands. This autumn sees the roll-out of its long-awaited LH model range of extremely roomy mid-range cars which have won accolades from the motoring Press. The question now is whether they, together with several other important products the company will wheel out between now and 1994, will prove an equal success with the motoring public. Mr Eaton, who is 52 and currently the company's chief operating officer, says the LH production start up is going 'outstandingly well' - as good as or better than any he has known - and the few models that have been delivered to customers so far have been 'extremely well received'. Mr Eaton brings to the new job a reputation as a good engineer, manufacturer and quality expert, with an eye for detail and an ability to foster team-building. As such, he should give the company many skills complementary to Mr Robert Lutz, the Chrysler president who was passed over for the top job and has a particular flair for the development and marketing of new products. Mr Eaton himself reckons the most important attributes he has brought to the company include a 'relatively broad view of the industry - European, Japanese etc - and a very strong background and track record in cost, quality and product'. His European experience is of limited direct value to Chrysler since it has virtually no overseas operations, though it is growing its export business to Europe fast from a low base and now has a mini-van production joint venture in Austria. Still, Mr Eaton reckons his time in Europe will be valuable because it has given him a 'broader perspective of the US and its problems in comparison to the rest of the world'. Mr Eaton grew up in Colorado, took a degree in engineering and joined GM as a trainee in 1963, working his way up the group's engineering side. His most important break came when the company sent him to Europe in 1988 to take over from Mr Jack Smith - now number two at GM - who had begun to turn around the area from losses into GM's most successful automotive operation. Mr Eaton carried on the Smith tradition and won particular plaudits for negotiating new flexible working agreements with European labour unions and for GM's rapid move into the east German. A down to earth man with reputation for frugality and informality, Mr Eaton will take over next January as chairman , although Mr Iacocca will remain on the board as chairman of the executive committee for one year (extendable) and will continue to do some consulting for the company. This has led some analysts to suggest that Mr Iacocca, who has evidently found it hard to quit the company, might remain breathing down Mr Eaton's neck. However, Mr Eaton quotes Mr Iacocca as saying 'I'll be retired and I'll no longer be involved in any day to day operations of the company.' A diametrically opposed problem arose in August when Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the Californian who is the company's largest single investor, demanded a meeting with Chrysler executives to express concern about the reduced role Mr Iacocca would be playing after January. However, after a two-hour meeting he seemed to go away happy. Part of his concern seemed to be the fact that he had never met the new chairman. Mr Eaton acknowledges that 'in hindsight I probably should have met him earlier  .' but says relations are now excellent. Where does Mr Eaton see Chrysler five years down the road? 'I believe the company has the opportunity to be the premier North American automobile company from the standpoint of product, quality, cost and customer satisfaction, and giving a very good return to its shareholders,' he says. By premier he obviously does not mean the largest - since Chrysler is by far the smallest of the big three - though he thinks it could be able to increase its share of the US car and light truck market from the current 13 per cent to 15 per cent. For a company which just two years ago seemed the sick man of Detroit, that is no mean achievement.</p>

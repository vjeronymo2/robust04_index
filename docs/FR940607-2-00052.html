			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the permit covers a large area, the take of threatened or endangered species will only occur where actual urban growth occurs. The area designated for urban uses (including all low density residential categories) in the 2010 General Plan covers roughly 74.5 square miles (47,600 acres) of undeveloped or open land. Of this, 22.25 square miles (14,200) acres is natural land, which currently supports populations of the species of concern, and 52.25 square miles (33,400 acres) of other open lands, primarily intensive agriculture. Full build-out of the 2010 General Plan would double the size of Bakersfield, but full build-out is not expected to occur within the proposed 20-year life of the permit. Realistic projections indicate a loss of open lands at a rate of roughly 1 square miles per year, which is assumed to be divided proportionately between natural and other open lands. At that rate, a loss of some 20 square miles of open land, including some 7 square miles of natural land, will take place over the life of the permit. Even though actual growth and impact may vary, the mitigation program is designed to be self-regulating, even a major increase in growth could be accommodated by the proposed HCP program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actual extent and location of Metropolitan Bakersfield growth cannot be exactly predicted, and the HCP must therefore rely on the ongoing preservation actions of the Trust. Permit compliance will be met by maintaining adequate enhancement levels. There are two tests that the Trust must meet: (1) 1 acre of enhancement for each acre of open land urbanized, or (2) 3 acres enhanced for each acre of natural land urbanized, whichever is greater. The accounting will be done quarterly and annually, but will reflect cumulative urbanization commencing at the beginning of the permit period. Management plans for habitat areas will require approval from the Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA examines a range of alternatives pertaining to preserve strategy. The no-action alternative, meaning that the City and County would not obtain a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit, would leave much of the Metropolitan Bakersfield area in conflict with the Act and potentially subject to civil and criminal penalties. The Service could only enforce the Act on a case-by-case basis and significant impact on endangered species could still occur through piece meal reduction of habitat, cumulative indirect impact of growth, and lack of enhancement to offset past impacts. No action would lead to significant impairment of growth in Metropolitan Bakersfield, along with gradual, significant deterioration in the status of endangered species. Other alternatives examined include five other preserve strategies and mandatory relocation as additional mitigation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Marvin L.

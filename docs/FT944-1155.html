			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Carter's mission impossible offers scant hope If the guns fall silent in Bosnia tomorrow, Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president, can pat himself on the back for his mediation efforts. However, there seems little hope of the warring parties agreeing the conditions of a long-term peace. In a three-day diplomatic shuttle around former Yugoslavia, Mr Carter announced yesterday he had secured the agreement of the Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-led Bosnian government for a four-month ceasefire in a country where truces seldom last more than a few hours. Mr Carter also said he had obtained agreements from both parties to release all prisoners taken in their 32-month-old war. 'Both sides agreed to let the International Red Cross come in, inspect the prisons, inspect all the prison camps, and inventory the prisoners, and it calls for an immediate release, total release of all prisoners of war by both sides,' he said in Atlanta. However, he stressed the ceasefire agreement was only a tentative pact. 'The whole thing can very easily come apart,' he said. The two sides pledged to hammer out, over the next fortnight, the specific details of a cessation of hostilities. However, even before the ink was dry on the agreement, last night Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, predicted it would be stillborn if Bosnian-government forces failed to withdraw from strategic heights around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, which are UN demilitarised zones. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, warned that the Serbs were using the Carter talks as a foil while their forces tightened their stranglehold around Bihac, a Moslem enclave in the north-west. He endorsed the ceasefire, but said he saw no chance for peace. The time is right for a ceasefire, as neither side wants to fight a war as the harsh Balkan winters grips Bosnia. But the leaders of both sides appear convinced that war is preferable to compromise. The Bosnian government clings to the five-nation Contact Group's plan it accepted last July, giving the Moslem-Croat federation 51 per cent of Bosnia and the rest to Serbs, who now control 70 per cent. The Moslem-led government, by its own admission, accepted the plan as the Serbs were bound to reject it. They are holding out for salvation from abroad, perhaps military intervention. The Sarajevo government remains convinced the incoming Republican majority in the US Congress will vote to lift the arms embargo. The Bosnian Serbs, as the stronger group, see no reason to accept the maps foisted on them by the Contact Group. They have withstood an embargo imposed on them in August by their former mentor, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / NW Water recruits from Tarmac North West Water yesterday sought to lay to rest any anxieties over its international expansion by appointing as its new chief executive Mr Brian Staples, former head of Tarmac's contracting business. He replaces Mr Bob Thian, widely credited with building North West's international business. Mr Thian, a forceful manager, left in November following what was reported as a 'difference in management style' with the equally hands-on chairman, Sir Desmond Pitcher. The City yesterday gave a cautious welcome to Mr Staples' appointment, although as a divisional manager he is relatively unknown. 'He is a very, very good risk analyser,' said one analyst. This, and his experience in managing large sums of capital investment, would prove invaluable to North West's international expansion, among the more aggressive in the UK water industry. Mr Staples, 48, became chief executive of Tarmac's construction division in 1992 and is highly regarded as a UK contractor within his industry. He had been about to join the Tarmac main board. He said he intended to conduct a strategic review at North West once he had learned his way around the water industry. On the international side, he said North West would focus on operating contracts, as opposed to the higher-risk contracting projects. Sir Desmond said North West, which has suffered a number of executive upheavals since privatisation in 1989, had sought to appoint a 'team leader'. Mr Staples was also arriving at a particularly 'important time for North West as the regulatory review moves to completion'. The management of the massive capital investment programme under the new pricing regime to be set by the industry regulator this summer would be crucial to the group's profits, he said. Tarmac announced yesterday that, following the departure of Staples, it plans to divide the construction business into two divisions. Mr Brian Pellard, 51, managing director of Tarmac Construction Regions, will head the contracting division. Steve Redding, managing director of Tarmac's management division, will take charge of the professional services business expanding its consultancy operations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Official sources in New Delhi have clarified that  there is no change in India's stand on Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT]. New Delhi believes that nuclear nonproliferation  must be universal, comprehensive, and nondiscriminatory. The  sources said the prime minister had categorically stated this  position in his recent address to the Army commanders  conference. They were reacting to press reports that the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal behari Vajpayee,  expressed the view that the prime minister's observations over  the issue needs clarification.    The sources said Mr. Narasimha Rao in his speech made it  clear that any attempt to restrict India's nuclear option will  be unacceptable and unrealistic in view of Pakistan having  acquired nuclear weapon capability. There is also proliferation  of such weapons recently.</p>

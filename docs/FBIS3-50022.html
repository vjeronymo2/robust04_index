Judge Antonie Iorgovan, who is also professor of  constitutional law of the Bucharest University, reminds that  Romania's constitution does not provide such a concept because  of the simple reason that there is only one government in a  unitary state, politically responsible in front of the single  parliament as the representative body of the Romanian nation."    Antonie Iorgovan reminded also that the "self-governing"  wording was not stipulated by any unitary state's constitution  in Western Europe as they consecrated a regional system of local  administration and not a departmental system." Antonie Iorgovan  draws attention also to the fact that even though only a  departmental system of administrative-territorial organization  in counties exists in Romania and not one recognizing regions,  lands, provinces or communities, "there are political forces who  employ such wording." Judge Iorgovan cites the Article 31,  Paragraph 7, of the constitution as saying: "Any defamation of  the country and the nation, instigation to a war of aggression,  to national, racial, class or religious hatred, any incitement  to discrimination, territorial separatism, public violence as  well as an obscene conduct contrary to morality are prohibited  by law."    The public opinion in Romania has repeatedly showed in the  recent years, its concern with regard to the statements made by  several UDMR leaders questioning directly or in a dissimulated  way the issue of Transylvania, ancient Romanian territory,  temporarily under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg  empire, till 1918.    According to the January 1992 census, the population of the  counties of the historic province of Transylvania is made up by  Romanians with 72.3 percent.</p>

Sterling Deposit 2.414p SUNDAY AUGUST 23 Treasury 2 1/2 pc I-L 2011 Pounds 2.27 RESULTS DUE INTERIM results from Argos, the catalogue retailer, are due today with most profit estimates between Pounds 8.5m and Pounds 9.5m pre tax, against Pounds 10.7m last year. The figures are hard to forecast as the first half of the year is far less important than the Christmas trading period. Annual figures from Ratners, the jewellery retailer, are also expected this week. The figures for the year to February 1 are expected to show a loss of Pounds 125m pre-tax after exceptional costs for rationalisation of Pounds 98m and interest charges of around Pounds 27m. More interesting will be reports of the group's talks with its bankers and, perhaps, news of a capital restructuring. BICC, the cables and Balfour Beatty construction group, is likely to announce on Wednesday a pre-tax profit fall of about Pounds 10m from the Pounds 66m made in the first half of last year. A key question - with an eye on 1993 dividend prospects - will be whether profits are holding up from the European cables business. Marley, the building products manufacturer which announces interims on Wednesday, is expected to show a further fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.3m to about Pounds 8m. The bad news should be softened by a maintained interim dividend of 2.1p for the third consecutive year - albeit uncovered. However, the company may indicate a cut in the final pay-out. Rentokil Group, the environmental services and property care concern, is expected to stay on course for a 20 per cent earnings increase when it announces its half-year results on Thursday. Forecasts are for about Pounds 53m compared with Pounds 42.3m. Profits should have been boosted by strong growth from environmental services, while sales will have continued to grow more quickly outside the UK. Soft insurance markets in the US and a weak dollar will have depressed Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, the UK's two biggest brokers, which report interim figures on Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 54m and Pounds 63m at Sedgwick, compared with Pounds 65.3m. Willis's pre-tax profits could fall to between Pounds 55m and Pounds 65m, from Pounds 69.4m.</p>

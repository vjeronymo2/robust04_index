			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Life's modest pleasures prove too dear: The retreat from the indulgences of the late 1980s CHASTENED CITIZENS in an austere Britain spent significantly less on life's pleasures last year. Beer, spirits, toys and games, and entertainment fell foul of the recession. Instead people preferred to stay at home watching television or listening to the radio. The latest UK National Accounts published by the Central Statistical Office show that last year Britons continued to retreat from the indulgence of the late 1980s, spending less on all but one of the components that make up consumer expenditure. Total consumer spending - which accounts for about two thirds of the UK's gross domestic product - fell by 2 per cent last year, the first fall since 1981. Expenditure on household goods fell sharply, reflecting the depressed housing market, with carpets and furnishings suffering the biggest drop. Between 1990 and last year spending on household goods and services fell 3 per cent, the second consecutive annual fall. Spending was 6.5 per cent lower than the peak reached in 1989, after which the housing market started to tumble. The year was bleak for sports, betting shops and theatres. It is hardly surprising that several West End musicals closed prematurely last year with spending on other recreational and entertainment services down 10 per cent. Spending on betting and gaming fell by 5 per cent while newspaper and magazines suffered a 4 per cent fall. Spending on sports goods, toys, games and camping equipment fell by 4 per cent, the first fall in this category for 10 years. Cars fell out of favour as spending dropped by 19 per cent - a far bigger drop than the 7 per cent registered between 1989 and 1990. Household spending on food, which accounts for just over a tenth of all consumer expenditure, was flat on the previous year although the pattern of spending pointed to a somewhat healthier, if poorer, nation. Spending on cakes and biscuits fell by 2 per cent while spending on vegetables rose by 5 per cent. Spending on potatoes rose by 2 per cent and spending on sugar dropped 4 per cent. Fruit was less popular with expenditure falling by 3 per cent. People tended to make do with the previous season's fashions last year as overall spending on clothing and footwear dropped by 2 per cent. Spending on men's clothing dropped 7 per cent, the third successive fall. Purchases of 'fripperies' were less popular than in 1990. Spending on jewellery and clocks was down 7 per cent, and expenditure on hairdressing and beauty care fell for the third successive year. Restaurants were even emptier than in 1990 as spending fell by 4 per cent. Spending on fuel and power, the one component of consumer spending to rise, increased by 8 per cent on the previous year with big increases in outlay on electricity and gas. Revised figures from the Central Statistical Office show that gross domestic product fell by 2.4 per cent last year rather than the provisional estimate of a fall of 2.2 per cent. GDP figures for 1990 were also revised to an increase of 0.6 per cent rather than the 1 per cent that was originally reported. UK National Accounts, 1992 Edition. HMSO. Pounds 14.75.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edo Zitnik from Brussels] </F>   [Excerpts] Slovenia today signed the Partnership for Peace,  the 14th East European country to do so. At the ceremony held  on this occasion, which, in addition to NATO Secretary General  Woerner, was also attended by the ambassadors of all 16 NATO  member-states, Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek stressed that the  partnership is extremely important for Slovenia. [passage  omitted]    After the signing of the document, Prime Minister Dr.  Drnovsek had a closed-door meeting with the ambassadors of NATO  member-states. According to him, they all expressed  satisfaction with the economic and political situation in  Slovenia. The ambassadors were also interested in Slovene views  about the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as whether there  are any possibilities for the restoration of certain forms of  cooperation on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.    Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek stressed that Slovenia is in any  case interested in restoration of peace in this region and is  also willing to assist within the limits of its capacities and  interests. However, this does not mean that Slovenia is open to  any sort of institutionalized linking with the republics of the  former Yugoslavia. Slovenia has already overcome the worst  crisis that emerged with the loss of the Yugoslav market, which  was, among other things, also facilitated by the creation of the  free trade zone with the Central European states.    Logically, there was also discussion about the arms embargo  today, which is still in force for all the republics of the  former Yugoslavia, therefore, for Slovenia, too. Because the  Partnership for Peace, in addition to military cooperation, also  envisages the adaptation of Slovene armaments to the NATO  standards, the arms embargo is becoming nonsensical with  Slovenia's membership in the plan.    As it was the UN that passed the arms embargo, the NATO  officials today avoided giving a direct answer to this question.</p>

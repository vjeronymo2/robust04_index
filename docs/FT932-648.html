			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Trusts lift fund managers' profitability THE profitability of Britain's investment management houses reached a five-year high last year despite rising competition, says a a survey of fund managers. The survey of 38 managers with a total of more than Pounds 400bn in assets was conducted by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. Profitability expressed as a percentage of revenue was an average of 18.1 per cent before tax across the industry. This reflected efficiency gains and an increase in funds committed to management. However, the survey found wide variations in the profitability of different products. Personal equity plans, a staple product of retail financial services firms, produced on average losses for firms offering them equal to 14.9 per cent of their income. Price Waterhouse suggests that the relatively small size of individual Pep accounts mean they may never be profitable. In key respects they resemble products offered to private clients whose average account is nearly 10 times that of the average Pep. 'Providing a private-client level of service to Pep investors cannot be profitable,' Price Waterhouse said. The most profitable product category for the industry is the investment trust, which produced an average profit of 42 per cent of revenue, followed by pension funds and charities which produced returns of 24 per cent. Pooled insurance funds produced returns of 19 per cent. The study found that insurance companies in particular have been slow to adapt the cost structure of their fund management operations. They are characterised by antiquated computer systems and high general administration costs. Price Waterhouse Investment Management Survey 1993 - Business Dynamics.

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No respect Sir, I was disappointed and shocked to see the FT front page picture depicting the scene of the tragic bomb attack in Tel Aviv which left 22 people dead ('Israel firm on peace despite blast', October 20). Is this necessary? The picture showing a body and severed limbs reveals a total lack of respect for the victims of such a horrific attack. To see this image must undoubtedly have a devastating effect on the relatives of those who died. Do you not agree that a more subtle image could have been used? A photograph should be used to support or clarify the text. In this case, it could add very little to the description of the attack given in the article, which was sufficient for FT readers to imagine the horrors of the scene for themselves.

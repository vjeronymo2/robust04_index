			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock outlines Costa relationship MR Neil Kinnock released a statement outlining his four-year acquaintance with fashion entrepreneur Mr Charilaos Costa after it emerged that the fraud squad is investigating the collapse of the businessman's company, CHS Holdings. The statement said the Labour leader had met Mr Costa socially on several occasions and Mr Costa had donated money to Labour during the 1987 election. No donations had been made to either Mr or Mrs Kinnock personally. While Mr Kinnock was aware that Mr Costa's company in Islwyn was in the hands of the official receiver, he was not aware of the concerns of the fraud squad, nor of any allegations about missing funds until yesterday.</p>

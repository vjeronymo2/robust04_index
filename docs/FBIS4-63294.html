			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 19, BNS -- Lithuania welcomes Swedish  Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas' position that the number  of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region must be reduced, the  Lithuanian Foreign Ministry said in a press release Thursday [19  May].    "The Kaliningrad region is an anomaly in the Baltic Sea  region because of the huge army and navy forces concentrated in  this area," af Ugglas was quoted as saying by the Lithuanian  ministry. The Swedish minister, who visited the region  Thursday, reportedly expressed hope that Russia will demonstrate  its preparedness to reduce its military potential in Kaliningrad.    The Lithuanian ministry said efforts to raise the issue of  Kaliningrad's demilitarization on an international level and to  integrate the region into international cooperation processes  would significantly contribute to enhancing security in the  Baltic Sea region.</p>

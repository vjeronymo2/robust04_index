			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television To say that the BBC will be hoping Bruce's Guest Night does as much for them in ratings terms as 'The Generation Game' used to is an understatement. They will be crossing everything they've got. We are told the new series (8.00 BBC1) is a 'glitzy cocktail of entertainment' with Forsyth as compere, chat show host, and song and dance man. Those appearing in today's first show include American comedian Rita Rudner, singer Lisa Stansfield, tennis player Pat Cash, and Cliff Richard. By the sound of it there will not be a dry eye in the house after today's Short Stories on C4 (8.30): this is a documentary about Brinsworth House, a retirement home for old troupers, average age 86, many still game to go into their act. ITV begins a 10-part drama series called Heartbeat (9.00) set in the 1960s (miniskirts, Radio Caroline, mods and rockers) inspired by Nicholas Rhea's 'Constable' books. Nick Berry stars as a young policeman who moves from London to the Yorkshire moors, and Niamh Cusack plays his wife Kate, a doctor. Arena considers the work and life of Spanish artist Javier Mariscal who has won the design commission for the Barcelona Olympics.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["kas"-attributed commentary: "A Summit in the Lowlands"] </F>   [Text] At the German-Spanish summit in Schwerin, Helmut  Kohl will perhaps complain to his friend [Spanish Prime  Minister] Felipe Gonzalez that Gonzalez could have spared him a  lot of trouble about the new European Union [EU] Commission  president, if Gonzalez had run for this office himself in time.  The Spaniard, on the other hand, could admit that the chief's  chair in Brussels would have promised him a brighter future than  the fate of his minority government, which is darkened by  corruption scandals.    In fact, the two Euroenthusiasts, who have been inseparable  for years, must now seriously discuss disturbances in their  relationship. Until recently Gonzalez favored Ruud Lubbers as  Commission president, when Kohl, together with Mitterrand, had  already dropped the Dutchman. It is questionable whether Spain  will now turn toward Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene. There are  enough signals of bitterness in Madrid about the reckless  rotation of the German-French axis. At the summit in Granada in  1993, Gonzalez agreed with Kohl on a three-part coordination of  the three consecutive EU presidencies of the three countries.  Now he, as the junior partner, must realize that the two  seniors first agreed on the further enlargement of the EU  without him.    Spain's resistance against EU enlargement had caused outrage  in Bonn, the echo of which has not yet vanished. The EU's  enlargement to the north and the east makes Madrid fear that  Brussels' generous subsidies for the south, of which Spain gets  the lion's share, might abate. Since the establishment of a  competitive economy is, however, lagging behind because there is  a lack of capital and innovation, Madrid will have to ask for  help for a long time to come.</p>

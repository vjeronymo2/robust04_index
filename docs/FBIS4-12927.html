			<p>BFN     [Text] An authoritative source announced in Beirut that two  Iraqi diplomats were arrested in Beirut today on suspicion of  killing Iraqi opposition figure Talib al-Suhayl yesterday. The  source added that the two diplomats are the economic attache at  the Iraqi Embassy Khalid Khalaf and the cultural attache  Muhammad Kazim. The two diplomats have been working in Beirut  since August 1992. An embassy guard, who is on the run, is also  a suspect. Sources at the Lebanese Foreign Ministry said that  diplomatic immunity does not prevent apprehension for  interrogation.    In a statement to AFP, 'Awwad Fakhri, Iraqi charge  d'affaires  in Beirut, said he is not aware of these facts and that he has  officially informed the Lebanese Foreign Ministry that two Iraqi  diplomats have not reported to work.    Slain Iraqi opposition figure Talib al-Suhayl, 70, had lived  in Lebanon for many years, held Jordanian and Saudi passports,  and was married to a Lebanese woman. He was shot dead in his  house in Beirut by a gun equipped with a silencer.</p>

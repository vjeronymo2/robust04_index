			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, Souban Salitthilat, chairman of the  Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control and deputy minister  of foreign affairs, held a press conference at the Foreign  Affairs Ministry in Vientiane to publicize a comprehensive plan  on narcotics control in the Lao People's Democratic Republic  [LPDR] for the period from now to the year 2000. The press  conference was attended by foreign diplomats along with  representatives of the United Nations and nongovernmental  organizations to the LPDR. Director generals of various  departments under the Foreign Affairs Ministry were also present.    On this occasion, Souban Salitthilat explained the line and  policy of the party and state on the settlement of the narcotics  problem in the LPDR for the period from now to 2000. He also  reported the achievements in investigating narcotics problems  throughout the country, especially in northern provinces, where  there are some 19,000 hectares of land for poppy plantation. He  noted that in the northern provinces in 1992-1993, a total of  some 125 to 150 metric tons of opium were produced and some  42,000 people became addicted to the drug.    In view of the aforementioned problem, the chairman of the  Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control proposed as many as  16 infrastructural projects requiring as much as $35 million.  He said: In implementing the various projects, an emphasis will  be put on restricting and reducing drug production. Regarding  this, more rural development projects will be set up in Phong  Saly and Oudomsai provinces and in Saisomboun District,  Vientiane Province. Existing projects now being implemented  include the rural development projects in Xieng Khouang  Province, the Lao-American Cooperation Project for Integrated  Rural Development in Houa Phan Province, and the drug reduction  projects in Bokeo and Luang Namtha provinces.    In the recent past, the Lao National Committee for  Narcotics Control has received technical and financial support  in the form of loans and gratis aid from many organizations,  such as the (?Christian) Organization of Norway, the United  Nations Drug Control Program, the International Fund for  Agricultural Development, and the Lao-American project in Houa  Phan Province.</p>

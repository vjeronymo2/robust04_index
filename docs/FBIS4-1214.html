			<p>BFN     [Text] On this last Sunday before the election RAPPORT has  asked the leaders of five political parties why they think  voters should support them. Here are their answers:  <H5>  The National Party Keeps Its Promises </H5>   [NP leader F.W. de Klerk] This week heralds the beginning of  a new life for all South Africans. The quality of that life  will depend on how you vote -- that is the heartbeat of  democracy. Before you vote I want to share a few ideas with you:    I have had the honor of serving as state president for the  past five years. As the leader of the National Party I have  promised to lead our nation into a new period of freedom. I  have kept that promise. I have promised to end apartheid, and I  have. I have promised to release Nelson Mandela and to unban  political parties, and I have done that. I have promised to  hold free elections in which all people would be allowed to  vote. I have kept that promise. I have promised to lay down  the basis for justice. That has been done. I have kept all my  promises.    After the election we will have a government of national  unity. This means that the most important political parties will  share power. It is in the best interest of the country that the  National Party leads that government. If we can get the  majority of your votes then I can continue my work for a  prosperous and peaceful South Africa. It is not just enough to  have free and fair elections. The elected government should act  in the best interest of the people:     -  We must create job opportunities so that all our people  can support their families and can be independent of the state.    -  We must build houses so that all our people can be  accommodated.    -  We must ensure that effective standards of education and  health  care is available to all.    -  To achieve all these things we have to manage the economy in  such a way that businesses, large and small, can flourish.    -  Above all we must have respect for law and order so that  violence, crime, and intimidation, can be wiped out from society.    -  We must replace racial tension with harmony. We must replace  hate with goodwill. We must promote strong family values.       In this way this huge nation of ours -- all its people --  will remain the richest nation in Africa and occupy a front seat  in the league of nations. The National Party stands for the  same plan which has ensured the prosperity of several nations  throughout the world. The ANC would like to do all these  things, but can they? They do not have any experience in  government. They make promises they cannot keep. They are in  alliance with communists (SACP) [South African Communist Party)  who have totally unacceptable ideas on how to manage the  economy. Their plans will ensure the collapse of the economy.  They were involved in violence far too often to be trusted to  end it. The only safe option for you -- those desiring peace,  reconciliation, and a prosperous future -- is to vote for the  National Party. With your help I promise that we will build a  great new South Africa. And as you know, the National Party  keeps its promises.  <H5>  The ANC Has a Plan for South Africa </H5>   [ANC leader Nelson Mandela] South Africa is in a mess as a  result of the National Party's policy of apartheid. Nearly 50  percent of all South Africans are unemployed, there is a  shortage of at least 6.5 million homes, and three times more  money is spent on educating white children, compared to that  spent on black children. South Africa is being torn apart by  violence and crime, directly linked to unemployment and the fact  that many people are hungry. The only way to address these  problems is to give our people hope and to ensure that they will  have a better life after 27 April. This cannot be done with  vague promises and by spending most of the time attacking other  parties, like the National Party and Democratic Party are doing,  without a plan on how to save South Africa from the present  decline.    The ANC has a plan:     -  We have a plan to create 1.5 million job opportunities  within the next five years through a public works program,  similar to the "New Deal" [preceding two words in English] so  successfully applied by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the U.S. after  the Great Depression. Such a public works program will be  labor-intensive and will help to build houses and roads, and  will provide electricity and running water in townships  [preceding word in English], denied to the people for years.    -  We will support small business development and also create  new  job opportunities.    -  The apartheid system of education will be rationalized and  one  National Department of Education will be created in order to  effectively use funds to ensure 10 years of free education for  every child.       These are just a few of the concrete plans we have to ensure  a better life for all in our country. No other party has such  an extensive plan. Our children and grandchildren should never  experience the violence and suffering, the injustice and pain,  that we have experienced. They should enjoy their childhood and  should feel safe with their families. They should be raised  with equal opportunities so that they can explore all  opportunities. I call on all South Africans to build on  reconciliation, peace, and a better life for all. Now is the  time. Vote ANC.  <H5>  Self-determination can lead to a better life for all </H5>   [Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi] In spite  of their differences, I beleive that Zulus and Afrikaners have  one thing in common -- a fundamental belief in the principle and  practise of self-determination. Self-determination does not lie  at the root of conflict and of competition, but it is a  complementary factor and could lead to a better life for us all.  Because we blacks comprise the majority of the country's  population, self- determination will guarantee for us all  freedom from domination. I say this without rancor or reproof,  but if we want to be fair toward one another, and if we really  wish to find one another, we must accept that we suffered  terribly under the Afrikaners. They misused their power to  dominate others mercilessly.    We, the blacks, are now on the threshold of becoming the  'dominant' group in the country. But I cannot emphasize enough  that we are a people with a long history of accomodating other  people -- a history of cooperation and coexistence. We are  people whose commitment to reconciliation knows no bounds. We  can not forget, but we can always forgive. It is for this  reason that I can state with absolute certainty that we are  prepared to promise, indeed, guarantee, that we have no desire  whatsoever to dominate any other group, and specifically not the  Afrikaner.    Despite the horrors of our tragic past, now is the time to  look forward to a brighter common future, as brothers and  sisters. It may be that the Afrikaner dominated us, but they  were also dominated by others, and that is what gave rise to  Afrikaner nationalism and apartheid. We will not repeat that  mistake.  <H5>  Support the FF [Freedom Front] for a homeland </H5>   [Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen] The Freedom  Front is not ashamed to say we are a Christian party working for  the maintenance of Christian values and the survival of the  Afrikaner in South Africa. Many Christians in this country are  concerned about the strong influence being exercised by the  communists within the ANC. A vote for the FF will give us the  opportunity to unashamedly testify to our Christianity in the  highest assemblies of the land. This does not mean we are giving  recognition to a communist constitution, but rather it offers us  the chance to fight communism and this imperfect constitution in  the political arena.    The argument is used that one should rather vote for the  National Party to vote against the ANC. That is totally wrong,  and does not take into account the new system of proportional  representation. Under the new electoral system the results are  calculated in percentages. So it could happen that in the Cape  the ANC might get 40 percent, the FF 30 percent, and the NP or  the Inkatha Freedom Party 30 percent. Should the anti-ANC  parties then agree on certain issues, they would together have  60 percent and they, not the ANC, would govern the region. So  no vote is lost, as was the case in the old system.    The FF stands for the same freedoms as the NP, but offers  you  self-determination as a further assurance for the future. If  the NP leaders are unable to keep a check on the ANC as a  government, how are they going to do so as an opposition? The  ANC dominated the NP in the negotiations, and used them to get  rid of opponents such as Bophuthatswana and Ciskei. Venda and  Transkei are not troubled because they support the ANC.  Self-determination as a modern concept must form part of any  future solution in South Africa. There are those for whom this  is not important. The 34th principle in the constitution makes  self-determination for our people and for other communities  possible. The proviso is that there must be sufficient support  within that community for self-determination. Without  self-determination for those peoples who desire it, we will have  no peace, but will simply become another African state with a  strong, dictatorial central government.    Prevent that by voting for the FF. That will also make it  possible for us to establish a homeland council. According to  Article 184 of the constitution, this homeland council will be  established after the election. That will become the most  important instrument for constitutionally making a homeland  possible in the new constitution.  <H5>  The DP Promises Human Rights and Democracy </H5>   [Democratic Party leader Zach de Beer] The election campaign  is now nearing an end, and the Democratic Party [DP], after a  difficult beginning, is doing better and better. There are  several reasons for this. --- Human rights: There are fears  that the human rights which were so trampled upon during the  years of NP rule will again be in danger under a future  government which wants to hold too much power. Just as the NP  was a party of and for whites, so too an ANC government may feel  that its first duty is to see to its 'own people', and that  causes concern among South Africans about their personal rights.  The DP and its predecessors have shown for 35 years that they  can be trusted with the rights of the indivudual. In contrast  to other parties, the DP has never been identified with any  particular ethnic group, and offers a place to every South  African as an individual. We want to protect the citizen against  the misuse of power.    Economic management: The NP government intervened in the  economy on a large scale by, for instance, setting prices and  interest rates and by trying to manage the flow of labor. That  led to disastrous deterioration. The ANC, given its strong ties  with communism, will also be under pressure to apply central  planning methods. That, as current history has shown, never  succeeds. What does succeed is liberal democracy and free  enterprise--as has always been propagated by the DP. And people  are increasingly realizing this.    Prevent one-party domination: Opinion polls have indicated  that the ANC could achieve a two-thirds majority, which would  mean that to a large degree it would draw up the constitution  according to its will. That would be dangerous, and we must  prevent them from getting that kind of majority. The DP, which  has opposed apartheid for all these years, is a party which can  effectively compete with the ANC, as shown by Prof. Maki Mandela  who decided that she could not vote ANC and chose the DP as her  alternative.    Peace: Among the important parties, the DP is the one which  has never been accused of being in any way involved in violence  -- except as a victim. Our hands are clean, and people know it.  So peace, which leads to stability and investment; democratic  values which create confidence; and lively political debate.  Liberal democracy with free enterprise. That is why the DP  deserves support.</p>

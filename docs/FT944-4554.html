			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Former prime ministers compete to lead Japan's new alliance Two former Japanese prime ministers, Mr Toshiki Kaifu and Mr Tsutomu Hata, will today compete to be the first leader of Japan's new opposition alliance. The struggle for the top job at the New Frontier party, the result of a merger of nine small opposition groups and the only serious challenge to the ruling Liberal Democratic party, will be decided by a poll of party members tonight. The vote paves the way for the NFP's official inauguration on Saturday. This will bring a resolution, even if temporary, to the political fragmentation caused by the wave of defections from the LDP, which recently returned to power in coalition after spending a year in opposition for the first time in nearly four decades. The realignment restores some clarity to Japan's formerly fragmented and confusing political structure, to the relief of bemused foreign investors. The NFP's policies are almost the same as those of the conservative LDP, though it wants less government intervention in the economy. The open method of choosing a leader, advocated by Mr Hata, marks a break with secretive traditions such as the LDP's habit of sharing jobs among its top factions. The most powerful members of the NFP, including the two leadership candidates, are former members of the LDP who have left their old party over the past 18 months in protest at its reluctance to accept political reforms. Mr Kaifu is widely tipped to win the vote by a small margin because he has broader support than Mr Hata, whose followers are mostly concentrated in his own group, the Japan Renewal party, the core of the two previous coalition governments. A third candidate, Mr Takashi Yonezawa, head of a trade union-backed group, is an outsider. The job of NFP secretary-general, second in command, is likely to go to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a powerful backroom strategist from the same group as Mr Hata. Mr Ozawa left the LDP last year and has since been instrumental in bringing together two coalition governments and this new party. He is the only candidate for the job. Mr Kaifu launched plans for reforming the electoral and political system, in an attempt to regain the public's waning trust of politicians, while he was LDP prime minister from 1989 to 1991. Party elders withdrew support for Mr Kaifu when he started pushing reform too hard for their liking. He finally left the LDP in June, in what turned out to be an abortive bid to become opposition prime minister. New political and electoral rules, to take effect on December 25, echo Mr Kaifu's 1991 proposals. Mr Hata, shortest-serving Japanese prime minister since the second world war, was in office for two months until the present government, a three-party coalition of the LDP, socialists and a small centre-left group, took power in June. He has also held the finance, foreign affairs and agricultural portfolios.</p>

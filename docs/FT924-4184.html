			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Brazilian chocolate maker tumbles to Cr40bn deficit LACTA, the market leader in Brazilian chocolates, suffered a loss of Cr40.4bn (Dollars 5.6m) for the first nine months of 1992. In 1991, the company earned Dollars 1.5m for the entire year. The Brazilian chocolate market has fallen by 15 per cent this year, but Lacta said it managed to hold the company's decline to 12 per cent. Lacta is one of Brazil's big three chocolate makers. It enjoyed a 43 per cent market share for January-July, compared with 28 per cent for Nestle, the subsidiary of the Swiss multinational, and 24.6 per cent for Garoto, a Brazilian competitor. A dispute has been simmering between the controlling group, headed by Brazilian businessman Mr Adhemar de Barros Filho, and minority partner Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss company owned by Philip Morris. Jacobs Suchard held 40 per cent of voting capital before it was purchased by Philip Morris. Earlier this year, a planned stock issue was held up by a judicial restraining order sought by Jacobs Suchard. Lacta is now authorised to make the issue, but no date has been set.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy, UK paper best European markets in July ITALY and the UK, two former members of the European exchange rate mechanism, were the top performing European government bond markets in July, according to figures compiled by JP Morgan Securities. Italian bonds showed a return of 2.77 per cent in local currency terms, followed by the gilt market with a return of 2.5 per cent - well above the average European bond return of 1.33 per cent. 'The Italian bond market's strong showing was reinforced after the Bank of Italy cut its discount rate by a full percentage point,' according to JP Morgan Securities. 'The Ciampi government has remained firm in its resolve to hold down inflation in spite of lira depreciation. Additionally, agreements to overhaul labour market institutions gave investors greater confidence that lower rates of inflation would prevail,' the US house said. The gilt market's rally was prompted by continued favourable economic data showing that inflation was at its lowest level in 30 years. In addition, sterling assets provided a safe haven for many investors as the European exchange rate mechanism came under attack last month. Several of the European currencies - in particular the French franc, Belgian franc, peseta and Danish krone - suffered renewed bouts of turbulence at the end of July, triggered by the Bundesbank's decision to leave its keenly-watched discount rate unchanged while cutting the Lombard (or effective ceiling) rate by 50 basis points. French government bonds gained only 0.75 per cent on the month, while the Belgian, Ecu and Danish bond markets were the worst performers with falls of 0.29 per cent, 0.44 per cent and 0.99 per cent respectively. 'The international government bond markets have provided investors with positive returns during the month of July (with the exception of Belgium and Denmark). The main factors bolstering global bond markets were yet more signs of moderating inflation,' says JP Morgan Securities. The Australian government bond market ranked as the third best performing market with a monthly return of 2.37 per cent helped by low second-quarter inflation figures.</p>

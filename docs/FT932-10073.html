			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Business and the law: Star of the silver screen - A legal tool that may give a boost to Europe's film industry As the film industry gathers in Cannes next week to see movies and be seen, European film makers will reflect on yet another year spent in the shadow of Hollywood. In spite of the critical success of such films as Howards End and The Crying Game the commercial success achieved by US studios continues to elude the European industry. Mass-market films with international appeal, which the Americans are so successful at making, remain a scarce commodity in Europe. Many of the plans hatched in Cannes last year for European productions with international appeal will have foundered on the difficulties of getting bilateral or multinational co-productions off the ground. This year, however, as they sit down with renewed enthusiasm to make plans which they hope will revitalise the European film industry, producers will have with them a new business tool - the so-called Model Co-production Terms. These were drawn up by Denton International, a group of law firms from the UK, Germany, Holland and Denmark, but were the idea of Eur-images, the pan-European support fund of the Council of Europe for the co-production and distribution of European feature films and documentaries. The model terms aim to offer contractual solutions to the key issues - such as ownership of rights, editorial controls, distribution patterns and risks of insolvency - which co-producers face under Europe's various legal systems, and to make it easier for European co-producers to apply for Eurimages funding or for benefits under the European Co-Production Convention. Launched three weeks ago, the model terms have already received an enthusiastic welcome from some European producers. 'Co-productions are definitely the way forward,' says Mr Nick Hobdell of Screen Finance magazine. 'The ability to access European subsidies is tremendously important. Big budget films are too expensive for individual production companies to fund on their own.' The success of the model terms will depend to a great extent on how far European industry as a whole is in agreement with that view. A 1991 study of the competitive positions of the European and US film industries produced by consultants London Economics for the Madrid-based Media Business School found the strategic options for the European film industry were not obvious. Should it strive to find the means to challenge for a bigger share of the mass-market box office by aiming to make and sell films across the Continent, with continued expansion of European co-production? Or should it accept that European film makers would on the whole do better to leave the production of big budget feature films to the Americans and concentrate on national success with each country's industry aiming to sell films in its local market? Current policy is directed towards encouraging European film makers to challenge for a bigger share of the mass market by making and selling films across the Continent. The policy is easy to justify in terms of commercial goals. The American film markets, including video rentals and sales, were worth nearly Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) in 1992, and the European markets more than Dollars 8bn. These markets are dominated by US producers. A larger share of the overall market for European producers and distributors would greatly enhance European film-making resources. Promoting the European industry would also result in benefits for consumers, giving them greater choice in the face of a US monopoly. Per capita admissions to the cinema in Europe are half those in the US. Europeans only go to the cinema on average 1.8 times a year while Americans go on average 4.6 times. Arguably this is a reflection of the way American themes and popular culture dominate mass-market feature films. If Europe provided the context, theme and backdrop of more of the world's films, perhaps Europeans would go to the cinema in greater numbers. The problem of how to put European policy into practice remains, however. Mr Adrian Barr-Smith, a partner with solicitors Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens, the UK arm of Denton International, believes it has been the lack of guidelines for avoiding the traps and tricks of co-production which has been holding European producers back. One of the pre-conditions for applying for Eurimages funding (it has offered co-production support in the form of refundable loans since 1988) is a signed agreement between the co-producers. Similarly, an agreement is required for producers to get access to the benefits available to national films through the Co-Production Convention which should come into force later this year once it has been ratified by five European countries. This represents something of a Catch 22 situation. Co-producers cannot apply for European funding until they have a co-production agreement and few of them have enough experience of co-productions to know how to go about drawing one up. The model terms should address that problem, says Mr Barr-Smith, by providing a common starting point for reaching bi-lateral and multilateral co-production agreements. 'The terms stop short of being a model agreement,' says Ms Angela Jackson, one of the Denton lawyers responsible for drafting the model. 'It's more of a menu or list from which they can choose the elements they want, a legal 'how-to'.' Contracts are frequently signed late in the film business, she explains. Producers like to hedge their bets, but they start hiring and setting up shooting arrangements often without an agreement. The industry is founded on trust, but then problems arise which producers find difficult to raise while projects are in their formative stages. The terms will allow such issues to be settled early on, rather than waiting for things to break down. Denton stresses the importance of co-producers concluding agreements in writing. A common problem in European co-productions is that meetings and phone calls take place in different countries; letters and faxes are sent, and letters of intent and deal memos signed. But later, when problems arise, it is difficult to say with any certainty whether a binding written or unwritten contract was made under the laws of any particular country. Mr Barr-Smith is keen to emphasise that even if no contract is signed there is still a risk under the various legal systems of Europe that a binding oral agreement has been concluded. And even if no contract, written or oral, has been concluded there may be a risk under some legal systems - under German and Dutch law, for example - that legal consequences flow from the mere breakdown of negotiations. Ms Jackson and Mr Barr-Smith believe the model is a business first. If it works, it could provide the basis for multinational co-operation agreements in other sectors of industry, they say. In pharmaceuticals, for example, it might be possible to draw up a similar model for multinational development of drugs. But whatever the model's application in other industries, European cineastes will be hoping the film industry gives it a favourable review.</p>

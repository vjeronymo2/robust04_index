			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Private View: Shakespeare in the asylum AS I climbed the path to the great rampart surrounding Broadmoor Hospital, the air was suddenly filled with the shriek of a siren. I clutched my folding umbrella more tightly, expecting every moment to see wild-eyed figures clambering over the high brick wall in front of me. 'Just a test,' said the man at the main gate. 'We do it every Monday morning.' Nobody entering this 130-year-old asylum for the criminally insane can avoid a shiver of voyeuristic apprehension. Not all of the 500 occupants, men and women, have killed. But many have, and some of their names are known to every newspaper reader in Britain. Inside the walls, the place is more spacious, quiet, clean and modern than a jail - no sign of state penny-pinching here - and enjoys a panoramic southward view over Berkshire and Hampshire. I began to forget Broadmoor's fearsome reputation and the recent allegations of cruelty by a former resident doctor. I began to believe, instead, in the truth of a book which movingly describes an extraordinary experiment which has been going on here for the past three years. The author of the experiment and editor of the book is Dr Murray Cox, consultant psychotherapist and Shakespearean scholar. In 1989, as a result of a chance meeting between Dr Cox and the actor Mark Rylance, then doing a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Hamlet was performed in front of 105 Broadmoor patients. That was followed by the RSC's Romeo and Juliet, a local amateur group's Measure for Measure, the National Theatre's King Lear and, most recently, the RSC's performance of A Woman Killed with Kindness by Thomas Heywood. Now Aristotle, as every theatre-goer knows, described the purpose of Greek tragedy as 'catharsis': the purging of the audience's emotions through the dramatic depiction of pity and terror. But there was something shocking about the idea of showing madness, mutilation and murder - I thought of the scene in King Lear where Gloucester's eyes are gouged out - to people with a psychotic or psychopathic condition, whose own horrifying deeds had caused them to be locked away. Dr Cox demurred. 'What this is doing, I think, is opening up a safe way for people to face unfaceable things in their inner world.' He explained that psychotics (mostly schizophrenic) need more protection from the real world than confrontation with it, whereas psychopaths need both. 'Watching first-class drama is an encounter with truth of all kinds. It is one of the great aspects of drama that it gives you the support and the confrontation in an interesting amalgam.' Interviewing Dr Cox, I found it impossible to pursue a straight line. His discourse spun like a Catherine wheel and he threw off quotations from Shakespeare and other poets like sparks. At one point, I entirely lost the drift and apologised for the fact that we were going round in circles. He was delighted. 'Absolutely. We go in spirals actually. Spirals are very important. It's like therapy in some ways. You think you're going in circles but actually you're going in spirals and you get deeper and deeper into the material.' Dr Cox was reticent about his own life. Apparently, it can damage a psychiatrist's relationship with his patient if he discloses too much about himself and, Dr Cox assured me, the Broadmoor patients would be reading the interview. But I learned that he read medicine at Cambridge University and was a general practitioner for 10 years until his interest in poetry and language and the way patients talked about themselves - the 'deictic stress' or signalling function of their words - took him first into prison psychiatry and then, in 1970, to Broadmoor. Bringing Shakespeare himself to Broadmoor had been therapeutic, he said, but it had not been designed as 'dramatherapy'. Did you think it would be good for patients to see enactments of their own offences? I asked. 'Yes, I did think that; but then it's good for all of us to see enactments. This is not something special for patients here. Ibsen, for instance, is full of the idea that there are things people just don't do. But people are always doing things that 'people just don't do'.' I asked about what seemed to me the obvious dangers. Are there people here for whom seeing these plays is a mistake? 'I'm not sure you can say that. Their own defence mechanisms would on the whole have defended them against seeing what they weren't ready to see. There is a sense in which we are kept at a distance from what is perceivable because it is too horrific. 'Gradually during psychotherapy and maturation and a hundred and one other things one can gradually . . . let's go to Macbeth: I am afraid to think what I have done. To look on't again I dare not. Or again: But when we have our naked frailties hid, that suffer in exposure, let us meet again and question this most bloody piece of work to know it further.' Cox told me that many patients had televisions and could watch whatever they wished. I asked: Including scenes of violence and rape? 'But we all know that every news bulletin has the most horrific scenes. This is part of the web of life that we're all in and it's something that's woven into virtually every therapeutic session here. This is the human predicament and in a curious way one needs to undramatise a great deal of it because the offences - it may be one act, years ago, and of course it's very serious - are part of life too.' Why didn't you start with Alan Ayckbourn and work up, so to speak? 'That's a very good question. It just so happened that Mark Rylance said it would be good if we could come to Broadmoor. It was totally an accident . . . That's a good Shakespearean word,' he mused. But why tragedies? 'I happened to meet Mark and he happened to be playing Hamlet and Romeo that year.' Are there disadvantages in this experiment? Dr. Cox pondered. 'I'm thinking of this word experiment . . . Is it an experiment? Yes, it is . . . One negative would be if it ever became compulsory.' Would it be a negative if actors got a thrill out of performing in front of a lot of homicidal maniacs? 'Those are your words, not mine. I think that would wear off very quickly. In the workshops afterwards, both groups quickly recognised the other as human beings and the homicidal maniac stereotype simply vanished. Paradoxically, it was almost a de-dramatising of patients in Broadmoor and of actors, too.' How do you answer the charge that you are just curious to see how patients will react, and the actors are curious to see what killers look like close up? 'That is a charge which could be levelled and if that is the overall impression people get, I'm sorry, but it just isn't like that. I can tell you it just isn't so.' At this point I used the word 'inmate' and got a severe ticking off. However neutral the dictionary definition, at Broadmoor the word is verboten. 'This is definitely a hospital. I mean, seriously. It is a secure psychiatric hospital and the people here are patients.' Of course, I resumed, if you show murder on the stage to murderers it's bound to make a big impact . . . 'But that's the point. We're not showing murder on the stage. What we are doing is performing Hamlet. To say that is showing murder on the stage is taking one small fragment of a hugely important drama. I'm well aware this is an extremely important point. What you see is Shakespeare's huge presentation of life: he's not simply demonstrating murder . . .' There was a knock on the door and one of Dr Cox's colleagues poked her head in to ask a question. When the door shut he asked: 'Where were we?' and immediately plucked out another quotation, from Richard II: Where was I when weeping made me break the story off? This led to a long and emphatic digression, laced with quotations, on the productive accidents that can occur during therapy sessions, on the 'existential aspect of therapy' and on the 'paraclinical precision' of Shakespeare's poetry. Although I followed his every word, the purpose of Dr Cox's digression quite escaped me. I steered him back to the subject. Are some people too disturbed to benefit from Shakespeare? 'It's a huge question. It depends on the perspective from which he or she sees the world: that will fluctuate as it does for all of us. For example, someone will see Hamlet stabbing Polonius and might easily say: 'that's nothing to do with my life, that's simply an actor stabbing another actor.' The person sitting beside might say: 'that stabbing is exactly like what I did, except I stabbed a young man not an old man like Polonius.'' Does all this mean that once patients can distinguish between fantasy and reality with the help of drama, they are cured and can be trusted to go out into the world? 'No, it certainly doesn't. Drama is a generic human encounter. Patients have to be treated as appropriate. There must be other signs of a more integrated life, evident on the playing fields or in the workshop. 'Everything I say about the therapeutic aspects of drama must be seen not as replacing, but supplementing, conventional clinical approaches, such as psychotherapy, medication. That's very important.' As he escorted me back to the gate of Broadmoor, and suspecting I had missed something vital, I asked Dr. Cox to explain again the purpose of his digression. I still didn't understand his reply. But what I did understand, even as I felt the relief of crossing back into the real world, was his fascination with the human mind - normal, poetic, or deranged. Perhaps it is only by getting to grips with madness that we can come to terms with the dreadful deeds of mankind. And that, after all, is what Shakespeare was all about.

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH AND GORBACHEV'S MALTA SUMMIT  </P> <P> The best news coming out of the summit could well be President Bush's  announcement to provide U.S. leadership on the global warming issue. The Cold  War may be over but the "hot war" is just beginning.  </P> <P> Bush and his science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, have proved they are both  rational beings. They saw the scientific evidence, they read the reports, they  discussed the issue with scientists and they decided that yes, indeed, the  worldwide threat to the atmosphere from carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse"  gases is very real and must be dealt with.  </P> <P> The "hot war" -- finding solutions to reducing greenhouse gases and ozone  destruction -- will be a lot easier than solving the Cold War. We know what the  problems are. We have some solutions. And most of the world agrees that  something must be done about the issue.  </P> <P> Goodby Cold War, hello hot war! Hey! That's actually good news.  </P> <P> LU HAAS  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

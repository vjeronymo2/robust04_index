Virgil Magureanu, director of SRI, has ordered a full  investigation of the activity of Major General Gheorghe  Diaconescu.    Sources from the SRI leadership have told us that the cause  that led to the demotion of the counterespionage division head  is "a complicated one."    Despite the fact that one of the rumors that are circulating  claimed that Major General Diaconescu had been placed under  arrest, our own investigations have proved that this was a false  report.</p>

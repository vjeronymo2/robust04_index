			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPEAU FILES COMPLAINT OVER SALES PRICE OF UNITS SOLD TO MAY  </P> <P> Campeau Corp. said Wednesday that it has filed a complaint against May  Department Stores Co. over a disagreement related to May's purchase of Filene's  and Foley's from Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. division.  </P> <P> The complaint, filed by Campeau and Federated in U.S. District Court in New  York, seeks a judgment on whether the purchase agreement between the retailers  provides for certain adjustments in the amount of money May paid for  Boston-based Filene's and Houston-based Foley's department stores.  </P> <P> Campeau, a Toronto company that has real estate and retail holdings including  strings of department stores in the United States, said the amount of the  adjustments in dispute is about $47 million.  </P> <P> Campeau said May has until May 18 to respond to the complaint, which was  disclosed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was filed  in the Manhattan court April 20.  </P> <P> A spokesman at May's headquarters in St. Louis said the company was  disappointed that Campeau and Federated filed the complaint instead of seeking  a solution to their disagreement through arbitration.  </P> <P> "We previously advised Campeau of the need for arbitration of our mutual  disagreements in the purchase price adjustments both for the Foley's and  Filene's transactions," the spokesman said.  </P></p>

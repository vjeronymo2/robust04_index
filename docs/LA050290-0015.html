			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX REVOLT TIME  </P> <P> If the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution were the shots heard 'round  the world, then this Poll Tax Revolt in Great Britain should trigger a "read my  lips" revolt against all the nickel-and-dime taxes in the U.S. But it won't  because Americans have been so lulled that they will endure all kinds of  political abuse.  </P> <P> We must stop all this foolishness. A progressive income tax properly  administered should cover all costs of providing services our citizens want and  need. We must stop special taxes on gasoline, tobacco, alcohol and use taxes  for purposes not relating to these taxes.  </P> <P> Americans have just paid their various income taxes. Wasn't that enough?  </P> <P> HARRY WALD  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

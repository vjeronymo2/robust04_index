			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> RICH MADE MORE BUT PAID LESS  </P> <P> In a finding that could undermine President Bush's plan to cut capital gains  taxes, a House committee report said today that during the 1980s, the rich paid  lower taxes on more income, while the poor felt a sharper tax bite.  </P> <P> The report, based on Congressional Budget Office and other agency studies, is  to be released Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee at a hearing where  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and White House Budget Director Richard G.  Darman are scheduled to testify.  </P> <P> The report shows that the effective tax rate for the poorest 20% of American  families rose 16.1% during the 1980s while real income rose 3.2%.  </P> <P> During the same period, it says, the effective tax rate for the richest 20% of  families dropped 5.5% while their real income rose 31.7%.  </P> <P> That statistic and others in the report could add fuel to Democratic claims  that wealthier Americans, who would benefit most from a capital gains tax cut,  do not need or deserve another tax break.  </P></p>

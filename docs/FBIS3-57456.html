			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Feliks Gromov, the commander in chief of the Russian  Navy, has stated that quantitative cuts in the navy will  continue in 1994. At the same time, the navy will be modernized  with improved models of combat vessels. The main aim is to  create a small but highly efficient navy that would be less of a  burden for the country from the economic point of view.  <H5>  Navy Commander on Nuclear Warheads in Baltic Fleet </H5>   [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian 2020 GMT on 24 January carries a video report on the  visit to the Baltic Fleet by Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first  deputy commander in chief of the Navy. The announcer, G.Sablin,  says that the combat and tactical training of the crews and  vessels of the Baltic Fleet deserves the highest evaluation. He  says that the admiral talked about the timescale for the  withdrawal of forces of the fleet from Latvia, and he confirmed  the readiness of the last major unit--a submarine brigade--to  leave Liepaja by 1 June.    Admiral Igor Kasatonov stressed that with the loss of bases  in the Baltic countries the Russian fleet is not losing its  might and mobility. Kasatonov says: "If the fleet now has 27  percent of the nuclear warheads, then it will rise to 42-47  percent by the year 2000. On 21 December 1993 I had the honor  of being the senior person from the Ministry of Defense at the  laying of the keel of a most modern submarine. In addition, the  keels of some surface vessels were also laid, and some vessels  were also completed, but, again, the concept of a new fleet, a  third millenium fleet, which of course has to pass through the  government, needs to be confirmed."</p>

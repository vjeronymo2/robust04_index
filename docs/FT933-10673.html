			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Companies more reluctant to invest THE reluctance of UK companies to invest in eastern Europe has deepened during a recession which has led a third of UK companies to reduce their overall overseas investment, a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants and management consultants, has found. A total of 66 per cent of a sample of 100 UK companies from the FT Top 500 expressed an interest in investing in central and eastern Europe. This compares with with 88 per cent in a similar survey two years ago. A third said they would not even consider investing in the former Soviet Union.</p>

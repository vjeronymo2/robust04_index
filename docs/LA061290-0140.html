			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL PUTS OCEAN IN THE LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> As an oil tanker fire raged in the Gulf of Mexico and with memories still fresh  of the Huntington Beach spill, Newport Beach officials and environmentalists  Monday announced plans for a festival they hope will heighten awareness of the  grim realities of toxic pollution.  </P> <P> Against a backdrop of pleasure boats at the Lido Marina Village wharf, a group  representing more than 100 businesses and organizations and calling itself Stop  Toxic Ocean Pollution warned that without the proper precautions, the idyllic  coastal lifestyle could fall victim to pollution.  </P> <P> "As I stand here today, a Norwegian (oil) tanker is about to sink in the Gulf  of Mexico," said Robert H. Sulnick, executive director of the Santa  Monica-based American Oceans Campaign, a national, nonprofit organization that  will receive proceeds from the June 24 festival and a golf tournament the  following day.  </P> <P> "And in Huntington Beach . . . we had the best possible scenario (weather and  terrain) for an oil spill, and still couldn't clean it up," he said, referring  to the February incident in which the tanker American Trader dumped thousands  of gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean, closing public shores from Seal  Beach to Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> In Orange County, the spill dealt a financial blow to ocean sports-related  retailers and tourist businesses.  </P> <P> The festival will be on the streets of Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach  from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and will include a chowder cook-off, live entertainment,  environmental awareness education and a host of celebrity supporters. On June  25, a $325-per-person celebrity golf tournament is scheduled from 9 a.m. to 5  p.m. at the Tustin Ranch Golf Club.  </P> <P> Newport Beach Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer praised the festival as a way to "get the  grass-roots support that is going to send a message to our legislators," while  Sulnick called Orange County "one of the focal points of ocean protection for  California."  </P> <P> Since 1986, Orange County's coastal city officials have worked with local  congressmen to fight federal plans to lease offshore oil drilling tracts in  area waters.  </P> <P> The American Oceans Campaign has lobbied for the same goals from its Washington  office, in addition to serving as an umbrella organization for other prominent  environmental groups on ocean preservation issues.  </P> <P> On the local front, the Huntington Beach-based Surfrider Foundation, founded in  1984 with the same goals as the 2-year-old American Oceans Campaign, will have  a booth at the festival although it won't receive proceeds from the  fund-raiser.  </P> <P> The American Oceans Campaign lobbies for oil spill liability legislation,  moratoriums on offshore drilling, development of alternative fuels, bans on  gill-net fishing and toxic dumping and increased protection of coastal  ecosystems.

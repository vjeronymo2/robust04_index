			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tax on paper gains would be self-defeating Sir, As a specialist adviser on executive share options, including a number of water and regional electricity companies, I was interested to read Mr Gordon Brown's comments that 'options were costing the taxpayer Pounds 200m per year in lost tax revenue' ('Labour names share option 'millionaires' ', August 19). I wonder if this is all it seems. Most taxpayers expect to pay tax when they receive cash. However, under Mr Brown's proposals, executives will pay tax when they simply convert their options into shares, ie swap one piece of paper into another without any cash being received. As it happens, most executives do sell most of their new holding of shares almost immediately. As a result, they pay much the same amount of tax as if they had paid tax on the paper gains rather than their cash gains. The only difference is the relatively small annual capital gains tax exemption, which they can employ to reduce their gains. Possibly, some of Mr Brown's lost taxes can be recovered by withdrawing the annual capital gains tax exemption on option gains by treating them as income. If so, then the burden will fall disproportionately on the lower reaches of employees rather than Mr Brown's 'millionaire optionholders'. The loss of a Pounds 5,800 exemption to an ordinary employee means a great deal more than to a millionaire option-holder. The only way Mr Brown could raise a significant proportion of the alleged Pounds 200m lost tax he has identified is to tax the paper gains at sharply higher rates than the present 40 per cent. Curiously, even this may be counter-productive. If employees are taxed on their paper gains rather than cash gains, then the options may appear less of an incentive and companies would presumably offer the benefit of share options less regularly or, more likely, only to a restricted circle of senior executives who are better placed to cope with the more complicated tax liabilities. In any event, the end result would probably be that the total amount of tax revenues raised on share options would probably dwindle, not increase.

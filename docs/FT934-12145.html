			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Mexico to join 'border bank' THE US and Mexico yesterday announced agreement on setting up a North American Development Bank to help finance environmental and infrastructure projects along their border. The Nadbank, along with a new Border Environmental Co-operation Commission, is expected to play a critical role in winning support for the imperilled North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada. A Nadbank was originally proposed by Congressman Esteban Torres of California. Its establishment has won his endorsement of Nafta and other undecided Hispanic Congressmen may follow suit. Yesterday's announcement also triggered the endorsements of the National Council of La Raza, the biggest US Hispanic organisation, and of environmental groups such as the National Wildlife Federation and the Natural Resources Defence Council. Waverers have come down on both sides of the fence, but Nafta opponents still outnumber its supporters in Congress, particularly in the House of Representatives. Mr Jeffrey Shafer, assistant US Treasury secretary for international affairs, said Mexico and the US would each contribute Dollars 225m (Pounds 149m) over four years in paid-up capital to Nadbank. 'Through market borrowings, we believe we can leverage the paid-in capital into Dollars 2bn initially, perhaps eventually up to Dollars 3bn.' Nadbank loans or guarantees would back around Dollars 2bn of environmental infrastructure projects along the border.</p>

The shelling late Wednesday close to the Kurdish checkpoint  of Chamchamal on the road from the government-controlled town of  Karkuk to Kurdish-held al-Sulaymaniyah caused no casualties,  they said.    Kurdish district commander Khidir Sine said 6O tanks had  been  brought forward to the line since Tuesday, while an Iraqi  helicopter flew within 300 metres (yards) of the demarcation  line.    Iraqi forces are now less than 500 metres (yards) from the  checkpoint.    A 300-kilometre (180-mile) stretch of the demarcation line  between Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq and the rest of the  country lies south of the 36th parallel, above which the Kurds  are protected by allied warplanes.    Iraq has since the start of March built up troops and arms  on  the other side of the line, according to the Kurds.    But a senior officer who deserted from the Iraqi Army,  declining to be named, said the soldiers along the demarcation  line were "not in a fit state to attack the Kurds."    Their morale is low and the army's situation "desolate,"  according to the officer.    While ruling out a large-scale attack, Kurdish officials and  representatives of foreign organisations said the army could  launch limited raids south of the 36th parallel.</p>

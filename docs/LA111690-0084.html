			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHIPPING OUT;  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH TELLS LIVE-ABOARD BOATERS TO MOVE ALONG  </P> <P> For 15 years, Bob DeLoyd has lived aboard his boat, a breakwater away from the  open sea but so close to nature that he knows the gulls by name.  </P> <P> People said his lifestyle was too good to be true. This week they were proven  right. On Tuesday, DeLoyd and six other live-aboard boaters who moor at the far  edge of Redondo Beach's King Harbor were told they will have to move.  </P> <P> The eviction notice, served by the City Council, was part of the fallout from  the violent storms of 1988. In just four months that year, towering waves and  gale-force winds devastated the harbor area and nearly destroyed the Redondo  Beach Pier. The storm also spawned several multimillion-dollar lawsuits against  the city.  </P> <P> When the first of those lawsuits -- a claim by the Redondo Beach Marina that  the city had not adequately protected the harbor -- was settled earlier this  year, the city agreed, among other things, to buy the mooring area for $1.5  million and evict its tenants.  </P> <P> For years, the marina had allowed boats to anchor far from the docks and just  inside the harbor passage to Santa Monica Bay. The area is far from  comfortable: Phone service is limited, groceries and water have to be hauled in  by dinghy and there is the annual threat of winter storms. Still, scores of  boaters accepted the risks and inconvenience as the price of a home that was  private, tranquil and cheap.  </P> <P> "It's hard to explain," said Bill Humphreys, 41, who has lived in the outer  harbor for 11 years. "What other people feel when they go backpacking, I feel  on a daily basis when I go home."  </P> <P> DeLoyd agreed.  </P> <P> "So many people live humdrum lives, with their cars and their electric  garages," the 39-year-old student said. "I row out to my home. I enjoy the wind  and the waves and camaraderie that you just don't get in a neighborhood where  people drive home and watch TV."  </P> <P> Each day, he said, he is awakened by his dog, which he would have to give up if  he kept his boat in a slip, where pets generally are not allowed.  </P> <P> When he leans over the deck of his 26-foot sailboat, Fancy Free, curious seals  pop up from the water. Sea gulls swoop down to eat from his hand.  </P> <P> "I've even named some," DeLoyd said, smiling. "One old bird I've named Horus,  for the Egyptian god with the wings."  </P> <P> When the first massive storm hit in January, 1988, DeLoyd and Humphreys said,  they felt excitement rather than fear. Familiar with the elements, they could  sense what was coming from the rising force of the winter wind and the crash of  the waves against the breakwater. When the skies cleared, buildings had been  wrecked, the landmark pier had been battered and millions of dollars' worth of  damage had been done. But there were no injuries among the resilient  live-aboards of the outer harbor, and no lawsuits filed by them against the  city.  </P> <P> There was, however, a suit filed that year by their landlord, the Redondo Beach  Marina, and when it was settled in April and the city got the moorings, the  question of municipal liability arose.  </P> <P> Mooring tenants in the outer harbor who had removed their boats during the 1988  storms were not allowed to return, but a handful, including DeLoyd and  Humphreys, had managed to ride out the storms.  </P> <P> The live-aboards urged the city to let them stay, and a six-month study ensued.  But in the end, a city consultant concluded that the safety of live-aboards in  the outer harbor could not be guaranteed.  </P> <P> It is unclear what the deadline will be for the people of the outer harbor.  When the lawsuit was settled, the tenants were given 30 days to move.  </P> <P> DeLoyd and his neighbors, caught in the middle of the legal wrangling, contend  that the city has ousted them not because of the safety risks but because the  council is unreasonably fearful of more litigation.  </P> <P> But the council is adamant.  </P> <P> "Living aboard a boat is wonderful and romantic, and I can understand that  you've done it for a long time," Councilwoman Kay Horrell told the stunned  live-aboards.  </P> <P> "But when you sit up here and picture things as we do, it's scary. This city  has lawsuits lined up at the harbor gate and waiting to come in on the tide. .  . . It would only take one lost life and this city is in deep, deep trouble."  </P></p>

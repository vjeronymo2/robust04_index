			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Austrian Airlines delays alliance decision AUSTRIAN Airlines has postponed a decision on future business alliances until 'early autumn' following receipt of a specific proposal for co-operation from Lufthansa, the German national airline. Austrian was expected to make its decision next week on whether to join the Alcazar project, which would link it with Swissair, SAS Scandinavian Airline System and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, or pursue co-operation with Lufthansa or Air France. Lufthansa confirmed at the weekend that it had made a precise co-operation proposal under which Austrian would be responsible for most flights between Germany and Austria. Austrian said only that it was in talks with Lufthansa, Air France and with the Alcazar companies. Its board would take a position on these proposals early in the autumn. Analysts in Vienna said there were divisions within the Austrian board and among the airline's workforce on which alliance to accept, but Alcazar still appeared the better option. 'Austrian's main problem is transatlantic business, and Lufthansa would not help because it has no US partner,' Ms Claudia Schwarz-Vartok, an analyst at Die Erste Invest-Consult in Vienna, said. Also, if Austrian joined Lufthansa, it would have to unwind the very substantial co-operation arrangements it has with Swissair already on maintenance, pilot training, flight numbering, sales offices and a frequent flyer programme. Flughafen Wien, the partially privatised operator of Vienna's international airport, said the Austrian government was seeking to reduce its stake in the group from 36.5 per cent to 25 per cent. An initial offer would be made to the province of Lower Austria and the city of Vienna, each of which holds 18.25 per cent. If they were not interested, the shares would be offered to institutional investors by Bank Austria and Warburg Securities. Shares in Flughafen Wien were floated in Austrian and international stock markets in June 1992.</p>

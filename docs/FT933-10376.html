			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Unlikely springboard for European growth JAMES BROWN will be the first entertainer not wearing football boots to play at the New London Stadium. The veteran soul singer appears at the end of this month by arrangement with Ogden Entertainment Services of New York, one of the world's biggest marketing companies. Ogden, which manages 110 venues in the US and Canada, has found its springboard to a European stadia operation in New Cross, south London, the home of Millwall Football Club. The US group, whose only other European operation is baggage handling at Gatwick Airport, is at the start of a vigorous European campaign in entertainments. Last month it agreed a 20-year contract to operate Manchester's new Olympic arena and it is in the final throes of arranging a deal concerning a new stadium in Kirklees, West Yorkshire. Several other projects are under negotiation including plans for Germany and Belgium as well as further schemes for the UK. Mr Frank Russo, Ogden's vice president for international operations, is excited about the Millwall venture. He is unworried about the club's former reputation for supporter violence or the ground's location in an area of south London considered in need of regeneration. 'The area has a reputation that is based more in perception than truth,' he said. The link-up between Ogden and Millwall arose from an association between Mr Peter Mead, vice-chairman of the football club, and chiefs at Ogden. It has resulted in the 10 year management deal under which Ogden will take full responsibility for non-football events and take a share in catering and merchandising. Mr Russo sees the UK as a market ready to be tapped. Apart from customers clamouring to be treated 'with more kindness', he also sees potential for more stadia. 'There needs to be more of a circuit in the UK,' he said. The foothold Ogden has made at Millwall will soon be consolidated by plans for a permanent UK base.</p>

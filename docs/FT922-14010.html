			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: End to ads - Ballot Box The 500 or so UK employees of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi  - the agency handling the Conservative party's election advertising  - will receive an internal newsletter carrying a spoof ad advising them that a vote for Labour means a vote for job losses in their own industry  - as Labour intends to ban tobacco advertising. The ad shows two boxing gloves, one with 'less ads', the other 'less admen' printed on them, a la Saatchi's 'double whammy' poster. On the other hand, given the recriminations between Saatchi and Conservative Central Office over the party's poor showing in the opinion polls, it may be that the agency's Tory account is already as good as lost.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: The cost of education Sir, Speaking as one who holds a Scottish Higher leaving certificate, I refer to your report ('Baccalaureate urged instead of Scots exam', March 6) about suggested changes to the Scottish Higher exam. Broadly, Professor Howie is asking for the Scottish education system to have both breadth and depth and not simply the breadth that it has at present. If our children are to be educated in breadth and depth then the government will have to be prepared to pay for longer periods spent at school and in the university. Our university graduates qualify when they are 2l and at the latest perhaps 23, whereas in Germany and France 25 and 26 is not unusual.

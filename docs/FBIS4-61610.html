			<p>BFN     [Text] A member of the Georgian parliament Boris Kakubava  calls for the military action for the return of breakaway  Abkhazia. Addressing a convention of the Union for the  Liberation of Abkhazia, in Tbilisi, Kakubava described political  moves for the return of Abkhazia as a criminal waste of time.    He said that although he was no fascist, he knew that ethnic  Georgians would return to Abkhazia with the help of those same  means that were used to oust them from their home place.    But, Kakubava said, no refugee would dare return as long as  the Abkhaz authorities dictated terms in Sukhumi.    Kakubava accused Eduard Shevardnadze of losing Abkhazia. He  said he represented the best part of the Georgian nation and  would work for the triumph of the Georgian spirit throughout  Georgia.    Kakubava urged the 300 delegates to the convention to  refrain  from moves that could aggravate the domestic situation and  foment confrontation with the government.    The leader of Georgia's Popular Front Nodar Natadze rejected  the idea of taking military action against Abkhazia. In his  view, moves must be made to create an operational committee for  the temporarily occupied areas which would instruct the  government on strategies for Abkhazia.    Speaking on behalf of Shevardnadze's Georgian Citizens'  Union, Georgiy Baramidze called, but failed to evoke support,  for a political settlement. The convention is going on. Eduard  Shevardnadze will be expected to take part in the proceedings.</p>

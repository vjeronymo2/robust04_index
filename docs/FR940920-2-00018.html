The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the notice of initiation on March 7, 1994 (59 FR 11771, March 14, 1994), the following events have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 31, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 13, 1994, three companies, the Caicedo Group, Hilsea Investments Ltd. (Hilsea), and Quitoflores, requested that they be excluded from any potential antidumping duty order issued as a result of this investigation. Due to constraints on the Department's administrative resources, we were unable to investigate companies requesting to be excluded from the potential order or requesting to receive a questionnaire on a voluntary basis ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the May 2, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 19, 1994, the Department decided to collect constructed value (CV) information from all respondents in addition to home market or, where appropriate, third country sales information ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the April 19, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 5, 1994, the Department issued sales and cost questionnaires to the following four Ecuadorian companies: Arbusta-Agritab (Arbusta), Inversiones Floricola S.A. (Floricola), Florin S.A. (Florinsa), and Guanguilqui Agro Industrial S.A. (Guaisa). These companies accounted for approximately 40 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise during the period of investigation (POI). Although the Department ``normally will examine not less than 60 percent of the dollar value or volume of the merchandise sold'' during the POI, 19 CFR 353.42 (b)(1), due to the limited administrative resources, the Department chose to examine less than 60 percent ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the May 3, 1994, memorandum from David L. Binder to Richard W. Moreland).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 7, 1994, the Department relieved all respondents from the requirement of reporting sales of roses imported and/or sold as part of bouquets ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the June 7, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 14, 1994, the Department selected the appropriate third country markets for all four of the respondents ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the June 14, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). However, since respondents argued that third country markets were fundamentally different from the U.S. market, it was decided that the final basis for foreign market value (FMV) for the respondents (either third country sales or CV) would not be determined until more information was received ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the ``Third Country Sales Versus Constructed Value'' section of this notice for further discussion).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 24, 1994, the Floral Trade Council, petitioner in this investigation, requested a postponement of the preliminary determination until September 12, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1994). The Department granted this request on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 34409, July 5, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, on June 24, 1994, the Department instructed respondents to report monthly-average price data for the U.S. and third country markets ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the June 24, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 25, 1994, Floricola, one of the four respondents, submitted an amendment to its questionnaire response. In that amendment, Floricola stated that, based on further review, it did not have viable third country markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents submitted responses to the Department's sales and cost questionnaires in May, June, and July 1994. Hilsea also submitted a voluntary response to section A on May 26, 1994. Because the Department determined that it did not have the administrative resources to accept voluntary responses, Hilsea's response was returned on June 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department issued deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June, July, August, and September 1994. Respondents submitted their responses to these deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June and August 1994. Responses to the September deficiency letters are due later this month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 12, 1994, the Department decided to base FMV for Arbusta and Guaisa on third country sales ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the September 12, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford).

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein told to pick up 'gauntlet of peace': British and Irish prime ministers strive to regain initiative on Ulster Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds tried to recapture the initiative in their joint attempt to halt 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland yesterday. Presenting a united front in statements coinciding with Mr Major's third visit to the province this year, the British and Irish prime ministers categorically ruled out negotiations with Sinn Fein until the IRA ends its armed campaign. But in a third statement in as many days, Sinn Fein redoubled its efforts to drive a wedge between London and Dublin, accusing the two governments of making 'contradictory statements' about last week's Downing Street Declaration. The charge from the IRA's political wing came as President Bill Clinton appeared to offer it an incentive by hinting that he might lift a ban on Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, entering the US in return for a positive response to the Major-Reynolds initiative. Mr Major used a surprise visit to Belfast to tell Republican leaders: 'There is a gauntlet down on the table. It is marked peace. It is there for Sinn Fein to pick it up.' He added: "The joint declaration is perfectly clear. There is no need for fresh negotiations. There is no need for any indecisiveness.' If Mr Adams wanted clarification, he should stop the violence and wait for a brief period. Then the questions he wanted answered would be answered. Accusing Sinn Fein of 'delaying tactics', Mr Major warned that London was not prepared to wait indefinitely for a positive response to the peace initiative. 'I don't think one can be strung along for ever,' he said. On his first official visit to Republican west Belfast, Mr Major urged listeners: 'Don't play Mr Adams's game. He has an opportunity. That opportunity is marked peace. The opportunity is on the table - does Mr Adams have the will and the courage to pick it up?' Before moving on to meetings last night at Hillsborough with church and community leaders and leaders of Northern Ireland's four non-violent political parties, the prime minister said a terrorist decision to renounce violence was the only 'sane' decision that could be made. The men of violence no longer had 'a shred of justification'. Mr Reynolds echoed Mr Major's line in telling the Irish senate the 'next stage' of negotiations with Sinn Fein could come only after peace 'has first been established'. But the Irish prime minister took a more emollient tack in pledging 'an enlightened and pragmatic approach' in subsequent talks on 'difficult' security issues. A 'balanced' approach would be essential, he said. In a further hint at flexibility, he said the Republic's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein would be reviewed 'in depth' on January 19. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is expected to report to Mr Major on a review of similar British restrictions about the same time. As Mr Adams repeated calls for talks with London and Dublin to clarify 'confusions and contradictions' in the declaration, senior Sinn Fein officials said 'direct contact' was now 'a vital and essential part of the process'. But after a meeting of the party's national executive committee in Dublin, Mr Caoimnghin O'Caolain, a committee member, said he did not believe the peace process was deadlocked. Mr O'Caolain also hinted Sinn Fein had tried to reopen its secret channel of negotiations with the British government. There was no indication whether the IRA is planning to extend its traditional three-day Christmas ceasefire, spanning Christmas Eve to Boxing Day. That is expected today. Yesterday's developments came after the Irish Times reported that President Clinton had indicated the ban on Mr Adams entering the US might be lifted. Observer, Page 11</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: AGF chairman's challenge in countdown to sell-off - John Ridding examines a key appointment in the French insurance sector Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani was yesterday appointed as the new chairman of Assurances Generales de France, one of the country's largest insurance groups, and a candidate for privatisation this year. Mr Jeancourt-Galignani, who moves to AGF from the head of Banque Indosuez, will succeed Mr Michel Albert, who was appointed earlier this month as one of the six lay members of the monetary policy council of the Bank of France. The expected change at the head of AGF is the latest step in a reshuffle of chairmen at state-owned groups slated for privatisation by the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur. Mr Michel Pebereau was appointed as head of Banque Nationale de Paris prior to its privatisation last October, while Mr Philippe Jaffre and Mr Jacques Friedmann have respectively taken charge of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurance group. Like Mr Pebereau and Mr Jaffre, the new AGF chairman is a graduate of France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration and started his career in the Tresor, the country's financial administration. But his latest appointment is not considered to be politically motivated, and is more a reflection of his financial background and his experience of privatisation while at Banque Indosuez. The investment bank has advised the government on several privatisation issues. Since joining Banque Indosuez in 1979, Mr Jeancourt-Galignani has established a reputation as a respected financier. He failed, however, to secure the chairmanship of Cie de Suez, the bank's parent company. Mr Jeancourt-Galignani will now focus on the preparation of AGF's privatisation. The sale of the insurance group is expected to follow that of Elf-Aquitaine and UAP and could take place in the second half of the year. AGF has proved relatively resilient in the face of the French recession. In the first half of last year, the group reported net profits of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 235m), although Mr Albert warned of a more difficult second half. The insurance group has also made progress in resolving outstanding problems. In particular, a government-backed recovery plan has been concluded for Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the loss-making property bank in which AGF has a 30 per cent stake. 'Its property-related problems are being sorted out,' said one industry analyst in Paris. The prospect of privatisation could also prompt the establishment of a partnership with Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank. Industry observers in Paris argue that Credit Lyonnais could become one of AGF's core of stable long term investors after privatisation, creating a strategic alliance similar to the relationship between BNP and UAP. Mr Jeancourt-Galignani's departure also raises questions about strategy at Suez. Banque Indosuez has traditionally enjoyed a high level of independence from its parent company, but Mr Gerard Worms, Suez chairman, has indicated that he wants to create a more-centralised financial services group and could use Mr Galignani's exit to bring Indosuez under stronger central control.</p>

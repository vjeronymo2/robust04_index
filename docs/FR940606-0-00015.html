Children under the age of 16 will not be admitted to these research rooms unless they have been granted research privileges or are granted an exception to this provision to view specific documents that a parent or other accompanying adult researcher is using. The exception will be granted by the Director of the User Services Division for a child who is able to read and who will be closely supervised by the adult researcher while in the research room. Normally, such a child will be admitted only for the short period required to view the documents. Unless otherwise permitted, children under the age of 16 who have been granted special permission to accompany an adult using records may not actively participate in research activities, e.g., removing, copying, or refiling documents. Students under the age of 16 who wish to perform research on original documents must apply in person to the Director of the User Services Division and present a letter of reference from a teacher. Such students may contact the National Archives by phone or letter in advance of their visit to discuss their eligibility for research privileges. Students under the age of 16 who have been granted research privileges will be required to be accompanied in the research room by an adult with similar privileges, unless the Director of the User Services Division specifically waives this requirement with respect to individual researchers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The procedures in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section apply to all research rooms in the National Archives Building (except the Microfilm Research Room); the Suitland Research Room in the Washington National Records Center; and the research rooms in the National Archives at College Park.

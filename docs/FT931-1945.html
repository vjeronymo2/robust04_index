			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Arts: Hitchcock's 'Blackmail' - Concerts in London Few segments of the South Bank's Towards the Millennium series have been as imaginatively devised as the mini-festival of film music mounted this weekend by Matrix and its conductor Robert Ziegler in collaboration with the British Film Institute. The 1920s is the period currently under review; and, since several significant figures were involved in the composition of scores to accompany early silent features, the three days of events at the Queen Elizabeth Hall were filled with events at once relevant to the series' larger theme and greatly enticing in their own right. But perhaps more imaginative still was the opportunity given to one of today's prominent younger British composers, Jonathan Lloyd, to provide the score for the BFI's handsomely cleaned-up new print of a famous early (1929) Hitchcock film. Blackmail, of course, exists both in silent and sound versions, but the greater artistic economy of the former was a point made clear by Thursday's showing - and underlined by the punchy alertness to incident, and laconic sensitivity to atmosphere of Lloyd's music. His scoring is for chamber octet (strings, wind, brass, piano and percussion); the influence of both Weill and Stravinsky is deliciously evident, as is Lloyd's creative fingerprint of quirky wit (a loopy set of variations on 'Two for Tea' unfolds under the developing triangle of girl, policeman and artist). One left the hall hoping that Blackmail and its wryly sympathetic new musical accompaniment will now be seen and heard together as often as possible: they have forged a genuinely successful creative partnership.</p>

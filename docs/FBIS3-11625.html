			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oliver Bodan] </F>   [Text] Mariano Barahona and Orlando Corrales, counsels for  the defense of the eight bodyguards allegedly involved in Jean  Paul Genie's murder, said yesterday that Army General Humberto  Ortega is still commander of the Sandinist Armed Forces [EPS].    Barahona and Corrales flatly denied that the cautionary  measure against Ortega meant a house arrest.    In addition, the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]  National Directorate [DN] has expressed its moral support for  the EPS Commander's "responsible stance" of appearing in court  "with a constructive spirit." The FSLN DN backed all points in  the letter Ortega addressed to the country. The FSLN DN agreed  with Ortega on the existence of a smear campaign against the EPS  unleashed by ultrarightists in Nicaragua and the United States.  According to Article 103, Chapter IV of the Military Criminal  Law, "the indicted person's pledge not to leave his home shall  consist of the obligation not to leave the same, or any place  where he might happen to be residing temporarily, without  authorization from the prosecutor or the court, as the case may  be, except to tend to his business, care for his health, or  pursue higher education."    In an open letter, Barahona and Corrales insisted that Gen.  Ortega only removed himself from learning about any procedure  "directly or indirectly" connected with the trial. They also  said that Ortega "has voluntarily resigned his jurisdictional  powers."    According to the counsels for the defense, the cautionary  ruling issued against Ortega was "unnecessary because the  general has never refused to appear in court."    By contrast, Judge Advocate Lester Gallo Sandoval, who is in  charge of the preliminary military investigations, has told  BARRICADA that "the house arrest will continue for indefinitely  but that he will continue to perform his normal functions."    Gallo said he will announce his "conclusions" in about six  weeks. Inspector General Lieutenant Colonel Denis Moncada  Colindres will then announce the final sentence, which can be  appealed by the two parties through a writ of appeal presented  to the Supreme Court of Justice. Regarding yesterday's doubts  about whether Ortega had been temporarily suspended, the  prosecutor said that "the president of the Republic," who is  also the defense minister according to law, "is the person who  decides whether he is suspended."</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SCOTTISH BAND DEL AMITRI TOUGHENS ITS ACT AT ROXY  </P> <P> Del Amitri is a Scottish band with a taste for both Neil Young and its own  roots (the sinewy rustic nostalgia of "Gasoline Alley"-period Rod Stewart). The  band also has a strong, soul-pop singer in Justin Currie, and a knack for pop  hooks neither trendy nor timeless, but that unfold with a comforting  familiarity.  </P> <P> On the current album "Waking Hours," blandness keeps a lid on things, but at  the Roxy on Thursday, del Amitri did more than the toughening-up most bands do  on stage.  </P> <P> The band members also offered an unaffected, engaging spontaneity, hooking up  with each song as if it were a challenge to be dealt with anew -- you could  tell from their eye contact and reactions to certain riffs and flourishes that  they were really listening to each other. But the real attraction of del Amitri  on stage is lead guitarist Iain Harvie, a wild-eyed messiah figure who looks as  if he were assigned to the wrong band at roll call. The tension between the  group's reserve and Harvie's scary intensity was absorbing from start to  finish. The band plays tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.

However, such involvements create an increased risk of conflict between the private interests of individuals, or of the companies with which they are involved, and the public interest that NSF funding should serve. These risks have aroused concern in the scientific and engineering communities, in the public media, in Congress, and at NSF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this concern, NSF developed a proposed Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy requiring financial disclosure by investigators and professional employees at grantee institutions who are involved in NSF-funded research and educational activities. On July 16, 1992, NSF published its proposed Policy in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and invited public comment. 57 FR 31540 (July 16, 1992). NSF received seventy-two written comments from universities, research institutions and various associations. The primary issues raised by commenters, and NSF's responses, are described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uniform Federal Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters recommended either that the Federal Government adopt a uniform, government-wide investigator conflicts policy with a single point of contact for conflict of interest and financial disclosure issues, or that NSF coordinate with other agencies to ensure that agency policies are consistent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSF agrees that a uniform, government-wide approach to the conflicts issue is advisable_it would eliminate the possibility of inconsistent agency policies, and reduce the bureaucratic burdens associated with compliance with different conflicts policies. NSF has been working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that this Policy and the proposed rule issued by HHS in this edition of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be consistent, and will impose the same obligations on grantees. In addition, NSF has been working with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, HHS and other interested agencies to develop and propose a common Federal policy on investigator conflicts of interest. It is expected that this policy, when completed, will ensure consistent treatment of investigator conflicts issues at all Federal funding agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Financial Disclosure to NSF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy required grant applicants to disclose to NSF the significant financial ties their investigators have with parties whose financial interests might be affected by the work to be funded. It also required applicants to describe the measures, if any, that would be taken to minimize the risks associated with actual or potential conflicts of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters felt that universities and research institutions, and not NSF, should have primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing investigator financial information, and for managing conflicts. They objected to the requirement that each grant proposal be accompanied by financial disclosures, and offered a variety of reasons for doing so. These included privacy concerns; a belief that NSF's review of financial disclosures would be inconsistent with an emphasis on institutional responsibility; a belief that the requirement imposed an unjustified paperwork and staff burden on institutions; and a concern that this disclosure requirement could have a chilling effect on university-industry collaborations and on the submission of grant proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative, some commenters suggested that NSF require institutional certifications that appropriate policies and procedures had been implemented, and that actual or potential conflicts were resolved to the satisfaction of the institution. NSF could then conduct periodic reviews of grantee financial disclosure/conflict of interest records to assure itself that institutions had complied with NSF's minimum requirements. Some commenters also suggested that financial disclosure to NSF would be appropriate if institutions are unable to satisfactorily resolve conflicts issues that they identify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NSF recognizes the fact that many institutions and investigators are concerned about the possible ramifications of providing financial information to NSF. While NSF does not necessarily agree with all of the conclusions reached by those institutions and investigators, the final Policy has been revised so that disclosure to NSF is not required unless institutions find that they are unable to satisfactorily resolve a conflict issue. Instead, NSF's final Policy requires an institutional representative to certify with each grant proposal that the required conflict of interest policy has been implemented; that, to the best of his or her knowledge, all required financial disclosures were made; and that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest, or, if such conflicts exist, they were, or prior to funding of the award, they will be managed in a manner satisfactory to the institution or disclosed to NSF. Individual investigators also must certify that each has read and understood the institution's conflict of interest policy; to the best of his/her knowledge, all financial disclosures required by the institution's policy were made; and he/she will comply with any conditions or restrictions imposed by the institution to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final Policy also requires that institutions maintain records of financial disclosures, and records relating to the management of actual and potential conflicts of interest, until three years after the later of the termination or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving the records. NSF may undertake periodic reviews of the records in order to assess the reliability of institutional and investigator certifications, and to determine whether institutional safeguards do, in fact, protect the integrity of NSF-funded research. In undertaking any such reviews, NSF will coordinate with HHS, to the extent feasible, to ensure that institutions are not unnecessarily subjected to multi-agency reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

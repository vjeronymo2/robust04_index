			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> EARLY EXHIBITS TO DISPLAY CONTEMPORARY LOOK  </P> <P> Well, out with the old year, in with the new. What's coming up on the visual  arts scene in Orange County? Happily, some impressive-sounding shows -- nearly  all devoted to contemporary work -- are on tap for the first six months of  1990.  </P> <P> One important point to keep in mind: While it's great for our museums and  galleries to host fine shows organized elsewhere, an institution's real  prestige comes from having done the planning, thinking and legwork on its own.  </P> <P> Newport's first big blast for the year opens April 8. "OBJECTives: THE NEW  SCULPTURE," (through June 24) is chief curator Paul Schimmel's last project  before he leaves for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The show  presents a type of work by younger American and European artists that has come  to dominate the offerings of a number of major galleries in L.A., New York and  Europe.  </P> <P> Called "Neo-Geo" or "Simulationism" in the United States, this work is about  our attitudes toward everyday objects and the way they reflect assumptions held  by the society that produced them.  </P> <P> Without knowing these works were created by artists and meant to carry a  particular set of meanings, viewers are likely to see such pieces merely as  mass-produced kitsch, a bizarre kind of window dressing or the whims of an  eccentric collector.  </P> <P> Clearly, work such as this cries out for explication -- a task that a museum  survey is equipped to undertake. Artists in the show include the much-lauded,  much-derided Jeff Koons as well as Grenville Davey, Katharina Fritsch, Annette  Lemieux, Julian Opie, Haim Steinbach and Robert Gober. Financial support comes  from the Irvine Co. and the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> Associate curator Lucinda Barnes' first show at Newport Harbor is also the  first one-person exhibition of Buzz Spector's art in California (Jan. 21  through March 18). An art critic and former book designer, Spector transforms  books "from object(s) of communication into . . . object(s) of the  imagination," as a Museum of Modern Art curator has written. Part of the  ongoing New California Artist series, the exhibit -- supported by the museum's  Century Club -- presents several of the artist's "altered books" (created by  tearing or carving) and one of his sculptural installations, made with 6,500  stacked volumes.  </P> <P> Although an exhibit called "Selections from the Permanent Collection" (Jan. 21  through March 18) sounds like old news, Newport's includes some significant  recent additions. One is "Rondo," an installation by celebrated "light and  space" artist James Turrell, purchased with funds from the Peter Norton Family  Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum's big contender -- the pet project of director Charles  Desmarais -- is "The Profound in the Banal: The Art of Ilene Segalove" (April  27 through July 8). The Los Angeles artist is well known for her deadpan  videotapes exploring the amazing-but-true blend of blandness and weirdness  experienced by middle-class suburbanite living in a consumer culture.  </P> <P> The show -- funded in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts  -- will include 30 large-scale photographic works, 12 videotapes and 20 audio  works. (Viewers may already have heard some of Segalove's audio pieces on  National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" and "Morning Edition.")  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza Satellite site starts the new year  with a group of installations by San Francisco artist Paul Kos (Jan. 11 through  April 15). His new piece, "Ber lin" -- the title is divided to represent the  Berlin Wall -- incorporates neon, lights, two-by-fours and cuckoo clocks as  metaphors for recent political upheaval in the East Bloc.  </P> <P> Kos' other work in the show includes a couple of recent pieces -- "Silenced  Tongues" and "Trotsky" -- as well as "rEVOLUTION: Notes for the Invasion -- mar  mar march" from 1973, in which the rat-a-tat-tat of a typewriter stuttering  over the same word creates a hypnotic, marchlike cadence.  </P> <P> How brave of South Coast Plaza, which is bearing some of the costs of the show,  to have opened its pocketbook for such subversive-sounding stuff.  </P> <P> Other exhibits are imports from points east and north.  </P> <P> "Success Is a Job in New York ... The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol"  runs from Jan 21 through March 18 at Newport Harbor, where is also is funded by  South Coast Plaza. Organized by the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center at New  York University, the show traces the artist's early commercial and  non-commercial art, before he became a big shot in the Pop world.  </P> <P> In 1959 Warhol came to New York from Pittsburgh, a 21-year-old with a design  degree from Carnegie Tech. His early jobs were with ad agencies, fashion  magazines and department stores. (The show's title comes from a magazine  article Warhol illustrated.) A few years later he was hired to design book  jackets and record albums, and he dabbled in "image shaping" for retail stores.  </P> <P> Only in 1957 did he give up commercial stints to focus on his own art -- which  was, of course, derived from the look of advertisements and throwaway media  imagery.  </P> <P> "Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper 1951-1989," which runs July 13 through Oct. 7 at the  main location of the Laguna Art Museum, was organized by the University Art  Museum, Berkeley. DeFeo, who died in November at 60, showed at the Ferus  Gallery in Los Angeles and was included in the prestigious "Sixteen Americans"  show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1959. One of the few women  painters of her era to hold her own with the big boys of the art world, she  worked in both figurative and abstract modes.  </P> <P> This exhibit -- funded by the Exhibitionists, a Laguna Art Museum council --  includes drawings, photo collages and paintings on paper.  </P> <P> For the die-hard lovers of California Impressionism, Laguna is trotting out  "Colors and Impressions: The Early Work of E. Charlton Fortune" on Feb. 2  (through April 15). Fortune was one of the handful of women (the "E" stood for  Euphemia) among the painters who introduced the French style so belatedly to  California in the 'teens of this century. Originated by the Monterey Peninsula  Museum of Art, the exhibit is supported in Laguna Beach by  Wittenberg/Livingston Inc.  </P> <P> The non-commercial galleries also have come up with a bunch of shows that sound  well worth checking out:  </P> <P> "John Paul Jones: The Man in the Mirror: The Constant Image" opens Jan. 9 at  the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach (through Feb. 20).  Phyllis Lutjeans, guest curator for the show, says it is not a real  retrospective; instead, as she modestly says, it's based on "a funky idea I  had." The exhibit includes about 40 works made by the UC Irvine art faculty  member from 1948 to 1989. Lutjeans believes the somewhat murky, amorphous  figurative images in Jones' early paintings and works on paper are strongly  related to the sculptures he has been making recently, in which viewers can see  reflections of themselves.  </P> <P> The redoubtably titled "California Collectors and Collections II: The Arts and  Crafts Movement in California 1900-1918: Traditions and Antecedents" opens Feb.  6 and runs through May 26 at the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San  Juan Capistrano. This movement -- led by English poet-artist-craftsman William  Morris -- was a revolt against the lack of quality and overdone embellishment  in machine-made Victorian furnishings. As Morris once said: "Have nothing in  your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful."  </P> <P> In California, the Arts and Crafts spirit involved the use of restrained  designs and lavish use of natural woods, metals and minerals. It was kept alive  by such true believers as Greene &amp; Greene, the Pasadena architecture firm;  furniture maker Gustav Stickley; and Dirk van Erp, a San Francisco lamp maker.  Their influences will be visible in this exhibit of furniture, ceramics,  metalwork, lamps and textiles, including period rooms.  </P> <P> Only sparse information was available last week about upcoming offerings at  Saddleback College Art Gallery in Mission Viejo, but they include "Leningrad  Artists," Feb. 8 through March 9, recent work by painters who broke away from  the officially sanctioned styles and subjects of art in the U.S.S.R. The  exhibit is curated by Selma Holo of the Fischer Gallery at the University of  Southern California.  </P> <P> Coming up Jan. 7 (through Feb. 10) at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery is "The  Pleasure and the Terror: An Exhibition of Landscapes," works by Los Angeles  artists Richard Sedivy and Lynn Aldrich. He does mixed-media constructions on  canvas; her works are free-standing painted sculptures.  </P> <P> Sedivy is a popular guy in these parts: His paintings also can be seen in  "Insistent Landscapes" at Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa. Opening Feb.  3 (through April 1), the exhibit includes paintings by Lawrence Gipe (whose  work was at the Laguna museum a couple of years ago), Tobi Kahn, Marcia Cygli  King, Vicki Teague-Cooper and Jean Towgood. For that matter, work by Annette  Lemieux (shown concurrently in Newport Harbor's "OBJECTives") makes another  appearance in a Security Pacific show provisionally called "Representational  and Non-Representational Strategies" (April 21 to June 3), along with Moira  Dryer, David French, Jim Iserman, Ronald Jones, Lari Pittman, Rosemarie Trockel  and Sohki Wagner. Meanwhile, the gallery's Project Room gets a mysterious new  tenant: an installation by Los Angeles artist Michael McMillen called "Train of  Thought" (Feb. 3 through July 29).  </P> <P> Art, architecture and music are the topics of several hot-ticket lectures and  lecture series this winter and spring at the museums.  </P> <P> Francoise Gilot, an artist who was Pablo Picasso's mistress in the late '40s  and early '50s speaks on "Cocteau as I Knew Him 1944-1963" at the Severin  Wunderman Museum in Irvine on Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. Picasso introduced Gilot to  author and artist Jean Cocteau, and they remained friends until his death in  1963. The museum is at 3 Mason St. Ticket prices are $20 general, $12 seniors  and students with ID. For more information and reservations, call (714)  472-1138.  </P> <P> "California and Beyond: The State of Design in the '90s," a five-part lecture  series, begins Feb. 7 at Beckman Center on the UC Irvine campus. Sponsored by  Newport Harbor Art Museum, the series includes talks by architect Michael  Graves (Feb. 7), landscape architect George Hargreaves (Feb. 28), architect  Steven Holl (March 14), graphic designer April Grieman (March 28) and architect  Frank Israel (April 11).  </P> <P> Supported by The Western Regional Philanthropic Committee of Shearson Lehman  Hutton Inc. and the Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Corp., the series is a  project of the Forum, the museum's architecture and design council. Tickets are  $75 for the entire series. (Mail checks no later than Feb. 1 to the Newport  Harbor Education Dept., 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach, 92660).  Single-lecture tickets will be sold at the door only ($15). All lectures start  at 7:30 p.m. For more information, call (714) 759-1122.  </P> <P> At the Laguna Art Museum, the California Contemporary Composers series,  co-sponsored by the UCI School of Fine Arts, continues with 7:30 p.m. lectures  by David Raksin (Jan. 11), Nicholas Slonimsky (Feb. 15), Morton Subotnick  (March 14) and Steven Stucky (April 11). Admission to each lecture is $6  general, $4 students and seniors. Call (714) 494-8971 to purchase tickets;  space permitting, they will also be sold at the door.  </P> <P> Laguna's "Good Morning Laguna" series continues Jan. 11 with  sculptor/installation artist Lita Albuquerque, one of whose works was recently  purchased by the museum. Admission to the 9 a.m. talk, which includes  continental breakfast, is $4.50 general, $3.50 for students and seniors.  Reservations are not required.  </P> <P> Of course, there will be more as the season progresses, so watch this space!  </P></p>

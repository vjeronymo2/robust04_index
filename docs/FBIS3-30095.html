The daily, quoting Chinese diplomatic  sources, said Kim Chong-il, the heir to and son of Kim Il-song,  would also visit China before summer this year. The sources  observed it is almost certain that Kim Il-song would accept the  Chinese invitation.    The paper quoted the sources as saying that China is  inviting  the top leaders of South and North Korea and Japan in a move to  demonstrate its influence in Northeast Asia. It seems Kim  Il-song would ask for China's economic aid and cooperation and  also its support for Kim Chong-il as the next ruler of North  Korea, the POST said. Kim Il-song is also interested in meeting  China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to affirm the "lips and  teeth relations" between China and North Korea, said the paper  adding that Deng would agree to meet Kim on a private basis.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Bill on business rates faces disruption by Labour MPs The bill setting the level of business rates for the coming financial year will be a target for Labour MPs when they return to Westminster today to continue their procedural 'trench warfare' against the government. Labour leaders decided to withdraw customary co-operation between government and opposition over the handling of legislation just before Christmas. Ministers used the parliamentary guillotine to force through two controversial bills through all their stages on successive days. Some of the anger fuelled by what Mr John Smith and his shadow cabinet colleagues believe was an abuse of parlia - mentary process surfaced in the House of Lords yesterday. Baroness Turner of Camden, chief Labour speaker in the debate on the bill providing for Pounds 1.9bn additional revenue from employees' National Insurance contributions, warned that it would require increased scrutiny because of its 'rushed passage' through the Commons. She stressed that, but for the need to comply with constitutional convention, Labour peers would have voted against the second reading of the bill. Labour MPs will have an early opportunity to harass ministers seeking to speed through vital legislation when a procedural motion relating to the non-domestic rating bill is discussed later today. They will have even more scope tomorrow when the bill is due for its second reading. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, has already underlined the importance of ensuring that the bill is not unduly delayed in order to avoid businesses facing uncertainty over rate bills for the coming financial year. The statutory sick-pay bill - the other measure whose rapid passage through the Commons triggered the declaration of non-co-operation - is due for its second reading in the Lords today. It is designed to save the Treasury about Pounds 750m by ending the arrangements for reimbursing employers for about 80 per cent of the cost of statutory sick pay.</p>

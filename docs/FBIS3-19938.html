			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, this morning met Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas and ascertained that with his negative  stance, the proximity talks have finally ended in deadlock. The  UN envoy said that although the two sides are very close to an  agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's], the  Turkish side did not consent to the agreement.    Stressing the importance of the confidence measures for the  two sides, Clark noted that the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish  Cypriot sides must reach agreement to implement them. He said:  We do not have the Turkish Cypriot side's agreement. Clark  insisted that the UN envoys will continue their efforts until  the end of the month when UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali will prepare his report to the UNSC [UN Security  Council] on the talks.    Clark concluded his contacts in Cyprus by meeting President  Glavkos Kliridhis shortly after noon. The meeting concluded a  short time ago.    In a statement in Larnaca after visiting the U.S. frigate  USS  Taylor, Kliridhis described his meeting with Clark as a clearly  typical farewell visit. Kliridhis made it clear that there is  no room to maneuver in the proximity talks right now because  Denktas refuses to take a position on the UN documents on how to  implement the CBM's. He added, however, that nobody knows what  might happen before the UN secretary general submits his report.  The president stressed: Denktas gives no answers. This is why  I made it clear that I will not accept any new UN documents.    Shortly before meeting Kliridhis, Clark met the ambassadors  of the five UN Security Council permanent members in Nicosia.  In a joint statement, the five ambassadors reiterated their  position that an agreement must be reached with no delay. The  statement read by David Dain, British high commissioner in  Nicosia, reiterates the support of the five states for the UN  secretary general's efforts.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'MOST MISERLY'  </P> <P> I resented very much your front-page headline (June 30) "Orange County Among  Most Wealthy, Miserly in U.S.," but became totally incensed when I turned to  Page A18 and found the second portion of your article headlined, "Survey: O.C.  Among Wealthiest, Cheapest."  </P> <P> "Miserly" and "cheap" are harsh words that connote meanness and selfishness.  </P> <P> Simply because Orange County is not beset with social problems as severe as  those of many other counties across America is no reason for your editors to  assail the character of an entire county's citizenry.  </P> <P> Anyone familiar with Orange County knows that our needs for "human service" and  "public safety" spending should not be among the highest in the nation,  although, according to the survey, they are above the national average.  </P> <P> Unless you have solid information to the contrary, you should use adjectives  like "frugal," "economical" or "prudent" when describing Orange County  taxpayers!  </P> <P> JEFFREY LEWIS  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

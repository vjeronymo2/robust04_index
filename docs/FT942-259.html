			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Delors succession search looks south The hunt for a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission is shifting to the south, with three names prominent on the diplomatic circuit: Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva of Portugal, and former Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of Italy. The southern connection has surfaced in the wake of the bungled Franco-German campaign to push through Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, at last weekend's European summit in Corfu. Two other northern candidates - Mr Ruud Lubbers, outgoing prime minister of the Netherlands, and Sir Leon Brittan of the UK - withdrew their candidacies last Saturday. The attraction of Mr Gonzalez and Mr Cavaco Silva is that they are experienced prime ministers. Mr Gonzalez, particularly, would seem assured of winning the required unanimous support. Mr Amato, an economist widely respected for his role in steering Italy through its political upheavals, is said to be seeking a top international job. All three would also lend Mediterranean balance to the Union as it tilts north and east. Next year Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway plan to join the Union, and German-led pressure to include the newly emerging democracies in east and central Europe is certain to grow in the next five years. Mr Gonzalez, a long-time favourite of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has been under pressure for the past three years to throw his hat in the ring. But he has steadfastly refused on the grounds that it would undermine the Socialist government he has led since 1982. Though he is a Socialist, he could be easily repackaged as a centrist on account of his government's programme of labour market reform and efforts at fiscal austerity. A French-speaker, he would also be acceptable to France. In the early hours of Saturday morning, after Mr Dehaene won the first ballot, Mr Gonzalez expressed regret at the failure to reach a consensus, believing that he would be called upon to run once again. But he told his summit colleagues that he did not want to leave Madrid for Brussels - a position he repeated to the Spanish parliament yesterday. A German-inspired 'draft Felipe' movement could start to roll if Mr Kohl sticks to his self-imposed deadline of July 15 to come up with a compromise candidate to replace his protege, Mr Dehaene. Germany believes it is vital to present the Commission president designate to the new European parliament when it holds its inaugural session on July 19. Mr Cavaco Silva's strongest cards are his experience, his Christian Democrat credentials, and his economic track-record since he came to power in 1985. But Portugal holds elections in October 1995, and Mr Cavaco Silva's presence is viewed as vital to his party's hopes of attaining a third consecutive majority. Mr Kohl is also said to be ambivalent. Mr Amato's name is understood to have come up yesterday in conversations between Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Antonio Martino, the new Italian foreign minister. His weakness is his connections to the corruption-plagued Socialist government of Mr Bettino Craxi, though he has remained untainted and above suspicion. Mr Hurd and Mr Martino expressed confidence that the deadlock over the Delors succession could be broken. 'It should be someone who is committed to European ideals, but at the same time not committed to a dirigistic, centralistic, bureaucratic vision of Europe,' said Mr Martino.</p>

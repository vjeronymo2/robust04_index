			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GROUP TO PRESS FOR DURING-SCHOOL MUSIC CLASSES  </P> <P> The nonprofit Friends of School Music will ask the Palos Verdes Peninsula  Unified School District on Monday to reinstate instrumental music classes  during the school day at the district's eight elementary schools.  </P> <P> The group is conducting a letter-writing campaign, warning that a Board of  Education decision to provide instrumental music classes after school, rather  than during the school day, would cause "far-reaching damage" to the district's  music program. Parents are being asked to write to the board to express their  views on the issue.  </P> <P> Members will press for reinstatement of school-day music classes when the Board  of Education meets Monday to adopt its tentative budget for 1989-90. The 7 p.m.  board meeting will be at the district's Valmonte Administration Center, 3801  Via La Selva, Palos Verdes Estates. The board is not expected to adopt a final  budget until September.  </P> <P> The Board of Education decided earlier this year to provide after-school  instrumental music instruction for educational and budgetary reasons, district  officials said Friday. The district expects to save at least $65,000 next year  in salaries and other costs by offering classes after school.  </P> <P> The after-school program will start in the fall at two locations -- the former  Pedregal Elementary School on the west side of the peninsula, and either Mira  Catalina Elementary School or Miraleste High School on the east side, according  to district spokeswoman Nancy Mahr. In addition, ensemble playing will  occasionally be offered after school at all eight elementary schools, she said.  </P> <P> Brigitte Schuegraf, president of Friends of School Music, said that  participation would drop from current levels of 500 to 550 students if the  instruction was after school, when music would have to compete with other  extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> An after-school program, especially one not at the student's home school,  "would reduce enrollment so drastically that the secondary-level music classes  would eventually face extinction," she said.  </P> <P> "Stop a moment and picture future school and community events -- football  games, musicals, parades, band and orchestra concerts -- without a band or  orchestra," she said. Cutting back on elementary music instruction would be  "like cutting a tree off at the roots," she said.  </P> <P> Mahr said that until now, the district has offered a "pull-out" music program  at all eight elementary schools. Under the program, students have been taken  out of their regular classes for music lessons at their home school.  </P> <P> Wherever possible, students are removed from non-academic classes such as  physical education, Mahr said. But sometimes, because two teachers must divide  their time among eight schools, students must be taken out of academic classes,  she said.  </P> <P> Board members and state officials are concerned that students may be missing  required studies, Mahr said. "Classroom pull-out is a very major issue" among  educators, she said.  </P> <P> Mahr noted that music is only one of many school programs affected by a  continuing decrease in state funding. District enrollment has declined from  about 18,000 in 1973 to 9,320 today, and state funding to the district has  diminished accordingly, she said.  </P> <P> In the 1989-90 fiscal year, the district expects to receive $30.6 million from  state and local sources, compared to $31.8 million for 1988-89, Mahr said.  </P> <P> Partly because of the revenue decline, the district had to slash $1.1 million  from its list of desired programs for the 1989-90 school year, she said.  </P> <P> Next year's after-school program, which will be paid for by the district, is  expected to cost about $36,000, compared to $101,000 for the current program,  Mahr said.  </P> <P> A district survey showed that about 250 families would be interested in  participating in an after-school program, she said.  </P> <P> But Friends of School Music and other music organizations contend that  after-school programs do not attract enough attendance to succeed in the long  run.  </P> <P> "It has been our observation over the years that music programs offered before  and after the school day plainly do not work," said Wayne W. Nelson, president  of the Southern California School Band and Orchestra Assn., in a letter to the  district.  </P> <P> "This type of 'extra' time instruction becomes one of elitism, whereby those  who can afford the transportation benefit for a while, but the inconvenience of  early/late pickups soon causes parents and students to drop out. . . ."  </P> <P> Six members of the South Bay branch of the Music Teachers' Assn. said in their  letter that programs in districts that have tried the before- and after-school  approach have failed "after about one year." In addition, they questioned why  music should be assigned a secondary status: "Should it not be welcomed into  the curriculum, rather than (being) banned to the unofficial, unacknowledged,  unimportant non-school times as now planned?"  </P> <P> Schuegraf and the Friends group also criticized the new after-school program  because it would use non-credentialed teachers rather than credentialed  teachers from the district.  </P> <P> District officials said the teachers -- professional musicians and music  teachers from the South Bay Conservatory, a private school in Rancho Palos  Verdes -- are qualified. They simply don't have a teaching credential for  public schools, Mahr said.  </P> <P> The Friends organization, which since its founding in 1979 has donated $180,000  to the district, has helped pay for elementary instrumental music classes in  the district for the past four years. The group also sponsors the Palos Verdes  Elementary Honors Orchestra.  </P></p>

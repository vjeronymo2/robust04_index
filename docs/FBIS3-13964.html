			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Murli Manohar Joshi, former president of BJP </F> (Bharatiya Janata Party), on 5 January; place not given:  "Government Has Allowed Internationalization of Kashmir Issue"]    [Text] When I went to Srinagar to hoist the National Flag  there the Islamic fundamentalist terrorists had infiltrated even  into the administrative machinery of J&amp;K [Jammu and Kashmir]  government. They had established a large number of training  centres, and they had also attracted the imagination of a large  number of young people who were constantly interacting with  Pakistan. Some of them demanded Independence, some others wanted  to merge J&amp;K with Pakistan. Normal life had been disturbed,  terrorism was in full swing and the authority of the Indian  government had completely eroded. I thought that in a part of  our own country, in Kashmir Valley, people, Kashmiri Hindus,  have been squeezed out of their hearths and homes and rendered  homeless. What is this government sitting in Delhi and Srinagar?  How is it that the government has lost the sensitivity to react  to the situations? There is no concern for those unfortunate but  patriotic people. All the political leaders heard the slogans of  Pakistan zindabad... "Indian dogs get out of the  Valley", and other anti-India outpourings. The posters carrying  such slogans were appearing on the walls. Then there was a  massive anti-India propaganda, hate-India campaign on Kashmir  all over the world. Our security forces were painted one of the  most inhuman forces, brute forces violating all human rights.  The government in New Delhi was pumping money, crores, hundreds  of crores in Kashmir Valley. But despite all this generosity  nobody could dare personally go and hoist the National Flag in  Srinagar any day -- Independence Day or Republic Day. A certain  feeling and sense of despondency was descending on the people of  Jammu and Laddakh also as there was nobody to raise a little  finger against the terrorists. Therefore, the Party (the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party]) decided that I should go to Srinagar  and hoist the National Flag in order to emphasise India's basic  unity and integrity. We wanted to tell the whole world that  India is indivisible.    You cannot say that this is Kashmir, this is this, this is  that. These divisions are for administrative set up but  culturally, emotionally and historically, India, including  Kashmir, is one. As I discovered during the Ekta Yatra, even in  the remotest corner down south the sentiment on Kashmir is same  as in the rest of the country -- north, east or west. The main  objective of the Ekta Yatra was to emphasise this positive side  of the Kashmir problem and to educate the people about the harm  and damage which was done by retaining all these years Article  370 which has sowed the seeds of separatism.    My analysis was that the major problem arises because of  this  Article under which Kashmir appears to have been given a  separate status, separate from other States. The continuance of  the Article was responsible for separatism in Kashmir, said Shri  Murli Manohar Joshi, former President of BJP, in an interview to  ORGANISER on his sixtieth birthday, January 5.    Excerpts.    [Question] The government is having talks with Pakistan on  Kashmir. what is your view about it?    [Answer] Regrettably the government has not acted wisely in  handling Kashmir affairs and has provided a handle to  separatist, anti-India elements in Kashmir. The most unfortunate  part of government's policy (on Kashmir) is that Kashmir which  was only a bilateral matter, under the Shimla Pact, has been  allowed to become an international issue. Now, many countries  are coming and trying to sponsor their services to mediate and  United States and some of its representatives have even  questioned the accession of Kashmir State to the Indian Union.  They say that entire Kashmir is a disputed territory. This is  because Government of India could not initiate talks with  Pakistan. The GOI should have forced Pakistan to the negotiating  table and asked for withdrawal of Pakistani forces from the  occupied Kashmir as provided under UN resolutions. The UNCIP  appointed by UNO had held that the accession was legal and valid.    [Question] You mean UN resolution also called for withdrawal  of pakistani Army from PoK?    [Answer] Yes. But GOI never demanded the withdrawal of  Pakistani forces.    [Question] What would you suggest? Should the government  hold  talks?    [Answer] Talks or no talks...that is not the issue. Well,  first GOI should be in a position to create a favourable world  opinion. All those countries which were supporting India till  now have become non-interested. Even Russia which was extending  blanket support in the past has withdrawn. Now, once you accept  that Kashmir is a disputed territory, what about Sikkim? China  does not think it is part of India. Arunachal also, China feels,  is not a part of India. This is a design to destabilise India.  Therefore, the basic question is that of country's integrity.    [Question] Against this background what do you think can be  a  solution?    [Answer] There are so many options being talked about. Some  say, give Kashmir more autonomy, some feel borders should be  made more porous. Some say Valley should be put under  international control for some years. Some are thinking of  independent Kashmir, some say that let Kashmir go to Pakistan.  All sorts of solutions are coming up. These solutions are being  talked about because the GOI has shown weakness in handling the  Kashmir issue all these years. Had it dealt with the issue  firmly there would have been no Kashmir problem today.    [Question] The situation being so alarming, has the Party  any  other immediate plank on Kashmir?    [Answer] Yes, I feel the soul of India must be stirred once  again. To remain quiet on the new U.S. stance on the issue will  be suicidal. Due to elections and other reasons the reaction of  GOI was not so sharp as it should have been.    [Question] It is said that Hazratbal episode gave BJP a very  good chance to bring the Kashmir issue to the fore but BJP  wasted it?    [Answer] As I have told you, there were elections at that  time. But still, all through the election campaign we focussed  on Kashmir and told the people of government's surrender to  militants.  *</p>

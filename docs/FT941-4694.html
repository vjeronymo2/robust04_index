			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / NUM in ballot on new structure The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday started balloting its Yorkshire members over merger plans which, if defeated, would spell the end for the union's structure, Richard Donkin writes. A close vote could bring into question Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency, although those campaigning against the executive admitted yesterday that such an outcome was unlikely. The merger vote has been brought to a head because the NUM, which had 245,000 members in 1982, has about 8,000 members, nearly 6,000 of whom work in the Yorkshire area. This has led to rationalisation plans including the takeover of the Yorkshire area's Pounds 5.8m assets to help ease the union's financial crisis. A ballot is necessary to achieve the merger because of the NUM's federal structure.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BACKWARD STEP  </P> <P> One small step backward for man, one giant step backward for mankind is the way  the port commissioners' vote for naming the new convention center can be  interpreted ("Port Rejects King's Name on S.D. Center," July 26). Ironically,  it happened the week after we have celebrated the 20th anniversary of the walk  on the moon, the big step forward for mankind.  </P> <P> Why did Milford Portwood, Raymond Burk, Robert Penner and Daniel Larsen oppose  the renaming? After all, the democratic process was followed with Rev. Clyde  Gaines leading a citizens' committee for 10 months that came up with that  recommendation. How does Larsen justify his stand? Did he capitulate to the  good old boys? Is he that insensitive to followers of Dr. Martin Luther King,  to the children who seek a role model, a distinguished black man, a reminder of  what we can become?  </P> <P> The distinguished Dr. Martin Luther King will not suffer for the loss. He's  been inscribed in history as the symbol of non-violence, a man of fairness. Who  will suffer? San Diegans will miss the opportunity of being reminded of what  Dr. King did in his short time here. The generic convention center won't have  Dr. King's name. It's a missed opportunity to promote non-violence in an age of  violence.  </P> <P> When we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Apollo in July of 1999, we will  also recall the 10th anniversary of the name-change vote, a bad day in San  Diego's history where four men took a terrible step backward.  </P> <P> SANDRA LIPPE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

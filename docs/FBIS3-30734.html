			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mate Boban, president of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, placed the office of president at the disposal of  the assembly until further notice at an extraordinary session of  the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    [Begin Boban recording] I have decided to place the office  of  president of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna at the disposal  of the assembly until further notice. My duties will be carried  out by the presidential council which will appoint one of its  members to represent the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. [end  recording]    Explaining his decision, Boban said that the most  influential  international players have been misled due to a lack of  information and he believes that certain politicians, and not  the will of the Croat nation, stand in the way of a  multicultural, multiethnic, and unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This belief of the international public, which leads to growing  pressure on the Republic of Croatia, is the reason why Boban had  offered to resign.    [Begin Boban recording] I am saying this at the beginning so  that those who believe in other interpretations in the Croat  nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not describe this as a result  of [word indistinct]. [end recording]    I will stay with you, Boban said at the end of his speech,  in  which he recalled that the will of the Croat nation in Bosnia-  Herzegovina was defined two years ago in a referendum formulated  in Livno, which approved Bosnia-Herzegovina, not as a unitary  state but as one in which the Croat nation would have equal  rights and the right to self-determination. We still support  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three republics, because we  enabled it to survive by defending 35 percent of its territory.  However, the Serbs and the Muslims do not want this  Bosnia-Herzegovina anymore.    Boban also mentioned the meetings of self-proclaimed Croat  assemblies and he said that this assembly is the only legitimate  representative of the Croats' will in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENGLISH MUFFIN IS OK  </P> <P> Question: Different restaurants serve different types of breads with their  meals.  </P> <P> I've even been to some restaurants that put down a tray of Danish pastry when  you first sit down. I know that Danish is a kind of cake, so I avoid it. But  what about an English muffin? Is that considered acceptable if you're trying to  watch your weight?  </P> <P> Answer: An English muffin is acceptable. Danish, sweet rolls and coffee cake  are not.  </P></p>

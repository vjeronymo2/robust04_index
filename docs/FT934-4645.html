			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (6): Where to get to know your banker - There may be no restaurant in the area worth a detour, but Ian Rodger offers advice on where to eat in the city if you are in search of a memorable evening out One eats well in Zurich, but if an evening out is memorable, it more likely to be for the company or the atmosphere of the restaurant rather than for the cuisine. It is safe to say that there is no restaurant in the Zurich area that is 'worth a trip in its own right' as the Michelin Guide would have it, and probably none that is 'worth a detour'. That is perhaps as it should be in a city that still lives very much by Protestant virtues. Public restaurants also suffer from the loss of a large part of the most desirable clientele. This is because private bankers would not dream of taking their rich clients to a restaurant, for fear a competitor would see them. Conversely, many rich people would not like to reveal their status by being seen in the company of a private banker. Thus, some of the city's best tables can be found in the banks. Reviews of four of the Zurich area's top restaurants, all of which will certainly fulfil the needs of a special evening, appear elsewhere in this survey, on page 10. Swiss ambience and cuisine are at their best in the Rotisserie of the Hotel zum Storchen. The restaurant overlooks the Limmat and, on a rare clear evening, one can see past the lake to the Alps. At night, a fairytale atmosphere prevails, as the river lights twinkle and the illuminated old facades of Niederdorf on the opposite bank are reflected in the water. Try to get a table by the window or - in summer - on the terrace. Nowhere will you find the traditional Zurich speciality, Zurcher Geschnetzeltes - thin slices of veal in a rich cream sauce with rosti potatoes - better prepared. Other purely Zurich-style culinary experiences can be found in the Zunft houses (guild halls), the best being the Zunfthaus zur Waag in Munsterhof and the Zunfthaus zum Ruden on Limmatquai. In both cases, the prices are adjusted upwards for the medieval atmosphere. The Kronenhalle at Bellevue, once one of the finest restaurants in town, has lost a bit of its flair since the passing of its legendary foundress, Hulda Zumsteg. But it still serves a good meal and is worth a visit anyway just to sit among some outstanding paintings of Chagall, Miro, Matisse, Klee and Braque. For fondues and other simple Swiss dishes, try Walliser Kanne in Lintheschergasse or Walliser Keller in Zahringerstrasse. For Grison delicacies, it is Bundnerstube in Nuschlerstrasse. Italian restaurants have a long and distinguished tradition in Zurich, reflecting the immigration of thousands of Italians to the city in the 1950s. They range from cheap and cheerful pizzerias to exclusive establishments. Standards are high in all categories, reflecting the fierce competition. For a quiet, elegant business lunch or dinner, try Conti da Bianca in Dufourstrasse behind the Opera (their lobster spaghetti is a revelation), or Piccoli Accademia near Stauffacher (where the calves' liver Veneziana is a speciality and the Zabaglione a marvel). Hard by Paradeplatz, established bankers eat at Orsini, while up-and-coming colleagues frequent Bindella or Contrapunto. The cachet of the latter two establishments is likely to rise next year as their owner, Mr Rudi Bindella, figures in a trial of a former city restaurant inspector for taking bribes. For a light lunch and all the business news, go to the Investors Club in Nuschlerstrasse, and after work to the James Joyce pub, both establishments maintained lovingly by Union Bank of Switzerland, whose headquarters are only a few steps away. For seafood, the Hummer Bar in the St Gotthard Hotel rates highly and has a warm, clubby atmosphere. Nouvelle cuisine and and a hip atmosphere combine well in a refurbished mill at Tiefenbrunnen called the Blaue Ente, while Kaufleuten in Pelikanplatz offers a bistro style. Zurich is not much of a town for fast food. There are three McDonald's outlets, but no chicken emporiums. Zurichers on the run grab a slice of pizza from the occasional sidewalk vendors or stop at the Vorderer Sternen stand at Bellevue for the best bratwurst in the world.</p>

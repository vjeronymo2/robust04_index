			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / US economic growth 'slowing' on June figures The US index of leading indicators rose by a modest 0.2 per cent in June, this being the latest sign that economic growth is slowing, the government said yesterday, agencies report from Washington. Analysts, who had anticipated the rise in the the government's chief forecasting gauge of future US economic activity, said that a small increase was consistent with evidence that the economy is expanding at a moderate pace. This was reinforced by the Federal Reserve in its latest Beige Book survey of economic activity, which said scattered signs of economic slowing were emerging, with rising wage and commodity costs. Presenting revised figures, the Commerce Department said the index rose 0.1 per cent in May, after remaining unchanged in April. The department previously reported that the barometer was unchanged in May. It also said yesterday that orders to US factories rose in June for the fourth consecutive month, climbing 0.8 per cent and matching the previous month's increase. The rise was practically across-the-board, excluding construction-related material and home furnishings. The rise was led by a 12.8 per cent surge in orders for medical instruments and navigation equipment. The Fed said yesterday: 'Business activity in most areas is continuing to expand at a solid pace, although a number of districts report scattered indications of some slowing or slight declines.' The Beige Book, produced about every six weeks, said several districts had reported labour markets tightening and said that was pushing wages up. 'However, labour shortages appear to be concentrated only in a few skilled occupations,' the Fed added. But price rises were reported for a broader range of commodities used for manufacturing, including finished steel and steel scrap, copper, wood and building materials. Retail sales that had moderated in the spring have picked up but competitive pressures were holding prices down and squeezing profit margins, the Fed said.</p>

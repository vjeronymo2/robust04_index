			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: ENCINITAS' MANDARIN NO LONGER TOWERS OVER  CHINESE CUISINE  </P> <P> At its opening nearly 10 years ago, Mandarin Tower in Encinitas was  exceptional, thanks to an energetic management and to the faithful renderings  of classic dishes by a Peking-born and -trained chef. But the energy has waned:  While the cooking and service today are adequate, it no longer serves a  compelling Chinese cuisine.  </P> <P> The restaurant lists pot stickers on the menu page devoted to house  specialties, but the dish is merely average. Other specialties are more  notable. The panda pork, presented on a bed of crushed, deep-fried noodles, has  a pleasantly chewy texture and a subtle flavor that mingles sweet and spicy  undertones. The yu-shiang shrimp, while very much a standard dish, also is well  done, and the shrimp take well to the Szechuan treatment that again mingles a  bit of sweetness with an underlying but far from overpowering heat.  </P> <P> The crispy chicken in hot garlic sauce, highly touted by the restaurant as a  special among specials, was not a particularly happy dish, since the chunks of  chicken lacked crispness and had a rewarmed quality; what was likeable was the  small garden of vegetables in pungent brown sauce that garnished the bites of  bird.  </P> <P> The appetizer list is so perfunctory that the restaurant seems to be telling  its guests that it knows what they want, and that they want egg rolls, crisped  won ton or fried jumbo shrimp. There is the alternative of the dreaded "pu-pu  platter" (the name probably originated at one of those pseudo-Polynesian  restaurants that flourished in the 1960s), which includes tastes of all of  these as well as such tidbits as skewered beef, all to be heated over the open  flame that burns bluish-orange in the center of the platter.  </P> <P> There is a greater range of options among the soups, although, once again, the  selection sticks to the basics. The sour-hot soup is pungent, somewhat hot and  respectable, while the very Cantonese Imperial soup includes a more than  generous amount of minced shrimp among the water chestnuts and vegetables  stirred into an egg white-thickened broth.  </P> <P> The selection of standard entrees again seems to take the point of view that  guests have relatively narrow tastes. There are sweet-sour dishes in the  expected manifestations (chicken, pork and shrimp); moo shu beef and pork;  assorted kung pao offerings and, in an interesting return to the Chinese menus  of other days, a foo young made with barbecued pork.  </P> <P> Among the poultry choices is a good sliced chicken with vegetables that, while  mild, also is delicate, an important distinction. Also on the positive side is  the lengthy list of seafood dishes, which extends beyond the usual shrimp with  cashews to Mandarin-style lobster and the whole fish of the day, served  sweet-and-sour or braised in hot sauce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MANDARIN TOWER 625 Encinitas Blvd.  </P> <P> Encinitas  </P> <P> Calls: 942-1959  </P> <P> Hours: Lunch weekdays, dinner nightly  </P> <P> Cost: Entrees $5 to $15.95. Dinner for two, with a glass of wine each, tax and  tip, about $25 to $40  </P></p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: A Collier's Friday Night - Theatre DH Lawrence was a very good playwright. A Collier's Friday Night was written around 1906 when Lawrence was 21 and, in the author's own words, 'before I'd done almost anything.' He described it as 'most horribly green'. The text was not published until 1934 and according to the record books, which may of course be wrong, the piece went unproduced until 1965 when it was performed without decor at the Royal Court. The Court put on a season of Lawrence plays, including Friday Night, three years later. The edition of the play in my local library had not been taken out since August 1975. John Dove, the director at the Hampstead Theatre, is something of a specialist in Lawrence drama, and it shows. Every loving detail of the collier's house is there: the huge kettle on the hob, the home-baked bread, the lamps, the way of washing without baths. But it is not only the detail that scores. As a play, Friday Night is not remotely green; it is quite remarkably mature. One may ponder the date of writing. Around 1906 European theatre was at one of its all-time highs. Lawrence, the student, must have read Ibsen, Shaw, Wilde and the rest of them, even if he had not seen their plays. Friday Night is up with the best of that other contemporary writer, Harley Granville Barker. Some will enjoy the play for what it foreshadows of Lawrence's later novels, notably Sons and Lovers. It is closely autobiographical: educated son of a miner, but whose mother is much more middle class. There is also the mother's jealousy of the son's girl-friend. Yet the play stands it is own right. The nearest analogy currently on the London stage is Githa Sowerby's Rutherford &amp; Son, written in 1912 and showing at the Cottesloe. Both depend heavily on a mixture of social realism and feeling. Both are surprisingly sympathetic to the main male figure: superficially a tyrant, but not to be wholly condemned. In Rutherford &amp; Son the man is a factory-owner. In Friday Night he goes down the pit. Played by Edward Peel, he is a strong handsome figure, especially when the grime is off. One can see why his wife (the everlasting Barbara Jefford) fell for him in the first place. He is not a stereotype; as he points out, he has allowed his son a college education, despite the son's resentment of his father's manners. Moreover, practically all the members of the family have moments of brutality resembling their father's. This is a family study. It is not all quarrelling. There is a lovely line when the son reads in the Derby newspaper of the death of Swinburne and a superb vignette as the miners discover the workings of the newly invented fountain pen: 'It works just like a pump'. Indeed Dove's triumph as director lies in not overdoing the intensity. Ernest, the earnest son, is played by Dominic Rowan who rightly lets the role develop as the play goes on. He may be educated, but he is not tolerant. The design by Robert Jones and the lighting by Mark Henderson belong to the top of the first division in any theatre. Hampstead Theatre (071) 722 9301</p>

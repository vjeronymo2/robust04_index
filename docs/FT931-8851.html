			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: NZ Telecom plans to shed 5,000 jobs TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand yesterday reported a 9.7 per cent improvement in third quarter net profit to NZDollars 121m (USDollars 65m) and announced a redundancy and restructuring programme aimed at shedding about 5,000 jobs. Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive, said that Telecom, which is 68.2 per cent owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US, was on target to report improved earnings for the full year, despite redundancy costs of NZDollars 350m. The redundancy costs, which will be treated as an abnormal item, are part of a restructuring over the next four years that will cut staff numbers from 12,600 to 7,500. Net earnings for the nine months ended December, were 5.3 per cent higher at NZDollars 305.8m. For the whole of last year Telecom's net profits totalled NZDollars 402.3m. Mr Deane said that the restructuring was designed to rationalise the company's structure by combining its four operating companies into one. It would also substantially improve service quality and reduce operating costs.</p>

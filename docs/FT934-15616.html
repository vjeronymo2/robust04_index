			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: Strauss and Stravinsky - Concert It was the small size of its audiences that originally prompted the BBC Symphony Orchestra to shift some of its South Bank concerts into the smaller Queen Elizabeth Hall. Having made the move, it has evidently decided to turn economic necessity into musical virtue. Although the orchestra's Strauss and Stravinsky series mostly consists of full-scale works being played in the Royal Festival Hall, Friday's concert was in the QEH and stripped the BBCSO down to chamber-orchestra proportions. The programme explained in some detail how the two composers of this series have nothing in common - an uncontroversial opinion, except that this particular evening showed them heading down very much the same retrospective path. All the music was signposted 'neo-classical'. Richard Strauss's Suite from Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme evokes the world of Beaumarchais with minuets, the once enfant terrible of a composer prancing round in a perfumed wig. Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks draws its style from Bach and Pulcinella its material from Pergolesi. It would be interesting to create a series examining why these forward-looking composers preferred to look back in middle life. A few years ago it would have been difficult to imagine the members of the BBCSO exposing themselves to music-making on a small scale with any confidence of success, but these days the orchestra has no reason to be afraid. The playing of a dozen or so soloists in Dumbarton Oaks was trim, accurate, exactly rhythmical, down to the precise double-dotting of the horns. We know from his Strauss in the opera-house (and Daphne at the start of this series) that Andrew Davis is able to sort out the complex textures of a Straussian orchestral score with lucidity. His performance of the Suite from Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme was tightly controlled, but also characterful, witty, cool-headed and chaste where others might surrender to its lusher moments. As to the Pulcinella, it could not be compared with Simon Rattle's recent performance at the Proms, which in retrospect was effortful and sluggardly (though he did have more players weighing the music down). Davis and his chamber-sized BBCSO had shed excess fat and emerged slimmer, fitter, and scintillating in the way one always imagined this music should be. Lynne Dawson, John Graham-Hall and David Wilson-Johnson made a fine trio of vocal soloists. Unqualified delight. Final Strauss and Stravinsky concert at the Royal Festival Hall on October 12</p>

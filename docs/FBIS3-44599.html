Known for his strategic talent and diplomatic acumen, Chen  was also popular as a poet and "go" player.    Collected in the three-volume works are 453 poems (including  traditional Chinese Ci) in chronological order -- from the prime  of his life to the revolutionary times and the construction  period of New China.    Chen Haosu, the eldest son of Chen who compiled the books,  said that it was his father's long-cherished wish to publish a  collection of poems to depict his 50-year revolutionary career.    Chen Yi was among the ten soldiers who received the highest  military ranks after the founding of the People's Republic of  China in 1949. Later he became the second foreign minister of  New China after Premier Zhou Enlai.    He died on January 6, 1972.</p>

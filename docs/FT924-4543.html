			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Panic to challenge Milosevic in election YUGOSLAV Prime Minister Milan Panic said yesterday he would stand in the Serbian presidential elections on December 20 and launched his campaign with a scathing attack on his rival, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. 'Under Milosevic we have become isolated internationally and have become the victim of crippling sanctions,' he said. 'War rages out of control and yet Milosevic has done nothing.' Mr Panic faces an immediate challenge on Saturday when Serbia's electoral committee is due to rule whether the Belgrade-born US businessman is eligible to run. Belgrade radio, controlled by Mr Milosevic, said Mr Panic might not qualify as he could not provide proof of one year's residence in Serbia. Mr Panic, who returned to Serbia from California in the summer, dismissed this. This latest attempt to block Mr Panic reflects nervousness among Serbia's ruling Socialists that he could beat Mr Milosevic at the polls. Named prime minister in July, Mr Panic has won popularity for promising to save Serbia. A western diplomat called his decision to run 'courageous', saying he was the only candidate who could beat Mr Milosevic. Meanwhile in Bosnia yesterday the UN suspended the Sarajevo airlift after a US relief plane was hit by small-arms fire. In Brussels, Nato said it planned to tighten an oil and trade embargo on Yugoslavia by despatching warships to the coast of neighbouring Albania. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, criticised the WEU and Nato for sending separate naval task forces to enforce the embargo. He told the WEU assembly in Paris the two overlapping forces were failing to achieve results.</p>

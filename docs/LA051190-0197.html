			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: RANDOM HOUSE SNAGS COLLINS FOR $4 MILLION  </P> <P> "EVEN WHEN you win the rat race, you're still a rat," opined Joan Collins. Now  Joan has left Simon &amp; Schuster after writing her first novel, "Prime Time,"  for them, and she turns up -- courtesy of her agent, Irving (Swifty) Lazar --  at Random House with a new contract for $4 million for two new works of  fiction.  </P> <P> And to think I had to hear about this elsewhere, call Swifty and dig it out of  him! (I suppose he was saving it for one of the Mica and Ahmet Ertegun dinner  parties.)  </P> <P> When I commented, "How incredible!" Swifty was indignant: "Why? She's bloody  good!" OK, hooray for Joan, who has proved that there is life after Warren  Beatty, after Tony Newley, after Peter Holm, after "Land of the Pharaohs,"  after "Empire of the Ants" and after TV's "Dynasty."  </P> <P> You are no rat to your fans, Joanie. You are a beautiful, let's say  "Spectacular," kitty-kat.  </P> <P> TEXANS ARE going to lead the June 6, Eisenhower Centennial D-Day Salute in New  York City, aboard the aircraft carrier "Intrepid." Zach Fisher, the skipper of  the "Intrepid's Museum of Patriotism," has invited the PR king, Tex McCrary, to  round up a herd of Texans to lead this event. It takes place just three days  after President Bush's summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Tex has already invited the President to come to this party, along with the  four other living U.S. ex-Presidents -- Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald R.  Ford and Richard M. Nixon. Tex has reminded each of them that this will be an  historic occasion, just right for a unique photograph of the five together.  (And I might add, if all five don't accept, then the next time most of them  meet will most likely, sadly, be at the funeral of one of them.)  </P></p>

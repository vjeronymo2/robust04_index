			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Greece clears the path for telecoms sale THE Greek parliament yesterday passed a controversial bill clearing the way for the partial sale of OTE, the state-owned telecoms monopoly, the government's most ambitious privatisation project, Reuter reports from Athens. The bill was approved by 51 votes to 47 after weeks of strife within the ruling conservative party and a storm of protest from opposition parties and trade unions. The government has a single-seat majority in parliament and National Economy Minister Stephanos Manos was forced to make last-minute changes in the bill to persuade dissidents in the conservative camp not to vote it down. The bill allows the sale of 35 per cent of OTE's shares and its management to an international operator. Another 10 per cent will be floated on the Athens bourse and 4 per cent will be offered free to company employees and pensioners. The state will control the remaining 51 per cent. Objections focused mainly on the decision to grant management rights to a core investor. The opposition Socialist party accused the government of selling off national wealth. To soften opposition within his own ranks, Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis had said the government would control telephone charges and the state will hold a 6-5 majority on OTE's board of directors. Mr Manos went further yesterday, giving the board more power to decide major policy. The General Confederation of Greek Workers, the country's biggest union with almost 1m members, held a 24-hour strike yesterday protesting against OTE's sale. The strike closed public banks and offices and created problems in transport, telecommunications, the power supply and the mail. Six international companies have expressed interest in winning the management stake in OTE. They are Japan's NTT, France Telecom, American GTE, Spanish Telefonica, Italy's Stet and Korea Telecom. Kerin Hope in Athens adds: The quality of OTE's international service has deteriorated recently as the union representing OTE workers stepped up its campaign against the proposed sale. Given the scope for improvement in Greek telecommunications, it is hard to see why anyone should oppose the introduction of new management. The government says the foreign buyer would undertake to invest at least Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.75bn) in the network over the next decade. According to an EC-funded study carried out by consultants from Coopers and Lybrand, the international accountants, OTE's current policy of piecemeal replacement of switching and transmission equipment is 'gradually killing' the country's overloaded telephone system. With more than 800,000 applications for telephone lines outstanding, a quarter of them in Athens, the waiting period for a new connection can be as long as five years. The study also described OTE's maintenance policy as 'reactive fire-fighting'.</p>

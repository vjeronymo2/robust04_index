			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Lloyd's Names threaten to adjourn crucial meeting LEADERS OF loss-making Lloyd's Names are threatening to adjourn a crucial meeting on Wednesday in order to press the market's council - or governing body - to settle legal disputes at the insurance market. Leaders of the loss-makers have been collecting proxy votes from their members, who are among 31,607 Names eligible to vote at a meeting called by Lloyd's to approve the introduction of corporate capital. They believe they may be able to defeat the reform at Wednesday's extraordinary meeting. But they fear that voting down the corporate capital proposals would throw the market into chaos, end hopes of attracting new investment and destroy the chances of an out-of-court settlement. It is understood that the adjournment proposal, which is advocated by at least two of the 37 Lloyd's Names action groups' leaders, will be discussed at a meeting on Monday of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which represents the action groups.</p>

This was also noted by the UN Security Council last  Thursday [3 February]. It threatened measures against Croatia,  if these troops are not withdrawn. This withdrawal must take  place.    It is not only the Serbs who have violated the cease-fire  the  parties to the conflict promised the European Union [EU] foreign  ministers. Bosnian troops, too, have initiated a major  offensive against Croat towns in central Bosnia. The senseless  killing, misery, suffering, and the driving away of people has  to stop. Bosnian Muslims and Croats need each other.    The UN Security Council has given Croatia a period of two  weeks. It then intends to decide on measures against Croatia,  which might also entail the danger of further streams of  refugees to Germany, a radicalization, and endangering  humanitarian aid. Therefore, we must make good use of the time.  Therefore, at next Monday's meeting of the 12 EU foreign  ministers, I will advocate that we Europeans, in close  cooperation with Croats and Muslims, seek an understanding that  restores order to the deeply disturbed Croat-Muslim relations.  This is the key issue.</p>

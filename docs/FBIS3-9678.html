He said that -- instead of a central committee of the party --  a War Presidency was appointed at the first war convention of  the party held last year. That decision was interpreted in  different ways, making it necessary to call another convention.  The decision to do this was completely legal and in accordance  with the party's statute. The dilemmas about whether the Party  Presidency had the right to call this convention had caused a  political rift in the party.    Adil Zulfikarpasic stated that I betrayed the party,  Filipovic stressed, adding: Those who believe that my  involvement in the state delegation and my acceptance of the  ambassadorial post in Switzerland are acts of betrayal, they are  opposed to the independence and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  After all, Filipovic added, the public is aware that my  involvement in the state delegation prevented the signing of the  partition of Bosnia. Therefore, to attack such a man means to be  committed to a policy opposed to this.    The reporters reminded Filipovic that he had stated at the  party convention that Zulfikarpasic in no way financed the LBO  during the war, and that he had called in April 1992 on the  members of the party to overthrow Alija Izetbegovic. The  reporters were interested in why those facts were not made  public before. Filipovic said that he did not want [words  indistinct] Zulfikarpasic to give up on Bosnia, since he was  still hoping that the latter would be able to offer some kind of  help. Filipovic also said that it was not true that  Zulfikarpasic had been trying to obtain weapons for the defense  of the country, as he had been telling foreign and some domestic  media. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and Government are  acquainted with this fact.    Finally, in confirmation of Filipovic's statements, Salih  Foco, newly elected deputy chairman of the LBO, added that the  LBO committees in Tuzla and Zenica had been disbanded because of  inconsistencies concerning the implementation of party policy  and at the insistence of some members of the regional committees.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (6): Fortunes at a watershed - Credit Lyonnais It was with some trepidation that Credit Lyonnais, the great bank of Lyon, decided to move its headquarters to Paris in 1878. The bank's officials were so nervous about the move that they bought a building on Boulevard des Italiens which - if the worst came to the worst - could easily be converted into a department store. Credit Lyonnais is still in the same building. Despite the move to Paris, it remains a force back in its own home town. Le Lyonnais not only dominates banking and property in the Rhone region but is also an overweening physical presence in Lyon itself: its tall tower looms over the city's skyline. The great bank of Lyon has reached a watershed in its fortunes that could prove as decisive as the move to Paris over 100 years ago. It has just emerged from a period of frenetic expansion under Jean Yves Haberer's chairmanship (1988 to 1993), which added to its domestic interests and extended its retail banking network across Europe, but also burdened the group with huge provisions on sour corporate loans and dud investments. Credit Lyonnais fell into the red for the third time in its history in 1992, with a net deficit of FFr1.05bn - and made an even heavier loss last year. Its performance in 1993 was so poor that its capital ratio fell below the minimum legal level of 8 per cent, prompting Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who replaced Mr Haberer as chairman last autumn, to call on the French government to rescue the bank with a recapitalisation package. The government had no choice but to agree. After all, it could scarcely afford to countenance a Gallic version of the Banesto collapse which is still sending shock waves through the Spanish banking scene. Another consideration was the knowledge that it would never be able to privatise Credit Lyonnais if the balance sheet remained in such a fragile state. Details of the recapitalisation package have just been released. The government plans to give Credit Lyonnais a cash injection of FFr3.5bn; FFr1.4bn will come from other shareholders, and there will be a float-off transfer of FFr40bn of loans to a new company, with FFr18.4bn of the total loans to be guaranteed by the state. Analysts are confident that these measures should be sufficient to stabilise Credit Lyonnais in the short term. It is now up to Mr Peyrelevade to take further steps to secure its long term position and to prepare the bank for its eventual privatisation. One option is to raise capital through asset sales. Mr Peyrelevade began, earlier this year, by selling a 30 per cent stake in the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group for FFr1bn. Last month he announced plans to sell off another FFr20bn of assets over the next two years, which will involve disposing of a large chunk of its FFr55bn investment portfolio. This includes sizeable stakes in a number of private sector companies, such as the Bouygues construction company and Navigation Mixte industrial group, as well as holdings in other state-controlled concerns. There is also significant scope for improving Credit Lyonnais's financial performance through internal measures. Credit Lyonnais, like other French banks, has relatively high staffing costs in comparison with its European competitors - thanks to France's traditionally high labour costs and the legacy of the state's influence over the banking business. Despite recent reforms, French labour law is still too strict to permit dramatic cuts in employment. Moreover, Credit Lyonnais's own staff have demonstrated, through their participation in recent industry-wide strikes, that they would resist such initiatives. Yet analysts are convinced that it should be able to achieve some improvement. Credit Lyonnais also seems set to benefit from an upturn in the banking market. France's banks, like every other area of the economy, have been badly affected by the recession. One problem has been the rise in provisions as a result of the steep increase in business failures and sharp fall in property values. But the banks have also been hit by weak demand for credit; static for the past two years, for the first time since the early 1940s. These recessionary pressures are now easing. The slow but steady reductions in French interest rates should soon start to stimulate demand for credit from consumers and the corporate sector. Residential property is already showing signs of recovery and the commercial sector has stabilised, thereby alleviating the pressure on provisioning, although the rate of business failures is still alarmingly high. Mr Peyrelevade's hopes for recovery should be buoyed up by the favourable changes in the banking market, providing Credit Lyonnais can avoid a repetition of the big corporate hits which haunted Mr Haberer's final years. The write-offs on its loans to corporate horror stories such as the late Robert Maxwell's media empire and Olympia &amp; York, the collapsed Canadian property group, have cast a dark cloud over Credit Lyonnais in the early 1990s. The big corporate hits have eased over the past year or so, although Credit Lyonnais is exposed to EuroDisney, the troubled leisure group, and is now engulfed in a new blaze of adverse publicity over its involvement with Sasea, the failed Swiss holding company. Sasea went bust two years ago, but since the start of this year Credit Lyonnais has found itself dragged into the court case over its receivership because of the Swiss judge's attempts to indict Mr Haberer and Mr Francois Gille, who is still an employee. Credit Lyonnais has already written off all but FFr500m of its FFr4.7bn exposure to Sasea. and it seems highly unlikely that Mr Haberer and Mr Gille will ever be indicted.</p>

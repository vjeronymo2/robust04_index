			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Germany to shun bombing raids GERMANY will not take part in any Nato-backed selective bombing in the former Yugoslavia because of constitutional constraints and its legacy in the Balkans in the second world war, the Foreign Ministry said yesterday. Although the constitutional court last week allowed German-manned Awacs aircraft to help impose a United Nations no-fly zone over Bosnia, the ministry stressed this was a 'one-off' arrangement. 'We fully understand the emotion and engagement of David Owen facing these terrible pictures of the Serb offensive in Srebrenica. We have lost any belief in the Serbs' will to find an honest and peaceful compromise,' said Mr Hanns Schumacher of the Foreign Ministry. 'The next step can only be the tightening of the sanctions, although the idea for selective bombing has been proposed before.' 'As regards military steps by Germany in the former Yugoslavia, everybody knows (about) our constitution and our historical burden. We do not want to participate in a public debate about our participation.' Germany's involvement in military activities outside the Nato area is constrained by the interpretation of the constitution. Even if the constitution was amended to state specifically Germany's military role in the post-cold war era, Mr Schumacher said, 'there is a clear majority' in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, against involving German solders in Yugoslavia. A Nazi-backed regime was set up in Croatia during the second world war.</p>

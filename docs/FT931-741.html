			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: The pitfalls of peering into the future 'THE result of leaving the European exchange rate mechanism, combined with large cuts in interest rates, would be a fall in the pound probably unprecedented in the last 40 years. . . And quite soon interest rates would have to go back up again - to much higher levels than they are today.' - Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, July 10 1992. RECENT events in the gilts market have underlined the pitfalls of peering into the future. Not only have short-term interest rates fallen since Britain was forced to leave the ERM last September, but the same trend has been apparent for long-dated gilts which are more important in determining long-term borrowing conditions. The events of the past six months illustrate that the economic theory behind the chancellor's speech to the European Policy Forum last July was extremely flimsy. They also indicate the degree to which the environment for international bond markets has improved, due to slow growth and generally weak inflationary pressures in many parts of the developed world. Even though last week yields for most classes of gilts moved up ahead of this week's biggest-ever gilt auction, the market has performed far better in recent months than most people in the Treasury and the Bank of England appear to have expected last autumn. Mr Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, spelt out in a speech last week how official thinking has shifted. 'Departure from the ERM led to sharply lower expected interest rates in the short run. 'By contrast, rates in the long run were expected to be higher than before, suggesting that that there was some loss of counter-inflationary credibility from our (ERM) exit. But this loss was small, and since then there appears to have been some restoration of long-run credibility.' Since the ERM exit, bank base rates have come down from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. Ten-year gilt yields have dropped from 9.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent, while yields for 25-year bonds have moved from 8.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Over the same period, the difference between yields for 10-year gilts compared with 10-year German government bonds has come down from about 1.5 percentage points to about 1.1. This indicates international investors have reduced the extra 'risk premium' they demand for holding UK securities as opposed to German ones. The move to lower gilt yields has partly reflected the shift in this direction for virtually all the main bond markets since the autumn. It also underlines reduced worries about price pressures in the UK economy over the next year or so, together with only muted concern about the level of gilt issues needed to finance the growing public sector borrowing requirement. Meanwhile, buying pressure for gilts has been helped by the more resilient tone to sterling in recent weeks. The pound gained 1 pfennig on Friday to close against the D-Mark at DM2.43, some 10 pfennigs up from its DM2.335 level at the beginning of the month. Over the next few months, many bond specialists expect gilt prices to fall with a consequent rise in yields, as the implications of the expected Pounds 50bn PSBR in the financial year beginning next week sink in. Such thinking was a factor behind the 15 basis point increase in yields at the long end of the gilt market last week, with attention focusing on the Pounds 3bn auction next Wednesday of a new class of 20-year stock - the 8 per cent bond due in 2013. News of the amount of stock due to be auctioned by the Bank led to some technical switching down the yield curve, leading to a price fall on the week of about 2 points as measured by the June gilt future. The reduction in prices probably augurs well for the success of the auction  -the first in a series due roughly once a month over the coming year - as it increases the probability that foreign and domestic buyers will want to buy gilts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fokker Cuts Back Primarily on </F> Production"]    [Text] Amsterdam -- Fokker intends to cut its production  capability by 1,400 jobs. Approximately 500 jobs will disappear  at the level of administrative staff and management.    The total staff cuts affecting 1,900 jobs are necessary  because the company's aircraft production is being reduced from  56 to 40 machines. The measure is a result of the lingering,  worldwide recession in the aviation sector.    According to the company's acting CEO [chief executive  officer], R.J. van Duinen, the manufacturer probably will have  to make even deeper cuts next year if the current rate of  production is maintained. "Fokker is doing relatively well,  because our market share is growing. However, the self-same  market has almost totally collapsed," said van Duinen, in an  attempt to explain the measures.    Yesterday morning the staff reacted indignantly, and yet  stoically, to the announcement that further rationalization is  in the pipeline. "First of all we want to see what Fokker's  restructuring plan is based on, and how the management intends  to limit the number of forced job losses," said P. van Bers and  G. van den Heuvel, of the trade unions FNV [Netherlands Trade  Unions Federation] and CNV [National Federation of Christian  Workers]. G. Melchers, the secretary of the COR [Central  Enterprise Council], reacted with shock: "We knew that  something was in the cards, but we had not counted on such a  high number."    According to the financial expert on the board of directors,  R.F. Hendriksen, the company anticipates a turnaround that will  drag it out of the red occurring only in 1996. However, this is  by no means certain, he wisely let it be known.  <H5>  Development </H5>   According to van Duinen, the future for Fokker as a  "self-creating aircraft industry" is not in danger. "The  restructuring will have a tremendous draining effect. However,  we shall be proceeding at full speed with product developments  -- like the new Fokker 70 -- that we have already set in motion.  Our excellent products have a future. That is why we are doing  better than our competitors. However, the fact remains that,  for a company of this size, we are not making enough sales."</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Brown envelopes seal future of commercial TV THE BROWN envelopes that will determine the fate of the UK's 16 commercial television companies will be opened next Thursday. The envelopes will contain bids that might commit applicants to paying the government a total of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn for a 10-year commercial broadcasting licence from the beginning of 1993. There are expected to be 35 to 40. The ceremonial opening of the bids by the Independent Television Commission's chairman, deputy chairman, chief executive and secretary is part of the process of validating information submitted by applicants. Bids will be checked, then locked in a safe. So far, the gaze of the television industry has fixed on one date and time - noon on Wednesday, May 15, the deadline for bids. Less attention has been given to what happens next, how the commission will handle the mountain of paperwork that will be delivered on Wednesday morning and how the commission will make decisions. A careful procedure will tend to place a greater emphasis on highest bids than has been widely realised before. Some ministers have backtracked in private on the wisdom of the Broadcasting Act's provision that each licence will go to the highest bidder that reaches a quality threshold, unless there are exceptional circumstances such as an underbidder offering exceptionally high programme quality. The commission is clear on the issue. Whatever ministers say, it has to implement the law to the letter if it is to avoid having its decisions challenged in the High Court. Until recently there was a feeling in the independent television industry that somehow deals could be done to prevent too many ITV companies losing their franchises. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, appeared to encourage that view when he was broadcasting minister by suggesting that continuity of the network might be a reason for setting aside a highest bid under the exceptional-circumstances clause. The commission believes 'continuity' cannot be legally defined. It will decide, franchise area by franchise area, without considering what effect those decisions are having on the overall shape of the ITV network. Mr David Glencross, the ITC's chief executive, said: 'What we are really saying is that the quality threshold is similar to what has already been achieved and that those who get over it will be able to provide a service at least as good as people get now.' The commission believes that the demands on applicants and the costs involved in mounting a bid for a large region - up to Pounds 2m - have effectively weeded out frivolous bids. Next Thursday, a licence working group under the chairmanship of Mr Michael Redley, the commission's official in charge of licensing, will begin work on the applications to draw up a list of bidders that pass the quality threshold. The working group will draw on the financial, regional and programming expertise of the commission's officials. Each of the eight members of the commission - excluding the chairman and deputy chairman - will oversee two of the 16 contests. The officials will submit recommendations and briefing papers to the commission, which has 10 members, within two or three months for the final decision on which applicants will make it to the last bidding round. Only then will the cash bids be brought out of the safe. When a winner is established in each area, commission members will consider whether there are exceptional circumstances that would overturn the verdict of the brown envelopes. If exceptional circumstances are being considered, all the companies involved will be invited to the commission for a private hearing. The final stage before the winners are announced, probably by the end of October, will be to look at the priorities of the applicants.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Peter Burian, charge d'affaires in </F> Washington, by TA SR reporter Otakar Korinek, in Washington;  date not given: "The Basis for Development of Relations With the  United States"]    [Text] "In 1993, a sufficient basis for the functioning of  normal bilateral relations between the United States and  Slovakia was established. This process was exceptionally  dynamic and smooth. From this point of view, the establishment  of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Slovak  Republic was very important, and so was the fact that Slovakia,  as one of the successor states, took over treaties and  obligations between the former CSFR and the United States,"  Peter Burian, charge d'affaires in Washington, told a TA SR  reporter.    In 1994, the work of the ambassador will be to strengthen  economic and commercial contacts. The interest of U.S. firms,  such as Westinghouse and others, in investing in Slovakia is a  positive factor. Moreover, we succeeded in establishing  continuous working contracts with the International Monetary  Fund and the World Bank. The conclusion of the treaty on  avoiding double taxation between the United States and Slovakia  was an important factor in the development of our trading  contacts. Burian described as a success of our diplomacy the  establishment of the conditions for Slovakia's being taken off  the list of countries to which the United States does not export  advanced technology (COCOM). According to Burian, the final  decision is expected in the days to come.    "In the political sphere, we are going to invite a high U.S.  official to Slovakia. There are many occasions for it, such as  the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising," Burian  said. He stressed that the basis for active relations was  established in 1993 after the visit of the president, the prime  minister, the National Council chairman, and other ministers and  Slovak officials to the United States.    The work of the ambassador and pushing for the Slovak  Republic's interests, in general, was complicated, to a certain  extent, by the negative publicity about development in the  Slovak Republic. Some sectors are underestimating the importance  and the tasks of the embassy. They should address the embassy as  the primary source of information and consult it about the  preparation of any action having an impact on bilateral  contacts. Otherwise, the embassy has to act as a fire brigade.  Burian sees certain possibilities in cooperation with the  community of Slovak countrymen. The activity of the World  Congress of Slovaks, headed by a new leadership, is quite a  pleasant thing. The premises for the embassy are a problem that  still has not been sorted out. "In Washington, there is an  unwritten law regarding prestigious matters. One of them is the  fact that the flag of a state should be fixed in a certain place  on the building. Even this helps build respect for one state or  another in the U.S. capital." Burian described as very  important the fact that, in January, the Slovak ambassador will  arrive in the United States.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Arts: Solo performers - New York Theatre Two solo performers have been giving audiences a look at contemporary life in productions playing in New York this summer. With Fires in the Mirror Anna Deavere Smith holds the glass to the 1991 Brooklyn race riots showing the audience its own reflection; violence in our cities, she reminds us, is everyone's problem. David Drake's The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me is both a window onto gay life and a crystal ball that lets us picture a world beyond AIDS. Fires in the Mirror just finished a sell-out run at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public Theater. Smith will perform the piece in Boston and San Francisco this autumn, and at London's Royal Court Theatre next February, and is creating a similar piece about the recent Los Angeles riots for that city's Mark Taper Forum. She has become so well known that she has been given that most American accolade: she is posing for a Gap poster. For Fires in the Mirror Smith interviewed dozens of people about the events of August, 1991, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in which blacks and Jews turned against each other in several days of violence after a Hasidic motorcade ran over and killed a 7-year-old black boy. She edited 29 of the interviews into vignettes, and, as directed by Christopher Ashley, performs them using minimal props and costumes to suggest the speakers and their milieux. One minute, she is the spread-legged, head-cocking Reverend Al Sharpton exuding bravado; the next, she is the leather-jacketed University of Santa Cruz professor Angela Davis spouting theory, and the next she's the spangled-sweatered Jewish matron Roz Malamud pleading for peace. Smith is a skilled actress who inhabits her characters with ease and assuredness. The range and flexibility of her voice is particularly impressive; she switches between regional and cultural accents as deftly as she swaps a Hasid's fedora for a rapper's kinte cloth cap. The effectiveness of Fires in the Mirror lies in her skill as a collagist. Though she performs her subjects' words without her own verbal commentary, her message comes through in her choice and ordering of material and in the cumulative effect of so many takes on the same events. Far from placing blame in the Crown Heights case, Smith powerfully instructs that right or wrong is not the point. Her work communicates the need for mutual understanding more effectively than any political harangue. In The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me, playing at the Perry Street Theatre, David Drake reveals and revels in twentysomething urban gay life. That Drake's series of vignettes is laced through with the language of AIDS activism - 'The truth will set you free,' he says, 'but first it will piss you off' - brings home where much of his community's energies lie. For Drake, as he explains in his first vignette, Larry Kramer's ground-breaking 1985 drama The Normal Heart, kissed him and thousands of others awake to the reality of the AIDS epidemic and called them to political action to end the crisis. At times in The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me one senses the bounds of Drake's imagination and his experience. In the post-Spalding Gray profusion of autobiographical solo performance, one longs for formal innovation, for the see-what-I'm-doing postmodern wink, but Drake remains safely and disappointingly within his work's artifice. His autobiographical passages come off as wide-eyed and simple as Drake's persona in them. The vignettes in which he plays himself at eight years old are syrupy sweet. But when Drake investigates an aspect of gay life by embodying several characters and points of view, the results are stunning, particularly his part-send-up, part-expose of gay night life and the personal ads, '12' Single'. As directed by Chuck Brown against Steve Sandberg's throbbing score, '12' Single' is a prose-poem of intoxicating theatricality in which Drake reveals both the elation and the self-destructiveness of the club scene. Drake's final vignette is a simple fantasy and his coup de theatre. On New Year's Eve, 1999, the happy, healthy Drake natters to us, his party guests, about the last decade. Barbra just directed her son in a homosexual remake of The Way We Were, Drake's parents have worn out their home video of his legal domestic partnership ceremony, and a cure for AIDS was found years ago. 'It's better here,' says Drake, breaking the fourth wall for the first time, 'you'll see.' All too seldom in the theatre do we look beyond today to a better time; that Drake allows us to do so is an act of generosity that makes great theatre.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: A glimpse of the golden age at the Biblioteque-Musee - In Paris Ronald Crichton visits the refurbished Palais Garnier and a performance of Elektra The pavilion forming the West wing of the old Opera, the Palais Garnier, was intended as a ceremonial entrance for Napoleon and Eugenie, who had survived an attempted assassination some years earlier outside the previous opera house in the rue Le Peletier. By the time Garnier's building was ready the Second Empire had collapsed and the former Emperor had died in exile at Chislehurst. For more than a century the pavilion has housed a fabulous collection devoted to opera and the dance, the property of the Biblioteque Nationale, consulted by writers and students many of whom, as I used to, may have felt a little overawed by the surroundings - at once tradition-haunted and fusty. There were temporary exhibitions which could be visited from the auditorium during intervals. The one mounted for Robert le diable added a good deal to the effect of that opera's revival a few years ago. Recently the Ministry of Culture, the Biblioteque Nationale, the Opera, Louis Vuitton and AROP combined (in perfect harmony, it appears - finished on time, budget not exceeded) to redesign and refurbish that part of the huge building. The result is officially called 'Biblioteque-Musee de l'Opera'. In spite of the joint title, library and museum are now separated by an isophonic partition: seekers after truth are shielded from mere visitors wandering round the portraits, drawings, caricatures, models and posters. The new entrance is inside the main building, not as before in the rue Scribe. The monumental staircase which led from the side entrance is incorporated into the museum itself for temporary exhibitions. The noble proportions and bare walls, which must disconcert those who associated Garnier's architecture with rampageous gilt-encrusted decoration, would still look austere even if the imperial eagles and initials had been sculpted on them as planned. The new vitrines and furniture are the work of Richard Peduzzi, Cherau's designer for the Paris Lulu and for the 1978 Ring at Bayreuth. (Open everyday except Sundays, 10-4.30.) The special exhibition now showing, in support of the Picasso ballet programme described last Wednesday by Clement Crisp, is The Ballets Russes at the Opera. Not all Diaghilev's scandals and successes happened here - the Chatelet and the Champs-Elysees were also much involved. There is still plenty to show, from the time of the Boris Godunov of 1908 which started the whole thing off, up to Diaghilev's death in 1929. Many of the objects have been seen at loan exhibitions elsewhere and still more are familiar from reproductions, yet their impact remains as fresh as ever - the strength of invention, the range and versatility, the constant ability to use modern art in a theatrical context, from Golovin, Bakst and Benois up to Picasso, Matisse and Chelitchev. The wealth has been mined by succeeding generations but it is hard to throw off a feeling of decline. After these golden-age glimpses the Elektra shared with Los Angeles (where Max Loppert reviewed it) and Houston, now at the Bastille, looks a rather sad affair in John Bury's rubbly, ugly-ugly and, worse, uninteresting set. One wondered why it was thought worth while to bring half way across the world a production (originally by David Pountney, staged for Paris by Clare West) now chiefly remarkable for its failure to strike more than intermittent sparks from some powerful singers. In the title-role Gabriele Schaut, one felt, was poised for a fine performance which never quite materialised. Her top notes, cutting but not strident, winged out as if they would shoot across Paris and shake the Eiffel Tower. Rapid phrases were boxy and incomprehensible. Helga Dernesch's Clytemmestra, a potentially fascinating study of a thoroughbred gone disastrously wrong, did not project strongly enough in the unfriendly spaces. The Chrysothemis of Karen Huffstodt had vivid moments. In the brief role of Aegisthus Jean Dupouy was blessedly clear, but no Aegisthus can save an Elektra Under the Danish conductor Michael Schonwand the orchestra delivered thunderous climaxes and, as usual, some expert woodwind playing, with little of the genuine Straussian warmth. Acoustical problems in this theatre are not yet solved. Nothing so simple as the orchestra drowning the voices. The two in some way hard to define don't sit down together, with results unsatisfying and tiring to the ear. In fairness I report that a packed house loved it all. June Anderson having cancelled her solo recital at the Opera-Comique thorough illness, there was just time to get to the Champs-Elysees to hear another popular American star, Chris Merritt, give a whopping programme of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. This tenor's particular strength lies in the unusual way he combines technical agility with heroic vigour. The heroic side may be gaining the upper hand. Merritt looked like Siegfried and often sounds like him: I was ready for him to launch at any moment into the Forging Songs. He opened with an 'A te, O cara' from I puritani which wouldn't have disgraced Verdi's Manrico. Too beefy by half, but beef gradually gave way to rarer meats and operas with two Rossini arias written for the formidable Naples tenor Andrea Nozzari. Thomas Muraco dealt ably with the piano accompaniments.</p>

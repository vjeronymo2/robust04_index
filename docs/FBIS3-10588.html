The resolution proposed by the United States and cosponsored  by Nicaragua and El Salvador was approved by 24 votes in favor,  nine against and 20 abstentions.    Juana Silveira, deputy director of the International  Organizations Directorate of the Foreign Relations Ministry,  stated that "the vote on the U.S. proposal reflects an ever  increasing perception by underdeveloped nations with respect to  this issue"    Silveira believes the issue has been highly politicized by  Washington, and the U.S. Government's political intention is to  include it within the framework of the dispute it has had going  with Cuba for years.    According to official Cuban sources, the number of countries  that "resisted pressure and refused to vote in favor of the  resolution" increased this year in comparison to 1993.    "In failing to obtain half plus one favorable votes of the  nations gathered at the commission, and seeing its efforts to  obtain massive support from Latin America thwarted, the White  House saw its main hopes begin to vanish," Silveira pointed out.    Likewise, she stated that this year, contrary to 1993, the  proposal found less support among Asian, European, and Latin  American nations. It was not supported by African countries  either.    Local radio stations reported that in addition to the United  States, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile,  Cyprus, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy,  Japan, Mauritius, Holland, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea,  Romania, Great Britain, Russia, and Uruguay all voted in favor  of the resolution.    China, Guinea-Bissau, Libia, Sudan, Syria, India, Indonesia,  and Iran supported Cuba.    On the other hand, the nations that abstained included  Angola, Bangladesh, Barbados, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Ivory  Coast, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, Malawi, Mauritania,  Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Sri Lanka, Togo, Tunisia, and Venezuela.</p>

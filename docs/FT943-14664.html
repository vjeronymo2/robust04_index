			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: ITT takes effective control of Ciga ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, yesterday confirmed its effective control of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, when two ITT representatives were co-opted on to the seven-person board of the company. ITT also confirmed it had increased its stake in Ciga, to 20.3 per cent, and was continuing to buy shares in the market. The stake is held through its Sheraton International subsidiary. In New York, Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman and chief executive, said: 'I'm confident that they (the new ITT-appointed directors) will make an important contribution to Ciga's board, as the company moves through this important period of transition.' The new directors of Ciga are Mr Robert Cotter, president of ITT Sheraton Europe, and Mr Charles Goldman, a vice-president of ITT and the group's associate legal counsel. They replace Mr Michele Saponara, and Professor Gianguido Scalfi, two of the four directors nominated in February by the custodian appointed by an Italian court when Ciga ran into financial difficulties. The US company's control over Ciga became obvious at last week's shareholder meeting, when the former directors of Ciga were heavily criticised. However, control was only achieved after months of complex financial manoeuvring, and will be exercised under the supervision of Ciga's vociferous minority shareholders. The Italian stock exchange authorities have also yet to rule on whether ITT has to make a public offer for further shares in the group. Even yesterday, ITT could not declare a complete victory. A third director - Mr Pietro Guerra - was supposed to step down and be replaced by an ITT nominee. Mr Guerra is the representative of Fimpar, the Aga Khan's holding company which used to control Ciga. Yesterday, he decided not to resign, although he could step down later.</p>

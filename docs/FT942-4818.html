			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD fuels row on minimum pay The OECD's report on job creation saw each of the three main parties claiming support for its own strategy. First, Mr Major was joined by ministers saying the report endorsed their emphasis on deregulated and flexible markets. The prime minister said on LBC radio that it was 'a great setback for Labour that independent experts have looked at what they wish to do and said it is nonsense'. He added that Labour wanted to 'interrupt markets and try to regulate them, and the whole thrust of the report is in precisely the opposite direction'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the conclusions had exposed Labour's commitment to a minimum wage as a recipe for job destruction. But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, led an opposition counter-attack based on the OECD's call for flexible markets to be balanced by greater emphasis on education and training. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said the Tories had 'deliberately misrepresented' the report to hide the 'catastrophic economic failure' of deregulation. He said the Tories had created a 'low-skill, low-investment, low-pay economy' which could not protect against 'the onslaught of cheap competition from low-wage economies'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the report supported the government's argument that job creation depends on supply-side reforms focusing on flexible labour markets. 'These policies have helped us to get unemployment down by nearly 300,000 from its peak, while it has continued to rise elsewhere in Europe,' he said. Labour said the report left open the option of a 'responsible' minimum wage, even though it recommends abolition in countries which already have such legislation. The party pointed to a passage suggesting that the 'adverse employment effects' could be minimised by indexation of the minimum wage to prices rather than earnings. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the report was 'a direct criticism of the government's policies'. Mr Beith, who opposes a national minimum wage, called for decentralisation of wage bargaining and public transport and housing reforms to raise labour market flexibility.

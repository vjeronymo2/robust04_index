			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Personal View: Europe must show will to compete For an employee or manager 'competitiveness' - like 'restructuring' - can send nasty shivers down the spine. If you are neither, however, it is a subject that can make your eyes glaze over with boredom. Since most European politicians have not worked in - or managed - companies, this may explain why Europe's competitiveness has steadily declined over the past 20 years, with little being done about it. In fact, quite the opposite: laws have been introduced - and continue to be introduced - whose effect is to erode Europe's competitiveness even further. However, there are now some encouraging signs of change. The economic recession of the past three years has forced companies, national governments and the European Commission to look for the causes of decline and to prescribe remedies. As a result, 'competitiveness' is high on the political as well as the business agenda. Even so, there remain a number of causes for concern: As we emerge from recession, the political will to carry out the fundamental structural reforms necessary to restore competitiveness may evaporate. With the notable exception of Unice (Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe), nobody is talking about the size, the cost and the burden of the state in Europe's economies. Until that problem is recognised and tackled, we shall continue to suffer a heavy disadvantage vis-a-vis our main industrialised competitors. Europe's most ambitious strategic plan in favour of competitiveness - a genuine single market - is on the back burner, and, according to reports, no heavyweight commissioner volunteered to assume responsibility for making it work. The essential corollary of competitiveness - a strict competition policy - is being applied without the necessary rigour and determination. State aids continue to be authorised too easily by the Commission, in many cases to the detriment of just those companies that have undergone the painful process of restructuring. The legislative programmes of the German presidency and of the European Commission still include measures which, collectively, can do grave harm to European competitiveness - such as proposals for directives on a CO and energy tax, on withholding taxes on savings, on parental leave, on atypical work contracts, on the reversal of the burden of proof in discrimination cases, on the posting of workers. A further cause for concern are the measures missing from the legislative programme. For example, proposed directives designed to eliminate double taxation in the single market or introduce loss consolidation across national frontiers are stuck in the European Council and have made no progress for more than three years. Without these, the single market can only be a shadow of itself, just as it will be until we have a workable European company statute to simplify administration and accounting practices which currently must conform to 12 separate regimes. But if there is uncertainty about whether the Commission, the Council and national governments have it in them to reverse present trends, the talk, at least, is encouraging. The Delors white paper of December 1993 on growth, competitiveness and employment contained many parallels with Unice's own well-received studies of European competitiveness presented earlier this year to the Commission and to the EU summits in Brussels and Corfu. The Delors paper recognised the importance of competitiveness as the essential precondition for economic growth and job creation. In September the Directorate for Industrial Policy, under Commissioner Martin Bangemann, published an important paper on industrial competitiveness which unequivocally states that it will not be possible to restore growth and consolidate economic revival in Europe except through compet-itive, efficient and innovatory industry. The German presidency of the European Union has now appointed the Molitor Committee to identify what laws and regulations at both national and EU level should be simplified or abolished in the interests of efficiency and competitiveness. Firm action is still lacking, however. Meanwhile, capital is highly mobile. Investors will choose markets where prospects are best. Yet it is well within our power to restore European competitiveness. As President Woodrow Wilson said in 1912: 'While competition cannot be created by statutory enactment, it can, in large measure, be revived by changing the laws and forbidding the practices that killed it.'

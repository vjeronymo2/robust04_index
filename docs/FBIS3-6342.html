Both the CPV general secretary and the Thai prime  minister agreed that both countries will follow up agreements  reached in various fields so they will bear fruit effectively.    On the same occasion, the CPV general secretary expressed  his  admiration to His Majesty the King and members of the royal  family of Thailand. The CPV general secretary greatly admired  the royally initiated projects dealing with agriculture and  water resources and he wants to request Thai assistance on this  field. Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's  Office, granted an interview to this reporter on the event.    [Begin recording] [Aphisit] The Vietnamese party Central  Committee general secretary expressed his profound admiration  and gratitude to His Majesty the King, who once granted him an  audience. He also expressed his admiration to members of the  Thai Royal Family and royally initiated projects in various  fields. He noted that the relationship between the two  countries has significantly improved in the past few years. He  wanted the bilateral cooperation to further develop for  economic, social, and political interests in this region.    [Unidentified reporter] What royally initiated projects is  the CPV chairman [as heard] interested in and admires?    [Aphisit] He said he is greatly impressed by royally  initiated projects, especially in the field of agriculture  dealing with water. This is because Vietnam wants to improve  agricultural production efficiency. Despite success at a  certain level in economic reform, Vietnam still has problems due  to a lack of technology and improvement in production  efficiency, which is becoming more competitive. He specifically  admired the king's ability in agriculture and royally initiated  projects in various fields.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Aphisit] He mentioned Thailand providing assistance  through royally initiated projects to other countries, such as  Laos. Such forms of assistance are aimed to be models. Vietnam  has also requested such assistance from Thailand.    [Reporter] Does he want royally initiated projects to be in  his country?    [Aphisit] Right.    [Reporter] Did they discuss possible steps to be taken?    [Aphisit] The king will be informed of this matter and I  think it could be possible because the king also mentioned this  in an audience once given to him. [end recording]</p>

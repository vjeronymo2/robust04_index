			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH COURT UPHOLDS CBS LOSS OF RIGHTS TO 'AMOS 'N' ANDY'  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that CBS Inc. no longer enjoys  trademark protection for the "Amos 'n' Andy" radio and television shows.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal appeals court ruling  that CBS abandoned the trademarks when, under pressure from civil rights  groups, it suspended commercial use of the shows.  </P> <P> The asserted trademarks were challenged by Stephen M. Silverman, who wants to  produce a musical play based on the "Amos 'n' Andy" shows and their characters.  </P> <P> The case now returns to a federal judge in New York City, who is to rule on  other aspects of the dispute. Today's high court action does not remove all  legal hurdles confronting Silverman.  </P></p>

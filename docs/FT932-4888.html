			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Hands-off approach to the creation of drugs: A joining of European capital and US science IF Art Levinson and his fellow scientists have their way at Genentech, the Californian biotechnology company, a range of futuristic drugs could find their way to market towards the end of this decade. Dr Levinson, a man who sketches molecular structures on a blackboard as easily as most people sign their names, is the head of a research team of 320 cloners, cell biologists and other scientists. Genentech's candidate drugs - including genetically engineered treatments for the Aids virus and breast cancer, and an almost science-fiction drug that could regenerate a cirrhosis-decayed liver - are being developed thanks to an unusual marriage of European capital and American science and technology. The European partner is Roche, the Swiss drugs giant which three years ago paid Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.36bn) to acquire 60 per cent control of the 15-year-old Genentech. Roche has adopted a hands-off approach to Genentech's scientists. Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman of Roche, has pledged to maintain Genentech's autonomy, including independent control of its research agenda. Of Roche's original investment, there remains a Dollars 650m cash balance at Genentech. The company has the leeway to spend more than 50 per cent of its annual revenues on research and development. Genentech's pipeline of potential drugs probably now matches that of its Californian rival Amgen, the biotechnology industry's greatest success story so far. Mr Levinson's scientists are encouraged to spend 20 per cent of their time on their own research - rather than strictly company business. A more typical proportion would be 10 per cent. The 75-acre leafy park that serves as Genentech's headquarters on the bay in south San Francisco includes a recently opened Dollars 80m research centre and some of the best childcare facilities in the US. But the academic atmosphere of the headquarters does not conceal the entrepreneurial energy of the workers. Mr Kirk Raab, the crusty 57-year-old Genentech chairman, is, by his own admission, crazy about making money. 'Every employee in this company is a shareholder. There is a passion here for stock options, for ownership. Our future is to make a lot of money and to do that by providing lots of new products,' he says. 'One of the main reasons why we did the deal with Roche was to make sure that we could continue making R&amp;D investments. Without Roche's money we would not have been able to.' Mr Raab bristles at the mere mention of the Swiss company's majority control, although he acknowledges that Genentech has been left to its own devices. Roche has the option to buy out the rest of Genentech's stock by mid-1995. 'You don't see the Swiss flag flying out front,' Mr Raab says. 'Roche has only two members of our 13-strong board. I only talk to their chairman twice a year. They have no rights to our products or our science. They allow us to function independently. They don't want us to be Roche's West Coast arm.' The view from Roche's US headquarters in New Jersey is subtly different. Dr Jurgen Drews, the research director, agrees that Genentech must maintain a separate identity, to avoid stifling its entrepreneurial spirit - but he emphasises the extent to which the two companies are working together. 'We made it clear to Genentech that we wanted to collaborate with them but we didn't want to manipulate them,' he says. 'We've had to prove our abilities a couple of times but that has led to a relationship of trust.' Mr Raab, a former pharmaceuticals industry salesman, admits he is impatient at the time it takes for drugs to come to market. When they get there, the risks are far from over. Activase, a heart attack drug that dissolves blood clots within seconds, represents about 35 per cent of Genentech's annual revenues of more than Dollars 500m. In 1991 an Oxford University study, Isis-3, called its effectiveness into question. The study found that an older unpatented drug - streptokinase - saved as many lives as Activase, and at a tenth of its Dollars 2,000-per-dose cost. The study caused Activase's share of the US market in such clot-buster drugs to slump from nearly 70 per cent to 50 per cent. Mr Raab fought back. He pushed for a Dollars 55m study, funded largely by Genentech, that would test Activase against streptokinase. The study, called Gusto, was completed on April 30. Mr David Molowa, a drugs analyst at Bear Stearns in New York, noted the high risk: 'If it had gone against Activase, Genentech would be dead.' But Gusto showed that Activase had better results in preventing heart attack deaths than streptokinase. Although the difference was small - Activase saved about one extra life for every 100 patients treated - it was enough to boost Genentech's share price by Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 38 in less than a day. Mr Molowa reckons the annual Activase sales of Dollars 180m should soon rise to Dollars 250m. Wall Street's analysts have begun to revise upwards their net profit forecasts for Genentech this year, which already projected a rise of more than 50 per cent to Dollars 32m, reversing a two-year decline. Meanwhile Roche appears content to watch its investment and to acquire more shares - it now has 63 per cent. One of its Swiss competitors, Sandoz, is following in its footsteps. Last year Sandoz paid Dollars 392m for a 60 per cent stake in SyStemix, another Californian biotech company. But other observers in the pharmaceuticals industry believe the Swiss approach will fail. One is Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of UK-based Glaxo. His company has set up R&amp;D partnerships on a limited scale with several US biotech companies, avoiding large equity investments which, he says, eventually 'kill a company's spirit'. The scientific spirit is still very much alive in Mr Levinson's labs. But Roche would have to think carefully before making a full takeover.</p>

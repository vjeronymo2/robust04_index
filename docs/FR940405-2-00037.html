Comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment were not solicited, however, because we had not decided on whether the data and results from the entrainment studies completed for the Rothschild Project No. 2212, Centralia Project No. 2255, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590 could be extrapolated to an environmental analysis of this project. We have determined that the data and results for the three other projects can be extrapolated to this project. Therefore, we now request comments, recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment for this project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> l.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of Project:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project as licensed consists of the following: (1) A dam which has a total length of about 6,136 feet and is comprised of (a) an earth dike which has a length of 3,000 feet and a height of about 9 feet; (b) three sections of masonry gravity wall which have lengths of 1,024 feet, 138 feet, and 386 feet and a maximum height of about 20 feet; (c) three sections of concrete gravity wall which have lengths of 105 feet, 220 feet, and 450 feet and heights ranging from 22 to about 40 feet; (d) three gated spillways, one which has a length of 355 feet and contains ten 30-foot-wide by 15-foot-high Taintor gates, one which has a length of 252 feet and contains six 34-foot-wide by 13.75-foot-high Taintor gates, and one which has a length of 130 feet and contains three 30-foot-wide by 12.5-foot-high Taintor gates; and (e) a powerhouse with a length of 76 feet; (2) a reservoir with a surface area of about 455 acres, a storage capacity of about 4,660 acre-feet (AF), and a normal maximum water surface elevation of 1,011.3 feet mean sea level (msl); (3) a main powerhouse constructed of brick and steel with dimensions of 76.0 feet by 59.8 feet, equipped with two vertical shaft Francis turbine-generator units which have a total rated capacity of 4,680 kilowatts (kW), a combined maximum hydraulic capacity of 2,200 cubic feet per second (cfs), and a net head of 30 feet; (4) a second powerhouse located on the lower floor of a grinder building, which is integral with a masonry wall section of the dam and has dimensions of 184 feet by 57 feet, and which is equipped with eight horizontal Francis turbines, which have an aggregate hydraulic capacity of 2,400 cfs and a head of 30 feet, and which are connected to synchronous motors which have a total rated capacity of 4,430 kW; (5) a 220-foot-wide tailrace channel which is located immediately downstream of the powerhouse and grinder building; (6) a substation; and (7) appurtentant facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicant is not proposing any changes to the existing project works as licensed. However, the Applicant is proposing to include the eight synchronous motors, which are connected to the eight horizontal turbines, as a part of the project.

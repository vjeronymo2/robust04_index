			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> AN ACTOR'S ACTIVIST;  </P> <P> RON SILVER'S POLITICS AGREE WITH TNT'S MOVIE ABOUT TORTURE, HUMAN RIGHTS AND  AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL  </P> <P> Ron Silver looks like a Talmudic scholar and has entertained Madonna at a seder  dinner in his suburban home. The intense, bearded actor enjoys the  contradictions of fame- and the uses that can be made of celebrity.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate that people like cab drivers and teachers don't get a lot of  attention from the media," says Silver. "But, if it takes the presence of a  Whoopi Goldberg or a Billy Crystal to help draw attention to a problem like  homelessness, then that's a perfectly legitimate use of celebrity. If you're  privileged enough to have people shoving mikes in your face, you ought to use  that platform effectively."  </P> <P> As president of the Creative Coalition, a lobbying group of about 200 arts and  entertainment figures, Silver recently joined actors Alec Baldwin, Christopher  Reeve and other celebrities in working the halls of Congress in support of the  National Endowment for the Arts. "I think that public personalities can  dissipate their influence by not taking the time to get informed on an issue,"  Silver says. "One of the obligations of being in our group is that you have to  take the time to learn about the issue at hand."  </P> <P> Silver, who first gained attention as Valerie Harper's obnoxious neighbor in  "Rhoda," has an opportunity to match his advocacy with his acting on a TNT  movie premiering this week. He plays an American drawn into the horrors of  political torture in the two-hour "Forgotten Prisoners: The Amnesty Files."  </P> <P> Silver recently has been praised by critics for his performances in a wide  variety of movie roles. He made a womanizing lout sympathetic in Paul  Mazursky's "Enemies: A Love Story," and he has been described as the "tough,  unsentimental conscience" of "Reversal of Fortune," the new movie about the  Claus von Bulow attempted-murder trial.  </P> <P> The TNT movie, which is drawn from the files of Amnesty International, the  human-rights organization, focuses on cases of torture of political prisoners  in Turkey. A former torture victim who had spent years in a Turkish prison was  an adviser on the film. The characters, however, are drawn from composites  because, the producers say, using specific events could put lives in danger.  </P> <P> In the movie, Silver plays a somewhat naive American, a specialist in  international law, who goes to Turkey as an Amnesty representative to observe  the trials of a group of political prisoners. He becomes involved in trying to  free the group, which includes a teen-age boy and a political cartoonist.  </P> <P> The movie shows the effects of torture, but it also shows the potentially  positive effects of letter-writing campaigns by members of Amnesty on behalf of  political prisoners.  </P> <P> "When you read about hundreds of people being detained, it may be hard to focus  on their stories," says Silver, who has been a member of Amnesty International  for many years. "But, in this TV movie, you see individuals and their families.  Hopefully, watching the movie will help people see torture victims as something  more than statistics."  </P> <P> In addition to his activities with lobbying organizations, Silver also has  campaigned on his own for a number of liberal candidates in both the Republican  and Democratic parties. Earlier this month, Silver joined New York Gov. Mario  Cuomo in stumping for an environmental bond issue.  </P> <P> With all of this activity, is he considering running for office himself?  </P> <P> "What?" he asks, laughing. "And lose the influence that I have now?"  </P> <P> "Forgotten Prisoners: The Amnesty Files" airs on TNT Monday at 5-7 p.m., 7-9  p.m., 9-11 p.m., 11 p.m.-1a.m.; Tuesday at 7-9 a.m., 1-3 p.m., and Saturday at  7-9 p.m.  </P></p>

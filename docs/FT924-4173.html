			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: EC conflict over proposals for deposit protection scheme DEPOSITORS at UK banks could get greater compensation when a bank fails, if a European Community directive on deposit protection schemes is agreed. However, EC members are at loggerheads over the proposed directive, and will air grievances at a Financial Attaches' meeting in Brussels today. Most EC members agree to the principle that if a bank from one country has a branch in another country, depositors of that branch should be covered by the deposit protection scheme operating in the home country of the parent bank. At the moment, depositors are protected by the scheme operated by the country in which the branch is operating, or the host country. However, Germany, which is receiving some support from Italy, questions whether it is necessary to have an EC directive at all, arguing that deposit protection schemes are a matter of national rather than EC concern. Most EC members also agree that a minimum level of deposit protection should be provided in all EC countries, though countries should be free to decide the maximum level of protection they are prepared to give. Thus Germany and Italy would be able to continue to give a guarantee to depositors at their banks that they would not lose anything in the event of a bank failure. On the other hand, the UK would continue to pay no more than Pounds 15,000 to each depositor. But there are three important issues on which there is little agreement between EC members: France believes that the minimum level of insurance for the EC should be Ecu60,000, compared with an Ecu15,000 minimum proposed in the draft. The UK supports the Ecu15,000 minimum. Italy and Germany are opposed to a proposal that bank branches whose home country has a low level of deposit protection can opt into the higher level of protection offered in a host country, such as Germany and Italy. The draft directive proposes that depositors should always face some risk of loss on their deposits, which is known as the principle of co-insurance, whereas France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Italy all oppose co-insurance. Thus the draft directive says that any country which implemented only the minimum level of protection would compensate depositors in a failed bank for only 90 per cent of their deposits up to Ecu15,000. On the other hand, France and it allies want 100 per cent protection up to Ecu15,000. The British Bankers Association wants the UK to retain its current 75 per cent compensation rate. Meanwhile a US Federal Reserve economist, Ms Sydney Key, will argue in a paper to be delivered in Brussels today that the directive is seriously flawed by the absence of a maximum level of deposit protection for EC members.</p>

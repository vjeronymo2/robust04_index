			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Analysts on line to CSO gurus City economists fazed by government figures may soon have help at hand. The Central Statistical Office is considering setting up a telephone service to help analysts make sense of figures. It is the latest step in the CSO's initiative to develop better links with the City and the public - and cover its costs. The CSO yesterday said that if the service went ahead 'it will not be cheap'. It provided a free taster of the service yesterday to supplement the retail prices index. About 20 analysts took part in a conference call with CSO statisticians to ask detailed questions about the data. Other trials of the system, similar to briefings for journalists, have already been carried out for industry data. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist with Warburgs, welcomed the system. He added: 'A lot of people in the City get very annoyed that journalists have been getting better information than we do.' Nevertheless the CSO does seem to have succeeded on one point. Analysts' verdicts on yesterday's figures were unusually unanimous - and similar to the interpretation offered by the CSO.</p>

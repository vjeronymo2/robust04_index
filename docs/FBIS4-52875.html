			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Seoul-based Voice of National  Salvation, the Central Committee of the South Korean National  Democratic Front [SKNDF] on May 10 issued a manifesto on the  occasion of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular  uprising, calling on the South Korean people of various strata  to rise in the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle for independence.    We appeal to all the fellow countrymen:    Fellow countrymen, 14 years ago, our people suffered a  terrible disaster in Kwangju owing to the United States. The  entire city turned into a city of blood, all the streets were  covered with corpses, and all the streams inside the city were  running with blood. That was Kwangju in May.    So many innocent people were shot dead by the airborne  special warfare force driven by the United States, were crushed  to death by their armored vehicles, and stabbed with their  swords.    Even before the disappearance of this grudge, the cursed  United States is bringing a horrible nuclear holocaust upon our  people and our nation.    Finding fault with the North's nuclear issue in a groundless  manner, the United States has expanded its nuclear strategic  commotions step by step. Now, it has even announced a blunt  plan for a war of northward aggression and is staging a hectic  war exercise on the sea and ground, and in the air with the  introduction of massive war means, like Patriots, and the armed  forces of aggression close to South Korea and the Korean  peninsula, driving the situation to a phase of war. This is  naked expression of the aggressive design of the United States  which aims to sacrifice our people and nation in a nuclear war  to realize its strategic goal.    Using the South Korean-U.S. cooperative system of countering  the North's so-called nuclear issue as bait, the United States  grasped $5 billion and put an end to 6 million South Korean  farmers' lives by enforcing the opening of rice market. Now, it  is scheming to make undue profits worth billions of dollars by  opening South Korea's weapons market while babbling about  countering the arms buildup of the so-called nuclear threat from  the North.    The United States is running amuck in putting pressure on  the  North, even going through the United Nations in a bid to open  the way out for U.S. war industrial complexes that are facing  marketing difficulties with the end of the cold war and in order  to revive the sluggish U.S. economy by turning our country's  land into a nuclear war theater and by sacrificing our nation in  a nuclear war.    Do you see the evil intention of Wall Street! How can we  permit this if we are to call ourselves descendents whose hearts  throb with the blood of the Korean race? It is deplorable and  heart-breaking to see a nation divided into two to live in such  a condition for almost half a century without achieving  reunification. Worse still, why must we endure a nuclear  holocaust forced upon us by yankees from across the ocean?    Was there any time in the long history of our nation that we  had to experience such a heart-breaking crisis of national  suffering? Our people can never become an object of  exploitation, nor can our nation be sacrificed in a nuclear war.  Now is the time that all the people must rise in a struggle to  regain national sovereignty.    Our nation must determinedly rise in a struggle to get the  U.S. troops and nuclear weapons fraught with nuclear holocaust  withdrawn from South Korea and to smash U.S. pressure to open  the rice and weapons markets. Let us all put an end to the  colonial rule and intervention of the U.S. imperialists and  retake the sovereignty of the nation with the nationwide  anti-U.S. struggle. Smashing the U.S. imperialists' war  maneuvers and defending the peace on the Korean peninsula are a  vital question directly linked with our nation's fate.    Patriot missiles are not for defense but for a war gamble.  Let us audaciously carry out a struggle to withdraw the Patriot  missiles that support a nuclear war. The U.S. arms buildup and  the Team Spirit exercise are aimed at kindling the flame of war  on this land. Let all fellow countrymen who love peace and value  the nation rise in a struggle to deter the U.S. scheme to  buildup arms, to suspend the Team Spirit exercise, and to smash  the U.S. imperialists' war maneuvers.    Leaving intact the Kim Yong-sam clique which is parasitic on  the chin of the United States, our people and nation would not  be able to avoid a calamity. Let us all overthrow Kim Yong-sam,  the arch traitor to the nation, who has reduced South Korea to a  colony and a nuclear forward base of the United States and which  schemes to ignite a nuclear war in this land, and realize the  sovereignty of the nation.    Today's dark situation calls on the popular masses from all  walks of life to rise in an anti-U.S. struggle. The patriotic  popular masses of all classes who want to live independently and  peacefully should spring up to the plaza of anti-U.S. struggle  for independence so as to defend our nation regardless of  whether they are the haves or have-nots, whether they are  atheists or not, or whether they live in Cholla Province or  Kyongsang Province.    With the spirit of the May Uprising, let us all stamp out  U.S. intervention and domination from this land and open the new  road for independence, democracy, and reunification in a grand  anti-U.S. struggle for independence.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Bosnian Moslems cut land demands BOSNIAN Moslems yesterday scaled back their demands for territorial concessions in a move which could lay the ground for a possible agreement between the three warring factions. Bosnia's president Alija Izetbegovic tabled a proposal that his Moslem republic should receive an additional 4 per cent of the 28 per cent already allocated under the proposed partition. Previous Moslem proposals have demanded at least 10 per cent more land. The Bosnian Serbs were yesterday reported to have offered the mostly Moslem Bosnian government full land access to the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. Serbian sources said Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed to give the Moslems a 1.8 mile-wide corridor linking the three enclaves. But as the negotiations intensified, diplomats warned that the Serb leaders had repeated that this would be their 'final concession' and the Moslem delegation threatened to return home if their demands for additional land were rejected. 'This demand is the minimum of minimums. If they (Serbs and Croats) reject this, we are going home,' said Mr Mustafa Bijedic, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva. Mr Muhamed Filipovic, a member of the Bosnian delegation, said his side was demanding that the allocation of land to the Moslems be increased by 2 per cent in the east and 2.8 in the west in order to improve on the maps which leave his republic comprising seven isolated pockets. Mr Izetbegovic is also asking for a land connection to the sea and the Adriatic port of Neum. However, citing 'historical' precedent, Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, has rejected Moslem demands on the grounds that giving up Neum would isolate Dubrovnik, the resort on the southern Dalmatian coast, from Croat regions. As the three parties appeared to inch closer to a settlement, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, yesterday met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, to discuss the possible deployment of peace-keeping troops. In spite of hopes that the discussion might lead to a firm commitment about the possible deployment of troops in the region, the discussions were held under a total news blackout. Nato officials yesterday denied that the silence reflected any political disagreements. But with many diplomats remaining sceptical that the three sides will reach a firm agreement quickly, both British and French diplomatic sources stressed that they would not be prepared to commit any troops until the there was a workable peace agreement. Meanwhile, in an effort to broker a ceasefire between the Bosnian and Croat forces, General Francis Briquemont, UN commander in Sarajevo, yesterday travelled to Medjugorje to supervise talks between the two commanders. A four-day ceasefire between the Croat and Moslem forces in Mostar is due to run out this evening. However, a UN protection force spokesman in Zagreb confirmed yesterday that there had been skirmishes throughout the day around Mostar and across central Bosnia.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> NEW POSITION PUTS NEVIN ON DEFENSIVE, BUT HE REGAINS FOOTING  </P> <P> For most of February, it appeared that Cal State Fullerton third baseman Phil  Nevin had become as proficient at kicking as he had been for the Titans'  football team last fall.  </P> <P> Nine errors in Fullerton's first 15 games had raised speculation that Nevin,  who made 15 of 21 field goal attempts in 1989, wasn't making the  football-to-baseball transition as well as he did at El Dorado High School.  </P> <P> "I was just booting the ball, that's all I can say," Nevin said.  </P> <P> But Nevin's problems really had nothing to do with the change of seasons.  Rather, it was the move from shortstop, where he played in high school, to  third base that caused his defensive disorders.  </P> <P> At shortstop, Nevin, a freshman, was able to read hops better. He could sit  back on grounders, look for the good bounce and rely on his strong arm to throw  out runners. At third, Nevin has had to deal with bunts, drag bunts, slow  rollers and hard shots hit directly at him. The hard shots and the short hops  have been especially baffling.  </P> <P> "I'm like a hockey goalie, just trying to knock the ball down and throw guys  out," Nevin said. "I figured it would be an easy position to play, but I was  really wrong there."  </P> <P> With each error came more ribbing from teammates during practice. "You're  fielding with a skillet," they'd tell Nevin, a third-round draft choice of the  Dodgers last June.  </P> <P> But for the past month, Nevin has sizzled in the field. . He has made only two  errors in the past 11 games for the Titans (15-12).  </P> <P> "I didn't work as hard as I should have on my defense this winter, but I'm  putting the time in now," Nevin said. "I'm finally getting the hang of it. The  errors were demoralizing at first, because people expected a lot from me and I  expected a lot from myself too."  </P> <P> Diminishing returns: Through Fullerton's season of inconsistency, one steady  influence has been outfielder Rich Gonzales, who has reached base safely in all  27 Titan games.  </P> <P> Gonzales, who was a standout at Rancho Santiago College, ranks third on the  team in batting with a .379 average, a marked improvement over last season's  .281 average.  </P> <P> The senior cleanup hitter has two home runs and 15 runs batted in. He has  struck out only eight times and walked 12 times. Last season, he had 26  strikeouts and 11 walks.  </P> <P> Why the beefed-up statistics?  </P> <P> A trimmed-down Gonzales.  </P> <P> By closely monitoring his diet, the 6-foot-2 Gonzales lost more than 20 pounds  during the off-season, dropping from 215 to 192. He says he has improved his  mobility, foot and bat speed without compromising his power.  </P> <P> "I didn't think my weight hurt me until I reached this level," Gonzales said.  "Last year, the long season wore me down. I wasn't mentally or physically ready  for a four-year school. But I'm in shape this year."  </P> <P> Food for thought: Outfielder David Ayala has posted modest numbers this season  -- a .290 average with one home run and 10 RBIs -- but around his Fullerton  apartment, Ayala does extremely well at the plate.  </P> <P> The sophomore rooms with two of the best cooks on the team, second baseman Mate  Borgogno and reserve outfielder Matt McElreath. McElreath's specialty is  Chinese food, and Borgogno loves to prepare everything from Italian food to  desserts to barbecue.  </P> <P> "I don't have to eat out much," Ayala said.  </P> <P> Borgogno makes spaghetti sauce from scratch and fries his own beans for Mexican  dishes. He enjoys experimenting in the kitchen. Among his favorite authors is  Betty Crocker.  </P> <P> "I'm not actually a gourmet cook but I imagine I am," Borgogno said. "I love  inviting teammates over, putting food on the table and watching them eat. I  guess I'm a typical Italian."  </P> <P> Ain't seen nothin' yet: Must be something in those Blyleven genes. Like his  father, Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven, Todd Blyleven already has developed a  pretty wicked curve, one that Titan Coach Larry Cochell hopes will bolster his  staff next season. Blyleven, a Villa Park High School standout, made an oral  commitment this week to sign with Fullerton.  </P> <P> But if you think Blyleven's curve is good now, just wait until you see it in a  few years.  </P> <P> "My dad says my curve is better than his when he was this age, and he thinks  it's going to get better," said Blyleven, whose father possesses what many  consider the best curve in the major leagues.  </P> <P> Todd says his dad taught him the curve, but it wasn't a pitch he has perfected  over many years.  </P> <P> "He wouldn't let me throw a curve until I was 15, because he said it was bad  for my arm," Todd said.  </P> <P> Two-for-one deal: Wondering how Titan football Coach Gene Murphy was able to  add two assistants to replace the two who recently resigned when one of those  who departed, Preston Dennard, said his position was phased out because of  budget cuts?  </P> <P> Answer: The salary previously allotted to former secondary coach Ed Donatell,  who accepted a similar position with the New York Jets, was split between new  assistants Hue Jackson (offensive backs) and Mike Foster (defensive backs).  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Gene Murphy has pushed spring football practice back a week to give Hue Jackson  and Mike Foster time to adjust to their new positions. Conditioning drills were  supposed to begin Tuesday but are now set for April 2. An intrasquad scrimmage  is scheduled for May 5. . . . Titan softball pitcher Ann Van Dortrecht was  named Big West Conference co-pitcher of the week for her performance in last  week's PONY Invitational tournament. She was 5-1 with two shutouts and 47  strikeouts and allowed only three runs in leading Fullerton to the semifinals,  where the Titans lost to Arizona, 2-0. . . . Fullerton (24-9) dropped from  first to fourth in this week's NCAA softball poll. UCLA (29-4) took over the  top spot, followed by Fresno State (28-7) and Arizona (28-7). . . . The Titans'  softball game against UC Santa Barbara at 5 tonight will be tape delayed and  broadcast on Prime Ticket at 7 p.m. . . . Fullerton women's basketball Coach  Maryalyce Jeremiah is the 1990 recipient of the Carol Eckman Award, presented  annually by the Women's Basketball Coaches Assn. for sportsmanship and ethics  in the coaching profession. The award will be presented this weekend during the  women's Final Four in Knoxville, Tenn. . . . The Titan Road race, with 10  kilometer, 5K and 2K runs will be at 8 a.m. April 8. All races start and finish  at the north end of the Fullerton Marriott on campus. For registration and  information call race director John Elders at 773-3490. . . .

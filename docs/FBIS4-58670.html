			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, May 5, SPA -- Saudi papers on Thursday  cautiously welcomed the agreement signed on Wednesday [4 May]  between the PLO and Israel on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho peace plan.    The Jeddah-based, AL-MADINAH, said despite reservations on  some parts of the agreement, the agreement means that a new  phase has begun for practical and realistic actions. While many  people think that the agreement is full of deadly mistakes and  bears seeds of failure, the paper said, other people thought it  will fulfill the ambitions of the Palestinian people of the  occupied territories who suffered too much from unemployment and  poverty that makes the Palestinian side to soften its  negotiation stand.    AL-YAWM, of al-Dammam, said the agreement does not  necessarily mean that all standing propblems had been solved  because Israel, with a record full of manipulations and  deception, many not carry out the agreement honestly. The paper  urged the international community and big powers in particularly  to guarantee full implementation of the agreement and called on  the Palestinian to realise the biggest possible gain of the  agreement.    AL-JAZIRAH, published in Riyadh and 'UKAZ, published in  Jeddah also tackled the same issue said the agreement would be a  real test for the intentions of Israel and whether it is ready  to cope with the Arab position on peace process. They said if  the agreement is not followed by similar progress on other  tracks, it would certainly expose to erosion elements and  matters may change for the interests of peace opposing parties  in the region.</p>

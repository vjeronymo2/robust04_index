			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Cordoba, 14 Feb (NA) -- Cordoba Governor Eduardo  Angeloz today confirmed that he wants to become a presidential  candidate for the Radical Civic Union [UCR] in 1995 "if the  party accepts it and if all the instrumental steps that I want  to impose are accepted by the party."    Angeloz denied press reports in which he allegedly conveyed  to President Carlos Menem his decision to give up his  presidential candidacy. Angeloz explained: "This confusion is  not good for our country or anyone. I am the one who, depending  on my mood, will have to decide in due time if I feel like  becoming a candidate."    Concerning the possibility that Senator Fernando de la Rua  might actually become the UCR candidate, the governor said: "In  due time we will see who is in a better position to represent  the UCR."    Angeloz later stressed: "There will not be any internal rift  within the UCR," although he admitted "the existence of acute,  hard, and hostile disagreements. The party will remain  unchanged."

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. A. Reshetov, A. B. Karasev and G. A. Savin; </F> UDC 528.711.1.(15)]    [Abstract] Remote sensing activities in Russia are  reviewed. Past achievements are summarized and the ongoing work  is discussed in detail. The collection and sale of remote  sensing data constitute a potential source of foreign exchange  and it is the intention to make these materials available on the  world market. Collaboration with the developing countries will  also be stressed. However, the even more important role played  by remote sensing materials in the development of the Russian  economy is emphasized (exploration for mineral resources,  environmental protection, etc.). The following are regarded as  the immediate objectives in the field of development of detailed  observation subsystems: modernization of the Resurs-FI and  Resurs-FII satellites (1994-1996) for increasing their  technical-economic efficiency by improving resolution on the  ground by 20-40%, increasing the area of the survey from  one  vehicle and lengthening its lifetime; activation (1993-1994) of  a new vehicle of the Resurs-F series with a ground resolution  better than 5 m; flight tests (1996-1997) of a new vehicle of  the Resurs-F series which will replace the Resurs-FI and F-II  (work on creating the new vehicle is being funded by the Russian  Space Agency); adaptation of the information received from the  new vehicles to the tasks of different departments;  modernization of the surface complex for the interbranch  processing of information to a level which will make it possible  to draw a wide range of Russian entrepreneurs into the  subsequent processing and application of the results;  development and introduction of technologies for the digital  processing of satellite images within the framework of  geoinformation systems for the production of precise  cartographic materials oriented on the needs of planning and  control agencies, search for and evaluation of natural resources  and environmental monitoring. Russia must be prepared for active  participation in the international satellite information market.  The Russian government and companies, especially the Priroda  State Center, are ready to cooperate with companies in other  countries in marketing of products developed using Russian  remote sensing systems.</p>

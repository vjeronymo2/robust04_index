			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> HEARING POSTPONED IN ASSAULT CASE  </P> <P> A pretrial hearing for the youth accused of throwing a piece of glass that  disfigured 15-year-old Amber Jefferson was postponed Tuesday -- his 18th  birthday -- because he reportedly was too ill to attend.  </P> <P> Kurt David Wimberly was scheduled to appear in West Orange County Municipal  Court in Westminster on assault and weapons charges in connection with an Aug.  7 brawl outside his Stanton home.  </P> <P> However, with relatives from both sides present in the courtroom, Wimberly's  attorney Salvatore Ciulla told Municipal Judge Frank Fasel that his client had  suffered an unknown medical emergency.  </P> <P> Prosecutors also said they did not know the nature or the seriousness of  Wimberly's illness.  </P> <P> "I heard it was something with his nose, but they're not giving us much  information," Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper said. "All I know is the jail  personnel decided that it was serious enough not to transport him."  </P> <P> The case has been rescheduled for Nov. 26. Wimberly is charged with felony  mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon, infliction of great bodily injury and  battery.  </P> <P> The youth was one of three people charged in connection with a near-fatal  attack that left Jefferson, a Garden Grove cheerleader, with a disfiguring scar  from her temple to the side of her neck.TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND  </P></p>

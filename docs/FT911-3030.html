			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelters work close to capacity WESTERN EUROPE'S primary aluminium smelters continued to work close to the limits of their capacity last year, according to the European Aluminium Association. Output slipped by only 0.5 per cent from the 1989 level, from 3.58m tonnes to 3.56m, it reports. The Dusseldorf-based association monitors the aluminium industries in Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and Yugoslavia. This year low aluminium prices are putting considerable pressure on the European industry, which is estimated to have the world's highest-cost smelters. In its latest Aluminium Annual Review, the Anthony Bird consultancy group suggested that Italy has the highest-cost smelters with costs of 78 cents a lb, followed by Spain and Germany at 76 cents, and France at 70 cents. In comparison, Venezuela's costs are only 47 cents a lb and those in Canada are 51 cents. Alumix, the state-owned Italian producer, recently announced a rationalisation programme which will include the permanent closure in June of the 30,000-tonnes-a-year Porto Maghera smelter. The aluminium industry 'is closer to a shortage than a glut', says Anthony Bird. 'We estimate that at the end of 1991 the margin of spare capacity and the amount of excess stocks will be very similar to that seen in mid-1986 - which was of course followed soon afterwards by a period of intense shortage,' its latest Aluminium Analysis says. Aluminium prices are 'dangerously low' because they make it impossible for any new smelter project to cover its operating and capital costs and to earn an acceptable profit, it says. 'That would call for a price of 77 to 83 cents a lb at April, 1991 prices and exchange rates.'</p>

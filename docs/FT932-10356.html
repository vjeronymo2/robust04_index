			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets9): Copper prices driven to fresh lows THE COPPER market was down in the dumps again this week as Chinese sellers returned to batter prices to 5 1/2 -year lows. At the London Metal Exchange the three months delivery contract closed yesterday at Pounds 1,128.75 a tonne, down Pounds 80.75 on the week and Pounds 300 from the beginning of April - and some dealers were talking of a further 20 per cent slide before the present bear market has run its course. 'The market was too high for too long and now will probably go too low for too long,' one trader told the Reuter news agency. Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at the Metals and Minerals Research Services consultancy, explained that speculative activity and nervousness about possible supply disruptions had until recently been keeping copper prices high in defiance of the fundamentals. 'Copper producers have been making lots of money when in their cyclical business they should have been losing money,' he said. The high prices have encouraged the commissioning of new capacity at a time of slack demand, which has resulted in persistent overproduction. Stocks in LME-registered warehouses this week reached 400,300 tonnes, compared with 280,000 tonnes 12 months ago and 210,000 in April 1991, which at the time was regarded as far too high. In yesterday's issue of its daily Commodity Report, GNI, the London trader, suggested that combined LME and New York Commodity Exchange stocks, at present just over 500,000 tonnes, could by the end of this year 'be approaching 1m tonnes'. But it thought sellers might become more cautious in the nearer term in view of the possibility of production disruption at Chile's Chuquicamata mine, where wage negotiations are scheduled to begin later this month. Meanwhile LME traders noted that there was concern over production problems at the El Teniente mine, also in Chile, where recent rain is expected to force a five-day closure. The depression in the zinc market is of much longer standing and unremunerative prices have prompted production cuts by several companies. The trend was continued this week with the news that output was to be pared further at Noranda of Canada and Falconbridge, its 50 per cent owned associate. Having already decided in February on a cut in combined production to 530,000 tonnes this year from last year's 573,000 tonnes, the two companies announced on Wednesday that the figure had been reduced again to 500,000 tonnes. The news sparked a brief flurry in the market, but gains were quickly eliminated as the cut was measured against LME stocks, which rose by more than 20,000 tonnes in the past two weeks to 648,200 tonnes. A renewed rally on Thursday, encouraged by news of a force majeure declaration because of a labour dispute at Westmin Resources Myra Falls mine in British Columbia, was snuffed out equally quickly and at last night's close three months zinc was quoted at Dollars 1,027.50 a tonne, up just Dollars 2 on the week. The prospect of work stoppages resulting from US labour negotiations begining at the end of this month encouraged buyers in the aluminium market. Sentiment was undermined by copper's weakness but, having absorbed bouts of speculative selling, the market resumed its upward trend yesterday to close at Dollars 1,151.50 a tonne for three months metal, up Dollars 14.25 on the week. At the London bullion market gold weathered an early wave of profit-taking following last week's upsurge before moving on to break overhead resistance at Dollars 356.50 on the way to a nine-month high of Dollars 357.80 a troy ounce, up Dollars 2.05 on the week. But hopes of a move to Dollars 360 an ounce appeared to be fading. 'There's been some buying around the Dollars 358 area and if it got through that, it would then hit key resistance at Dollars 360,' one trader told Reuter. 'But I feel a retracement to around Dollars 352/353 is more likely.' Silver was fixed yesterday morning at a fresh 21-month high of 436.25 US cents an ounce, but it slipped back to close unchanged on the week at 435.50 cents. 'Both gold and silver have made good recoveries but will need a boost to surpass strong overhead resistance,' GNI suggested. New York traders turned against coffee early in the week after hearing that US certified stocks, which they had expected to show another fall, had risen by about 15,000 bags (60 kg each). With stocks elsewhere also high and a period of seasonally slack demand approaching sellers had the edge for the remainder of the week, which ended with London's July robusta contract Dollars 30 down on balance at Dollars 874 a tonne. New York raw sugar futures also surrendered some of their recent gains with the July position reaching 12.25 cents a lb in late trading yesterday, down 0.57 on the week. Oil prices consolidated above Dollars 19 a barrel this week as sentiment was aided by demand from US refineries for North Sea crude and a forecast by the International Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's oil monitoring body, of a rise in second quarter demand. It expected the rise to amount to 500,000 barrels a day, or about 1.5 per cent, compared with the same period last year. In addition the IEA estimated that production by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries fell to 24.1m b/d last month from 24.4m b/d in March.  ------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium   +3,700 to 1,785,200 Copper      +7,975 to   400,300 Lead        +1,800 to   251,300 Nickel      +1,596 to    91,506 Zinc        +1,400 to   648,200 Tin            +45 to    20,395  ------------------------------------------</p>

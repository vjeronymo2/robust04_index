			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marek Dreving: "Mart Laar: A Ruthless War on </F> Crime Has Started"]    [Text] The battle against crime is the most fundamental  task facing the government, testified Prime Minister Mart Laar  at yesterday's press conference. A police investigation directed  against terrorist activity is under the personal control of the  prime minister. All materials from the investigation of the bomb  blast that occurred in front of the Kadrioru police department  are being turned over to the prime minister.    As is known, an explosion occurred the evening of November  14  in Tallinn in front of the Kadrioru police department, which  injured two policemen and demolished three police patrol cars.  On 28 October, a bomb exploded at 10:25 p.m. in front of the  same police department, which destroyed two police cars.    "The explosions demonstrate that the Estonian police have  started to feel open to attack. Earlier there wasn't any thought  of bombing the police, but now evidently the need to intimidate  the police has arisen," explained Laar.    The fight against crime is one of the most important tasks  for 1994, assured the prime minister. "It's reason to believe  that a merciless war with criminals has started," noted Laar.  The prime minister assured that the state would provide for its  police officers, who had suffered injuries in the attacks  against the police. In the words of the prime minister, the  families of these police officers would be cared for as well.    An allotment of Israeli purchased arms will go towards  replacing police weapons.    "In connection with the bomb explosions of the Kadrioru  police department building, Tallinn Police Commissioner is doing  all that is possible in finding those responsible for this crime  and restoring law and security in the city," a representative  from the Tallinn Police Commissioner's Press Department told the  ETA.    The Tallinn criminal investigation department is currently  checking on several possible theories in a joint effort with  representatives of the Defense Police. In their operation, the  Commissioner's criminal investigators have discovered 8  kilograms illegally held explosives, weapons and detonators.  Twelve people have been arrested. Their involvement with the  bombing is being verified.    Tallinn police commissioner Ralf Palo added, that  considering  the extraordinary occurrence, a 5,000-10,000 kroon reward is  being offered to anyone who can inform the police of crucially  important facts in one's possession which can aid in the  investigation of the explosions. Anonymity is guaranteed.</p>

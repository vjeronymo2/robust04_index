			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / 'Austrian' recipe for prosperity: For an antidote to American economic correctness, Michael Prowse examines an intriguing counter-culture If you want to be 'economically correct', order this year's Economic Report of the President. You will learn from President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers that increases in tax rates need not undermine economic incentives, that numerical targets for imports can be preferable to free trade, and that government intervention is often necessary to correct 'market failures'. This casual rejection of free market orthodoxy will not raise eyebrows in most US or British universities. In academia, the influence of Milton Friedman and other members of the 'Chicago School' has been on the wane for nearly a decade. Even before Mr Clinton's election victory, the most influential school in the US was the neo-Keynesian, technocratic brand of economics taught at universities such as Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Yet the range of economic opinion in the US is still encouragingly wide. There are many able - if unsung - American economists who reject both neo-Keynesian orthodoxy and crude free market monetarism. 'Austrian' followers of F A Hayek and Ludwig von Mises constitute one of the most intriguing counter-cultures. The 'Austrian school' was founded in the 1870s by Carl Menger, the great 19th-century economist. But it long ago slipped its Viennese moorings. Today, most German-speaking economists regard themselves as part of the Anglo-American economic mainstream. Austrians have a niche position in the US largely due to the efforts of Mises, who was driven to New York in 1940 by the rise of Nazism. Mises was the undisputed leader of the Austrian school during the interwar years; young Hayek one of his star pupils. During the 1950s and 1960s, Mises attracted a new band of American disciples, the most important being Israel Kirzner, who heads a team of Austrian theorists at New York University, and Murray Rothbard, now at the University of Nevada. There are centres of Austrian research scattered across the US, for example at the Mises Institute in Alabama, at George Mason University near Washington DC and at Hillsdale College in Michigan. Austrian economists are spread thinly. But they pop up in surprising places. There are sympathisers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and, perhaps, even at the Fed's headquarters in Washington: Mr Alan Greenspan's speeches occasionally have an Austrian tinge. In Britain leading Austrians include Stephen Littlechild, the regulator of the power industry. Before looking at Austrian theories, a word of warning is appropriate. Austrians pride themselves on their realism: they seek to analyse market capitalism as it is, not as it might be. As a result, the novelty of their approach is not always obvious to lay people. The real significance of Austrian economics can be grasped only by contrasting it with the 'mainstream' economics taught in most universities. Believe it or not, the latter is often only tenuously related to real-world business. In recent decades, mainstream economists - in common with other social scientists - have tried to gain respectability by acquiring the trappings of a 'hard' science, such as physics. We are all familiar with the huge computer models used to generate those comically inaccurate economic 'forecasts'. But, in truth, maths is now central to every aspect of academic economics. Human beings are treated as though they were robot calculators, forever maximising profits or 'utility' subject to known (or at least precisely quantifiable) constraints. Prices are assumed to move rapidly to bring supply and demand into balance so that markets are always at or close to 'equilibrium'. The upshot is that all the complexities and uncertainties of a market economy are reduced to a series of neat equations. This makes economics look more sophisticated than in the days of Adam Smith (or even John Maynard Keynes). But is the pretension to scientific understanding justified? Can the kind of maths used to describe the natural world really be brought to bear on the decisions of human beings? Is economics really this tractable? Austrians think not. In real science, there are plenty of 'constants' - precise relationships confirmed by numerous experiments. After decades of effort, Rothbard points out, economists have not come up with a single 'economic constant'. All they can ever say is that certain relationships held at certain times in certain places. The crucial difference is that human beings can (and frequently do) alter their behaviour - an option not open to planets or atoms. Eschewing higher maths, modern Austrians, such as Kirzner, advocate an alternative economic paradigm that lays greater stress on the role of entrepreneurs as the driving force of capitalism and on markets as dynamic processes that facilitate innovation and discovery. To put it bluntly, Kirzner creates room for such real-world phenomena as Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media tycoon. By contrast, the insipid world of mainstream economics could be populated entirely by intelligent computers. The difference between Austrian and mainstream economics is the difference between a creative art and a dull, predictable science. Kirzner follows Mises in putting entrepreneurs at the centre of economic action. Mises (see Human Action, Yale University Press, 1949) was always unhappy with the conventional model of economic man as a kind of 'robot maximiser'. He felt it was simply incorrect to depict most economic decisions as a matter of routine optimisation subject to known constraints. He realised that business is a creative activity involving inspired hunches and leaps of faith. According to Mises, all you can assume is that people, facing a radically uncertain future, try to improve their material lot. They act purposefully to 'remove felt uneasiness'. But Misesian 'human action' does not assume anybody will optimise anything: he thus dispenses with most of the complex maths that clutters modern textbooks. 'We are all entrepreneurs,' was one of Mises's favourite slogans. What he meant was that all economic activity is inherently entrepreneurial because it occurs in conditions of uncertainty. When we buy a house or choose a career we have to take a gamble. We have to make assumptions about future real estate prices or wages that may or may not be justified. If we guess correctly we prosper, but there is always a risk of disappointment. Mises saw all economics in this light. Business tycoons are really no different from you or me. They gamble that the price at which they can sell a product tomorrow will more than offset the cost today of the labour and raw materials needed to produce it. If they are correct, they make big profits; if they are wrong they face bankruptcy. Whatever happens, they must remain alert because rivals are always scavenging for profits. The Austrian concept of markets as dynamic processes is equally fundamental. Mises had no patience with the traditional emphasis on 'equilibrium states' which assumes that prices adjust swiftly to bring demand and supply into perfect balance. In the real world, he pointed out, the conditions for equilibrium were constantly changing; the mix of products towards which business was striving today would be redundant tomorrow because of changes in consumer tastes, business technology, government policy and a host of other factors. Equilibrium was thus like the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. It was something you might approach but could never attain. 'Perfect competition' was not, as the textbooks implied, a characteristic of an equilibrium state in which myriads of identical companies passively accepted prices set by the market. It was, rather, a messy process in which, typically, a few big companies battled for supremacy and enjoyed considerable pricing power. It was a disequilibrium process that defied mathematical analysis. This may seem an abstruse point. Who cares if markets are in equilibrium or not? But it turns out to be of crucial importance because the criteria by which mainstream economists judge economic efficiency relate to equilibrium situations. When Mr Clinton's advisers talk about 'market failure', they are referring to the failure of real-world economies to achieve the efficiency conditions implied by their imaginary equilibrium models. Austrian analysis sweeps these concerns aside. Since real-world economies are never in equilibrium, the efficiency conditions never apply. There is no such thing as 'market failure' in the sense intended by Harvard-types because the criteria for market success - the mathematical efficiency conditions - apply only in non-existent situations. Since Austrians do not believe you can prove free markets are efficient, why are many deeply opposed to government intervention? Hayek provided the most convincing answer. In the 1940s, he stressed a seemingly obvious but hitherto ignored fact: the sum total of knowledge available in an economy 'never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess'. What Hayek meant is that you and I (and the managers of private-sector companies) know far more about our circumstances and desires than could ever be acquired by a central authority. Even if governments could obtain and process all the information dispersed throughout a market economy (an impossible task), they would still not know enough to make the 'right' decisions. This is because we often do not know in advance what knowledge will be relevant to our decisions: we thus could not keep government officials fully informed even if this were our goal. Mainstream economists still talk grandly about 'maximising social welfare'. Hayek's point about the dispersal of knowledge shows that this goal is really nonsensical. Nobody could know enough to measure society's welfare, let alone to maximise it. Hayek's central point is not that market prices convey and summarise already-existing knowledge - something most economists would accept. It is, rather, that the incentives offered by market prices during the dynamic process of competition lead to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge. As Kirzner stresses, they promote innovation and growth by 'alerting hitherto unwitting market participants to the possibility of pure entrepreneurial profit . . .' Such discoveries, argues Kirzner, 'constitute the crucial steps through which markets tend to achieve . . . successively better co-ordinated states of society'. Austrians believe decentralised markets will nearly always outperform bureaucrats for two reasons. They provide access to far more of the relevant information (in terms both of personal preferences and technological options) and they provide strong incentives (in the shape of profit opportunities) for using the information efficiently. Even if governments can somehow discover what to do, officials typically lack appropriate incentives: remuneration, for example, is rarely linked to the economic performance of sectors they regulate or control. The principal task of government should thus be to eliminate obstacles that prevent markets operating smoothly. Since markets are in continual flux, Austrians do not regard any particular market structure as ideal. In some sectors peak efficiency may be achieved through competition between only a handful of large enterprises; in others it may require hundreds or thousands of competitors. The efficient number and size of companies, moreover, will change over time. The crucial requirement is that individuals and companies (foreign as well as domestic) always be allowed to enter existing markets and compete away the profits of established companies. With completely free entry, Austrians' claim, entrepreneurial competition becomes an upward spiral leading to ever higher standards of living. Government regulation is no substitute for more intense competition because it tends to stifle the innovation that leads to economic growth; indeed Austrians such as Kirzner argue that the true cost of intervention, while high, is impossible to calculate because nobody can predict what advances would occur in its absence. Austrian theories will appear realistic or naive depending upon one's temperament and experience. But in forming a judgment, bear in mind that Austrians have an excellent track record on the central economic debate of this century. Mises published the first coherent critique of socialist economics as early as 1920. During the 1930s, he and Hayek stood virtually alone against the economics profession in arguing that central planning could not work. The technocrats who saw economics as akin to engineering (a science independent of politics) were still defending socialism in the mid-1980s. They still run the profession but somewhere up there, Mises is having the last laugh.</p>

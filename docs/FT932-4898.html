			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: In the heat of the Sun Mr Donald Gordon does not have the popular appeal of Mr George Soros but, within the narrow world of insurance, his investment decisions are influential. The stake in Sun Alliance unveiled last week by Transatlantic, his investment vehicle, was enough to lift the insurance sector against the trend of a falling market. Since Mr Gordon is also a notable investor in commercial property, and Sun Alliance's investment portfolio is heavily weighted in that direction, the comparison with Mr Soros's investment in British Land might not be too far fetched. Anticipation of a bid for Sun Alliance certainly looks premature. Transatlantic took control of Sun Life in 1991, but only after more than a decade slowly building its stake. Since Transatlantic is capitalised at one third the size of Sun Alliance, an outright bid would be difficult anyway. UAP of France, a partner in Transatlantic, is large enough to swallow such prey. But dire conditions in its domestic market and the prospect of privatisation leave it occupied closer to home. Even so, Transatlantic's visible presence on the share register must be discomforting for Sun Alliance's management, not least while litigation between the two sides is outstanding. The market's reaction in marking up insurance shares across the board is strange. If Mr Gordon's investment really is a play on rising asset prices, composite and life insurers might be expected to benefit. But with most already trading at a premium to net assets, it is difficult to argue that the sector is undervalued.</p>

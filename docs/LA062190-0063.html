			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG FISH STORY ENDS IN ANGLER'S ARREST  </P> <P> A man who caught a 300-pound Atlantic sturgeon could be sentenced to a year in  prison and fined $1,000, officials said.  </P> <P> Ron Mann was charged Monday with fishing without a commercial license and  illegally setting a net. Wildlife officials were also upset because the  sturgeon was female and the roe was lost.  </P> <P> Mann, 24, of South Berwick, caught the fish in the Salmon Fall River. He  described it as the "catch of the day, the year, the century."  </P> <P> But his bragging caught the ears of local officials. They arrested him and  called in the Maine Marine Patrol, which seized the fish.  </P></p>

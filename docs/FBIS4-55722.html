			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 20 May--European Commission President  Jacques Delors met this morning with members of the Sejm and  Senate Presidia and with the chairmen of the Sejm Commissions  for Foreign Affairs and for European Treaty Matters.    After the meeting, Jan Borkowski, chairman of the Commission  for European Treaty Matters, said that the most important issue  discussed today was a proposal by Polish parliament members for  Poland to participate in the work of setting up the new European  Union [EU] institutions that are to emerge after the states of  Central and East Europe are accepted as members of the  organization.    According to Borkowski, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy suggested  during the talks that Poland should gain permanent observer  status in the European Parliament. Borkowski said Delors agreed  that an initiative should be taken to enable Poland to cooperate  in reforming the EU. He added that Poland does not want only to  be a recipient of EU decisions and to stand outside, but that it  also wants to contribute to the creation of new structures in  which it is going to participate in the future.</p>

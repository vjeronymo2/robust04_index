			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Intelsat taps 10-year sector with cheaply-priced Dollars 200m deal Few borrowers braved the eurobond market yesterday ahead of today's US employment data, which could prompt a further rise in US short-term interest rates. The US dollar sector saw most activity, with deals from Intelsat and Morgan Guaranty Trust. Intelsat tapped the longer end of the dollar sector with a 10-year Dollars 200m offering priced to yield 55 basis points over US government bonds. Syndicate managers described the pricing as cheap and the spread tightened to around 50 basis points once the bonds were freed to trade. 'These bonds were priced to clear,' said one trader. 'The market is still difficult but the general feeling is that if you can pick your spot and price to recognise market conditions then you can get your deal done,' said another. Intelsat makes rare appearances in the eurobond markets. In March this year it brought a 10-year Dollars 200m bond offering, which was priced, launched and syndicated in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan). That deal, which was offered at the tighter spread of 37 basis points over the US Treasury bond, was not seen as a success at the time. It was important, therefore, that yesterday's deal was a success, syndicate managers said. Morgan Guaranty Trust tapped the shorter end of the dollar sector with a Dollars 200m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 19 basis points over US government bonds. Syndicate managers said the bonds were fairly priced. Lead manager J. P. Morgan said it had sold Dollars 60m of its own allocation of Dollars 136m and had only taken back Dollars 10m of the Dollars 64m allocated to other banks. Demand came from Swiss and Benelux retail investors, and to a lesser extent from the Middle East and Germany. Goldman Sachs and CS First Boston have cut 25 basis points from the 40 basis points launch spread on the Dollars 200m Reed Elsevier five-year bond issued last month, after news of the company's takeover and possible credit rating downgrading. Two deals were launched in the lira sector, despite turbulence resulting from recent political developments in Italy. Deutsche Finance Netherlands opted for the two-year maturity with a L200bn deal offering an 11 per cent coupon. Lead manager Deutsche Bank London reported very strong demand, sparked by both the high coupon and the short maturity. 'No one wants to go long in these markets,' said a syndicate official at Deutsche Bank London. Deutsche Bank London also lead-managed another lira offering, this time at the 10-year maturity for KfW, Germany's state-owned development aid bank. This deal is fungible with an L200bn issue brought earlier this year and was said by Deutsche to have met with a good response, mostly from German retail investors who benefit from a tax exemption. Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers, one of India's largest fertiliser producers, yesterday raised Dollars 55m with an offering of global depositary receipts, lead-managed by Crosby Securities. J. K. Corp, the Indian industrial conglomerate, also announced a Dollars 55m GDR programme, lead-managed by BZW.</p>

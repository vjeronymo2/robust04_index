			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / People: Departures The resignation of Kenneth Jackson as director of corporate affairs at Tarmac provides further evidence that the ailing construction and building materials group is under new management. With Neville Simms, group chief executive, firmly in the driving seat at the group's stately Hilton Hall headquarters in Staffordshire, Jackson's departure reflects his close partnership with Sir Eric Pountain, the colourful Black Country boss who steered Tarmac to success in the 1980s. Earlier this year, however, against a backdrop of collapsing profits, Pountain agreed to step aside to become part-time chairman. Jackson, with Tarmac for 16 years, played a big role in its expansion and helped lead the fight to win the channel tunnel contract. He cites 'managerial and procedural changes' as the reason for his departure and is being replaced by Sean Bruin, formerly investor relations director at Dowty. ***** Tony Pexton, production and engineering director of SCOTTISH POWER, is to retire at the end of the year. ***** Rex Baker has resigned as finance director of GIBBS MEW. ***** Graham Maw has left EDMOND HOLDINGS; Ian Dennett has resigned as a director and is on sick leave. ***** James Langford has retired from COSTAIN GROUP. ***** David Maroni has resigned from ACORN COMPUTER GROUP.</p>

Jonas  Savimbi's troops are suffering heavy losses on the ground. Our  correspondent Abel Abraao reports:    [Abraao] Kuito is still under intense shelling. While  Jonas Savimbi's rebel organization continues shelling the  defenseless residents, in the military field they are suffering  heavy losses because the government forces have had enough of  the provocations of National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] bandits. This was revealed to our  news desk by Brigadier Damiano Mocume, second commander of the  Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] regional command in Bie.  Brigadier Mocume told Radio Nacional de Angola that over the  past few hours the FAA intercepted and destroyed four vehicles  carrying war materiel south of the city of Kuito.

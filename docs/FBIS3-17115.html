In the conversation with Umanets, Mikhailov blamed the  breaking of the time-table for nuclear fuel delivery to Ukraine  on Russia's failure to settle accounts with a fuel producing  plant in Novosibirsk (East Siberia).    Umanets also reported that by his information the  Novosibirsk  plant was interested in the Ukrainian market since Ukraine had  always been one of its major clients. He declined to give  concrete figures on fuel shipments on the ground that such  information is classified.    He pointed out that the construction of a nuclear fuel plant  in Ukraine was "an urgent national task." In his opinion,  Ukraine has everything that is needed to cope with the task,  including uranium ore, "which has been supplied to Russia and  returned as ready-made fuel."    "The price at which we buy fuel in Russia amounts to 64  percent of the prime cost of electricity generated in Ukraine.  With the commencement of a state fuel producing plant, this  indicator could be almost halved," Umanets said.    In his words, feasibility tests on such a project are to be  completed this year.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Pounds 2.3m of memory chips stolen Computer memory chips worth Pounds 2.3m were stolen over the weekend from a Renfrewshire electronics company owned by the Red Cross. The raid on the Haven Products factory in Greenock is believed to be the largest in a series of chip thefts throughout Europe in recent months. Strathclyde Police said at least three raiders - masked and brandishing metal bars - held the factory security guard hostage while they loaded boxes of memory chips from the stores into a Haven Products lorry stolen from another site. Haven Products was founded in 1946 to provide work for people wounded in the second world war. It was taken over by the British Red Cross in the early 1960s and employs 150 people, of whom 90 are disabled.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Vietnam's new constitution recognises free enterprise VIETNAM'S national assembly yesterday approved a new constitution which enshrines the market-oriented economic reforms undertaken since the late 1980s. In the best communist tradition, the vote was reported by the state media to have been unanimous, although hardline deputies wary of capitalism fought a stiff rearguard action over the last three weeks and delayed the final vote for several days. The new constitution drops the dogmatic left-wing language of the 1980 version it replaces and explicitly recognises the right of citizens to engage in private business. The exact wording of the text was not known last night, but the latest public drafts contain guarantees against nationalisation and grant the Vietnamese the constitutional right to travel freely; for the time being, however, they still need exit visas to leave the country. The national assembly gains increased powers but the Communist Party retains responsibility for guiding the state and 'leading the workers. . . according to Marxism-Leninism and the thought of Ho Chi Minh (the late Vietnamese communist leader).' Even the party is expected to act in accordance with the law and the constitution. 'Sometimes the party interferes, sometimes there's a phone call from up above,' said Mrs Ngo Ba Tanh, the reformist who chairs the law commission of the national assembly. Outright private ownership of property is still not recognised but farmers have the right to transfer their land to their heirs. Vietnam has attracted intense interest from foreign investors in the past three years but a US economic embargo remains an obstacle to more rapid growth.</p>

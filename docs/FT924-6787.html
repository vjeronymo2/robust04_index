			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Sandvik declines by 21% at nine months SANDVIK, the Swedish speciality steel and carbide group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent decline in nine months profits (after financial items) to SKr1.17bn (Dollars 195.5m) from SKr1.48bn for the first nine months of 1991. Turnover fell by 5 per cent to SKr12.47bn, with part of the decline due to the strength of the krona. Group order intake totalled SKr12.67bn for the January-September period, down from SKr13.28bn for the same months of 1991. Sandvik warned that net profit for this year would fall short of SKr1.5bn. Last year the group made SKr1.9bn after tax. It said there was a decline in sales in most product areas with the biggest drop in value coming in the steel division where sales tumbled to SKr3.78bn from SKr4.2bn. By contrast sales in saws and tools rose by 42 per cent to SKr1.52bn. Sandvik recorded a 13 per cent improvement in invoiced sales in Sweden to SKr981m from SKr865m but its most successful expansion took place in Latin America with 27 per cent growth to SKr697m. There was a 13 per cent drop in the demand for its goods in North America to SKr2.04bn and a more modest 3 per cent setback in the EC to SKr5.57bn. The group recorded a SKr1.0bn rise in liquid assets in the nine months to SKr5.8bn. Return on investment was 10.4 per cent compared with 13.1 per cent for the whole of last year. Earnings per share calculated after full tax totalled SKr22.6 over the past twelve months. Sandvik also announced yesterday it had reached agreement with SKF, the Swedish rolling bearing company, for the sale of SKF's 80 per cent interest in CTT Tools to Sandvik at the end of this year. CTT Tools reported sales last year of SKr1.9bn and employs 3,900 people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Amir Taheri in London, </F> Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa, Nura Fakhuri and Taj-al-Din  'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi, and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden  and Cairo: "Failure of the Meeting between Zayid and al-Ahmar  Speeds Up United Arab Emirates' Official Recognition of  Democratic Yemen; Salih Tries to Impose `Legitimacy' by  Penetrating Hadramaut and Splitting the Socialist Party]    [Excerpts] The Yemeni war raged on yesterday while the  search continued for a diplomatic solution that would determine  the fate and future of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY].  Indications at both levels are that the Sanaa leadership is  determined to impose what it sees as "legitimate and  constitutional" by all means including opening a front in  Hadramaut and trying to split the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  despite rejection by the southerners and the YSP leadership.  [passage omitted]    Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that the failure  of the meeting held between Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar  [Yemeni House of Representatives speaker, Yemeni Reform Grouping  leader, and Hashid tribes chieftain], and [United Arab Emirates  President] Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan might speed up  the official recognition of the new southern state in Yemen  because al-Ahmar's visit was "Sanaa's last card to clear the air  with Abu-Dhabi, which has frankly held 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  responsible for the continuation of the fighting."    Diplomatic observers say that "nobody can succeed where  al-Ahmar failed because of al-Ahmar's close personal  relationship with Shaykh Zayid and his tribal weight in the  region." Al-Ahmar's statement after the meeting reflected his  extreme annoyance because 'Ali Salim al-Bid had been described  as president. He said "that is a very big word, and it is an  insult to Yemen." Despite his implicit criticism of the United  Arab Emirates, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar said at his press  conference: "I do not believe that any Arab or friendly state  would recognize the secession."    Al-Ahmar emphasized that resorting to military means to  settle the issue "was the last choice in the interest of  safeguarding Yemen's unity." He added that "Yemen does not  reject mediation to stop the war provided it is in the context  of legitimacy." He denied the rumors about the possibility of a  meeting between President Salih and the southern leader 'Ali  Salim al-Bid. He said that "it would be improper to hold a  meeting between the president and a mutineer."    Al-Ahmar rejected intervention by the Security Council in  the  Yemeni conflict. He said: "What has the Security Council to do  with an internal issue?" But he avoided the pitfall in which  Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister  and member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the  General People's Congress [GPC] -- President Salih's party --  slipped when he accused foreign powers of aiding the mutineering  secessionists. Shaykh 'Abdallah did not apportion any blame in  that respect.    The Yemeni House of Representatives speaker denied the  presence of any extremist forces in Yemen. He said that Sanaa  has given the United States assurances on that and got from it  an assurance of support for Yemeni unity. He also denied that  former south Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was offered  the post of president. He said: "'Ali Nasir Muhammad is a  patriotic leader but we do not offer posts to anyone. The way  is open for everyone to serve the homeland." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the provision that requires an UST owner and operator to perform a site assessment in order to apply for an extension 12 months after entering temporary closure (if a substandard UST or UST system has not been replaced or upgraded) was to allow a variance mechanism for UST owners to avoid permanent closure of tanks, on a case-by-case basis. The reason for requiring the site assessment before applying for an extension was based on EPA's concerns that prior contamination could have occurred and could continue to spread from a temporarily closed UST system. Although a holder would not be required to comply with EPA's UST corrective action regulations if contamination is discovered (provided, of course, the holder satisfies the requirements of this proposed rule), it would be required to report evidence of the contamination to the implementing agency (as discussed in the following subsection), who can then decide on the appropriate course of action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of course, a holder may choose to continue to operate the UST by storing or dispensing product after foreclosure, or otherwise not exercise either of the options described above. The holder may determine that its interests will be best served by forgoing the security interest exemption, continuing operation of the UST system, and perhaps realizing a greater return of capital on the security interest by selling the property with the UST system as a going concern. In such cases, the tank would be regulated in the same manner as a tank operated by any other person, and the holder would be fully responsible as an operator for compliance with RCRA subtitle I regulations, including corrective action, the UST technical standards, and financial responsibility requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the environment is adequately protected where a holder chooses either of the post-foreclosure options described above for complying with the technical requirements of Subtitle I. Where the tank is removed from service and emptied of its contents, the threat of an unknown or undetected leak resulting in environmental contamination is abated; accordingly, the Agency believes it is appropriate to exempt a foreclosing holder from UST corrective action regulatory requirements under these circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Lenders in Foreclosure Upon the Effective Date of the Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency recognizes that some lenders may already hold UST properties through foreclosure or its equivalents at the time the final rule is promulgated. Although EPA is primarily concerned about the future availability of capital to UST owners and operators, rather than loans that have already been extended, the Agency recognizes that holders may be concerned about their potential liability associated with current holdings acquired through foreclosure or its equivalents affecting the extension of future UST loans. A holder who possesses an UST property at the time the rule is promulgated may have tanks that still store product. It would be difficult to determine whether or not contamination caused by a release from such tanks had occurred during the time that the holder had possession of the UST property. A holder, therefore, could potentially be held liable as an UST operator if he has possession of a tank at the time the final rule is promulgated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on this aspect of today's proposal. We are interested in collecting data that will clarify whether future UST loan decisions would be negatively affected if the security interest exemption is not extended to holders possessing UST properties through foreclosure or its equivalents upon promulgation of this rule. In addition, EPA is interested in comments addressing whether and how an exemption from the UST regulatory requirements could be structured for holders of such tanks. Finally, we are also interested in receiving comments addressing the extent to which such a regulatory exemption could impact human health and the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Release Reporting Requirements Following Foreclosure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under today's proposal, upon foreclosure, a holder taking advantage of the proposed exemption from corrective action regulations must nevertheless comply with the requirement in &sect;280.50 that the discovery of any releases from the UST be reported to the implementing agency. Only the reporting requirement must be followed; the holder need not comply with &sect;280.52, despite the reference to that provision in &sect;280.50. The release reporting requirement of &sect;280.50 is part of Subpart E, which details the obligations for reporting known or suspected releases, investigating off-site impacts, confirming that a release has occurred, and cleaning up spills and overfills. While subpart E generally implements Subtitle I's corrective action and site investigation requirements, from which a holder may be excluded under today's proposed rule, &sect;280.50 has historically been viewed by EPA as part of the UST technical standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A holder is responsible, following foreclosure or its equivalents, for reporting to the implementing agency, any discovery of released regulated substances, or any suspected release at an UST site or in the surrounding area. Such reporting is considered necessary to ensure protection of human health and the environment. By informing the implementing agency of a release, the implementing agency can then determine the appropriate response action, if any. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the absence of today's proposed rule, a holder would have to perform release investigation and confirmation in accordance with &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.53. Under today's proposal, a holder who chooses to take the tank(s) out of service as described in this proposal is required to follow the procedures established in &sect;280.50 but is not subject to the release investigation and confirmation requirements in &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.53. A holder who elects to keep the tank(s) in operation is obligated to comply with all of the Subpart E requirements, including those related to release investigation and confirmation, and corrective action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Other textiles barriers must come down Sir, The policy adviser to Christian Aid, Mr Peter Madden, in his letter on textiles in the Uruguay Round (November 23) omits one vital point. Agreement to phase out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade multi-fibre agreement (MFA) is dependent on action being taken at the same time to remove other barriers - many of them far more stringent - which restrict international trade in textiles and clothing, not least in developing countries. The linkage was recognised by all the Gatt contracting parties when the original Punta Del Este declaration initiating the round was drawn up, and remains an essential component of any final agreement. Import bans and prohibitively high tariffs (many currently exceeding 100 per cent) can have no place in the post-Uruguay Round world. Their removal will stimulate development of trade between less developed countries and this will provide at least as great a stimulus to their economies as will the phasing out of the MFA. It will also, together with the equally necessary reduction of peak tariffs by developed countries, enable our own industry to seize essential new export opportunities. Time is running very short to allow a complex set of tariff negotiations to be completed by December 15. It is time for all concerned to knuckle down to some serious bargaining.

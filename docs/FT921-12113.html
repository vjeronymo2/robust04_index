			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady UK money market rates were steady yesterday, with sterling's stability on the foreign exchange markets continuing to dampen speculation about the need for higher interest rates, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn early in the session, revised up to Pounds 1.1bn. The main factor was maturing repurchase agreements, draining Pounds 674m from the market. Exchequer transactions, the main component of which is taxation payments, added a net Pounds 265m funds to the market. In spite of the substantial shortage, there was no clamour for funds and the Bank of England refrained from early assistance. Later in the morning, Pounds 265m was injected, through the outright purchase of band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 177m paper purchased for resale to the market on February 12 and 13 at 10 7/16 per cent. Afternoon assistance totalled Pounds 207m, again through the purchase of band 1 and band 2 bills, all at 10 3/8 per cent, continuing the recent trend for relieving liquidity shortages with the very shortest maturity paper. A late liquidity injection of Pounds 400m brought the total assistance for the day to Pounds 872m, around Pounds 228m less than the forecast drain of funds. The unsecured overnight money rate rose from a shade over 11 per cent to 13 per cent by early afternoon. However, the late injection of funds removed any pressure for higher short rates and overnight money was trading at 11 1/4 -11 per cent by the close. Three months inter-bank funds traded at 10- 9/16 per cent; one month inter-bank money was at 10 13/16 - 9/16 per cent, from 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent on Friday. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange was slightly stronger, closing at 89.74, from 89.69 on Friday. In Frankfurt, call money rates were marginally higher at 9.50/60 per cent from 9.45/55 per cent at the end of last week and the 9.40/50 per cent level which prevailed for several days. Pension payments are expected to drain funds from the market this week and the call money rate is expected to stay at between 9.55 and 9.65 per cent. However, so far market conditions appear to be comfortable, following the Bundesbank's decision to raise rates on December 19.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Scale charges framework is scrapped - Company Cars SOME 700,000 drivers face increases in their company car tax benefit bills, in a few cases of about a half, compared with currently when the new business car taxation structure takes effect from April 6 1994. However, the remainder of the UK's 2m company car driver population can expect to see their bills fall by up to a third compared with the current tax year. The new structure, which disregards some of the key elements in outline proposals for reform put out by the Inland Revenue last year, will give fresh incentive to companies to examine cash alternatives to the company car  -at least for some categories of user. Hardest hit will be senior executives with cars currently costing about Pounds 19,000 and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles annually. Typical beneficiaries will be junior executives, driving cheaper cars for more than 2,500 business miles. This outcome is the result of a revised taxation structure under which, to the relief of accountants, fleet managers and most car makers, the current awkward system of scale charges - arrived at through engine capacity and price banding - is scrapped. In its place will come one based on a simple 35 per cent of all cars' list prices. This level was marginally higher than proposed by the Revenue. Drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles will have a discount of a third on their assessment; drivers covering more than 18,000 a discount of two-thirds. This of itself might not please individual taxpayers. But in also rejecting the Revenue's proposal to retain banding, albeit based only on price and with a dozen bands, Mr Lamont has certainly pleased much of the motor industry. It should end 'tax break specials' and other market-distorting factors which have been criticised by, among others, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and which have arisen from price 'breakpoints', at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the assessed tax benefit rises sharply. It is also self-adjusting, ending much of the sales-depressing market uncertainty that in the past has always surrounded Budget time, as company car makers, dealers and buyers have waited to see what the latest scale charge increases would be. Under the new system, the increase in taxation will automatically be determined by inflation - as new car prices rise, the assessed tax benefit will rise in proportion. In terms of the new system's long-term effects, one important 'unknown' for the vehicle industry will not be clarified until it has been operative for some time. Will it lead to a general company car 'downsizing' as a result of company car drivers having more flexibility in choosing the size of their tax bill? Should it do so on any significant scale, vehicle makers may yet come to regret their current support for the changes. Makers of luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce will be hurt by the lack of a 'cap' on the list price formula. Currently, the tax charge on a Pounds 100,000 Rolls-Royce is the same as on a Pounds 35,000 Jaguar. When the scheme arrives, increases for company car drivers will be less draconian than they might appear, because of the 8 per cent increase in the scale charges under the current system announced for the 1993-94 tax year. But Mr Lamont is stepping firmly on the least defensible company car 'perk'  -free fuel for private motoring. The scale charge for that shoots up by 20 per cent, and out goes the 50 per cent reduction in the scale charge for high business mileage users. Both are well above inflation, and their introduction will mean the government then will regard company car users as fairly taxed relative to private motorists. This is well above current inflation, and when it comes in next month will mean the Government then regarding company car users as fairly taxed relative to private motorists. Despite the uneven impact of the new regime in 1994, it is not intended to tighten the screw of company car taxation, in real terms, any further. There will, however, be some disappointment that the business mileage bands were not adjusted. Under next year's scheme, clear 'perk' car users, those covering fewer than 2,500 business miles a year, will pay tax at their marginal rate on the full 35 per cent of a car's list price. The main problem comes with the middle band, representing around 1.35m of the total, covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a year. What then becomes self-defeating in terms of business costs and efficiency, and even for the environment, is that there is then a strong temptation for such employees to invent unnecessary business trips solely to reach the 18,000 mile threshold.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company car taxation changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Car                                              Jaguar XJ12 Cylinder capacity                                    6,000cc Typical driver                              Company chairman Marginal rate of tax paid                                40% Annual buiness mileage                       Less than 2,500 List price                                     pounds 46,000                             Scale charge     Actual tax paid Current                    pounds 13,950        pounds 5,580 New (1993/4)               pounds 15,066        pounds 6,026 New (1994/5)               pounds 16,100        pounds 6,440  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Car                                            Mercedes 280E Cylinder capacity                                    2,800cc Typical driver                             Managing director Marginal rate of tax paid                                40% Annual buiness mileage                          2,500-18,000 List price                                     pounds 28,600                             Scale charge     Actual tax paid Current                     pounds 5,750        pounds 2,300 New (1993/4)                pounds 6,210        pounds 2,484 New (1994/5)                pounds 6,673        pounds 2,670  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Car                                        Rover 820 Vitesse Cylinder capacity                                    2,000cc Typical driver                                       Manager Marginal rate of tax paid                                25% Annual buiness mileage                          2,500-18,000 List price                                     pounds 19,695                             Scale charge     Actual tax paid Current                     pounds 2,770          pounds 693 New (1993/4)                pounds 2,992          pounds 748 New (1994/5)                pounds 4,596        pounds 1,149  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Car                                                Metro 1.1 Cylinder capacity                                    1,100cc Typical driver                                District nurse Marginal rate of tax paid                                25% Annual buiness mileage                           Over 18,000 List price                                      pounds 6,670                             Scale charge     Actual tax paid Current                     pounds 1,070          pounds 268 New (1993/4)                pounds 1,156          pounds 289 New (1994/5)                  pounds 778          pounds 195  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

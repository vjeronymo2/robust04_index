			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Arts: The remarkable Mark Morris - Clement Crisp on the American choreographer's L'Allegro at the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh It is one of the most encouraging and most imaginative things about the Edinburgh Festival that it should have established a special relationship with Mark Morris. This year brings his third consecutive appearance at the Festival. And this year Lothian Regional Council and the Foundation for Sports and the Arts have initiated an educational project (funded by ScottishPower) which will provide classroom sessions and further involvement with the Morris company to children and older students. There is talk of another Morris visit next year. Such patronage and Festival support argues a sense of responsibility and respect for a major artist - and his public - which can bring wonderful rewards. Morris' offering this year is that luminous L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato which he staged as his first offering when he took up residence in Brussels in 1988. Morris was not the man for the Brussels public, hankering after that other Maurice (Bejart) who had been their dance-guru for a quarter of a century, but the Monnaie opera house, where he was installed as Bejart's successor, provided a fine stage and tremendous musical forces. Morris seized the moment. His affection for - and wonderfully imaginative response to - baroque music could be properly satisfied with the means he had gained. So he chose to realise L'Allegro ed il Penseroso, Handel's setting of Milton (in the admittedly somewhat compromised version made by Charles Jennens, whose advocacy of moderation provides some earnest but blessedly brief versifying for il Moderato). The resultant piece, given in December 1988, was a joy, and I reported on it with great pleasure. Here was a choreographer, already remarkable for his ability to clothe music with sensitive movement, at full stretch, grandly responsive to an important score. Now L'Allegro has been brought to Edinburgh, in two performances at the Festival Theatre at the weekend, with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Edinburgh Schola Cantorum, and soloists under Gareth Jones - and it looked splendid indeed. The Brussels' designs have been retained. Adrianne Lobel's succession of gauzes turn the stage into a magical arena where blocks of pure colour are both dramatic and allusive. James Ingalls' lighting is a marvel in illuminating the dance while still creating atmosphere. Christine van Loon's clothes are simple, always apt, lightly flowing. An uncompromised clarity is the most obvious quality of Morris' dances for his cast of 12 men and 12 women. The effect comes from his decision that words should find immediate theatrical life in gesture and movement, that as a voice sings 'ivy-crowned' dancers will briefly sketch a crown on their heads, that 'Jest and youthful Jollity' should mean just that in steps and capers. Morris is looking back to those 'music visualisations' which were part of the first naive strivings of American Modern Dance, but his manner places such genuine innocence within a vastly sophisticated context. At his most powerful and most searching, the images open out on to the European pastoral tradition, and to much older ideals about dance. His hunting scene, inspired by 'To listen how the hounds and horn/Cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn/From the side of some hoar hill', reaches back to Renaissance festivities, as dancers impersonate trees, hill, hounds, quarry. The closing ring dances evoke those theological ideals of celestial harmony which occupied the Fathers of the church. Morris' choreography renews the past for us with a radiant assurance: it is effortlessly both then and now. In everything Morris respects words as well as score. Clear textures, quickly passing imagery, a certain modesty of means - no bravura; no rodomontade - are the keynotes to the work. The swathes of group dances which bring the piece to its close - chains, rings, long lines of simplest movement - are powerful evidence of his command of effects. Here we see him, in Milton's words, 'Untwisting all the chains that tie/The hidden soul of harmony'. Morris clothes the hidden in beautifully visible dance. Harmony reigns. The musical performance under Gareth Jones was stylish. The singers were pleasing - though in a work where every word counts so that we may savour what Morris does with it, I wish that diction had been uniformly exact. The Morris company dancers were dedicated, and very fine.</p>

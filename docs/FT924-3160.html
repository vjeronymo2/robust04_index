			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BA bid for 25% of Qantas expected today BRITISH AIRWAYS is today expected to make a bid for a 25 per cent stake in Qantas, the Australian national carrier due to be privatised next year. The BA board met yesterday and is understood to have agreed the bid. A formal notification will be made today, the Australian government's deadline for bids from foreign airlines for a stake in Qantas. BA is expected to face stiff competition from Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand. Under the Australian government's rules, the maximum stake a foreign carrier can acquire is 25 per cent, thought to be worth between ADollars 600m and ADollars 750m (Pounds 340m) depending on the Australian government's decision on how much it is prepared to recapitalise the airline before privatisation. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said yesterday that a partnership between the UK carrier and Qantas would make 'a very good fit'. Qantas would give BA a much stronger presence in the Asia-Pacific market which continues to show the fastest growth of any aviation market. Sir Colin sought to dampen Australian fears that BA was seeking to take control of Qantas. 'There seems to be a misconception in Australia that our only interest is in taking over Qantas. It isn't. Qantas will remain an Australian airline under Australian control.' The US government is expected to make a decision by Christmas on BA's proposed acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 493m). Sir Colin said USAir had called an extraordinary meeting on December 18 to approve the partnership. The deal continues to face fierce opposition from the big three US airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.</p>

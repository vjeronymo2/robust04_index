			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Economics: Spotlight falls on UK economy THE recession-struck UK economy will be centre stage again this week, with the usual mid-month welter of statistics. Key data include the December manufacturing output and industrial production figures published on Friday. These form the basis of the much awaited fourth-quarter GDP figures due on February 20 which are widely expected to show flat or negative non-oil growth - the sixth successive quarterly decline. Today's credit business figures will be watched closely for signs of a pick-up in consumer confidence in December. Another net repayment is expected following a reduction in the demand for credit in the three months to November. Attention will also focus on the inflationary pressures which remain in the economy with underlying earnings expected to touch a new low of 7.25 per cent, the lowest annual rate recorded since 1981. In the US, optimists on prospects for economic growth this year are unlikely to find much succour for their views in this week's statistics. January retail sales are expected to remain dormant following a disappointing Christmas sales season. But inflation has continued to decelerate with the producer price index for January likely to remain unchanged. Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of City forecasts in brackets, from MMS International, a financial information company, include: Today: UK, final retail sales for December (down 1.0 per cent), December credit business (net repayment of Pounds 50m).

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Fall in demand hits Matsushita and Sony MATSUSHITA and Sony, two of the world's leading consumer electronics companies, yesterday reported sharp declines in pre-tax profits for the year ended March as demand continued to be severely depressed in major markets. They warned that conditions were unlikely to improve significantly in the current year. Both companies were also under considerable strain from higher depreciation costs, including amortisation resulting from their acquisition of important film studios in the US and from the yen's sharp appreciation in the past year. Matsushita, the world's largest electronics group, reported a 54 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y168.4bn (Dollars 1.52bn) from the previous year. Sales were down 5 per cent to Y7,055.9bn, while net profits decreased 71 per cent to Y38.4bn. Sony saw a 57 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y92.6bn on sales up 1.6 per cent at Y3,993bn. Net profits fell 70 per cent to Y36.3bn. The sharp fall was partly due to an extraordinary gain from sales of shares in a subsidiary the previous year. The 6 per cent appreciation of the yen during the period also had a significant impact. Sony, which is dependent on exports for 66 per cent of sales, said that the yen's appreciation had resulted in a Y154bn decline in revenues. For Matsushita, which has an export ratio of 36 per cent, the impact was just Y7.3bn. Both companies faced difficulty in the market for audio and video equipment. Matsushita also saw declines in most of its other product areas such as home appliances, electronic components and entertainment. The group was hit by restructuring costs for JVC, the troubled audio-visual affiliate, and by costs relating to defective refrigerators sold by another subsidiary. Sony said that in the past six months it had sold 240,000 units of the MiniDisc, one of its newest products. One area in which Sony did particularly well in contrast to Matsushita was in the entertainment field. Sony's film division increased sales by 16 per cent in yen terms and 25 per cent on a dollar basis. Sony's music division, reported a slight decline in yen but a 16 per cent increase on a local currency basis. Meanwhile Matsushita's entertainment division, which includes MCA studios, reported a 3 per cent sales decline in yen terms although this would have been a slight increase on a dollar basis. Both Matsushita and Sony are cutting costs to meet what they expect will be continued weakness in their markets. Capital expenditure has been nearly halved at Sony while Matsushita has been reducing the number of product models it offers as well as other costs. Matsushita is forecasting flat sales for next year at Y7,060bn on a consolidated basis and a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y210bn. Sony is forecasting a 2 per cent decline in sales to Y3,910bn and a 6 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y87bn due in part to higher interest charges.</p>

Russian officials attending the four-day talks explained  that  to ensure the safety of flights over Siberia it is necessary to  limit the number to six per hour, even though new facilities  have been built to enhance the reliability of communications  equipment.    The Russian officials suggested that a parallel route could  be established over Siberia that would allow nine filghts an  hour, but Japan said the proposal would require building new  radar facilities.    However, Japan said it would consider the proposal. The two  countries will meet again in mid-March.    A Japanese Transport Ministry official said Friday that  officials were unaware that translators were being used. They  stressed that the need for improved traffic control in the  Siberian route will increase with the opening of the Kansai  International Airport in September.    Russia, citing the diminished reliability of its  communication facilities, has been restricting the number of  commercial flights over Siberia since December to six per hour,  only a third of the previous volume of traffic.    The restriction initially caused delays of as much as two  and  a half hours for flights in and out of Narita Airport, and even  though the situation has improved since then, flight delays of  30 to 40 minutes are still common, officials said.    The Siberian route is the main air route linking Japan and  Europe, used daily by some 40 to 50 airliners both into and out  of Tokyo.</p>

After the meeting, which  lasted about 75 minutes, Ross said they discussed the PLO's  commitment to resuming the peace negotiations and its commitment  to the Declaration of Principles. He said they also discussed a  number of topics, including Palestinian concerns about the  situation in the occupied territories and commitments related to  the peace process. Ross said that the most important thing is to  finish these negotiations and start implementing the Declaration  of Principles. What concerns us, he said, is to see a change in  the situation on the ground, new realities in the region, and  the implementation of the Declaration of Principles.    Before meeting with 'Arafat, Ross met with the Israeli  delegation led by Jacques Neriya, the Israeli prime minister's  adviser, who arrived in Tunis today.</p>

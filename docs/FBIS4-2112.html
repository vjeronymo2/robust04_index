			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This year  is the peak launching year of China's space industry. China  successfully launched the Long March 3-A rocket carrying one  satellite on 8 February and will launch another five domestic  and foreign satellites with five Long March carrier rockets this  year.    During the first half of this year, China will use Long  March  No 3 and Long March No 3-A carrier rockets to launch a domestic  meteorological satellite, the "Fengyun No 2," and a new type of  domestic telecommunications satellite, the "Dongfanghong No 3."    China has already launched two "Fengyun No 1" meteorological  satellites. "Fengyun No 2" is the first static orbit  meteorological satellite, and it can be used to observe an  approximately 100 million square km of the earth surface, with  China as the center. Compared with "Dongfanghong No 2," which  China previously launched, the "Dongfanghong No 3"  telecommunications satellite has a longer life and greater  capacity. It has 24 C-wave band transmitters for television,  telephone, telegram, and fax transmissions and other  telecommunications operations.    During the second half of this year, China will launch three  foreign satellites. A Long March No 3 carrier rocket will be  used to launch the telecommunications satellite "Asia-Pacific No  1," and two Long March No 2 bundled rockets will be used to  launch the "Aussat B-3" and the telecommunications satellite  "Asia-Pacific No 2."</p>

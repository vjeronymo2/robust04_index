			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Technology: Screen debut for journey into space Football teams visiting British Aerospace's Woodford plant in Cheshire know all about the sloping pitch, but not even the home side realised until recently that they were playing on a parallelogram. The revelation that one end of the pitch was 3m askew from the other came from a survey of the 480-acre site. Sophisticated electronic logging equipment charted the discrepancy in the course of plotting the site down to the nearest inch or two. The survey was the prelude to a new computer-aided approach to managing the facilities adopted at the site over the past two years. Manual drawings of the airfield and the assembly facilities nearby have been almost entirely replaced by a Pounds 200,000 computer-aided design (Cad) system from Isicad, a specialist in cable and facilities design, planning and management. Mike Fursey, Woodford's facilities planning manager, says BAe is already benefiting from the Isicad system, particularly when investigating the implications of change anywhere on the site, part of the airlines division at BAe Commercial Aircraft. Isicad's deal with Woodford took about two years to come to fruition, and illustrates the challenges for manufacturing companies in selecting the right equipment and software. It also shows how the use of computer-aided solutions in more 'central' areas such as product development and design - increasingly well-established over the past decade - are spreading quietly into support areas which have, until more recently, made do with their drawing boards. Either way, one aim is to save time by cutting out laborious manual work. But, as has happened with the use of computer-aided design and manufacturing, the Isicad system goes beyond that: 'It enables them (BAe) to do a hell of a lot that they would not have attempted before,' says Gerry Berks, Isicad UK business development director. One recent problem Fursey and his team were asked to address involved a proposal to turn a disused short runway into a parking space for aircraft. Calculating whether aircraft would have enough space to manoeuvre while adhering to clearance regulations would have been a task bordering on the farcical without the system, involving leaking paintpots hung from the end of the wings to trace their path. Instead, the Isicad system enabled the team to show within a day that the runway could be used as a parking space with minor widening. One of the benefits of such a system is the ability to take real measurements off the screen once the initial surveys have been completed. The team at Woodford had decided early in 1988 that it could no longer cope with the site's scope and complexity using existing manual systems, and opted for a computer-based solution rather than an increase in staff. With the help of the Advanced Manufacturing &amp; Technology Research Institute, BAe decided that workstations powered by a minicomputer would be best for its needs, giving more power than a PC-based system, and more dependability than a mainframe for use at all hours. The Woodford site now has two Isicad workstations. The entire airfield has been surveyed, along with most of a new assembly complex. Work is starting on including the flight sheds. The system is proving particularly useful for office reorganisations. The time taken to produce agreed layouts can be reduced from three months to less than a week. Comparative costings can also be provided at an early stage in a project's planning, as basic data on the cost of paint and ceiling systems are stored in the system. Reorganising aircraft manufacture is a difficult business. Working out whether aircraft wings can be manoeuvred past stanchions and over low buildings might normally have involved laborious construction of full-sized cardboard mock-ups. With BAe's decision to move final assembly of the 146 airliner to Woodford, the implications of reorganised production can be explored more quickly on screen.</p>

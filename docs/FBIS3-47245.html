			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu pledged more voluntary contributions to UN  aid for refugees in addition to manpower donations Monday.    Han promised visiting UN High Commissioner for Refugees  Sadako Ogata wider assistance for the commission, said Ham  Myong-chol, director-general of international organizations.    Seoul's contribution to the United Nations as a member state  accounts for 0.69 percent of the U.N. budget, but its voluntary  donations to other international bodies such as the commission  is 0.04 percent.    Korea gave 150,000 U.S. dollars to the commission last year,  when it joined the convention on better protection and welfare  of the refugees. This ranks 28th among the 48 contributor  nations.    While increasing the amount of monetary donations, Han said,  the government could send medical and other emergency aid teams  to troubled areas.    These teams may be sent as part of youth volunteer programs  at the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), a Foreign  Ministry umbrella institution, he said.</p>

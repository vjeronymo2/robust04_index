The  present stage is crucial, says the article.    As the country's traditional highly centralized economic  system is being dismantled and a market economy is shaping up,  economic management is undergoing changes.    Different forms of ownership now co-exist, with State-owned  industries playing a dominant role.    Market forces are deciding the distribution of materials and  output of enterprises.    The government is using economic and legal measures instead  of the traditional mandatory plans to regulate the country's  economy.    However, as conflicts and friction between the old and new  economic systems frequently occur, the achievements gained by  reform are being nibbled away by negative elements.    One of the most eye-catching problems is that some  government  administrative organizations are involved in running businesses,  causing chaos in management, incurring losses of State  properties, widening the income gap and bringing about  corruption.    Meanwhile, enterprises are often ordered, under different  pretexts, to pay various funds, fees and donations.    Random collection of funds, coupled with the boom in  non-governmental financial institutions, is burdening the  reforms because China still lacks laws and regulations to  standardize economic and financial activities.    The article in China Business Times says it is time to solve  the major problems in the reform and set up a sound economic  relationship.    Successful reform measures should be continued and new  packages should be drafted and put into effect in line with the  new circumstances, says the article.    At the same time, the reform should be given more  theoretical  direction. Traditional exploratory measures are not enough.    The article says that China's economic reform has  experienced  two stages in the past 15 years.    During the first stage, between 1979 and 1984, the country  tried hard to find reasonable measures for economic reform.    While the exploration proved fruitful, many new problems  emerged and mistakes were made due to the lack of experience.    The second stage, between 1985 and 1991, witnessed the  co-existence of exploratory measures and policy direction.    Now it is time that the country map out more policies to  guide the reform efficiently and equitably, the article says.  Overall policies should be introduced for the establishment of  the socialist market economy.    When mapping out new reform packages, market needs and  China's distinctive features should be taken as the major  concerns.    The article said the country's reform policies carried out  in  the past 15 years mainly originated from the practice of the  masses.    The two significant examples were the rural family contract  responsibility system and the shareholding system for  transferring management of State-owned enterprises, says the  article.    As the reform deepens, policy guidance has become  increasingly important.    At the same time, it is urgent that the legal system be  perfected.</p>

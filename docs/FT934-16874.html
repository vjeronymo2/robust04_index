			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP in fresh talks on Victoire UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group, has reopened negotiations with Suez, the financial and industrial holding company, over the future of Victoire, the French insurer in which the two groups have significant share stakes. The wrangle over Victoire, in which the Suez group has a majority holding and UAP a 34 per cent stake, has been one of France's most tortuous corporate sagas. UAP has for some time been pressing Suez to agree to exchange the former's Victoire shares for shares in Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire. The two companies last year came close to a deal, only to fall out at the last minute over the price. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, then announced that his group was withdrawing from negotiations. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP who was previously Mr Worms' boss as head of Suez, has since pressed for a resumption of the talks. On Friday, Suez issued a formal statement confirming that the two companies had 'recently resumed' negotiations over Victoire. The statement added that the talks had not yet been concluded but they were being 'actively pursued'. The reopening of negotiations comes at a critical time for Mr Peyrelevade. He has made no secret of his eagerness to conclude the Victoire affaire before the forthcoming privatisation of UAP, a state-controlled company which is on the government's list of sale candidates. The need to secure a successful conclusion has also been heightened by speculation that Mr Peyrelevade is a candidate to succeed Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, as chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group. Mr Haberer recently confirmed that he was considering quitting Credit Lyonnais. Mr Peyrelevade would be keen to secure a successful conclusion for the potentially embarrassing Victoire saga before leaving UAP.</p>

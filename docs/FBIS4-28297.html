			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["New `Operational Plan' Will Precipitate Their Own </F> Downfall" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today in  an article deals with the "operational plan to allure the U.S."  which was discussed at "a top-secret consultation" after a  "meeting of security-related ministers" held by the South Korean  puppets on November 10 last year. Branding it as a plan for the  provocation of a war, the author of the article says:    "Alluring the U.S." (miin) being the same with "a belle" in  pronunciation, one may misinterpret it as a "beauty operation"  for bewitching men by using beautiful women. But it means a  plan to allure the United States into "sanctions" and war  against the DPRK by leading the situation of the Korean  peninsula to the highest pitch of strain.    After the closet consultation dangerous war exercises  against  the North have been staged more openly on the ground and in the  sky and sea. This shows that the `operational plan' is being  carried into practice.    Holding such military confabs as "meeting of  security-related  ministers" one after another, the "civilian" warmaniacs let out  a torrent of bellicose words such as "a prompt reaction" and "a  tough response."    Some time ago, "Kim Yong-sam the traitor called to  "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] the puppet minister of  defence, the puppet chairman of the joint chiefs of Staff, the  chiefs of staff of the puppet Army, Navy and Airforce for a war  confab and ordered them to put the puppet Armed Forces on "a  stand-by alert," vociferating about "perfection" of preparations  for a war against the North with "a coopertion system" with the  United States. The puppets are even trumpeting "unification by  invading the North."    Having placed the entire puppet Armed Forces on "a stand-by  alert" the Kim Yong-sam group is discussing "UN sanctions" or  "multinational sanctions" with the masters,' while bringing  forward its own anti-national "policy of sanctions against the  North". This shows well what a reckless stage its frenzy of  northward invasion has reached.    The Kim Yong-sam group must ponder over the matter, mindful  that confrontation and war will precipitate its self-destruction.</p>

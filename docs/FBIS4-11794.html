			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel and David </F> Regev]    [Text] Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] troops in the Gaza Strip, and Colonel  Sh., commander of the Gaza Strip northern brigade, have ordered  the IDF commanders in the Strip to act in the future just as did  the undercover soldiers who killed six senior Fatah members two  days ago. There is no other method of operation in a  confrontation with masked and uniformed persons, the two said.    The two also recommended that the commanders of the  undercover unit give their soldiers a citation of merit for  their performance. The recommendation was made at the close of  the full debriefing of the incident.    A senior officer who was at the debriefing noted: "We made  it  clear to the force that its performance was remarkable. We must  remember, especially the bleeding hearts, that on Passover eve  one of our officers was shot in the abdomen and is still in  grave condition. The undercover unit was praised by the chief  of staff as well. It is impossible to make a distinction  between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]."    Following are the findings of the IDF debriefing:    -- Two hours before the incident, a hand grenade was thrown  at the IDF outpost in Jabalyah.    -- Over the past two weeks, 11 hand grenades and explosive  charges were thrown at that post.    -- The incident was not initiated by the undercover unit.  Its task was to guard the outpost.    -- The unit spotted six men who were wearing checkered  uniforms and masks -- in contradiction to the agreements made  over the past months between the IDF and Fatah.    -- The force opened fire at the six, four of whom were  holding loaded guns in their hands and aiming them at the  soldiers.    Despite the satisfaction in the IDF over the way the  soldiers  performed, there is serious embarrassment over the fact that the  dead men were senior Fatah members who supported the peace  process.    Immediately after the incident, Gen. Almog met with the Gaza  Strip Fatah commanders. Among others, he met with Sufyan  Abu-Zayidah. Almog made it clear to Abu-Zayidah that the  standing IDF orders compelled the soldiers to react the way they  did. He expressed his regret over the incident, and stated that  cooperation between Fatah and the IDF should continue.    Abu-Zayidah found it hard to accept the remarks: "This was  one big massacre which could have been prevented," he said.  "The Army has no business being in Jabalyah. The soldiers  should not have been there in the first place. These men wanted  peace very much and supported it."    At the end of their meeting, Gen. Almog and Abu-Zayidah  agreed that operational coordination between Fatah and the IDF  troops in the Gaza Strip will expand. A cooperation mechanism  -- a sort of a "hot line" -- may possibly be set up to  facilitate the exchange of ongoing information between the  parties.    A senior Southern Command officer said yesterday that early  coordination between Fatah and the IDF could have prevented the  killing of the six Fatah members. "Let them make no  accusations," the senior officer said. "Fatah should have  coordinated the presence of its men in the region. It should  not have sent armed and uniformed men into the heart of the  'hot' region.    "There have been incidents in the past when we allowed Fatah  men to stage marches while carrying their guns, as long as this  was done for their internal purposes. Unnecessary victims can  be spared when things are coordinated," he said.</p>

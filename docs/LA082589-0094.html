			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKES CARE OF NATION'S BUSINESS DURING 'TOTAL VACATION';  </P> <P> BUSH EASILY MIXING WORK AND PLAY  </P> <P> Every morning this week just before 8 a.m., a black Ford Tempo has followed the  serpentine seaside trail of Ocean Avenue and turned right at the narrow  driveway leading to President Bush's 11-acre compound.  </P> <P> The driver is Robert M. Gates, the President's deputy national security  adviser, arriving to deliver the President's daily intelligence briefing -- an  update on events around the world and a review of their impact on national  security.  </P> <P> Gates' visit is the one element of routine that varies little from the  President's workday in Washington. But, otherwise during his first of nearly  three weeks of vacation in this coastal village, the President has developed a  work schedule that doesn't cut deeply into the raison d'etre for his visit  here: jogging, fishing, boating, tennis, golf with his sons, playing with  grandchildren, dozing off while reading a book on the living room sofa during  the afternoon and, when the mood strikes him, going to bed at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> "He's so energetic about his work and his play and he mixes it with such ease  that it's hard to sort it out," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said.  </P> <P> "Total vacation" is the way the President describes his sojourn this summer in  Kennebunkport, where he says the crisp nights of late August produce "good  sleeping weather."  </P> <P> But there is some work getting done.  </P> <P> His aides report that he is in and out of his office "a couple of times a day"  to keep up with his mail, the half-dozen messages from Cabinet members that  have arrived over the last week and preparations for a nationally televised  speech Sept. 5 on his anti-narcotics program.  </P> <P> In just the sort of mixture of pleasure and business to which Fitzwater  referred, Bush spoke briefly and optimistically to reporters Thursday about the  Polish situation after he docked his cigarette-class boat Fidelity at Chick's  Marina here. Then he went aboard an 86-foot boat owned by Edward H. Hennessey  Jr., president of Allied-Signal Corp., to visit with South Carolina Gov.  Carroll A. Campbell Jr., former Marine Corps Commandant P. X. Kelley and  Hennessey.  </P> <P> Later in the morning, Bush welcomed Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter to  Walkers Point, his estate on a rocky promontory jutting into the Atlantic. The  prime minister and his wife, Anne Marie, were spending about 24 hours as house  guests of the President and Barbara Bush.  </P> <P> Next Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, his wife, Mila, and  their four children will be overnight guests of the Bushes.  </P> <P> And, Bush said on Wednesday in an informal news conference, in the coming week  he may also meet with several Cabinet members to discuss the anti-drug program.  His speech is planned for the day after he returns to Washington.  </P> <P> The President's office is situated in what was originally known as the  gardener's cottage, a two-story, two-bedroom guest house 100 yards across the  family's 11-acre compound.  </P> <P> In addition to the office, the house contains a very small kitchen and provides  work space for a secretary and temporary living quarters for Don Rhodes, a  longtime personal aide to the President. The secretarial position is being  filled on this trip by Linda Casey, executive assistant to White House Chief of  Staff John H. Sununu.  </P> <P> The rest of the White House staff -- such as it is -- that accompanied Bush to  Kennebunkport is housed in several of the old frame hotels typical of an  established New England summer vacation town. This weekend, the three senior  officials who accompanied Bush to Maine are scheduled to be replaced by three  others.  </P> <P> But the Washington-to-Kennebunkport migration is a mere shadow of the movement  of the government that took place each summer during the previous eight years.  When Ronald Reagan returned to his California ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains  near Santa Barbara, he often took with him an expanded team of his most senior  aides and their mid-level assistants, who moved into the posh quarters of the  Santa Barbara Biltmore Hotel.  </P> <P> Gone is the fleet of upscale gray sedans and military drivers from the White  House motor pool that chauffeured the staff up to the ranch -- on the rare  occasions when Reagan met with his aides there -- or about town to dinner  appointments.  </P> <P> Now, aides in Kennebunkport who need to see the President make their way in  small rented cars. When Sununu visited Kennebunkport on Monday and then made a  side trip to hold a news conference, he and another senior presidential  assistant, James Cicconi, eventually accomplished their getaway in the compact  Ford, with Gates as their driver.  </P> <P> Typically, after the personal intelligence briefing -- the vacationing Reagan  generally received his on paper, rather than in person -- Bush will speak with  Fitzwater to discuss the approach the press secretary will take to questions he  might face during his daily press briefing at 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Early in the morning, Cicconi, the White House staff secretary, will have  reviewed documents, speech drafts, messages from Cabinet members and other  correspondence dispatched to Kennebunkport by facsimile machine from the White  House. That done, he drops off paper work for Bush.  </P> <P> There is no set time when the President might visit his office here.  </P> <P> "He's a very secure man and he's not afraid to say he's on vacation," Fitzwater  said. "He does what he needs to do to run the government, but he also knows  it's important to have a vacation."  </P></p>

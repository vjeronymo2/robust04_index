			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Richard Harris's comedy of manners, Outside Edge, with its weirdly assorted couples coming together via the cricket pavilion, was a huge success on stage, where Maureen Lipman played Maggie. Will it work as well now that Harris has expanded it to a television series? We shall find out at 8.30 when ITV screens the first episode. Cutting Edge Special investigates accidents at work and asks why inspectors from the Health And Safety Executive refuse to prosecute individuals for manslaughter (9.00 C4). There have been good television drama series about the criminal underworld in the US, Italy and Britain, so why not Russia? Brian Cox stars as the big wheel in the St Petersburg Police, Grushko, whose name is the title of this three-part mini series beginning on BBC1 (9.30). Assassination and all kinds of violence in South Africa are routinely attributed by white television producers to the heritage of apartheid. How, then, do they explain assassination and violence in other African countries? They don't. Beloved Country has another go at South Africa (9.30 BBC2).</p>

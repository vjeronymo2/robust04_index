Clinton said: Over the past year, with Vietnam's  cooperation, the United States has made "major and substantial  progress" [zhong da de shi zhi xing jin zhan 6850 1129 4104 1395  6347 1840 6651 1455] in finding American MIAs from the Vietnam  war. Therefore, the best way to ensure Vietnam's continued  cooperation is to "end the trade embargo" against Vietnam. He  said the United States will continue to work to find out the  whereabouts of those American servicemen who are still missing.    Before Clinton made the announcement, he discussed the  matter  with family members of some American MIAs. Some American  Vietnam war veterans organizations and family members of MIAs  had asked President Clinton not to lift the trade embargo before  the whereabouts of all American MIAs are known.    Clinton also announced that he has decided to establish a  liaison office in Vietnam to "provide services for Americans" in  Vietnam and to "help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with  the Vietnamese Government." But, he expressly pointed out that  "these actions do not constitute a normalization of our  relationships." Before our relations can be normalized, "we  must have more progress, more cooperation, and more answers."  To achieve this goal, Clinton said he will "send another  high-level U.S. delegation to Vietnam" "this spring."    Clinton's announcement of lifting the trade embargo against  Vietnam immediately met with welcome from U.S. enterprise  circles. Some people from U.S. enterprise circles have held that  Vietnam is a new hot market and said Clinton's decision will  open up a new channel for U.S. exports and investment.</p>

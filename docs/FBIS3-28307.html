What lay behind this, apparently, was also Takemura's  discontent with the prime minister's growing tendency to lean on  Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party]. It is possible that the "triangular" relationship of  Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Takemura which has been the main frame of  the government since its inception will now change drastically  and that a new element of instability will face the government.    In a news conference on the morning of 3 February, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Takemura criticized the prime minister's  concept of the public welfare tax, saying, "To look back, it  cannot be said that everything was appropriate." This is the  first time that Takemura, who is functioning as Prime Minister  Hosokawa's housekeeper, has criticized the prime minister openly.    As far as the matter of reducing the income tax and raising  the consumption tax is concerned, Takemura has believed since  late last year that it would be difficult to accept the Finance  Ministry's idea of "taking care of the two matters in one  package" in view of the internal circumstances of not only the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] but also Komeito [Clean  Government Party] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. He  is said to have talked with the prime minister about it many  times and to have been assured that the two matters will be  "severed" from each other.    He thought that this common understanding was the given  premise when he entrusted the prime minister with making a final  decision. But the prime minister's final "decision" was "to  handle the two in a package," and this came as a shock to  Takemura. Takemura appears to suspect that "the prime minister  accepted the proposal of Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary  Ichikawa, who are sympathetic to the Finance Ministry and its  idea of raising the consumption tax."    Explaining the "decision," the prime minister said that  cabinet members of the SDPJ in a meeting at the prime minister's  residence on 3 February agreed to honor a decision of the ruling  party representatives meeting.    But Takeyama, in a top leaders meeting of the government and  ruling parties held at the prime minister's residence late in  the evening of 2 February, in fact spoke against the concept,  saying, "I will speak as president of Shinto Sakigake [New Party  Harbinger], and I would like you to be cautious (about handling  the two in one package)." Moreover, he refused to attend the  prime minister's news conference before the dawn of 3 February,  and he said at his own news conference held later that morning  that "the mistake should be redressed." All of these acts are  thought to be his expression of his repulsion toward the stand  of the prime minister.    Recently, Hosokawa has been said to be thinking negatively  even about a possible merger of the Japan New Party and Shinto  Sakigake. As a result, Takemura is trying to strengthen his  relations with SDPJ leaders and people such as DSP Chairman  Ouchi.    Differences in views between Hosokawa and Takemura were  revealed even on the question of who should be charged with  examining a revision of the concept of the public welfare tax.  The prime minister wanted the party representatives [general  secretaries] conference to be put in charge, but Takemura  insisted that the party heads council should take care of it.    On the evening of 3 February, Takemura announced that he  would support the prime minister as best as possible, and he  expressed his willingness to restore good relations with  Hosokawa, but there is no question that a cold wind has started  to blow on the relationship between Hosokawa and Takemura, thus  putting an end to their honeymoon period.</p>

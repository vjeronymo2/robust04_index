			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MURDER TRIAL OF GLENDALE DOCTOR OPENS  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Pryde Boggs murdered a stranger, planted false identification on  his body and reported the death as a heart attack to collect $1.5 million in  insurance, a prosecutor told jurors Tuesday.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie didn't say in his opening statement what  caused the death of Ellis Henry Greene other than that it was "not of natural  causes."  </P> <P> Greene's death remains a mystery. His body was quickly cremated in what  prosecutors say was a deadly conspiracy to switch Greene's identity with that  of Melvin Eugene Hanson, an Ohio businessman whose Columbus-based athletic  clothing firm was in bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Boggs, 56, a Glendale physician, is charged with Hanson, 47, who is awaiting a  separate trial, and James Hawkins, 25, who collected $1 million in death  benefits and remains at large. Hawkins was Hanson's partner in the Just Sweats  clothing company.  </P> <P> Police did not realize until some time after a dead man was cremated as Hanson  that the thumb print on the corpse did not match the one on Hanson's California  driver's license.  </P> <P> The body eventually was identified as that of Greene. MacKenzie contended that  Boggs met Greene at a North Hollywood bar, lured him to his medical office and  killed him. He said Greene was "alive and well" until he met Boggs.  </P> <P> But Boggs' attorney, Dale Rubin, told jurors that the man who died in Boggs'  office had tested positive for the HIV virus associated with AIDS and had  infections of the heart and lungs as well as liver disease.  </P> <P> "This individual was not very well in the first place," he said, indicating the  death may have been natural.  </P> <P> "Nothing is as black and white, as positive as the district attorney made it  sound," he told jurors. But he did not explain how Hanson's birth certificate  and credit cards came to be on the body.  </P> <P> MacKenzie said he would use circumstantial evidence to prove that Boggs, Hanson  and Hawkins conspired to commit "the perfect murder" for money.  </P> <P> "The evidence will show you that Dr. Boggs manufactured a medical file in the  name of Melvin Hanson to make it appear that Mr. Hanson had a long history of  heart disease," said MacKenzie. "He also manufactured a false EKG strip."  </P> <P> He said crime lab experts would testify that three differently dated  electrocardiogram readouts in Hanson's file were found to have been created on  the same day. "The edges of the paper on all three strips matched perfectly,"  he said.  </P> <P> With the cause of death in dispute, MacKenzie said he would call medical  experts including well-known former New York coroner, Dr. Michael Baden, to say  that the death was not natural.  </P> <P> But Rubin said the experts would testify that "there is no such thing as the  untraceable death."  </P> <P> Other pieces of the circumstantial puzzle, MacKenzie said, would be a  conversation Boggs had with his roommate about how to commit "the perfect  murder," phone records showing a series of calls among Boggs, Hanson and  Hawkins and an alleged stun gun attack by Boggs on another man.  </P> <P> Boggs, who could receive the death penalty if convicted, has claimed he thought  the man who died in his office was Hanson.  </P></p>

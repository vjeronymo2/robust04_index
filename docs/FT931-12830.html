			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson sees green shoots LORD HANSON, head of the Anglo-American conglomerate, told shareholders at the group's annual meeting yesterday that he was 'heartened' by signs that the UK and US were moving out of recession. The base rate cut was 'good news', he said. Orders were improving, but he warned that margins were tighter than last year and that the recovery in profits would lag economic recovery because of the amount of stock in the pipeline. Hanson shares rose 6 1/2 p to 243 1/2 p. Further details of the Dollars 500m (Pounds 329m) asset exchange between Hanson and Santa Fe Pacific, the railroads and minerals group, were also announced. Hanson is swapping Gold Fields Mining Company (GFMC), which has two gold mines in Nevada and California, for Santa Fe's coal and aggregates businesses. These will be integrated into Hanson's Peabody, the world's second largest privately-owned coal producer, and Beazer subsidiaries respectively. Hanson said there would be 'no significant gain or loss as a result of this transaction'. A straight exchange of assets is deemed by the US tax authorities to be tax neutral. Originally Hanson and Santa Fe were talking about swapping GFMC for Santa Fe's coal mines, but it was agreed that Santa Fe should include its aggregates businesses as well to make an equal swap. Hanson is exchanging assets with a tangible net worth of Dollars 150m, but with the goodwill attached to GFMC from the 1989 acquisition of Consolidated Gold Fields, the assets are reckoned to be worth about Dollars 500m. GFMC's pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 1992 were Dollars 52m, but the declining gold price meant profits were expected to fall in the current year. Santa Fe's coal and aggregates businesses are in the books at Dollars 131m, but are also deemed to be worth about Dollars 500m. Pre-tax profits in 1991 were Dollars 53m. See Observer</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BYRDS, IKE &amp; TINA NAMED TO ROCK HALL OF FAME;  </P> <P> POP MUSIC: THE IMPRESSIONS, JOHN LEE HOOKER AND WILSON PICKETT ARE AMONG THE  NEWEST MEMBERS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL ROYALTY.  </P> <P> The Byrds, the Los Angeles band whose 1965 recording of "Mr. Tambourine Man"  ignited the folk-rock movement, and Ike &amp; Tina Turner, whose soul revue was  among the most dynamic live acts ever in pop, are among the seven new inductees  to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> Other performers whose election was announced Monday at a press conference in  Cleveland are R&amp;B singer LaVern Baker, blues singer-guitarist John Lee  Hooker, soul vocal group the Impressions, soul vocalist Wilson Pickett and the  late blues singer-songwriter Jimmy Reed.  </P> <P> Blues legend Howlin' Wolf was chosen as this year's honoree in the early  influence/forefather category, while record producers Dave Bartholomew and  Ralph Bass were named in the non-performing division. The artists will be  inducted into the Hall of Fame at a dinner Jan. 16 in New York.  </P> <P> Roger McGuinn, the leader of the Byrds, said in Los Angeles that he was  thrilled by the selection and expects all five members of the original group to  be on hand to accept the award.  </P> <P> Ike Turner, who began serving a four-year prison sentence for a misdemeanor  drug offense in February in the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo,  could not be reached for comment. Carol Pinkins, associate warden at the  facility, said that she doubted if Turner would be allowed to attend the  dinner.  </P> <P> Impressions leader Curtis Mayfield, who has been hospitalized in Georgia since  a freak accident at an outdoor concert in August left him paralyzed from the  neck down, hopes to join the Impressions at the event.  </P> <P> "We're taking it day by day," Mayfield said Monday. "I'm very moved that the  Impressions will be honored."  </P> <P> Recording artists become eligible for the Hall of Fame 25 years after their  first recording and are chosen on the basis of contributions to or influence on  the course of rock 'n' roll. More than 300 performers, producers, writers,  record executives and broadcasters voted in this year's selection process.  </P> <P> This year's inductees were elected from a group of 15 nominees that also  included such artists as Johnny Cash, Frankie Lymon, Gene Vincent and the  Yardbirds.  </P> <P> The 10 new musicians and producers brings to 68 the number of performers,  non-performers and forefathers voted into the Hall of Fame since the nonprofit  organization was conceived in 1985 by Atlantic Records founder and chairman  Ahmet Ertegun.  </P> <P> Suzan Evans, executive director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation,  predicted that construction on the foundation's still unrealized museum will  begin next fall. About $43 million has been raised to build the facility.  </P> <P> The original Tower City site for the building was scrapped last summer in favor  of a new lake-front plot in downtown Cleveland. Architect I.M. Pei, who  designed the new wing of the National Gallery in Washington and the new  entrance and addition to the Louvre in Paris, is expanding his original design  to accommodate the new location.  </P></p>

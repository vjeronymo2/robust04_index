			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Virtuoso cellist - Concerts The Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, which continues in full spate through next weekend, has assumed the mantle of the former Almeida Festival. All the Almeida virtues are triumphantly reproduced. Huddersfield's artistic director, Richard Steinitz, is as tireless as Pierre Audi and Yvar Mikhashoff used to be about trawling new music for anything seriously interesting: original forms, artists with unheard-of talents, ambitious new ensembles. The current festival differs from the Almeida one only in having more venues and tighter programming - and being in Huddersfield. If more music students got modest grants to spend a week at the festival each year, the long-term effects on the collective imagination would be profound. On Sunday, a recital by the extraordinary cello virtuoso Frances-Marie Uitti was a perfect case in point. In arcane new-music circles, Miss Uitti is notorious for having developed a way of playing the cello with two bows at once, permitting full four-note chords and much more besides. Contemporary composers are constantly anxious to do more with less: the Uitti style expands the range of the cello into untested possibilities. But she proved also to be a formidable, intrepid musician; none of her boggling feats seemed mere tricks, but were laden with sense and feeling. Half of her recital consisted of short solo pieces composed or adapted for her, each of them addressed with fervent conviction. The second half consisted of one premiere: Advaya, with electronics and a 'midi-keyboard', by Jonathan Harvey - one of the festival's featured composers this year. The interplay between Uitti's cello and the extra electronic voices and sounds was sensationally effective, and sometimes built to massive climaxes on a near-orchestral scale. It made a unique experience, one that seized the imagination by main force. Harvey's wild ingenuity and Uitti's acrobatic finesse left us awestricken. Peter Maxwell Davies is also featured, still in the throes of celebrating his 60th birthday. Tonight the Royal Philharmonic plays an all-Davies programme at Huddersfield; on Sunday it ventured only part of it in the Royal Festival Hall, together with of Vaughan Williams's evergreen Tallis Fantasia and John Ireland's jolly, ropey Piano Concerto, played for more than its worth by the excellent Kathryn Stott. Since Max is the RPO's 'associate conductor/composer', it seemed odd that his London birthday concert should be so mingy. He was represented only by a suite from the first act of his 1991 ballet Caroline Mathilde (commissioned by the Royal Danish Ballet) and by one of the dimmest little pieces he has ever composed, 'A Spell for Green Corn: the MacDonald Dances' for violin and orchestra. Since the ballet music sounds disappointingly like, well, ballet music - naked tunes-with-accompaniments, simple, unambitious dramatic effects, much of it reassuringly tonal in a style that does not fire Max's inspiration - the new 'Spell for Green Corn' followed it with a particularly dull thud. It was hard to credit that he should put his name to such a feeble folk-fantasy, devoid of any inventive spark.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Cup fever turns city red THE GRASS on the bank around the Nissan car factory's test track says it all. 'Sunderland. Simply the Best,' it proclaims in red and white paint. Throughout the city the municipal gardeners have been planting red and white flowers in honour of its football team's appearance in today's FA Cup Final against Liverpool. On the route the team will follow tomorrow on their triumphal return - win or lose - the lampposts are decked with red and white pompoms and bunting. To an outsider all this may seem excessive. But for Sunderland, reaching the final is the crowning achievement of a run of morale-boosting triumphs. Earlier this year it achieved city status and this week its polytechnic became a university. Today Nissan is scrapping its Saturday morning overtime, and those shops staying open expect hardly a customer.</p>

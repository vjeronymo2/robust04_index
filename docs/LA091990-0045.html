			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SHOOTING OF 3 CALLED ATYPICAL OF GANGS  </P> <P> A drive-by shooting in Ventura that left three men injured Sunday was not a  typical gang attack, Police Sgt. Bob Anderson said Tuesday.  </P> <P> In a gang shooting, one or two shots are usually fired from a speeding vehicle  at unsuspecting victims, he said.  </P> <P> In Sunday's incident, eight to 10 shots were fired, and evidence suggests that  the gunshots came from two directions, Anderson said. The victims did not  return fire, he said.  </P> <P> John Michael Hart, 20, of Fillmore and Michael Wade, 26, and Noe Perez, 30, of  Ventura were in fair but stable condition Tuesday with broken bones, a Ventura  Medical Center spokesman said. The three victims were standing in the 2400  block of Channel Drive about 12:30 a.m. Sunday when they were struck in the  legs by shotgun pellets, Anderson said. SCOTT LAWRENCE  </P></p>

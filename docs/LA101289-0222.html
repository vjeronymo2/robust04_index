			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FARMER WHO FOUND DISK LINKED TO CRASH TO GET OVER $100,000  </P> <P> The farmer who found the 400-pound engine part suspected of causing a jet crash  that killed 112 people learned today that she will get a reward of more than  $100,000 from General Electric Co.  </P> <P> "It's just a shock," said Janice Sorenson, who found the piece while harvesting  corn Tuesday with a combine.  </P> <P> GE had offered a $50,000 reward for the titanium fan disk from the rear engine  of United Airlines Flight 232, which crashed July 19 in Sioux City, killing 112  people of 294 people on board. GE manufactured the engine. Investigators  suspect that the fan disk came apart, causing the engine to disintegrate and  spew shrapnel that severed the jet's hydraulic system and made the plane  virtually impossible to control.  </P> <P> GE spokesman David Lane said the company would not give the amount of the  reward. But a source close to the matter said it will be about $130,000, and  Sorenson today said GE told her that it will be more than $100,000.  </P> <P> "I'm just in shock. I can manage $20,000, but this?" she said.  </P> <P> Sorenson said she has no immediate plans for the money.  </P></p>

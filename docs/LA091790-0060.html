			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> TREE ORDINANCE UP FOR VOTE TUESDAY  </P> <P> The City Council Tuesday will consider a new street tree ordinance that would  make it clear that the city -- and not its residents -- owns the trees on  parkways.  </P> <P> The ordinance has been years in the making but received new attention when the  city chopped down about three dozen 70-year-old oak and ash trees on the north  side of Broadway a few months ago.  </P> <P> Residents who had lived there for decades were upset and formed a group that  managed to save the trees on the south side of the street.  </P> <P> Currently, residents may plant or remove trees with city permission. The new  ordinance would leave that to the city.  </P> <P> The proposal allows residents to appeal decisions to the department director,  who may consult an outside arborist.  </P> <P> Earlier, residents had recommended that the appeals be made instead through a  residents committee, a proposition the council may consider.

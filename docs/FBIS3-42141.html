And during the U.S. President's visit to Minsk the  extremely delicate question of Belarus's share of the materials  from the elimination of warheads was raised. IZVESTIYA's  correspondent asked Valeriy Tsepkalo, the chairman of the  republic Supreme Soviet's adviser on foreign economic questions,  to comment on this situation.    "The question of the share of the uranium in the tactical  and  strategic nuclear weapons being withdrawn from Belarusian  territory has been discussed in talks between ourselves and  Russia," Valeriy Tsepkalo explained.    "Moscow and Washington formerly prepared an agreement on the  sale to the United States of the uranium released as a result of  the elimination of the nuclear warheads on strategic offensive  weapons. At that time the United States reassured Kazakhstan,  Belarus, and Ukraine that the agreement would not be signed  before the question of the distribution of revenue from the sale  of the uranium was settled. Nevertheless, the United States and  Russia did sign the agreement. But the United States has  assured us that the agreement will not come into force until  agreement is reached on the distribution of the revenue. The  United States is buying 500 tonnes of uranium over 20 years at a  cost of $5.5 billion."    "The agreement between the United States, Russia, and  Ukraine  contains provisions which establish Ukraine's share of uranium  sales, either in money or in kind -- that is to say, through the  delivery of industrial uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power  stations. And most important of all, Ukraine has succeeded in  resolving the problem of tactical nuclear weapons; in other  words Russia has agreed to recognize Ukraine's right to the  fissionable materials in the tactical weapons and count their  number when determining the profit from the sale of uranium."    "For us this is very important. Russia has not recognized  our right to that quantity of fissionable materials in the  nuclear weapons withdrawn from Belarus through 27 April 1992.  But after all, almost half of all the tactical nuclear weapons  of the former USSR were situated on the republic's territory."    "Russia has claimed that the lion's share of the revenue  from  the sale of uranium will go toward covering the expense of  destroying the weapons. However, this does not correspond to  reality, since Russia has received considerable sums for these  very purposes from the United States."    "We consider it possible to begin talks with Russia about  our  share of the profits with the mediation of the United States --  that is to say, to prepare an agreement similar to the one  signed in Moscow."</p>

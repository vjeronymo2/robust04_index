			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> It never quite reached the mythic proportions of such classic duels as David  vs. Goliath, St. George vs. the Dragon, or Napoleon vs. Wellington.  </P> <P> And, now, it appears that Vampira vs. Elvira may just fade away into a small  file in the federal courthouse in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Vampira, a 1950s television horror-show priestess, have been  permitted to withdraw from the case after telling U.S. District Judge William  M. Byrne Jr. that they haven't been able to contact her for several months to  proceed with her lawsuit against Cassandra (Elvira) Peterson.  </P> <P> Vampira, whose real name is Maila Nurmi, claimed that Elvira, who holds down a  similar job these days, stole her character.  </P> <P> Elvira cackles that it ain't so. In fact, some say that the model for Vampira  may have been look-alike Carroll Borland, who accompanied Bela Lugosi on his  haunting forays in "Mark of the Vampira" in 1935.  </P> <P> Byrne gave Nurmi, whose last address was in Hollywood, until Sept. 18 to either  contact the court or have her $10-million suit dismissed. Efforts by The Times  to reach Vampira also failed.  </P> <P> Byrne previously threw out Nurmi's claim that Elvira violated Vampira's right  to publicity, but ruled that Vampira may seek damages for possible trademark  infringements.  </P> <P> In particular, the suit contends that Elvira lifted Vampira's character by  copying such features as "a distinctive, low-cut, tattered black dress,  emphasizing cleavage and a voluptuous figure."  </P> <P> If the low-cut rivals do go to court, neither side is expected to call Gloria  Steinem as a character witness.  </P> <P> The Lakers fell short, and the Dodgers are struggling. But one Los Angeles team  captured a championship: The lifeguards representing the county Beaches and  Harbors Department swam, ran and paddled to victory in the national competition  in Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> Big winner was Diane Graner of Santa Monica, who dominated five events,  including two triathlon-type "Iron Woman" races.  </P> <P> All in all, reassuring news for Southern California swimmers -- at least, those  brave enough to enter the often polluted local waters.  </P> <P> Add lunar report: It's somehow fitting that pretrial motions in the case of Zsa  Zsa Gabor vs. Gorgeous Beverly Hills Cop are scheduled today, the same day that  a total eclipse of the moon is on the agenda. After all, one of Gabor's title  film roles was the 1958 classic, "Queen of Outer Space."  </P> <P> The Bixby Land Co. is throwing a big bash at ground-breaking ceremonies for the  Circle Center West shopping center in Long Beach next week, and honored guests  won't be served any of those chi-chi edibles that no one can pronounce.  </P> <P> Invitations point out that catering is "courtesy of In-N-Out Burger."  </P> <P> Over the years, the HOLLYWOOD sign has been chipped away, covered with graffiti  and altered (HOLLYWEED, etc.).  </P> <P> Now comes the latest indignity: A sushi attack.  </P> <P> And don't blame Caltech. This painting was fashioned by Bonese Collins Turner,  an art instructor at Pierce College whose works have been featured in more than  250 exhibitions.  </P> <P> At least, "Sushi Hits Hollywood," described as a commentary on urban life,  appears to include a couple of California Roll (avec avocado) pieces.  </P> <P> Attention ablutophobes and zoophobes: Your stories are among those told in the  just published "Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears and Anxieties," co-authored by  writer Ada Kahn and Ronald M. Doctor, a Cal State Northridge psychology  professor.  </P> <P> Kahn-Doctor offer self-help suggestions for overcoming such fears as washing  and bathing (ablutophobia) or coming in contact with animals (zoophobia).  </P> <P> No doubt, the next edition will include sushiphobia.  </P></p>

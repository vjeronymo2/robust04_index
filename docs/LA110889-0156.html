			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SUTHERLAND TELLS OF HIS DISEASES  </P> <P> You name it, Donald Sutherland has had it.  </P> <P> Polio, rheumatic fever, hepatitis, an appendectomy, pneumonia, scarlet fever.  </P> <P> "And spinal meningitis," the actor said. "I died. . . . "  </P> <P> A reporter chuckled. Sutherland looked perturbed.  </P> <P> "Yes. I died. For four or five seconds," he said.  </P> <P> Sutherland overcame the bout of meningitis and says his experience with disease  since childhood left him with a deep appreciation of the medical profession.  </P> <P> He is the 1989 honorary fund-raising chairman of the Montreal Children's  Hospital, which hopes to raise $1 million this year to pay for renovations and  new equipment.  </P> <P> Sutherland said concern for his five children makes him especially sympathetic  to the hospital's appeal.  </P></p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Parties swing behind Hata: The personalities sharing Japan's search for a new prime minister Leaders of Japan's fractious coalition have reached a draft policy accord intended to pave the way for the selection of a new prime minister early this week. Six of the seven ruling coalition parties aim to finalise the agreement today on foreign and economic policies and field Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, as the alliance candidate for prime minister in a parliamentary vote. A rival bid for the leadership by Mr Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister who has announced his defection from the opposition Liberal Democratic party, is unlikely to succeed. Mr Watanabe hinted yesterday that he would support the new government. 'There is a definite agreement taking shape and it is natural to ask Mr Hata,' said Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary- general of Komeito, the Buddhist-backed Clean Government party. Mr Hata appears assured of a majority because he has the support of all parties in the previous government. That includes the New Harbinger party, which threatened Mr Hata's chances last week by saying that it did not want to participate in the new cabinet. Agreement on a new government would bring an end to 10 days of wrangling provoked by the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after allegations of financial impropriety. The row has accelerated the realignment of Japanese politics, prompting another round of defections from the LDP and deepening a split between the coalition's right and left wings. The 10-point outline accord would commit the new government promptly to enact the current year's budget, to push on with economic deregulation, increase indirect taxation and to hold the next general election under the new electoral system, implying that the next poll is to be at least six months away. On foreign affairs, Japan should follow UN policy on North Korea and take 'necessary precautions,' says the draft, a reference to possible UN sanctions over that country's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear sites. The outline accord was criticised in the Japanese press for merely papering over the cracks in the government partners' policies. The Social Democratic party, the alliance's largest and most quarrelsome partner, continues to oppose a rise in indirect taxes and wants a soft line on North Korea. Mr Watanabe said that he and his fellow LDP defectors - the number is as yet unknown - would support coalition policies. 'I understand and quite agree with the points of agreement drafted by them,' Mr Watanabe said.</p>

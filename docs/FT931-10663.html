			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Second woman candidate withdraws PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's second attempt to find a woman for the top US legal job suffered a setback yesterday when Judge Kimba Wood withdrew her name from consideration for the position of Attorney General, AP reports from Washington. She said her baby sitter had been an illegal alien for seven years - the same problem which torpedoed Mr Clinton's first choice, Ms Zoe Baird. Ms Wood, 49, had been named by officials as Mr Clinton's near-certain choice yesterday when they said she would be named unless problems developed during an FBI background check. During his campaign Mr Clinton promised to have a cabinet that 'looked like America', but after naming men to the traditional top jobs of state, defence and treasury he came under considerable pressure to name a woman to the Justice Department. Now that Ms Wood has withdrawn the two remaining candidates most widely touted for the job are men: Mr Charles Ruff, a Washington lawyer, and Mr Gerald Baliles, a former Governor of Virginia. Judge Wood said she had done nothing illegal. 'I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of our baby sitter. Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate. 'In March 1986 (when the baby sitter was hired), it was lawful to openly employ aliens who were in the country, like my baby sitter, on an expired visa, as long as all required taxes and forms were filed,' she said.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Institutions cool on UK equities UK institutional investors are losing some of their enthusiasm for British equities, as well as those from Japan, according to the lastest Smith New Court/Gallup survey of fund managers. The survey, conducted among 91 institutions in early September, found that only 15 per cent of respondents planned to increase their exposure to UK equities, down from a six-month high of 20 per cent in July. Only 21 per cent of respondents planned to increase their Japanese equities investment, down from 48 per cent in July. The investor demand for property investment appears to be tapering off as well, with only 1 per cent of respondents saying they wish to increase their holdings, down from 14 per cent, the six-month peak, in May. On the overall UK economic front, nearly two thirds of respondents say they expect conditions to 'get a little better' over the next 12 months, with another 20 per cent predicting they will remain unchanged. On the inflation front, 77 per cent see inflation rising more rapidly in the next 12 months. On continental Europe, respondents have increased their forecasts for German interest rates, saying they expect the Bundesbank's key rate for repurchase agreements to rise to 5.1 per cent in one year's time from its current level of 4.85 per cent. In the light of that forecast, not surprisingly, just over half of all respondents said they favoured French equities over German equities. France ranked as the Continental market in which investors most wanted to increase their exposure, while Germany was the market in which investors most wished to decrease their exposure. UK pension fund managers believe Asia Pacific and South America offer the most attractive investment areas over the next decade, according to a survey by Record Treasury Management, the currency hedging specialists.</p>

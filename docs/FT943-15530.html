			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Remy shrugs off weakness in principal markets Remy Cointreau, the French wines and spirits group, yesterday announced a 24.5 per cent increase in net profits, to FFr252m (Dollars 46.8m), for the year ended March. It also forecast a further improvement this year as European economies recover and as the US sees further expansion. The company, which owns the Remy Martin cognac brand and Krug and Piper Heidseck champagnes, said the rise in profits was achieved on sales of FFr6.38bn, an increase of 9 per cent over 1992. Sales have continued to expand this year, growing by about 10 per cent in the three months to the end of June. The group said last year's results were achieved in spite of weak demand in some of its principal markets. In particular, continental Europe and Japan suffered from the effects of recession. In spite of these constraints, sales of Remy Martin cognac grew by 13 per cent in value terms, to FFr2.82bn, consolidating its position as the world's biggest-selling quality cognac with about one-third of the international market. Sales generated by liqueurs, wines and spirits rose 5 per cent to FFr1.74bn, while the champagne division rose just 2 per cent to FFr668bn. The small increase in champagne sales was blamed on the continued strength of competition in the market, and on pricing pressures. The company's sales under licence rose 13 per cent, with Highland Distilleries whisky brands up 57 per cent. There was a strong rise in sales of The Macallan whisky brand in the US. Remy Cointreau said it took a financial charge of FFr595m last year - compared with one of FFr577m in 1992-93 - mainly reflecting payment to Grand Metropolitan of the UK for the buy-back of 20 per cent of Remy shares. It said it would pay a dividend of FFr4.60 per share, an increase of 4 per cent.</p>

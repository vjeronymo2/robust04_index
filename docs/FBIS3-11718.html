			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff Restrepo has  made his mark on his post. In spite of the fact he has turned  out to be quite controversial, the presidential candidates do  not dare touch that office.    [Begin recording] [Liberal Party Candidate Ernesto Samper  Pizano] I would reform the administrative aspect, but under no  circumstances would I lessen the authority of the prosecutor as  the top official for investigating crimes.    [Conservative Party Candidate Andres Pastrana] The important  thing is to give the Prosecutor General's Office resources so we  can have true justice in Colombia. I would not modify it. If  we have not been able to completely organize that office, the  important thing is to provide it with the resources so we can  have an real Prosecutor General's Office. We must not try to  modify something that has not yet been implemented.    [General Miguel Maza, National Civic Consensus] The  Prosecutor General's Office needs regulations. Why not increase  its coverage? It has become deadlocked in the narcotics problem  and in the voluntary surrender policy.    [Antonio Navarro Wolff, 19 April Movement Democratic  Alliance] The prosecutor general deserves the powers he has. He  is using them, albeit controversially. Nevertheless, he is  undoubtedly making use of his powers, and that is good. He is a  person who firmly believes in his convictions. [end recording]</p>

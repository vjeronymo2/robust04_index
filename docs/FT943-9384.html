			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Capital Shopping loses chief Mr Brian Jolly, the chief executive who helped build Capital Shopping Centres into the UK's leading regional shopping centre company, is to retire due to ill health less than 5 months after the group's flotation. The announcement was made as CSC issued its maiden results, showing interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.3m for the period to June 30 - effectively for only three months. The retirement came as a shock for investors. Mr Jolly was one of two key executives from Capital &amp; Counties, the TransAtlantic subsidiary which built the CSC portfolio. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said a replacement should be in place by 'the end of the holiday season'. CSC demonstrated strong growth from its core portfolio of seven shopping centres. On a pro-forma basis, rental income increased by 17 per cent from Pounds 17m to Pounds 19.9m, although this included a substantial impact from the phasing out of rent free periods. Lakeside at Thurrock, its flagship property, saw income rise 18 per cent to Pounds 10.6m, with tenant turnover recording double digit growth. Mr Gordon expects Lakeside to be a substantial beneficiary of Sunday trading, which begins on August 28 and should improve income from turnover rentals. The Harlequin Shopping Centre in Watford, its second largest property, increased profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4m and reduced bad debts from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 800,000. CSC has Pounds 120m of cash, and Mr Gordon said it was looking for opportunities to invest in other substantial regional shopping centres. He said there had been no discussions, but it would be logical for CSC to look for a tie-up with Blue Water Park, the shopping centre development across the Thames from Lakeside. The 230 acre site was recently purchased by an Australian property company and could impinge upon Lakeside's client base, although CSC argues that with 11m people within an hour's drive, competition is hardly a problem. Earnings per share were 1.9p; no interim dividend is declared but the company intends to pay a final of at least 5p. COMMENT CSC's main problem, which it perceives as a virtue, is its total absence of gearing. With a net cash position, it will struggle to offer more than pedestrian increases in net asset value. Brokers expect a year end net asset value of 216p, leaving the shares at a premium of 4 per cent, based on yesterday's close of 225p, down 2p. Net profit for 1994 should be about Pounds 25m. Management has the dilemma of needing an acquisition, at a time when competition is pushing up prices. Investors should defer judgment until they see what the management can deliver.</p>

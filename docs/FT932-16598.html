			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Spanish PM threatens to quit over party corruption scandal MR FELIPE Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, and his ruling Socialist party are heading for a clash this week over a corruption scandal that is seriously damaging Socialist chances of being re-elected later this year. In a pointed interview at the weekend, Mr Gonzalez hinted that he might resign as party leader if the Socialist party machine did not take political responsibility for the scandal. At issue is the so-called Filesa affair - named after a bogus consulting company, run by senior party officials, which took money from big business in return for industrial research which was never done. The money was used to pay Socialist election expenses in the late 1980s. The affair has hurt the party in polls ahead of elections which must be held before the end of the year. It has also sharpened old tensions between Mr Gonzalez's conservatively minded government and the more radical party, which has vigorously denied it had anything to do with Filesa. Mr Gonzalez had not wanted to stand for a fourth term as prime minister, but was persuaded to do so by the party, which sees that its only chance of winning over the electorate is with him as leader. However, he has begun to realise that public opinion is heavily against waiting for a court ruling on Filesa and in favour of a show of political responsibility - one or more senior resignations - by the party or government. In his interview on Spanish radio, he said he was not pressing anyone to resign but hinted that he was not prepared to go to the electorate with the scandal hanging over him. If Mr Gonzalez were to withdraw, there seems little doubt that the Socialists would suffer severe reverses. A party executive meeting scheduled for today has been delayed until Saturday as party infighting intensifies. The most likely candidate for sacrifice would be the No 3 man in the party, Mr Jose Maria Benegas who has, it is reported, already offered to resign. A Basque, Mr Benegas is an old Socialist warrior who has courageously stood up to intimidation from Basque separatist terrorists in the past. But under his direction the party has failed to satisfy public unease about the financing scandals.</p>

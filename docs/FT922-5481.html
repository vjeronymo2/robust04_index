			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Gardening: Instant trees - by the tonne / A forest on the move . . . ONE OF the talking points at the Chelsea flower show was the 25 ft-high oak growing in a container holding a metric tonne of soil, thought to be the biggest tree ever moved into the exhibition marquee. Shown by Hillier Nurseries of Ampfield, Romsey, Hants, it was, however, typical of a side of the nursery trade which is little-known outside professional circles. Hillier Broadmead Trees, the branch of the company responsible, produces trees up to 30 ft ready for immediate planting. These giant, container-grown trees are a development from the heavy standard trees which long have been available for autumn and winter planting direct from the open ground. Many buyers - chiefly municipal authorities, which use them for street planting, and large landscape firms - increasingly are turning to container trees. They cost more than trees lifted from the open ground, but have a greater chance of success. Hillier Broadmead is growing around 15,000 and demand is rising. Many varieties are available, although the larger sizes seem to be restricted to beech and oak. Trees in containers with 200 litres of soil - a very respectable size, although containers can go up to 1,000 litres - include several varieties of maple; horse chestnut; two kinds of alder; ailanthus; two kinds of birch; fastigiate hornbeam (which is very good as a street tree because its head is so compact); the Paul Scarlet variety of hawthorn; purple-leaved and Dawyck beech; several varieties of ash, rowan and lime; walnut; Spanish plane; several species of prunus; false acacia; sophora, and golden weeping willow. Another specialised company in this trade is Pantiles Nurseries Ltd, which is both a plant and garden centre and has its own landscaping side able to handle the largest container trees. It grows fewer trees than Hilliers although the variety is greater and includes some rare examples, including many good conifers. The explanation is that almost all the trees are bought in Europe, mainly from Tuscany where the soil and climate are ideal for cultivating them and there is a tradition of producing many scarce types. At Pantiles, you will see such things as big specimens of the weeping cedar, a rare tree in English nurseries, and also Blue Atlas cedars up to 30 ft. The biggest containers are even larger than those at Hilliers; I have seen one with 1.5 tonnes of soil holding an evergreen Magnolia grandiflora, rather a speciality with Italian growers. What do you pay for such trees? Anything from Pounds 75 to more than Pounds 2,000 for some of the rarities. To this, though, must be added a charge for delivery, planting and (almost certainly) anchorage in the soil with steel guy ropes.

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / West split over use of force in Bosnia WESTERN governments yesterday struggled to maintain a united front on proposals for outside military intervention in Bosnia, amid growing reports of disagreements over what option should be chosen. A senior Nato official said yesterday the chances of decisive western military intervention in Bosnia were fading. The official blamed European opposition to the use of force which had proved 'highly influential' with the Clinton administration and closed military options for dealing with Serbian aggression. The failure to intervene decisively at an earlier stage in the Bosnian crisis means the Vance-Owen peace plan sponsored by the European Community and the United Nations is 'highly unlikely ever to come into being', the official said. This gloomy assessment follows a week in which EC foreign ministers expressed strong reservations about military intervention and defence chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic went public with their concerns about using force without clear-cut goals. In Washington, President Bill Clinton is struggling to reach a consensus among his own civilian and military advisers on US action to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen plan. A decision is expected in the next few days. Britain, however, yesterday indicated it was ready to back a US ultimatum threatening air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia if the US administration agreed to maintain the international arms embargo. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is expected to travel to European capitals next week to consult US allies and discuss the plan Mr Clinton chooses for Bosnia. Neither British nor US officials believe that an international conference on Bosnia, as proposed yesterday by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, can be reconvened as early as next week. To be successful, it would have to be carefully prepared, the British Foreign Office said. As a House of Commons debate revealed intense concern that Britain risks being dragged further into the Bosnian conflict, Mr John Major, the prime minister, refused to rule out the option of air strikes. But he emphasised that Britain did not see military action as a substitute for sanctions against Serbia and the eventual goal of a negotiated political settlement, and he underlined his strong opposition to lifting the international arms embargo. Against a background of threats from their paymasters in Belgrade, Bosnian Serbs yesterday announced they would reconsider an international peace plan. The speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament said a new session would be held on May 5. The assembly rejected the peace plan on Monday.

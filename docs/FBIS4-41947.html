The Liberal Democratic Party accepted the applicaton and  stated that Finance Minister Andres Lipstok no longer is a  member of the party, Heiki Kranich of the Liberal faction in  the parliament said.    Lipstok, whose appointment to the ministerial office was  formally approved by the president Monday, agreed to accept the  posting despite the Liberals having shortly before quit the  ruling coalition. The posts of the minister of culture and  education, and of finance, became vacant after Liberal  ministers Paul-Eerik Rummo and Heiki Kranich left the  government. Lipstok before his appointment was head of county  government in Estonia's western Laanemaa region.</p>

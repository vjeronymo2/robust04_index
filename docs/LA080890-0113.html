			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> A state judge overturned a Louisiana State Racing Commission decision denying  the second-place $200,000 purse apparently won by owner-trainer Jerry Cart's  Big Earl in the Super Derby won by Sunday Silence last September.  </P> <P> Civil District Judge Louis A. Dirosa ruled in New Orleans that the commission  acted improperly last January in upholding a ruling by Louisiana Downs stewards  that denied Cart the purse at the Bossier City track. Cart also was fined $200.  </P> <P> The stewards made their ruling after a postrace blood sample from Big Earl  tested positive for more phenylbutazone than state racing rules allow. The  anti-inflammatory drug is known by the trade name Butazolidan.  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Lyonnaise There was some confusion in Paris yesterday about what to make of last year's FFr1.425bn net profit from Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the first set of results since the utilities and construction groups merged their activities in September. A figure close to FFr1.5bn had been forecast in the pro forma profit and loss account. Lower than expected capital gains as well as a disappointing performance from the Canadian construction materials group Westburne appear to be responsible for the shortfall. Lyonnaise shares slipped FFr9 to FFr618 on the day, though that may have had as much to do with the forecast that this year's earnings would only advance in line with the likely 5 to 10 per cent increase in sales. At this early stage of the venture, it is difficult to tell whether Mr Jerome Monod's vision of an integrated group solving problems of infrastructure around the world will succeed. He certainly would appear to be getting the upper hand in what many suspected would not turn out to be a marriage of equals, or so the earlier than expected disposal of Dumez's electrical equipment businesses would suggest. That might even point to a Westburne sale as part of the ongoing programme of asset sales, though now is hardly the best time in the cycle to be speeding it along. French utilities have been popular with investors and Lyonnaise has outperformed the market by 5 per cent over the last year. But the market's hesitancy is reflected in the fact that its rival, Generale des Eaux, which swallowed Societe Generale des Entreprises that much earlier, has outperformed by 10 per cent over the same period.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazil to ease way for foreign portfolio hedging FOREIGN investors are likely to be given permission this week to use Brazil's stock futures and options markets to hedge their portfolios, the head of the country's securities commission said yesterday. Speaking in London, Mr Roberto Faldini, president of the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios, said an application would be made today to the monetary council, a grouping of government and private sector officials which has the right to rule on such matters. He said that the inability to hedge portfolios was one factor discouraging foreign investors. However, they still may not hedge exchange rate fluctuations, a procedure which would take more time to be approved. Mr Arminio Fraga, senior Economy Ministry official, said there had been a net inflow of funds into the Brazilian stock market since it opened up to foreign investment about a year ago. Since early 1991, Brazilian entities had raised Dollars 7bn through the issue of marketable securities.</p>

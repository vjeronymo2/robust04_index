			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Presidium of the Belarusian </F> Trade Union Federation Holds Its Session"]    [Text] The Presidium of the Belarusian Trade Union  Federation [FPB] held a session on 26 May at its headquarters.  BELAPAN has learned that two key issues -- a summer treatment  program for working people and their children and an increase in  the minimum wage -- were discussed. In particular, it was  stated that the government allocated 120 billion rubles [R] to  treat those who suffered from the Chernobyl tragedy's aftermath.  However, this money will cover treatment for only 15 percent of  all those who actually need it. The Gomel Oblast Trade Union  Council sent an open letter to Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyachaslaw Kebich presenting the statistics regarding Gomel  Oblast residents who badly need this treatment.    The participants in the FPB session also raised the issue of  increasing the minimum wage. According to the trilateral  general agreement -- signed by the government, trade unions, and  the Association of Employers -- the divergencies between indexes  of a minimum consumer budget and a minimum wage should not  exceed 27 percent. According to FPB experts's estimates, the  minimum consumer budget (in June 1994 prices) will stand at  R160,000 (currently, it is R60,000).    All these issues will be raised at the session of the  Conciliatory Council of the Republic of Belarus, which includes  representatives from the government, the FPB, and the  Association of Employers.</p>

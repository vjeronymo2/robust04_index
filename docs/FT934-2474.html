			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): How to enjoy a good grilling - The start of a new business forum in Scotland The questioning was tough. 'How many deals have you lost because your prices were too high?' the electronics manufacturer was asked. 'I think about one,' he replied. 'That's not enough,' he was told. 'You're charging too little. If your prices are too low you make yourself too obvious to your competitors, who will react to put you out of business.' This exchange took place recently not in a private meeting between a managing director and his consultant but in front of about 60 businesspeople and professional advisers one evening in Glasgow. It was Scotland's first forum of this kind, aimed at encouraging the creation and growth of new businesses, and is modelled on the Enterprise Forum pioneered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1978. The bosses of two small electronics companies each gave a 20-minute presentation, outlining their business, its history, how it worked and its strategy. Then three senior figures from the Scottish electronics industry gave a brief assessment of the company and asked hard questions. Next, the other participants, from high tech companies, banks, accountancy firms and venture capital companies, made suggestions and asked questions. The grilling was moderated by an American facilitator. The forum has been introduced to Scotland by a group of businesspeople and professionals inspired by an initiative of Scottish Enterprise, the development body, to improve Scotland's low rate of new company formation. The business forum differs from other seminars and presentations in allowing young companies to bare their souls in a non-adversarial atmosphere. The chairman of the session, Peter Timms, managing director of Flexible Technology, a PCB assembler, says the aim is 'to allow ambitious entrepreneurs to test their ideas and overcome the uncertainty and loneliness of running a young business.' The companies which make the presentations benefit most: they publicise their businesses, pick up advice, make contacts and meet potential investors. But for everyone else it is still a chance to gain business, either from the presenters or from contacts made during the evening. The first presentation was by David Milne, managing director of Wolfson Microelectronics, an Edinburgh semi-conductor company seeking to move from designing chips to supplying finished products, manufactured under contract. He had to explain to an assessor (who, unlike the rest of the audience, had studied the company in advance) what really distinguished his company from other semi-conductor producers. The other presenter was Mike Eccles, managing director of Sunnyside Systems, employing four people in Livingston, West Lothian, which makes electronic test and measurement equipment for customers such as Rolls-Royce. One entrepreneur from the floor wondered if Sunnyside Systems was taking itself seriously enough. 'You seem to have got into this almost by chance - I'm worried you might drop out of it by chance.' Assessing the forum later, Eccles said that preparing his presentation clarified his mind about the company and its strategy, and he found the comments and suggestions useful. Above all he was subsequently contacted by several potential investors and partners. Milne found the technical critique useful but felt that one of the assessors should have been a financial expert, 'to bridge the gap between financing and manufacturing.' Although he was already close to securing finance for the next phase of Wolfson's development, he believes he may have made contacts at the forum who would help with the subsequent stage. Both men appreciated meeting so many potentially useful people in a friendly and supportive atmosphere. Where the business forum could be even more constructive - or possibly destructive - would be in assessing the business plan of a company that has only a business plan, and no track record. The next forum, in February, is scheduled to do exactly that.</p>

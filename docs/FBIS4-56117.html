			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 27 May (TANJUG) -- Media in Skopje report  today that Defense Minister Vlado Popovski has said that the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is preparing a new scenario of  exerting pressure on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM] by encouraging disputes on the border between Serbia and  FYROM. Popovski said this in an address yesterday to officers  of the FYROM Army.    After the plan to create Serbian regions in Macedonia  failed,  the idea of the border being a problem is now favored in Serbian  circles, although under the Constitutions of both the Federal  People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia the [former Yugoslav] republics were  treated as states, Popovski said. Talking to the officers,  Minister Popovski denied the worldwide belief that FYROM has  become an American aircraft carrier, and that America's military  presence on its territory threatens the security of its  neighbors.</p>

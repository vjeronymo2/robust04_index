			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia insists on reciprocal aluminium cuts RUSSIA, which later this month will host an international conference of major aluminium producers and consumers to thrash out a multilateral solution to the row over its exports, denies that it has offered to restrict its own exports unilaterally. Officials say Russia has told the European Commission, which has imposed curbs on Russian imports, that it is prepared to cut its exports only if western producers undertake similar 'self-restrictions'. 'This problem cannot be solved unilaterally,' said Mr Eduard Borovikov, the foreign trade ministry's specialist on relations with the European Community. Mr Vladimir Kondratiev, an official at Concern Aluminiy, which groups major Russian aluminium plants, said that Mr Sergei Znamensky, its director for foreign trade, had told commission officials in Brussels last month: 'We agree to cut our production of aluminium only if at the same time other producers do the same.' Mr Kondratiev also categorically denied rumours that the Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk plants had left Concern Aluminiy, and added that Mr Igor Prokopov, the company's president, had not been present at the Brussels talks. The so-called 'safeguard action' imposed by the commission in August restricts Russian imports to 60,000 tonnes until the end of the year. The US and Canada protested against the EC restrictions, saying it would simply divert a flood of cheap metal their way. The EC measures have had no effect on world aluminium prices, which have fallen because of continuing excess supply the world over. Asked to clarify Russian production figures, Mr Borovikov said the EC had already agreed that negotiations on any production cuts would cover only Russian exports of aluminium destined for end-users - amounting to an annual 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes - and exclude another 182,000 tonnes destined for further processing at metallurgical plants within the European Community. Mr Borovikov said that an initial conference, to be held on October 20-21, would bring together Russia, the EC, the US and Canada. Russia had already agreed with the European Commission to establish system of 'double checking' to monitor illegal exports through other former Soviet republics, he said, estimating that these totalled about 150,000 tonnes a year. Mr Borovikov laid the blame for the appearance of cheap Russian aluminium in Europe mainly on these exports, which Russia had been unable to control partly because of the absence of effective border controls following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. 'This is a very big problem,' he said. 'Any trader from Latvia can come to Moscow and buy aluminium at the lower domestic price and then ship it through Riga (Latvia's capital and a major port).' He admitted that another problem was corruption among Russian customs officials, who could be bribed to turn a blind eye to unlicensed exports from Russia. But he said that Russia had a much better grip on the situation than before, partly because the gap between Russia's internal price and world prices was rapidly narrowing as a result of higher Russian energy prices. Cheap Russian energy and lax environmental standards were cited by EC producers as giving Russian producers an unfair advantage. Many Russian plants are badly in need of re-equipping to meet Russia's existing environmental standards. But at a time when the country is undertaking radical market reforms being urged upon it by the west, officials say it is unrealistic to expect it to make unilateral sacrifices. The closing of western markets to competitive Russian exports, especially when Russia has opened its market to competitive western goods and services such as banking, is also seen as hugely hypocritical on the part of western countries. A wider conference on the aluminium problem in November would include producers such as Ukraine, the only other major producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and other western producers such as Norway.</p>

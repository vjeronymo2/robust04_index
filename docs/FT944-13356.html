			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Shell Oil up by one-third at Dollars 323m Shell Oil, the US arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said after-tax profits before one-off factors rose by one-third, to Dollars 323m, in the three months to the end of September, writes Richard Waters in New York. Higher-than-expected production from the Augur field in the Gulf of Mexico and lower exploration costs led to a Dollars 50m rise in operating income from exploration and production, to Dollars 151m, before one-off charges. In spite of the lower profit margins in the refinery business that have afflicted the rest of the industry, the company reported a Dollars 9m increase to Dollars 119m in underlying income from oil products, due to volume increases. Operating income from chemicals also advanced, with income climbing Dollars 33m to Dollars 100m. Including all one-off factors, net income rose to Dollars 313m from Dollars 187m a year ago.</p>

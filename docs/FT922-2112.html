			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Export insurer quells fears of price war A PRICE WAR over export credit in the UK has to be avoided, Mr Harry Groen, head of NCM, the Dutch credit insurer, said yesterday. NCM recently acquired the short-term credit arm of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Mr Groen said, 'We are focused on increasing the market rather than picking up bits of the business of our competitors.' His 'declaration of peace' comes two months after NCM issued the warning: 'We haven't entered this market to be a marginal player.' It should come as grim comfort to Trade Indemnity, the market leader with 82 per cent share. TI has suffered badly through claims resulting from the recession over the past two years and in March announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 46.6m for 1991. The group passed its dividend last year. Mr Groen told the FT: 'We are not prepared to enter (the UK market) in a cut-price kind of way. We are going to be competitive but we are not going down the road of leading a price war. That's the one route to go out of business.' Adequate premium volume was, he said, likely to be essential for the company to survive the next 24 months. 'Premium income of Pounds 35m a year is too low to survive - you have to have between Pounds 125m and Pounds 150m,' he said. He pointed to 'considerable changes' in the European insurance market, predicting that there would be just five or six companies by 1994. While NCM has close links with TI - both hold shares in each other, and TI has a representative on the NCM supervisory board - Mr Groen deflected suggestions that he might make a bid for TI. 'I think the Office of Fair Trading would object,' he said. He pointed to radical changes in Europe's export credit insurance market in the coming year, occasioned by the likely release next month of European Commission proposals for all 'marketable' risk to be handled by private-sector insurers. That is likely to include all policies up to three years and will exclude political risk, which will continue to be at least reinsured by national governments. The proposals have caused concern in France and Germany, where government agencies still manage short-term export insurance, but are likely to be welcomed by NCM, which has been offering such insurance cover since 1933.</p>

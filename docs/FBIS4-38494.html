			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "In Brief" rubric] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the  "Yabloko" faction in the State Duma, doubts that Boris Yeltsin's  recent economic edicts are going to "work." He has pointed out  that on the whole, the direction of movement on the road of  economic reform chosen by this package of documents is correct,  but the "very execution of the edicts leaves much to be  desired." "Politically, this is an attempt by the president to  seize the initiative in the absence of such in the government.  However, the content of the edicts raises big doubts as to the  realism of the measures implied by them," G. Yavlinskiy stressed.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / CBI urges law on squatting THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry has called for squatting in commercial buildings to be made a criminal offence. It says squatting in shops, factories and offices is costing UK companies thousands of pounds a year. In Scotland, offenders can be fined or jailed for squatting in commercial or residential property. In England and Wales, the only remedy is an expensive and time-consuming civil action. The CBI said that, apart from legal action, companies had to pay to repair property damage, replace stolen or damaged stock and remove rubbish. Also their insurance premiums went up.</p>

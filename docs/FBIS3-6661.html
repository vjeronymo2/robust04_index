It says:    Though the criminal drafting of "comfort women" was  committed  long ago, it is not a problem of the past but of today because  the truth of the crime and its culprits have been confirmed in  recent years.    Japan must honestly admit this crime, apologize for it and  make compensations.    The Japanese authorities are evading the responsibility  under  the international law and ridiculously argue that the demand of  the victims for compensations has already been settled through  bilateral and multilateral agreements.    The international law defining war crimes and "crimes  against  humanity" demands compensations to the victims and punishment of  those responsible. It is a crafty ruse to dodge punishment at  any cost for Japan to persist in its attempt to evade the  responsibility under the international law.    The Japanese Government has no legal right to rescind the  human rights of an individual. The demand for a compensation is  a right of the victims whose human rights were abused.    The Japanese authorities are nowadays even foolishly  claiming  it is impossible to verify that the victims demanding  compensations were really "comfort women". This reveals their  moral inferiority. They are lost to elementary human conscience  and morality. If those responsible are not punished, Japan must  be brought to the international court.    The Japanese authorities must admit at an earlier date the  responsibility under the international law for the crime of  Japan in drafting "comfort women for the Army" and seek its  solution.</p>

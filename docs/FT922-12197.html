			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Outlook bleak for forging industry THE OUTPUT of the British forging industry fell by nearly a quarter last year and the prospects for the current year look little better, the British Forging Industry Association says in its report for last year, Paul Cheeseright writes. It said: 'The best that can be hoped for is no further deterioration in demand, and perhaps the beginning of a slow recovery in the second half of the year,' it said. The industry which describes itself 'as a good a barometer as any of the health - or sickness - of UK manufacturing industry,' faced reduced demand last year from all its customers except those in the railways and industrial engine sectors. More than half of the steel forgings produced go to the vehicle industry. Total production of steel forgings in 1991 was 175,255 tonnes, of which just over 20 per cent was exported. Exports exceeded imports by an estimated 5,115 tonnes.</p>

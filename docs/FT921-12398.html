			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Companies criticised over financial policies SMALL and medium-sized British companies rely too heavily on short-term finance and are poorly placed to respond to an increase in demand when the recession ends, according to a survey of businesses with turnover of up to Pounds 25m. Companies depend heavily on bank overdrafts, which can be recalled without notice, and are failing to take advantage of other means of finance open to them, such as share issues, factoring and invoice discounting, according to the report by Business Banking Review, a financial consultancy. Of the companies questioned, 80 per cent used overdrafts, while 40 per cent had term loans, 38 per cent made use of leasing, and 33 per cent used hire purchase to buy plant and equipment. Only 6 per cent had raised equity capital; 4 per cent had used invoice discounting and 3 per cent had factored their invoices. The study questioned 189 companies in Hertfordshire and Essex. The emphasis on short-term finance may reflect both a lack of understanding of sound financing structures on the part of the companies and a desire of the banks to provide a short-term commitment only, the survey said. The study noted that there was no shift to longer-term finance as the length of time the company had been with its bank increased. Eighty-four per cent of companies that had been with the same bank for less than one year had an overdraft and 57 per cent had a term loan. By the time companies had been with their banks for more than five years, four fifths still had an overdraft but only two fifths had a term loan. 'With overdrafts being repayable on demand, the banks are able to provide a series of short-term 'fixes' without long-term commitment,' the study says. The banks do not appear to provide advice on other longer-term forms of funding when customers ask for an increased overdraft, the study notes. At head-office level, however, the banks continue to urge small businesses to take out term loans instead of overdrafts. A survey by National Westminster Bank of 850 businesses, most with sales of less than Pounds 750,000, found that 61 per cent of small companies had an overdraft while just 30 per cent had term loans. 'Owner-managers should match finance to the needs of the business and use overdrafts only to cover short-term cashflow fluctuations,' the bank said in comment on the survey results.

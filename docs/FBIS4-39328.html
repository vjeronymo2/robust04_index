			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/6/1994 -- General Aleksandr  Lebed, 14th Army commander, stated in a recent interview, that  he is in favour of settling certain political conflicts through  force. "I passed through the battle schools of Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia and I understood very clearly that in a  crisis situation tough and unexpected measures should be taken.  This is a guarantee that there will be no bloodshed for a long  period. You can fight two-three years and lose every day 5-10  soldiers. In a year the number of deaths will rise to 3,650.  On the other hand, it is possible with a single strong strike  to lose only 100 people and settle the problem once and for all.  I followed this principle here, in Dniester, and succeeded in  proving its validity." Chisinau is ready to make compromises to  settle the problem, but Lebed believes that the process of  conciliation and establishment of good relations between the two  sides might take a long period. "After the war in Dniester  (because a real war took place in Dniester) a deep rupture  between Chisinau and Tiraspol emerged. It can be removed only  by time and the trust between the sides will be recovered very  slowly. The fact that realistic people have come into the  Moldovan Parliament is a first step in this direction," said  Lebed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed  concern Friday [20 May] over reports that the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team conducting inspection in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) confirmed Pyongyang  has already begun withdrawing spent fuel rods from its  5-megawatt nuclear reactor.    "We express regret and concern over the IAEA inspection team  confirming that North Korea has started replacing spent fuel  rods at the 5-megawatt reactor on its own," Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said here.    The DPRK notified the United States and the IAEA  respectively  earlier that it could no longer defer removal of the nuclear  fuel rods from its reactor due to technical reasons.    Chang said that the South Korean Government will await the  results of negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA, then  discuss the necessary safety steps after refueling and consult  closely with its allies on follow-up measures.    "The government is paying heed to the IAEA announcement that  there is still room for safety measures if North Korea stops  withdrawing at this stage," he noted.    The IAEA inspection team said that the DPRK is still in the  early stage of replacing spent fuel rods.    As the IAEA has proposed sending delegates to discuss  safeguards needed in the refueling process for safety reasons,  South Korea is asking the DPRK to abide by nuclear safeguards  after immediate talks with the IAEA, Chang said.    Meanwhile, South Korea decided Friday to consider asking the  United Nations Security Council to take additional action if the  DPRK rejects the IAEA's proposal to suspend the changing of fuel  rods at its reactor and permit complete inspection.    The decision was made at a unification and security policy  coordination meeting attended by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime  minister and national unification board minister, and other  related ministers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The generator of power unit No. 1 at Khmelnitskiy  nuclear plant was disconnected for several hours. The plant  information center reports that this was caused by false  activation of the modular transformer containment system due to  a short circuit in the control cable conductors. The generating  set was reconnected upon the removal of the defect. The  conditions of the plant's safe operation were not affected. The  radiation situation is unchanged.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Italy facing general strike after pensions reform rift Italy's powerful trades union movement decided last night to call a general strike after the government ruled out further compromises over pensions reform and public spending cuts. At the same time, the government decided to bring forward the presentation of details of the 1995 budget, originally due tomorrow but likely to be finalised today. This move demonstrated the determination of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, to outflank the unions by presenting the electorate with an austerity budget which claims to spread sacrifices fairly. The budget is seeking to find L48,000bn (Pounds 19.5bn) through spending cuts and fresh revenues to hold the deficit to L138,000bn - just below 9 per cent of gross domestic product. Extra revenue through a reform of the pensions system has been a central issue. At a final meeting between the government and the heads of the three main trades confederations last night, the unions claimed the government position had even hardened. But senior government officials said in advance that the time for concessions had passed. Union leaders considered a last-minute compromise unlikely and talked of the inevitability of the long-threatened action. The call for a general strike is expected to be put to union members today. Union officials said yesterday the protest would not be limited to pensions but to the entire thrust of the 1995 budget. In three previous meetings over the past two weeks, the rightwing coalition government has sought to head off a confrontation with the trades union movement. Mr Berlusconi has already reduced the planned level of cuts in Italy's generous but deficit-ridden state pensions system. The government has given ground on plans to reduce the costly rate at which pensions accrue from 2 per cent a year closer to the European Union norm of 1.5 per cent. But union leaders are pressing for further changes in the proposals. They are refusing to accept a suggestion that pensioners should be penalised if they have made the necessary equivalent of 35 years' contributions but retire before retirement age. Measures to freeze inflation adjustments for pensions temporarily are also opposed, as is a plan to link future increases to the annual projected rate of inflation. More generally, the unions insist the government has adopted a short-term approach on budget needs instead of introducing long-term structural reforms. The government is gambling on the unions losing public sympathy. It hopes to avoid a troubled autumn by playing on fears of social instability as well as concerns for the prospects of what is an increasingly strong industrial recovery. But more trades unionists are pensioners than active workers. The government faces unrest from civil servants who plan a national stoppage on October 13 to protest against stalled pay talks. Also yesterday, local transport workers began a three-day series of stoppages, starting in the north, to protest against the failure to renew contracts.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Norwegian hopes rise Improved economic fundamentals, easier monetary conditions and private sector financial consolidation have paved the way for sustained recovery of Norway's oil-dependent economy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says. However, structural reforms are needed to improve efficiency and reduce the budget deficit. It predicts real growth in gross domestic product of more than 3 per cent in 1994 and nearly 4 per cent in 1995. The economy excluding oil is set to expand by respectively 2.25 per cent and 3 per cent. Unemployment, currently at 6 per cent, is expected to decline only slightly. An extensive overhaul of the labour market is needed as unemployment growth can no longer be stemmed by fiscal stimulus and public sector job creation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 30 May POSTIMEES, pp 1, 3; "News Bulletin" No. 106/94] </F>   [Text] Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces General  Aleksander Einseln has been surprised by claims of an alleged  Estonian-Israeli military cooperation project. Einseln referred  to a confidential letter by Kristian Garancis, aid of Leonid  Apananski, to GHQ [general headquarters] chief Colonel Sirel.  Apananski mediated the weapons deal with Israel and the letter  mentioned a joint project launched by Prime Minister Mart Laar  and Israeli General Dan Shomron.    General Einseln pointed out in a letter to Prime Minister  Laar that defence projects should be coordinated with the  military leadership and required about Apananski's powers to  deal with defence issues. Laar assured the general that no  cooperation projects had been signed and referred to defence and  interior ministers as better acquainted with the subject.  Government advisor Jaan Tross denied the existence of any  cooperation plan.    General Einseln also criticised the inefficiency of the  Defence Ministry and the frequent replacement of ministers. "I  have been in office less than 13 months and this is the fourth  minister already," he pointed out.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: SHE CREATES 'L.A. LOOK' IN NEW YORK  </P> <P> Menswear designer Jhane Barnes may live and work in New York, but most of the  time she is California dreamin'.  </P> <P> That's because California is the biggest market for the 35-year-old Coty  Award-winner's designs.  </P> <P> "I have no idea why they're so popular here," says the strawberry blonde with  the Elvis Costello glasses. "People are always saying the clothes have such an  L.A. look, which is funny because I've never lived here and never spent much  time here."  </P> <P> It's the vibrant colors and light weights that give the clothes their Los  Angeles personality. But Barnes' designs -- known for their modernistic  patterns and multitextural fabrics in cool colors -- will have a slightly  different look in seasons to come.  </P> <P> "I've been using purples and teals for 10 years and find that now people expect  purple in clothes; it's a standard color," said the designer during a recent  interview at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. "But society is moving  toward warmer colors. I think at least for the next 10 years we will see  warmer-colored clothes in looser silhouettes for men."  </P> <P> She also believes shoulders will be less severe and has included rounder  shoulder pads in her latest jackets. Another trend she feels men will be  seeking is fuller pants that drape rather than fitted pants that hug.  </P> <P> Barnes -- who was in Orange County for a South Coast Plaza men's fashion show  sponsored by GQ magazine and the Alex Sebastian men's store -- says one of the  best things about visiting Southern California is seeing men wear her clothes  to work.  </P> <P> "The biggest difference in the two markets, and I love California for this, is  that Californians wear my clothes to work and the New York customer wears them  during off-hours," she says. "I love the casual attitude Californians have  about clothes."  </P> <P> "This state is ahead of the country in that respect," she adds. "You keep  hearing that we're entering an age of elegance for menswear, but I don't  believe it. I think people would rather wear more comfortable clothes."  </P> <P> For her fall line, Barnes weaves juniper green, berry red and purple with black  and mahogany for three-button jackets and full-legged pants. Her cardigans  combine lambs wool, cotton and wool, and many feature a high neck with  contrasting pattern.  </P> <P> (The clothes -- sold in Orange County at Alex Sebastian, Alex Sport, Neiman  Marcus, Bullocks Wilshire, Indian Summer and the Look -- cost about $125 for  shirts, $185 for pants, $425 for jackets and $55 for ties.)  </P> <P> During the last few years Barnes has been experimenting by using a computerized  hand loom to weave different designs and lately has arrived at what she  considers the perfect combination of natural materials and Lycra to produce  highly textured, eye-popping patterns for sweaters and pants. The synthetic  material gives the finished fabric bounce and accentuates the textures of the  woven patterns, and also keeps the sweaters lighter than if they were knit or  woven in wool.  </P> <P> "Most people are horrified when I say I'm using Lycra because they think I'm  doing stretch pants," she says. "But I'm aiming for the texture and the draping  quality that you get when you use it."  </P> <P> Influenced a great deal by architectural elements, Barnes creates geometric and  Op Art-style patterns with her Macintosh computer. The pattern designs are then  fed into her computerized looms, where assistants help produce swatches. These  hand-woven swatches then go to the mills, where the clothes are manufactured.  The finished product is what Barnes calls "architextural."  </P> <P> "I've always felt that architecture was ahead of fashion," she says. "I look  around and see that buildings are more inspired than the clothes we wear. We're  always lagging behind."  </P> <P> Barnes, who grew up in rural Maryland, is a two-time Coty Award winner (1980  and 1984). She was named by Cutty Sark as the Outstanding Menswear Designer in  1982 and won the Council of Fashion Designers of America Menswear Design Award  in 1981. Along with her men's line, Barnes creates fabric designs for  commercial interiors.  </P> <P> Clothes have gripped the designer's attention since she was a teen-ager. The  outfits she made for herself and her friends so impressed her high school  principal that he asked her to design uniforms for the school's dance band.  When word got out, she was swamped. In fact, she nearly missed her senior prom  because she was so busy finishing up all of her friend's formals.  </P> <P> Although Barnes once had a women's couture line, she found menswear more  captivating.  </P> <P> "I started to like menswear in high school," she says. "It seemed like the guys  never had any attention before and I noticed they actually really loved  clothes, but they didn't think they should. It was time they got some  attention."  </P> <P> Besides, she adds, designing clothes for women is not as much fun.  </P> <P> "The women's fashion industry is not a nice business," she says. "There is much  more freedom in menswear."  </P> <P> She says when she was creating women's clothes the stores tried to dictate too  much. Buyers said she should design longer skirts or shorter jackets. She  wanted to design what she believed looked good, not what the buyers needed to  balance out their inventory.  </P> <P> She realizes, however, that most famous designers make clothes for women.  </P> <P> "I'm not in it for the publicity," she says. "I don't care if I'm ever famous.  I think menswear is very important and that's why I'm doing it."  </P></p>

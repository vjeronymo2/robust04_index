			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / US ends ban on meetings with Sinn Fein Pressure on London to clear the way for preliminary talks with Sinn Fein mounted significantly yesterday as the US launched the start of 'a normal relationship' with the IRA's political wing. Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, informed Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, in a telephone call that the US was ending its formal policy of not meeting Sinn Fein officials. A senior administration official said: 'The way to read this is the beginning of a relationship with Sinn Fein, a party with whom we've had no official contacts for 25 years.' Mr Gore's telephone call appeared carefully calibrated to raise the contact with Mr Adams to the highest level possible without offending the British government by a meeting at the White House. Although Mr Adams has been pressing for a week for a more conspicuous meeting with Mr Bill Clinton, US president, or Mr Gore, administration officials said he had not made any formal request for such a meeting. Downing Street's response to the telephone call was low-key. Officials emphasised that 'the Americans have got to decide for themselves' how they receive Mr Adams. The government is analysing with great care remarks made by Sinn Fein's president during his second visit to the US this year. London has promised to begin a dialogue on admitting Sinn Fein to talks on Northern Ireland's future within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence, but it is still not convinced that the month-old ceasefire is for good. Senior officials said yesterday that every day which passed 'without violence, without killing' gave grounds for optimism. A first meeting will take place today at the State Department between Mr Adams and Mr John Kornblum, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Mr Kornblum will be joined by Mr Leon Fuerth, national security adviser to Mr Gore, and Ms Nancy Soderberg, staff director of the White House National Security Council. In a letter to Mr Adams Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's principal national security adviser, said the Sinn Fein leader's 'role in bringing about the IRA ceasefire was a courageous step forward for peace'. A senior US official said the letter had been 'carefully written' so as 'not to get into word-games' over Mr Adams's refusal to describe the ceasefire as 'permanent'. Yesterday's move came as Mr Adams prepared for a high-profile television debate with Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p>

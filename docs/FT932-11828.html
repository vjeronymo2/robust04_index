			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI pleases Heavy trading followed the announcement of higher first-quarter results from ICI, with concentrated share buying in the London market boosted by demand in the unofficial 'grey' market. It was expected that ICI would pull something out of the hat for the last set of figures before its impending demerger and consequently the pre-tax figure would be comfortably above the consensus forecast of Pounds 180m. However, Pounds 233m was better than the most confident predictions. In spite of a certain amount of caution in the accompanying statement, the stock shot up 43 on the announcement and closed 31 ahead at 1278p after very heavy turnover of 4.8m. In the grey market operated by US investment bank Salomon Brothers, ICI 'new' were quoted sharply higher at 580p while Zeneca held steady at around 705p, with dealers talking of additional volume of around 1m shares.</p>

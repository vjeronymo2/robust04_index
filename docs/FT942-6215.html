			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / NZ budget goes into surplus Mr Bill Birch, New Zealand finance minister, said yesterday the country would show a budget surplus of NZDollars 420m (Pounds 163m) for the year to June 30, the first surplus for 17 years, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. This is a sharp turnaround from the Treasury prediction last October before the general election that returned the National party government. The Treasury then predicted a deficit of NZDollars 1.4bn. Mr Birch said that thanks to the rapidly improving economy, tax receipts would be NZDollars 2bn higher than expected, while government spending and other costs had been held down.</p>

"Only the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali  Khamene'i can pardon him (Szimkus)," Musavi Tabrizi told  reporters.    A German delegation headed by Deputy Justice Minister Rainer  Funke arrived in Iran a few months ago to request clemency for  the German spy from Iranian officials.    The prosecutor general said that Funke's request that German  spy be pardoned has not been sent to the leader of the Islamic  revolution for his decision.    On anti-narcotics campaign, Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi said  that a special joint law enforcement and army unit has succeeded  in tightly controlling the borders and preventing entry of  international drug traffickers and narcotic drugs.    He added that 70 percent of prisoners have been convicted of  drug related offences.    The ayatollah said that poppy cultivation in Pakistan and  Afghanistan, bordering Iran on the east, was one of the main  reasons for smuggling in of these drugs to Iran and added that  Islamabad and Kabul governments should pay careful attention to  the destructive outcome of poppy cultivation.    Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi added that by sealing off Iran's  eastern borders, 70 percent of the anti-narcotics campaign has  been completed.</p>

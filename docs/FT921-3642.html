			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 'Double whammy' knocks Enterprise down ENTERPRISE OIL, the indep-endent UK oil producer, was squeezed by rising costs and a weak oil price last year, resulting in a sharp decline in profits. But the company is maintaining its development programme and plans to double production in the coming years. Profits before tax amounted to Pounds 114.4m, down from Pounds 210.3m, a decline of 45 per cent. After-tax profits were Pounds 110.5m (Pounds 156.5m), equivalent to earnings of 24.5p (34.4p) per share. Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said that Enterprise had suffered a 'double whammy'. The sharp fall in the oil price last year had hit the company at a time when production costs in the North Sea remained 'stubbornly high'. Other factors in the fall included a decline in interest income and the absence of asset sales which had boosted the previous year's result. Nonetheless, Enterprise is increasing its annual dividend by 5 per cent to 15.75p, 'reflecting our underlying confidence in the business', Mr Hearne maintained. The proposed final is lifted to 9.25p (9p). 'These are testing times for the oil industry but we remain committed to our strategy,' he said. 'Enterprise has a successful exploration record and is on schedule with its development projects.' Production averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 11.5 per cent on 1990's level, at an average realised price of Pounds 11.88 (Pounds 12.91) per barrel. Investment totalled nearly Pounds 500m, and will amount to approximately the same amount this year as Enterprise pursues its aim of doubling output over the next few years. Aside from the North Sea, it is active in continental Europe and the Far East. Enterprise does not expect to see any marked recovery in the oil price in the foreseeable future. COMMENT The result, particularly size of the dividend rise, caused some disappointment in the market, where the shares shed 2p to close the day at 367p. The main culprit, it seemed, was the surprise rise in Enterprise's production costs at a time when many observers see spare capacity beginning to emerge in the North Sea. This was partly to do with the extra safety costs imposed by the Cullen report. But Enterprise is also approaching a high point in its activity cycle as it brings on important new ventures like the Nelson and Scott fields. The market doubted that the pressures which squeezed last year's result would go away this year. Analysts cut their profits forecasts by about a third from approximately Pounds 120m to about Pounds 77m pre-tax. The market remains confident of a rising dividend. The shares currently yield 5.7 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE SLIM COUNTY BUDGET, 24 OFFICIALS IN LINE FOR RAISES  </P> <P> At a time when Los Angeles County struggles with probable budget cuts and the  planned layoff of mental health workers, two dozen department heads are in line  to receive $174,501 in merit salary increases under the county's  performance-based pay plan.  </P> <P> Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon, in a report released Thursday,  has recommended pay boosts ranging from 3% to 12.9% for 24 general managers and  department heads as part of a management incentive program.  </P> <P> In addition to the proposed salary increases, the Board of Supervisors next  week also will vote on whether to give county department heads and elected  officials -- including themselves -- a $350-a-month allowance for "professional  development."  </P> <P> The financial package, which is tied to a similar proposed allowance for court  judges, is designed to pay for trips to educational seminars, the purchase of  books and personal computers or for other job-related reasons. But Dixon said  Thursday there would be few, if any controls, on how the money is spent.  </P> <P> "Quite candidly, you can have an individual who didn't spend it on  (professional development) but will spend it on suntan lotion on the beach,"  said Dixon, who said he still thought the payment was preferable to the paper  work involved in reimbursements.  </P> <P> The proposed salary increases include a suggested $11,180 pay hike for Eddy  Tanaka, director of public social services, that would boost his annual salary  to $105,000 -- and an increase of $10,590 for County Counsel DeWitt Clinton --  raising his salary from $99,410 to $110,000.  </P> <P> Dixon also lauded the performance-pay program, which affects 1,400 county  executives and division chiefs, as well as the department heads. "They clearly  aren't exhorbitant," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Program Has Worked'  </P> <P> "In my opinion, the program has distinctly worked," he said. "I think that we  have a system where people have taken on more work and performed better and . .  . collectively, (the increases) are reflective that they have done pretty darn  well."  </P> <P> Dixon said the salary increases -- the first since Sept. 1, 1987, for  department heads -- were in keeping with an average 9.5% salary hike most  county workers received during that same 16-month period.  </P> <P> But representatives of county labor unions said Thursday that they will  challenge the proposed pay raises, particularly when the county is facing  probable budget cuts and laying off or demoting several hundred mental health  workers. "That's obscene," said Henry Walton, director of health services for  Local 660 of the Service Employees International Union. "That is ridiculous.  How can the county afford to give raises like this when they are laying off  people?"  </P> <P> Under the plan, the largest percentage increase recommended by Dixon was for  Robert Arias, the county's affirmative action compliance officer, whose salary  would jump 12.9% from $60,667 to $68,500. The smallest single increase would be  a $2,002, a 3% raise for Francis Ching, director of the county Arboreta and  Botanic Gardens.  </P></p>

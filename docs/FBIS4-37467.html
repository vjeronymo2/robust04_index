			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel has become the first country to officially  lift its arms embargo against South Africa. This follows the  United Nations Security Council's resolution last month to  cancel the military embargo and other restrictions it had  imposed in the past. There had been speculation that the two  countries were cooperating on nuclear weapons and ballistic  missile research until Israel stopped signing arms contracts  with South Africa in 1987.</p>

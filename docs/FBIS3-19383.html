The spokesman added that the United Nations  should keep in mind that the region does not need new tensions.  Anyway, Venizelos said, Turkey is not the most ideal country  when it comes to the implementation of UN regulations. The  spokesman also repeated Greece's firm position against the  participation in the peacekeeping operations of countries that  are historically or geographically involved in the problem. The  spokesman concluded: The framework of Greek foreign policy is  formulated by the political party leaders' conference under the  president.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Spanish newspaper closes down El Sol, a colourful two-year-old attempt to topple El Pais from its position as Spain's biggest daily newspaper, gave up the chase yesterday and closed down, becoming the third Spanish daily to collapse in the last eight months, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. The closure of El Sol, owned by an ambitious book publisher, Mr German Sanchez, completes a near rout of some six daily general and business newspapers launched during the economic boom of 1987 and 1988.</p>

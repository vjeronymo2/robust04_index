			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Greece softens stance on Macedonia GREECE has adopted a new position on recognising the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, saying the issue of its name should be resolved through international arbitration and Athens would abide by any decision, Reuter reports from Athens. Athens had maintained it would never recognise the former Yugoslav republic under the name Macedonia, arguing it implied territorial threats against Greece's own Macedonian region. It blocked the republic's recognition by the European Community. Mr Vassilis Maginas, government spokesman, describing it as 'a new position of the government', confirmed statements to Bulgarian television on Wednesday by Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, who said Athens was willing to accept any decision taken through international arbitration. The idea of arbitration between Greece and Macedonia was first suggested by France in January. Athens then said it was willing to discuss the proposal but Macedonia turned it down. Meanwhile, Mr Branko Crvenkovski, Macedonian prime minister, said that United Nations sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia and the dispute with Greece were raising tensions and threatening the economy of his country. 'The block by Greece and by the United Nations against Serbia and Montenegro has cost Macedonia Dollars 1.5bn,' Mr Crvenkovski said during a visit to Rome yesterday.</p>

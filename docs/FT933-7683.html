			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Israel writhes under the goad of Hizbollah: Armed conflict risks overtaking diplomatic peace efforts ISRAEL'S problems in southern Lebanon refuse to go away. Just as the Jewish state was congratulating itself on last month's devastating seven-day offensive against Lebanese civilians, intended to curb attacks by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah militia, an increase in regional violence is back on the agenda. The death of at least eight Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon yesterday in two Hizbollah attacks, the first of which was followed by immediate retaliatory strikes by Israeli aircraft, has underlined the continuing fragility of the region. It has also raised the prospect of armed conflict overtaking diplomatic peace efforts and re-opened the fault lines between Israelis who argue for a more intensive peace drive and those calling for tougher military measures. Once again violence in southern Lebanon is driving Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, to weigh up (for the second time in a month) whether to pursue the diplomatic track or risk scuttling peace talks by more serious military action. Suspicions that Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon and the arms conduit to Hizbollah, tacitly allowed yesterday's attacks have also dented Israeli hopes of a real change in relations with Damascus. Israelis point out that yesterday's attacks came after Syria reprimanded the Lebanese government for deploying troops in southern Lebanon - a move which could have restricted Hizbollah activities. For 15 years, Israel, in defiance of UN resolutions, has been trying to 'purge' Lebanon of hostile Arab guerrillas. Today that goal is as elusive as it was when Israeli soldiers first crossed in substantial force into Lebanese territory in 1978, and later, in 1982, marched all the way to Beirut. Indeed, many Israeli military experts believe the country is now facing its most effective enemy in Hizbollah, which took over resistance to Israel after most Palestinian guerrillas were forced to flee Lebanon during the 1982 Israeli invasion. This year alone there have been more than 600 attacks on the self-styled Israeli 'security zone' in southern Lebanon. Yesterday's incidents brought the casualties for 1993 to at least 17 soldiers killed and 31 wounded. Furthermore, Israeli military analysts say the highly mobile Hizbollah is much better armed this year, with Iranian supplied Sagger anti-tank missiles and Strela shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft missiles. With the assistance of Iranian officers, it is also better trained. The Israeli public has come to expect revenge attacks and the pressures for serious military action is especially intense given that the government has been telling the public that last month's offensive, in which 130 Lebanese were killed, was a decisive blow against Hizbollah. Mr Rabin, a former army chief who embodies the belief that diplomacy must be backed by force, will also come under intense lobbying from military hardliners and Israeli hawks led by Mr Ariel Sharon, the former defence minister responsible for the disastrous 1982 invasion. Mr Sharon has called for an expansion of the security zone by the creation of a 'supplementary zone' between the Litani and Awali rivers where Israeli troops and their Lebanese proxies would have freedom of action without maintaining a military presence. 'Villages in the zone which have concealed terrorists for years should no longer be left standing,' he wrote recently. Few Israelis back Mr Sharon's military adventurism. Most fear being sucked into another Lebanese quagmire like the 1982-85 campaign, where 654 Israeli soldiers died and thousands were wounded. But many also believe that Israeli aerial and artillery retaliation leave the underlying problems unsolved. Some hardliners, therefore, see an answer to the problems in suspending peace talks with Syria. 'More Israeli retaliation is futile. We should tell Syria to go to hell,' said Brig Gen (Res) Aharon Levran, former deputy head of military intelligence. 'Hizbollah is a whip in Syrian hands to hurt Israel and we should not talk peace with them any more. The problem is that this government wants peace at any price. They want to put their names in the annals of history and they don't give a damm about the true and cruel realities.' However, a majority of the government and the public still recognise that only a comprehensive Middle East peace deal will solve Israel's problems in southern Lebanon. 'We must prevent ourselves being tempted into deeper military involvement in Lebanon or we will have casualties like this every day,' said Mr Ran Cohen, an MP from the left-wing Meretz party. 'Military action will not stop the violence; only a peace agreement will stop it. This is the only way.' Attacks by Hizbollah, combined with suspicions of Syria, weaken the voices of reason and moderation in Israel and threaten wider conflict. But the lesson of Israel's actions in Lebanon in the 1970s and 1980s is apparent to all but the most diehard Israelis: that violence is no substitute for genuine negotiation. Israelis who are seriously committed to peace hope the same message is understood in Syria.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Bank Set to Help Home Exporters"] </F>   [Text] The Export and Import Bank of China concluded its  first hoard meeting in Beijing yesterday with a pledge to  finance the country's high value-added machinery and electronics  exports.    Tong Zhiguang, chairman of the Board of Directors, said the  bank will start operations on July 1, and accumulate total  assets of 5 billion yuan ($570 million) by the end of this  century.    Its registered capital is 3.38 billion yuan ($388 million).    Established on April 26 with the approval of the State  Council (China's cabinet), the bank is one of the three policy  banks that provide preferential loans to State key industrial  and trade sectors.    The other two are the State Development Bank and the  Agricultural Bank.    The government decided to set up policy banks so that they  can help State key projects stay afloat by providing more long-  and medium term loans.    Lei Zuhua, governor and vice board chairman of the bank,  said  the bank will focus on export credit initially.    "At the same time, we will prepare for credit insurance and  guarantee business," he said. The bank is expected to approve 3  billion yuan ($345 million) worth of loans to domestic exporters  this year. The loans actually delivered, how ever, would be 2  billion yuan ($230 million), he disclosed.    Tong said the bank will gradually increase the amount of  export credit as the country has vast potential in tapping the  export of technology-intensive machinery and electronic products.    In 1993, the export of machinery and electronic products.  including complete plant systems, accounted for only 24.7 per  cent of the nation's total export volume.    About 60 projects have sought loans worth over 10 billion  yuan ($1.15 billion) from the bank. But Lei said that three  projects are likely to receive loans worth a total of 500  million yuan ($57.5 million).    They involve the launch of an overseas satellite and the  export of a ship to Norway and training aircraft to Pakistan.    Lei also said that his bank is expected to issue 1 billion  yuan ($115 million) to 1.7 billion yuan ($195 million) worth of  domestic bonds this year.    Besides export credit, credit insurance and guarantee, the  bank can also deal in government loans and mixed loans, which  are related to the export of China's machinery and electronic  products.    International inter-bank and syndicated loans, the issue of  financial bonds overseas and project assessment are also part of  the bank's business scope.</p>

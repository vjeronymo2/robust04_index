			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIM 'PEOPLE'S POWER' AID TO THE PEOPLE;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: DESPITE PRESIDENT AQUINO'S GOOD INTENTIONS, SO-CALLED DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAMS ARE VICTIMIZED BY OLD PATTERNS OF CORRUPTION, NEGLECT AND BUREAUCRACY.  </P> <P> With pin-striped economic advisers in tow, Philippine President Corazon Aquino  descends on the United States this week to drum up more investment and aid for  her debt-ridden economy. So frequent have been such borrowing trips that  cartoonists at Manila's dailies have had a field day lampooning Cory carrying a  begging bowl from one world capital to another.  </P> <P> Would-be investors, members of Congress and the American public would do well  to fight the inclination to fill the bowl further as the way to improve the  lives of the majority of Filipinos.  </P> <P> A year of research across the Philippine archipelago convinced us that Aquino's  "people's power" agenda is hopelessly stalled as far as the government is  concerned. And enhanced financial flows from the United States through what was  originally called a mini-Marshall Plan (and is now known as the Multilateral  Assistance Initiative) cannot overcome this basic obstacle.  </P> <P> Aquino's promise of land to the tiller has degenerated into a program of almost  comical scandals in which wealthy landlords sell their worst parcels of land to  the government at ridiculously inflated prices, which  peasants-turned-landowners must repay in full. This may be the first land  reform in history in which the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.  </P> <P> Similarly, loggers are tearing down Philippine forests at a rate that is among  the fastest in the world. The core of the problem is a timber-licensing system  in which about 90 wealthy individuals have been granted control over most of  the forests. Time and again they avoid replanting new trees by using part of  their ample profits to buy off government and military officials.  </P> <P> Aquino did not help the situation earlier this year by appointing a wealthy  businessman, Roberto Villanueva, to head up an agency created to oversee the  new aid. Villanueva put together an uninspired policy framework that would  channel the mini-Marshall Plan to an almost endless list of large projects that  fail to address poverty and environmental destruction. As Yale economist Gustav  Ranis recently warned in a critical assessment of the aid plan, giving lots of  money to Aquino's "return to the same old discredited narrow growth path" could  "do more harm than good."  </P> <P> News of Aquino's failures is undoubtedly jarring to Americans who invested so  much hope in the exuberant symbolism of her victory over the Marcos  dictatorship. Yet we should have realized that improving the prospects of the  two-thirds of Filipinos who live and die below the poverty line would require  substantial redistribution away from the small elite who have long controlled  the Philippines' economy and natural resources. With her family owning one of  the country's largest sugar plantations (where we observed race horses living  better than migrant workers), Aquino was ill-positioned to initiate the  necessary land and other reforms.  </P> <P> Fortunately, a far more fruitful and inexpensive alternative for U.S.  assistance was clearly visible as we traveled the Philippine countryside. While  stalled at the government level, the people's power agenda of social reform  continues to percolate in pockets of action around the country.  </P> <P> Farmers on the southern island of Mindanao -- men and women, young and old --  described to us their fears as they sat down for 11 days and nights to blockade  logging trucks passing through their town. Mudslides from denuded mountains  were destroying their fields, and help was not forthcoming from the government  far away in Manila. The peasants felt that they had no alternative but to act.  Despite brutal harassment by the military, they eventually forced the  government to cancel the loggers' licenses. Now the farmers want assistance to  replant the trees and to halt the logging that continues illegally.  </P> <P> Fisherfolk in the central Philippines are fighting the depletion of fishing  banks by Japanese trawlers and the destruction of nearby coral reefs in which  fish live and multiply. They seek assistance to create sustainably managed  marine reserves and to build artificial reefs from old tires or concrete.  </P> <P> Tribal Filipinos on the northern island of Luzon are fighting loggers and  mining companies that have encroached on their ancestral lands. They simply  want recognition of their land rights so that they may continue their  traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture.  </P> <P> It is these people's power initiatives of the poorer majority in the  Philippines that should electrify the world. They would benefit from modest  amounts of outside aid. In this case, more is not better. Indeed, the billions  of dollars that currently flow through the World Bank and government aid  agencies toward large projects simply line the pockets of government officials  and private contractors.  </P> <P> Rather, the United States could cut substantially the half-billion dollars in  aid it has earmarked for the Philippines next year and use the remainder to  endow a new foundation in Manila. Administered by experts from non-governmental  Philippine and U.S. development organizations, the foundation could direct  assistance toward promising small-scale initiatives.  </P> <P> To Cory Aquino and her well-dressed entourage, the message should be firm: The  United States wishes to channel its limited aid resources toward people-powered  programs -- programs that enhance equity, participation and ecological  sustainability. Until the Philippine government proves by its actions that it  is unequivocally behind such an agenda, U.S. aid should go directly to those  who are putting their lives on the line to advance that dream.  </P></p>

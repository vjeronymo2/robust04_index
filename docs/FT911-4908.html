			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: D-Mark warrant launched by Amex THE American Stock Exchange (Amex) yesterday launched a new D-Mark warrant to meet demand from US investors for a financial instrument that reflected the changed economic conditions of united Germany, writes Patrick Harverson. The D-Mark currency warrant - which trades like a call option and fluctuates in value as the US dollar rises or falls against the D-Mark - carries a strike price of DM1.7 and expires on September 30 1992. Issued by Merrill Lynch, it is the first D-Mark product launched by the exchange since the reunification of Germany last year. Amex said that investors had been seeking an instrument that took into account the effect on the D-Mark of German unification. The warrants would allow investors to participate in long-term investment or hedging strategies, said Amex. . .The price rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 3 1/4 on turnover of 6,100 warrants by midday.</p>

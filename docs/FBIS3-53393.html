			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin believes it was  a mistake from the outset to build settlements in all the places  where they were established, including the Golan Heights. At  the same time, he says, the settlements cannot be scraped off  the face of the earth retroactively. Interviewed on Qol  Yisra'el, Beilin said most of the settlements will not remain  under Israeli rule under the permanent arrangement and that,  consequently, an agreement should be reached with the  Palestinians and the Syrians whereby Israelis will be allowed to  remain in their settlements under Arab rule.    The Golan Heights Settlements Committee is demanding that  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin clarify whether Beilin's remarks  reflect the government's policy and, if they do not, to fire  Yosi Beilin.    Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Hanan  Erez, chairman of MAPAM [United Workers Party], has also  criticized Deputy Minister Beilin. Erez believes that such  pronouncements, coming on the eve of the Clinton-al-Asad summit,  are unnecessary and damaging both politically and in terms of  their impact on the mood of the Golan settlers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, Apr. 25 (MAP) -- Morocco is amazed at the  "vigorous and deluding" statements of Algerian ambassador to  Spain this April 21 during an international conference to  support the peace plan in the Sahara, a Moroccan official source  said.    The Algerian diplomat's address unveils a total ignorance of  the stances of each side and of the evolution of the UN  secretary general's efforts, the source said adding the address  was all the more amazing as the Algerian Government has  repeatedly claimed it was observing "restraint" regarding the  Sahara issue. The Algerian ambassador's statement was all but  conform to the pledge to restraint [as received], a fact that  leads us to wonder whether the statement reflects the official  position of Algeria or only a personal opinion, said the source.    The Algerian ambassador had stated that the present deadlock  in the Sahara issue was due to "hesitations of one of the two  sides ... while the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation  of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] has always showed a high  spirit of maturity."    On which basis does the Algerian ambassador make such  allegations, the Moroccan official source wonders adding that  seemingly the Algerian diplomat had not even consulted germane  resolutions of the Security Council and particularly resolution  907 which gives the secretary general until next June 30 to have  the Polisario adhere to the compromise on interpretation and  implementation of eligibility criteria.    If the Algerian ambassador had consulted the latest report  of  the secretary general, he would have learnt that Morocco has  accepted a year ago the compromise and consequently the one  responsible for the deadlock is the Polisario.    The Moroccan Government would have wished that participants  in the conference examine the situation in Bosnia where hundreds  of innocent victims are killed every day while others are living  in inhumane and deplorable conditions, the same source said.</p>

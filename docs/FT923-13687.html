			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Indian commerce minister steps down INDIA'S financial scandal claimed its first political victim yesterday with the resignation of Mr Palaniappan Chidambaram, the commerce minister, one of the key initiators of the country's economic reforms. The resignation followed his admission to prime minister PV Narasimha Rao that he and his wife owned shares in Fairgrowth Financial Services, which is being investigated in the securities scandal. Mr Chidambaram said his wife Nalini, who managed the family's financial affairs, had invested Rs250,000 (Pounds 4,600) of their money in Fairgrowth, which has been named by the central bank as involved in the scam. In a letter to Mr Rao, Mr Chidambaram, 46, said: 'It is my sincere hope that these small investments will not cause any embarrassment to the government. If they do, I would have no hesitation in stepping down from the office of minister. I leave the matter to your judgment.' Fairgrowth received Rs2.4bn (Pounds 48m) from a subsidiary of state-owned Andhra Bank while handing over securities worth only Rs1.35bn, according to the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, which said the balance was covered by allegedly forged documents testifying to the ownership of securities. Mr Chidambaram said he and his wife were not aware of the company's actions. 'My wife had no reason to suspect any wrongdoing,' he said. 'In fact, if FFSL have done anything wrong, we may stand to lose our investments.' The ruling Congress party said Mr Chidambaram had done nothing illegal by investing in a private company. A spokesman said his resignation was 'in the best traditions of the party'. Asked if the resignation would slow the economic reform process, the spokesman said reforms 'were a party programme' and would not be affected by the exit of one individual. The prime minister's decision to accept Mr Chidambaram's resignation is viewed as a strong signal that his government intends to unearth the truth about the Bombay financial scandal. However, some observers feared the move would slow the pace of trade liberalisation. A lawyer from Madras, Mr Chidambaram had built a good reputation in industrial and financial circles during his one-year tenure as commerce minister. He was credited with introducing export-import scrips, which paved the way for partial convertibility of the rupee. He accelerated liberalisation by simplifying bureaucratic procedures. Mr Chidambaram appeared in parliament yesterday but made no statement. His resignation was not raised because parliament was adjourned after pandemonium erupted over construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque at Ayodhya.</p>

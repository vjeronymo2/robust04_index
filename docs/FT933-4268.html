			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Baxter shares tumble by 15% after earnings alert SHARES in Baxter International tumbled nearly 15 per cent yesterday following a third-quarter profits warning by the US hospital supplier. Baxter, which achieved notoriety earlier this year by pleading guilty to co-operating with the Arab boycott against Israel, said its third-quarter earnings would fall below last year's Dollars 148m, or 53 cents a share. Analysts had predicted earnings of more than 57 cents. Following the warning, analysts at Cowen &amp; Company reduced 1993 earnings projections by 15 cents, to Dollars 2.05 a share, and cut 20 cents off 1994 predictions, to Dollars 2.20. Analysts at Cowen expect further cost-cutting moves will dampen Baxter's near-term earnings. The company also plans to cut senior management salaries by as much as 25 per cent, and to freeze other employee salaries. On Wall Street, Baxter's shares dropped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 22 7/8 , just above their 52-week low of Dollars 22 1/4 , in active trading. The news sent shock waves through the medical sector, with Oxford Health Plans down Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/4 and PacifiCare Health Systems plunging Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 34. Baxter blamed weak market conditions for its second consecutive earnings shortfall; in July, the company warned that second-quarter operating income would decline. Mr Vernon Loucks, chief executive, said revenue growth had slowed throughout the industry, reflecting changes in health care spending in anticipation of health care reform. 'Baxter did show revenue growth of 6.5 per cent for the second quarter of 1993,' he said. However, Baxter's problems run deeper than the industry's woes. The company has lost business from private hospitals and the US government in the aftermath of the Arab boycott debacle. Last month, the Department of Veterans Affairs banned Baxter from bidding on new contracts for up to one year. Although sales to US government agencies brought in only about Dollars 130m of the company's Dollars 8.5bn 1992 sales, and waivers have since been granted on about half of Baxter's VA business, the ban further damaged Baxter's credibility.</p>

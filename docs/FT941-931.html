			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Marshall acquires Bedford marque from GM Marshall, the Cambridgeshire-based vehicle and aerospace group, has struck a deal with General Motors under which it has acquired world marketing rights to the Bedford commercial vehicle name and bought the entire Bedford truck and bus parts business. The deal is expected to lead to a substantial increase in Marshall's truck production this year, from 400 to about 600. Executives of Marshall SPV, the umbrella company for Marshall's vehicle operations, regard the acquisition of the parts business as at least as important because of the large number of Bedford vehicles on the world's roads. Mr Dick Revell, Marshall SPV's parts director, said at the weekend: 'On a conservative estimate there are at least 500,000 out there.' Bedford, which has a 60-year history, was once the world's largest truckmaker. GM sold the Bedford truckmaking business for Pounds 22m in 1987, when it was losing Pounds 500,000 a week, to the entrepreneur Mr David Brown, who renamed it AWD. At one time under Mr Brown's ownership AWD was employing more than 1,300 people and making more than 5,000 trucks a year. After the business went into receivership in June 1992 Marshall bought from the receivers AWD's product designs, order book, rights to the AWD name and limited rights to the Bedford name. Marshall executives believe that a significant reason for AWD's failure was that its own deal with GM did not include the consistently profitable parts business. Most truckmakers earn most of their revenue from replacement parts rather than new vehicle sales. Neither Vauxhall Motors, GM's UK subsidiary which is the formal signatory to the deal, nor Marshall - a reticent company which prefers to conduct its affairs out of the public spotlight - would give any financial details of the agreement. One measure of the size of the parts business, however, is that Marshall has already shipped 170 articulated truckloads of parts to warehouses and distribution sites in Kent from the former Bedford factory at Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Marshall SPV was originally set up as Marshall of Cambridge (Engineering) to make vehicle bodies and exploit the international market for specialist military vehicles such as field ambulances. It changed its name two years ago and has extended its activities in the civilian vehicles field. Its range includes refuse disposal vehicles, single-decker buses and car transporters and trailers. It also owns Carlisle, the Birmingham-based busmaker. Mr Bob Crosby, the UK sales manager, said the company had no intention of re-entering the mainstream commercial market for trucks. Marshall has been awarded exclusive rights to the Bedford name and trademark throughout Europe. Its rights outside Europe are non-exclusive, although GM's own use of the Bedford name - confined to a few developing world markets - relates only to light vehicles such as Isuzu-built pick-ups.</p>

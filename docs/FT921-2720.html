			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec needs to cut output further, analysts say OIL PRICES could remain stuck at current low levels or even slide further without more decisive action by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, many market observers believe. Traders felt that Opec's decision at its February meeting to cut just over 1m barrels a day from production was not sufficient to lend much strength to prices during the second quarter. Now those output cuts are beginning to feed through to the market and volumes for sale show that not all countries are sticking by the agreement. So far the modest production cuts have not been enough to raise prices, but just enough to keep them in a steady range. 'Opec countries would all like to see prices Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 higher but the key players are not prepared to take further action to achieve that,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. North Sea Brent crude oil has shown some strength in the last couple of days as traders have seen Saudi Arabia making a clear effort to cut its deliveries. But at Dollars 17.80 a barrel, Brent for May delivery is only 30 cents higher than its level following February's Opec meeting, when it lost almost Dollars 1 a barrel. Crude buyers say that they have seen Saudi Arabia cutting back on any extra oil sales this month and restricting customers to existing contract levels. Most observers believe that the kingdom has cut production by some 400,000 b/d to 500,000 b/d down to a level of 8m b/d  - just above its allocation under the Opec agreement. The kingdom has been joined by Abu Dhabi which is reported to have cut by some 200,000 b/d and belatedly, by Nigeria where officials are trimming output for April. This has led to a production decline for Opec of about 750,000 b/d - still slightly short of the organisation's target of just over 1m b/d. Iran has been forced to reduce its deliveries by bad weather at the Kharg Island terminal - its main loading point - where tankers are reported to be backed up. This has led to a drop in Iranian oil in the market for April, but many observers expect that, once the weather improves, Tehran will return to full production. Mr Stanislaw believes that, for prices to rise, Opec will have to slash its output by at least another 1m b/d. But oil ministers are currently unwilling to give up that much volume. Since Opec's new production regime is based more on capacity than historical quotas, countries could be resisting cuts now in order to gain higher production allocations in future agreements. 'If you assume Iraq will be out of the market until after the US election, you have a couple of months of pain and then it all comes back for them,' said one market observer. Demand for Opec oil will begin to pick up later in the year, as buyers begin to build stocks in advance of the western winter. But the organisation could still face some tense negotiating at its meeting on April 24 when Saudi Arabia will resist calls from smaller producers to cut below 8m b/d. The kingdom is unwilling to shoulder the burden of production cutbacks without at least some token action by all other producers.</p>

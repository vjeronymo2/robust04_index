			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] has decided  to step up its efforts both at home and abroad toward gaining a  permanent seat in the UN Security Council [UNSC]. The decision  has been made because concerns have been voiced in some quarters  of the Japanese Permanent Mission to the United Nations, among  other relevant offices, that "Japan is not making itself clear  on this issue in comparison to Germany," as well as because the  ministry has judged that the public now has a deeper  understanding of the issue. MOFA plans to make stronger appeals  to UN member nations in the process of unfolding its UN  diplomacy and conducting bilateral talks.    Currently, the issue of Japan's bid for a permanent seat in  the UNSC is being discussed at a working-level panel on  reforming the current framework of the UNSC, and efforts are  underway toward working out details in preparation for a report  which is to be compiled by September.    In this connection, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa spoke at  an Upper House Budget Committee meeting on 15 June, reiterating  Japan's strong bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. He said:  "Countries being considered as candidates for permanent  membership in the UNSC has been narrowed down to Japan and  Germany." Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to the United  Nations, likewise, clearly indicated Japan's bid for a permanent  seat in the UNSC when he used the term "permanent member of the  UNSC" for the first time at an 8 June meeting of the  working-level panel on reforming the UNSC framework.    During the time of the administration of former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, such officials as then Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura were cautious about Japan's bid for  a permanent membership in the UNSC. As a result, "distorted"  relations existed between the Prime Minister's Office and MOFA.  However, such relations have ceased to exist under the  administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, resulting in  improved relations between the Prime Minister's Office and MOFA.  Thus, MOFA is now able to take a more determined stance toward  Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. All this has  contributed to MOFA's stepping up its efforts in this direction.  At the same time, MOFA's move has also been triggered by the  fact that the results of a recent MOFA public poll have shown  that a majority of the Japanese people support the nation's bid  for permanent membership in the UNSC.    However, opposition parties have raised objections to MOFA's  stance. For example, Shusei Tanaka, acting representative of  the Sakigake [Harbinger Party], has said: "MOFA is acting on its  own. Sufficient debate has not been held to clarify the  advantages and disadvantages of becoming a permanent member of  the UNSC." A senior official of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan has also said: "Currently, a broad understanding of the  people has not been gained regarding the issue." Apparently,  MOFA hopes to get the public involved in the issue by going as  far as to stir up a controversy.</p>

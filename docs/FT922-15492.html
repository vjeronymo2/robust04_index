			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: BCCI liquidators oppose loan discharge THE LIQUIDATORS of Bank of Credit and Commerce International are opposing a move to discharge a debenture giving the bank a charge over all the assets of Taplute, a company part-owned by Mr Nazmudin Virani's Control Securities. The High Court yesterday adjourned Taplute's application to cancel the debenture to enable the liquidators to put in evidence. The dispute stems from a joint venture in September 1989 between Control Securities and Batace, a company controlled by Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi businessman who has been named by the US Federal Reserve as having acted as a front man for BCCI in purchasing stakes in US banks. The fruit of the joint venture was Taplute, which bought the Ocarina chain of Spanish hotels from Bass, the brewing group, for Pounds 45m. Mr Philip Heslop QC, for Taplute, told the court that Control and Batace each provided Pounds 5m for the payment of the first tranche of the purchase price, the Pounds 35m balance being guaranteed by BCCI. As security for that guarantee BCCI was granted a debenture over all Taplute's assets. Taplute had sought discharge of the debenture and offered BCCI the Pounds 124,000 due on overdraft which Taplute claimed was all it owed the bank. However, last month the liquidators had demanded Pounds 7.1m, the additional amount representing Pounds 5.8m transferred from Batace to Taplute in September 1990, plus interest. Taplute denied that it was liable for the additional amount, Mr Heslop said. He read evidence in which Mr Virani stated that Taplute's account at BCCI showed that in September 1990 it had received equal contributions from Control and Batace towards the Pounds 11.6m second tranche due to Bass. However, Mr Heslop said, the liquidators claimed to have unequivocal evidence that Batace denied having made any payment in September 1990. That evidence was a letter from Mr Farouk Zavahir, Mr Pharaon's UK representative, stating that Batace had sold its interest in Taplute to Mr Virani and Control. Mr Virani denied such a sale had taken place and contended that it would have been inconsistent with an agreement last November between Control, Bellhaven (a Control subsidiary), Batace and Taplute. Mr Charles Purle QC, for the liquidators, said they regarded the November agreement with a great deal of reserve and suspicion. It appeared to have been made primarily to enable Taplute to enter into an agreement with Bass which would give Bass a security covering the same assets as the BCCI debenture.</p>

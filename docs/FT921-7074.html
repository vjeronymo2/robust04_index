			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Time runs out on the road to survival The collapse into loss of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has come as an unpleasant development at the end of the career of Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive of Vickers. Sir David retires at the end of May, and time is running out for him to put in place a strategy to ensure the survival into the next century of one of the world's most exclusive car marques. Vickers' Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary suffered an alarming Pounds 90m slide in its fortunes last year as losses of around Pounds 60m replaced a profit of some Pounds 30m in 1990. Now if the price is right Rolls-Royce is for sale, although there may be no buyers about, at least at the price acceptable to Vickers. BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, has been at the centre of most speculation with City analysts insisting that Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW chairman, visited the Rolls-Royce plant two weeks ago. However, BMW countered yesterday with the apparently unequivocal statement: 'We deny that any negotiations are being conducted about BMW taking any sort of shareholding, either minority or majority in Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.' The Vickers board repeated yesterday that it was continuing 'to review the options for the future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in the best interests of shareholders'. Sir David, insisted that in discussions to date 'we are not in the mode of a 100 per cent sale,' but he added that 'we cannot delete any option'. Vickers faces a cruel dilemma. It cannot allow a distress sale in mid-recession of a business that has produced consistent profits for two decades. On the other hand it is being pulled into overall loss by a business that needs an investment of more than Pounds 200m during the next six years to develop a new product range. The urgent review of the car business is bitter medicine for the Vickers chairman. Sir David never dreamed the fortunes of the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars business could fluctuate so wildly. Almost with an air of disbelief at the scale of the losses, he insisted yesterday that the car operations had 'averaged a 30-35 per cent return on capital through the 1980s. It has a solid business record. It is not a flaky business'. Trading conditions for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which includes the Bentley marque, were 'the most difficult we have ever experienced,' he said. Exceptional restructuring measures cost close to Pounds 35m with trading losses amounting to Pounds 25m. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars lost half its market in the face of the deep recession in its two main markets, the US and the UK. Sales worldwide fell 48.3 per cent to 1,723 - the lowest since 1968 - from the record 3,333 in 1990. Sales in the UK halved to 513 from 1,007, while sales in the US fell 65.2 per cent to 400 from 1,149 in 1990 and 1,216 in 1989. Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers managing director, who is to take over as chief executive in May, said the cost base at Rolls-Royce had been reduced by Pounds 30m a year, lowering the break-even production level to around 2,000 cars a year. Fixed costs have been reduced by 20 per cent and variable costs by 50 per cent. The UK workforce was cut by more than a third last year to just over 3,100. The recession allowed a new labour agreement to be pushed through finally removing many restrictive practices that disappeared elsewhere in the motor industry years ago. Team working has finally come to Crewe. The seven trades unions at the site are to act as 'a single union', and the number of union representatives has been cut from 110 to 40. Cars are still only being produced three days a week, however, with two days a week being devoted to training in new working practices.</p>

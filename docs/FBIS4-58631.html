			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports from Irbil have said that large-scale armed  clashes erupted in the past three days between Mas'ud Barzani's  group and Jalal Talabani's group. The clashes began in the  districts of Raniyah and Qal'at Dizah. Both parties used  various kinds of weapons, and many people were killed or wounded  on both sides. A number of innocent citizens were killed, and  their houses were demolished.    Fighting extended to the city of al-Sulaymaniyah, killing or  wounding many people. The situation in al-Sulaymaniyah  resembles a state of curfew. Detachments from both sides  erected control points on most roads in and outside  al-Sulaymaniyah. Many residents of al- Sulaymaniyah left their  homes and fled to adjacent areas in the belief that they are  more secure.    In the Dahuk governorate, Mas'ud Barzani's group occupied  the  headquarters of Jalal Talabani's group in all towns in Dahuk,  Zakho, al-'Imadiyah, and 'Aqrah, detaining their residents and  impounding their weapons.    In the governorate of Irbil, both sides yesterday exchanged  fire in Shaqlawah, the district of al-Siddiq, and Hajj 'Umran.  People who fled the area said that despite the calls made by  the cliques of saboteurs to halt fighting, there is still  continuous shooting between the two sides. The leaders of  saboteurs failed to address the situation, which was coupled  with cuts in the electric power and drinking water as well as  burglaries and looting of citizens' homes and properties.</p>

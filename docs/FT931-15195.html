			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Short accuses 'modernisers' LABOUR'S so-called modernisers are accused today of being ashamed of the party's past, devising policy in response to opinion polls and ditching the poor and the trade unions. In an outspoken article in the leftwing Tribune newspaper, Ms Clare Short, MP for Birmingham Ladywood, attacks the policy reformers and image-creators by claiming that people no longer know what Labour stands for. 'Many feel that they cannot trust a party that appears to have dumped everything it used to believe in and seems not to have a way forward that is different from the mess the Tories have created,' she says. The soft-left MP says the modernisers have stifled internal debate and claims that a strong policy platform devised after the 1987 election was 'watered down' by pollsters and 'sound-bite merchants'.</p>

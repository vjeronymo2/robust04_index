			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  (Free Democratic Party of Germany) wants the Chinese Government  to use its influence on Pyongyang in the controversy over North  Korea's nuclear program. In a talk with Chinese Justice  Minister Xiao Yang on Tuesday [29 March], Kinkel also pointed to  China's responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security  Council. Pyongyang refuses to have its nuclear facilities  inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    At the meeting, Kinkel insisted on the observation of human  rights in China, a spokesman announced after the meeting. The  minister emphatically referred to a special human rights case in  connection with the students' unrest of 1989, in which there has  still not been any reaction despite repeated requests by Kinkel.    The FRG Foreign Minister also advocated a "fair autonomy and  the protection of the cultural, ethnic, and religious rights" of  the Tibetans.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sergey Ostanin and Andrey </F> Surzhanskiy]    [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- The readiness of Russia and NATO  to embark on practical steps to implement the Partnership for  Peace program was confirmed today at a meeting between Russian  Federation Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev and NATO  Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, General George Joulwan.    Addressing a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry  on the results of the meeting, Pavel Grachev said that joint  preparations for a presentational document, reflecting specific  measures of cooperation between Russia and NATO, would start in  July at the level of military experts. Among other things, this  would clarify certain measures planned for 1994, of which there  are more than 30, and produce more detailed plans for military  cooperation in 1995. The minister said that the framework  document of Partnership for Peace and the Russia-NATO protocol  to the same program, both signed by Russia, open up a variety of  prospects for military cooperation.    Pavel Grachev noted that during the meeting agreement was  reached on the establishment of NATO missions in Russia and  Russian military missions at NATO's Supreme Allied Command,  Europe, and at NATO HQS. Agreement was also reached on a  telephone link between the General Staff of the Russian armed  forces and NATO's Supreme Allied Command.    According to Pavel Grachev, cooperation would also develop  between fleets and districts, "which will also take in military  units." Plans for cooperation also envisage participation by  Russian Defense Ministry representatives as observers at NATO  military exercises and talks between the General Staff of the  Russian Federation armed forces and NATO's Supreme Allied  Command. Pavel Grachev described consideration for Russia's  interests and the adoption of mutually agreed decisions as the  main condition for the development of such ties.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON'S NEW, HIGHER WATER RATES TO APPEAR IN BILLS RECEIVED IN OCTOBER  </P> <P> The price of water in Compton goes up this month.  </P> <P> Water rates were raised with City Council approval to 81 cents for every 100  cubic feet, up from 62 cents. The meter charge of $6.20 a month remains the  same.  </P> <P> Regina Turney-Murph, general manager of the Compton Municipal Water Department,  said that the increase means that a residential customer who uses 1,000 cubic  feet of water a month will see the bill rise to $14.26 a month, up from $12.26.  </P> <P> The fee charged for turning off a water meter will climb to $35, from $15.50,  and removal of the meter now costs $50, instead of $35, under the rate  increases that took effect Sept. 1. The department serves about 75,000 people.  </P> <P> "The cost of living, everything has gone up since 1984," when the department  had its last rate increase, Turney-Murph said. The rate increases were included  as recommendations in a management study and will allow the department to  finance major repairs of the water system.  </P> <P> She said the rate increases will show up on the bills received by customers in  October.  </P></p>

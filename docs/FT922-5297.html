			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (1): Comes the reckoning - Spain is celebrating its political and economic rebirth in flamboyant style. When the year's festivities are over, it will be asked to start paying the high price of its return to democracy and its European Community status SPAIN'S YEAR of fiesta as it celebrates the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage to America, the World Fair in Seville and the Olympic Games in Barcelona, will touch almost 20m people. It is a happy time and the perfect opportunity to salute Spain's progress since it emerged 16 years ago from the shadow of an introverted and small-minded dictatorship. But there is a cloud to this silver lining, probably one which only the people who run the country saw coming. For 1992 is also the year in which Spain is being asked to start paying the price of its young democracy's return to respectability and its entry in 1986 into the European Community. It is hard to describe what that meant to Spain, although it is measurable. Between 1986 and 1989 the Spanish economy grew at an average 5 per cent a year, far outpacing its large Community partners. Foreigners pumped about Dollars 30bn in direct investment into the country and more than Dollars 300bn into its debt and equity markets. Poor Spaniards rushed to fill their tiny homes with fridges and TV sets. Old cars were left to rot in ditches while new ones filled the streets. As imports were sucked in, Spain's current account plunged into deficit and has risen from surplus to a Dollars 16bn deficit in four years while the central government and 17 autonomous regional governments, not to be outdone, jumped on the freespending bandwagon. By last year central and regional government were borrowing some Dollars 23bn to finance their budgets, double 1989 borrowings, and efforts to stick with budgetary limits were simply thrown out of the window. Last year, the central government planned for a Dollars 5bn budget deficit and ended the year with a figure nearly three times bigger, passing the budget target in about April. This year, the figure is a more realistic Dollars 11bn but even that might be wildly optimistic. The state's cash deficit - which excludes interest payments - by the end of the first quarter of this year was 45 per cent higher than in 1990. The figures are, in themselves, manageable, but the socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in its 10th year in office, has an agenda that gets in the way. Mr Gonzalez is not really a socialist. He is a modern nationalist determined that his country should not be left floundering with Portugal and Greece once the European Community goes ahead with economic and monetary union and mints a single currency. There may be arguments for waiting beyond the 1997 or 1999 deadlines set by the EC for this but they fall on deaf ears in Madrid's ministries. The Gonzalez legacy to Spain will be to have shovelled it into the heart of Europe and locked it in, irreversibly, at the earliest possible opportunity. The Prime Minister knows better than anyone that unless Spain is pushed, it would find 1,000 reasons not to jump. When he and his Finance Minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, went to the Maastricht summit of EC leaders last December it was to deliver just that push by committing Madrid to the tough macroeconomic targets the summit established as necessary for any EC member to enter into EMU. Unless the Community's direction radically changes and Maastricht is discarded or softened to allow for the entry of new members, la suerte esta echada. For Spain, the die is cast. Madrid has five years to meet those targets, which will demand big cuts in inflation, interest rates and the public deficit. It is not a long time, considering that Spain failed to impose this promised discipline during the good years after 1986 and is now going to have to find a way to do so, and continue growing faster than the EC average, in a period of economic slowdown. Many of the targets in the convergence plan drawn up by Mr Solchaga seem quite optimistic, including 3 per cent growth this year and a reduction in the public deficit from a massive 4.4 per cent of gdp last year to just one per cent at the end of 1996. Spaniards have heard these promises before and they have always been sacrificed to political expediency and pressure from the socialist party. It happened last year when Mr Solchaga's tough budget draft was expanded to still party unease. While the plan's targets go beyond what Maastricht demanded the jury will stay out this time until it sees clear evidence of implementation. Mr Gonzalez has to call a general election before October next year and Mr Solchaga's next budget will be the last before that poll. Experience suggests he will try to be true to the apparent freedom Mr Gonzalez has given him to rein in public spending but, equally, that the party may fight it. But visitors to Spain's 1992 celebrations may run foul of convergence fairly quickly. Mr Solchaga, acutely aware that his plans to cut spending and to liberalise protected service industries could run in to all manner of hurdles if socialists political prospects begin to dim, in April took the unusual step of decreeing, without much debate, a sweeping cut in unemployment benefits which he combined with an increase in the time in work required to qualify for benefit. The measure could save Madrid up to Dollars 4bn this year alone. The trade unions, which behave in Spain as an extraparliamentary opposition, were quick to respond. They called a half day general strike last week and, unless the decree is withdrawn, a full day general strike will be held in October as well. The government is so far refusing to withdraw it and is managing, so far, to keep socialist party nerves steady by promising small changes. If the unions get the upper hand, more would be given away. For the moment, considerable labour unrest in the summer and autumn is almost inevitable, but it is the unions, not the Government, who might find the going tougher. As the strikes will not be about pay, it might be harder to sustain any mobilisation. What is happening could fundamentally change Spain. If the Government gets through the strikes and an election unscathed or even as leader of a coalition (which, if it were with the big Catalan party Convergencia i Union, would not overly bother Mr Gonzalez), it should have little difficulty implementing the rest of the convergence plan. That would blow away cobwebs - the pharmacy monopoly, ancient and powerful professional colleges, secure professorships and the doors that still remain closed to foreigners - in which much of Spain's economic culture is still trapped. In spite of the rapid modernisation of the country's infrastructure and financial markets, Spain still has to make one more giant leap before it can sit at the same table with the richer Community powers it so yearns to emulate. It is not a competitive economy yet. A recent confidential survey by the Industry Ministry found that fewer than half of Spanish businesses knew what effect the Single Market would have on them from next year. Nevertheless, local businesses had quickly absorbed the implications of one of the Government's boldest recent decisions - to lift all capital controls  -and almost half of the companies consulted said they intended dropping high cost Spanish banks to search for more competitive lenders elsewhere in the EC. The only way for a Spanish bank to compete with that kind of pressure is to cut its lending rates and reduce the industry's huge lending margins (around 4 per cent of total assets, the ECs highest after Greece and Portugal) to competitive Community levels. News like that must make life worth living for Mr Solchaga, who is attacked almost constantly and by almost everyone for forcing this economy to compete. But, somehow, in a pre-electoral period, with fixed capital formation plummeting (from 14 per cent growth in 1988 to a tiny 1.6 per cent rise last year), with unions on the attack and no obvious world economic upturn guaranteed to help him, he has to find a way of animating the economy, or at least disguising the bad news, without heating it up again. It is impossible to second guess the Government, but it seems unlikely Madrid will try to enter the narrow band of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism before an election. The fiscal sacrifice required to hold the peseta to a fluctuation of just 2.25 per cent against its partner currencies would be immense and politically dangerous. The government's best bet, it seems, would be to ride out the union protests against its benefit cuts. Spaniards may react badly to too much disruption and people are aware that the economy is delicate. If this works to the Government's favour an early election is possible. In order to avoid a clash with Expo, however (it ends on October 12), this might mean going to the polls in winter, which might not be popular. One thing not in doubt - barring disaster - is that Mr Gonzalez will be Prime Minister before and after that election and the only remaining question is how long he will then want to carry on.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WANTED DEAD . . . ONLY!  </P> <P> How often have you been riding down the freeway, or a city street, and come  upon something of strange color, shape and size? Upon closer inspection you  realize -- yuk! -- it's a dead animal of some sort -- a real eye-opener,  especially early in the morning. Then you drive by the same pile two or three  consecutive days and wonder how long it will be before someone scrapes up the  mess.  </P> <P> Sometimes the only way anyone in a position to do something finds out about the  problem is through a phone call. Maintenance crews are quite busy and do not  necessarily know what remains. It's just not possible to patrol all the city  streets, county roads and freeways in search of sail cats.  </P> <P> The Caltrans maintenance office reports receiving 10-15 calls per week. Callers  are usually women and are always very pleasant, if a little shocked at the  sight on the road. Here's a handy reference list for when you come across a  coyote carcass. Keep it in the glove compartment of your car. And the next time  you see a dead animal on the road you can report it.  </P> <P> To report dead animals on freeways, call Caltrans: (714) 639-6682  </P> <P> In the cities:  </P> <P> Costa Mesa: Call (714) 754-5311 to report a dead animal in the street; you may  dispose of your pet at 99 Fair Drive, seven days per week, 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m.,  or you may have it picked up at no charge.

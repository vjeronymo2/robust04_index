			<p>Language: <F P=105>Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Le Tuan, S. V. Novikov, I. G. Savelev, D. N. </F> Shelkovnikov, Yu. V. Shmartsev]    [Abstract]A study is made of the processes which occur when  GaAs layers are doped with a Zn acceptor impurity during liquid  phase epitaxy from a Ga-Bi melted solution. The thickness of the  GaAs : Zn or Bi epitaxial layers as a function of the melted  solution composition is complex in nature. This is explained by  the complicated form of the liquidus isotherm curves in the  Ga-Bi- As system and the change in the mass transfer processes  in the microinhomogenous liquid phase. The nature of the way  atoms in the Zn mixture behave in epitaxial layers, in the  substrates and in satellite substrates during the growth  processes is researched by using photoluminescence methods with  layer-by-layer stripping. An explanation is given for the  nonlinear relationship of the concentration of Zn in GaAs layers  versus the content of Bi in the Ga-Bi solvent. This explanation  is associated with the change in the vacancy concentration in  the gallium sublattice and the nature of the Zn diffusional  transfer in the liquid phase. The constant doping level in the  epitaxial GaAs layer with the given solvent composition shows  that the basic doping mechanism is the capture of Zn impurity  atoms from the liquid phase during the growth process.</p>

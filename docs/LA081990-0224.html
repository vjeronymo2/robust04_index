			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO CO. PLAYS POLITICS WITH VENGEANCE  </P> <P> Fifteen aides to county supervisors got tickets to the ballet. Two planning  commissioners played complimentary golf. And veteran Supervisor Thomas F. Riley  was presented with a $150 cowboy belt buckle.  </P> <P> In recent years, the Mission Viejo Co. and its affiliates have given those and  other gifts to elected and appointed officials throughout Orange County and  beyond. They have also been significant campaign contributors.  </P> <P> Lately, some of that generosity has stirred controversy.  </P> <P> Planning Commissioner C. Douglas Leavenworth, who accepted $1,200 worth of golf  games, theater tickets and other gifts over the past five years, may have  violated conflict-of-interest law by subsequently voting on matters affecting  the development firm, state officials say.  </P> <P> Leavenworth says that he did nothing wrong and that the gifts he received from  the company didn't influence his votes.  </P> <P> But this is not the first time that the Mission Viejo Co. has found its  political activity under a spotlight. During the past several years, records  and interviews show, the firm has blended contributions, gifts and scorching  retaliatory campaigns against its opponents in a mix that has earned it a  reputation as the most politically pugnacious developer in the county.  </P> <P> Developers and other political players traditionally use a combination of  carrot and stick to wield their influence, and in that the Mission Viejo Co. is  no different. But the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of New York-based  Philip Morris Cos. Inc., has shown a particular fondness for playing rough.  </P> <P> Sometimes the company has been successful, and other times it has failed  miserably. It has nearly always been controversial.  </P> <P> "They are so antagonistic and so out of the mainstream," said Gregory A. Hile,  an attorney who has tangled with the company and who has represented both  developers and slow-growth advocates. "They're bullies, and they're very, very  nasty to deal with."  </P> <P> That view is widely echoed by environmentalists, by some county officials and  even by other developers. Indeed, the company's relationship with the county's  development community is at times tenuous: In 1986, the Mission Viejo Co.  resigned from the local Building Industry Assn. because its leaders criticized  county planning operations.  </P> <P> Despite vocal criticism in many quarters, the company does have its defenders.  Supervisors Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez, for instance, have each praised the  firm for its contributions to Orange County sports and arts.  </P> <P> And even while observers often savage the company's political practices, rarely  does anyone criticize its homes or its planned communities.  </P> <P> "I generally think the company is regarded pretty well," said Ben Meharg, a  Mission Viejo planning commissioner. "They've done a decent job with this  community."  </P> <P> Company Vice President David A. Celestin declined a request to be interviewed  for this article, and Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the company, said  officials with the firm do not discuss contributions to political causes except  in general terms.  </P> <P> "We support candidates who believe in free enterprise, good planning and good  government," Wetzel said. "That's our response to all questions dealing with  political contributions."  </P> <P> Although not a major contributor on the scale of the Irvine Co. -- which has  given $2.2 million to political causes and candidates since the beginning of  1987 -- the Mission Viejo Co. has donated $636,517 to various political causes  during the same period, according to county records filed by the company.  </P> <P> Every member of the Board of Supervisors has received modest campaign  contributions -- ranging from $250 to $1,000 -- from the Mission Viejo Co., and  the company is also the largest single gift-giver to supervisorial staffs. It  gave away more than $2,000 in meals, tickets and other gifts to the  supervisors' aides last year.  </P> <P> Campaign contributions go to state and local officials at all levels -- from  South County school board representatives to a Los Angeles County supervisor to  the lieutenant governor's campaign of state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport  Beach).  </P> <P> In many cases, the donations go to candidates who are in a position to make  transportation or cityhood decisions that could affect development of south  Orange County, and in a few instances, the donations come at timely moments.  </P> <P> Eleven months after she received $5,000 from the company for her state Assembly  campaign, for example, Local Agency Formation Commission member Evelyn R. Hart  voted against an annexation proposal that the Mission Viejo Co. strongly  opposed.  </P> <P> And three months after she cast that vote, the company added another $1,000 to  her Assembly campaign coffers.  </P> <P> Wetzel said the contributions were unrelated to Hart's position with LAFCO.  Hart said she believes the company contributed heavily to her campaign because  of its longstanding displeasure with incumbent Assemblyman Gil Ferguson  (R-Newport Beach).  </P> <P> Indeed, while the company rewards politicians it likes, its more significant  financial efforts have been directed at punishing officials it opposes.  </P> <P> The company spent $282,042 in an unsuccessful attempt to recall Mission Viejo  Councilman Robert A. Curtis earlier this year, a staggering sum that raised  eyebrows across the state.  </P> <P> Curtis, who retained his seat and has since met with company officials to  discuss their development plans for the community, said the company's  willingness to strike out at its opponents is what distinguishes it from other  county political donors.  </P> <P> "They spend money to support some candidates," Curtis said, "but they are  clearly the most aggressive of the large landowners in the county in terms of  their willingness to frontally assault those with whom they disagree."  </P> <P> Confronted with a challenge to its South County development agreements in 1988,  the company also came out swinging.  </P> <P> When the city of Irvine joined with Laguna Beach and slow-growth proponents to  challenge a development agreement governing construction of Aliso Viejo, the  Mission Viejo Co. helped finance a blistering legal response, suing then-Mayor  Larry Agran and two other council members and tying up the city in intense and  costly maneuverings.  </P> <P> "They bled the city's resources," Agran said. "They moved in their own Xerox  machine and had it operating full time while they copied 80,000 pages of city  documents. . . . They turned City Hall upside down."  </P> <P> Copying and depositions dragged on for months as council members and other city  officials were questioned again and again. The city's suit against the Mission  Viejo Co. and the company-financed suit against the city wound up costing  Irvine $465,000, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said, making the pair of  related cases the most expensive ever fought by the city.  </P> <P> Irvine's case against the Mission Viejo Co. eventually was dismissed.  </P> <P> Richard Munsell, a former county planning director who filed the suit against  the city, said his side's legal fees ran to about $750,000.  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo Co., he said, paid more than half that bill -- as legal fees  and not political contributions, the exact figures do not appear on public  disclosure statements that are filed with the government.  </P> <P> "We were very public about that at the time," Wetzel said. "(Munsell) came to  us and asked us if we would support his legal effort, and we said we would."  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach City Council was also sued, but efforts there went a step  further. After that council tried to block the Aliso Viejo project, three  council members -- Dan Kenney, Robert F. Gentry and Lida Lenney -- found  themselves the subjects of a recall campaign backed by the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> That campaign, sponsored by local businesses irritated that the council would  not permit certain forms of outdoor advertising, drew $3,600 in contributions  from the company.  </P> <P> "Our basis there was private property rights," Wetzel said. "The city of Laguna  Beach had filed suit against our Aliso Viejo development. There were people who  opposed that suit and defended property rights, and we supported those people."  </P> <P> But the company's willingness to strike back, either through recalls or in  court, has subjected it to intense criticism, more so even than the larger and  more powerful Irvine Co., according to many observers.  </P> <P> "You can spend the money. The difference is if you spend it crassly, people  will get upset," Mark P. Petracca, a UC Irvine political science professor,  said of the company's involvement in the Curtis recall campaign. "People do  have a sense of fundamental fairness, and what the Mission Viejo Co. did was  essentially unfair."  </P> <P> In retrospect, even some of the company's supporters say that its political  adventures probably have been ill-advised and may have damaged its reputation.  </P> <P> "I've heard people say that (the Mission Viejo Co. is) a little politically  naive, though I'm not sure I agree with that," said Planning Commissioner  Meharg. "It may be true, though. That may be why they get bashed a little bit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE POLITICAL PUNCH OF THE MISSION VIEJO CO.  </P> <P> While praised for the quaility of its housing developments, the Mission Viejo  Co. has been criticized for its contributions and gifts to some politicians,  and its agressive campaigns against others. The company has donated $636,517 to  a range of political causes since 1987. "We support candidates who believe in  free enterprise, good planning and good government," company spokeswoman Wendy  Wetzel said. "That's our response to all questions dealing with political  contributions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Money for state, county, city and school board candidates in Orange and Los  Angeles counties.  </P> <P> STATE OFFICES  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:4.31IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Name  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Office Sought  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marian Bergeson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> State Senator (Lt.

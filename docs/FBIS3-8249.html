			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["The Election Program of the Hungarian Socialist Party"] </F>   [Text] Hungary is again facing elections. It will decide  whether to give four more years of rule to those who turned  incompetence into a government policy and who lectured the  people instead of serving them. Hungary will decide whether to  keep in power those who further deteriorated the economic  situation and brought the economy to the verge of collapse,  people whose failure is reflected in an unemployment rate of  almost 1 million, the fall of the middle classes, massive  poverty, the hopeless situation of Hungarian agriculture, and  the spread of corruption. Hungary will decide whether to  continue to give credit to those who kept breaking their  promises.    Contrary to its promises, this government has not become a  government of freedom, because it is constantly attacking the  institutions of freedom, and especially the press. It has not  become the nation's government because, instead of cooperation,  it caused a fateful division. It has not become a European  government, because its policy is antiquated and it propagates  ideas that have been obsolete in the better part of our  continent for half a century, and it opened the way to extreme  right-wing efforts. It has not become the government of  economic change either; instead, it has become a government of  wasted opportunities. This government is responsible to the  voters for all this.    According to the socialists, it is the government that  failed, and not democracy and the market economy. We are facing  difficult years, because the wasted confidence and time and the  wasted goods and resources cannot be regained. The situation is  not hopeless only because there is a choice. This country can  be led out of the crisis and the conditions for national  prosperity can be created with an honest and competent policy  supported by society. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  offers such a policy to the voters.    Our program aims at Hungary's economic and social  modernization. We want a modern society based on an efficient  economy, one connecting economic rationality with social  solidarity, social care and modern education that reduce  inequalities of chances, protection of human rights and  universal human values, and the protection of nature and the  environment.    We believe that there is no way back! Hungary cannot be led  back into the deadend of either five or 50 years ago. We must  again take the road that the nation set out on with full  consensus in 1989- 1990, a road from which the nation was  diverted by the coalition. We do not promise a new change in the  regime; instead, we promise a foreseeable future that will again  lay the foundations for the people's lost faith. We want a  change, not chaos.    A Change in the Economy! [subhead]    We offer an economic policy that will halt the decline  within  two years and will lead us out of the crisis and create the  conditions of a lasting growth of 1-3 percent annually. We  offer firm legal frameworks, predictable economic conditions,  and venture-oriented financial possibilities. Our program  protects Hungary from an unforeseeable increase in our domestic  and foreign debt and from rampant inflation. We will force the  decline of the forint to between 15-20 percent within four years.    The essence of our economic policy is to reduce our  economy's  lack of capital, reduce its technological backwardness and,  thus, increase its competitiveness. We will encourage projects,  investments, and savings accordingly. We are determined to halt  state waste and limit government expenditures. We will increase  the pace of economic restructuring and will create the necessary  legal and economic regulations as well as the institutions that  are still missing.    We will attribute special attention to broadening the  foreign  markets of Hungarian products, especially rebuilding some of the  lost East European markets.    Our economic policy program pays particular attention to the  budget reform, the modernization of the Hungarian banking  system, the development of infrastructure, the revival of  agriculture, the structural reorganization and modernization of  our processing industry, and to tourism.    We are striving to develop a political, legal, and economic  environment in which an active capital of at least $1-1.5  billion annually will flow into Hungary, a capital essential for  laying the foundations of economic growth and servicing our  foreign debt. Our goal is that foreign capital should primarily  serve the spreading of modern technology as well as the  modernization of our infrastructure, including transportation,  telephone services, public services, and settlement development.  <H5>  An Honest and Efficient Privatization </H5>   We want an economy based on the decisive role of individual  and partnership private property, one that guarantees the equal  rights of various forms of property. We believe that the  economy functions efficiently through the interest of natural  owners.    We want to get rid of the current privatization practice. We  will continue to privatize the state property, but for the  benefit of increasing economic efficiency, preserving the  domestic market of competitive Hungarian products, and securing  technological development and employment. We will eliminate the  State Property Managing Company Ltd and will restore  parliamentary control over the State Property Agency. We will  use the funds originating from the selling of state property to  improve the viable companies, create new jobs, and cover the  debts of state enterprises.    We support the participation of small investors and  employees  in the privatization process, but we oppose the free  distribution of property. We will provide an active property to  the local self- government bodies and forms of public  foundations to educational, cultural, scientific, and sports  institutions. We want to prevent large-scale dismissals and  production reductions with guarantees stipulated in the  privatization contracts.    We reject the distribution of property and positions to  compensate for political services, but we respect property  acquired through privatization, as any legally-acquired  property. We will take a stand against abuses connected with  privatization and corruption through publicity and with every  legal means.   <H5>    Agriculture: Market and Production Security! </H5>   We want to put an end to the disintegration of the  agricultural sector. Our program serves the foundation of a  modern and competitive agriculture and of a secure future for  peasants. We will conclude the process of compensations. We  will reexamine the debts of agricultural farms and will  temporarily halt the land tax.    Our agricultural policy is in favor of agricultural  cooperatives; at the same time, it creates identical rights and  conditions and provides identical defense to all agricultural  producers and owners. In the course of privatization, our  program provides an opportunity for domestic producers to become  owners both in processing and marketing. Our program limits the  emergence of monopolies.    Our program would eliminate the chaos prevailing on the  producers' market and will offer improving incomes to producers.  In a short time, we will halt the decrease in agricultural  production and will lay the foundations for an annual growth of  3-5 percent.    By gradually stabilizing the standard of living, we will  halt  the drop in domestic consumption, including the drop in food  consumption. We will improve the competitiveness of our food  production. For this, we will introduce a market defense used  in the West, and we will initiate the broadening of the  framework of the agreement signed with the European Union and an  improvement in the marketing conditions of Hungarian products.  <H5>  Unemployment: Human Tragedy and Economic Shackles </H5>   We cannot promise the complete elimination of unemployment.  Not even a spectacular economic growth is capable of  eliminating the current unemployment rate of almost 1 million;  on the contrary, unemployment itself becomes the main obstacle  to economic growth. We can only change this situation by  counting on our society's resources and solidarity.    We want to prolong the training and instruction period so  that young people can seek employment later and with better  chances. We will gradually assert the right to the first job.  We want to free jobs by introducing part-time employment and a  flexible retirement system.    We offer an economic policy that also considers employment  factors in order to save jobs. We support the creation of jobs  through a new investment policy, the development of  infrastructure, and public utility work. In the course of this  activity, we will pay particular attention to helping the  backward areas to catch up.    We will reduce the number of unemployed people to about  500,000 by 1998 by means of coordinated economic decisions. We  will encourage the unemployed to find jobs by providing adequate  unemployment benefits and active employment help, without  forcing people. We will make their situation more bearable by  means of a humane administration.  <H5>  Legal Security and Democracy in the Employment Field! </H5>   It is only possible to solve the economic and social crisis  on the basis of a broad social agreement. In preserving social  peace, we attribute a key role to the coordination of interests  of the employers, employees and the government and to the active  system of social partnership. We regard the trade unions as  natural allies in the implementation of our program.    We want to strengthen legal security in the employment  field.  We will guarantee increased labor rights to women, people  raising small children, and people with reduced working  capacity. We will encourage collective agreements with  political and legal means.  <H3>  A Proper Human Environment! Help for Backward Areas To  Catch Up! </H3>   The value of environmental protection expenditures is  extremely low in Hungary. The deterioraton of the natural and  built environment is so big that it threatens the healthy human  life and the quality of work. Our program will increase the  environmental protection expenditure threefold in the next four  years. We want to cover the expenses from public funds, but the  correction of new environmental damages will be paid by the  polluters themselves. We want to focus our resources on halting  the pollution of our air and waters, saving the forests, and  spreading environmental protective and energy-saving  technologies. We will initiate the legislation of modern and  strict laws for the protection of nature and the environment; we  will particularly support the information and educational  programs connected with environmental protection.    We regard the development of backward areas and the easing  of  problems of village areas with critical employment and supply  conditins as basic tasks, and we also attribute great importance  to avoiding the extreme division of the country. We will set up  institutions of regional coordination in charge of working out  local and regional development programs. We want to create a  harmony between initiatives based on local resources and efforts  and the central development programs. We will initiate the  legislation of a law on regional conditions and tasks as soon as  possible.  <H3>  A Just Distribution of Public Burdens and A More Thrifty  State Budget! </H3>   We think it is just when everyone shares in public burdens  in  accordance with one's ability. Within the tax system, we want  to reduce the burden of personal income tax and increase the  percentage of consumer taxes. This would make it more difficult  to avoid taxes. We will considerably increase the corporate  tax, and we will make the invested incomes free of tax; however,  we will tax the accumulation of property. We will eliminate the  tax on the interest on forint and hard currency saving accounts  and the minimum tax, and we will restore the tax exemptions  encouraging the foreign investors. We will reduce the  exceptions and benefits. Along with reducing the central taxes,  we will increase the right of local government bodies to levy  taxes.    Today two-thirds of the income is taken by the budget. This  is an unbearably high percentage, but it can only be reduced  gradually. We want to pay particular attention to the reform of  state administration and to the reduction of expenses, deficit,  and income withdrawal. We will primarily save on wasteful and  inefficient political, state power and administrative expenses.    We want to stabilize the tax system in order to create a  predictable economic environment. It will be impossible to  carry out a considerable tax reduction in the next four years,  but it is possible to avoid the increase in taxes. The social  security payments that seriously burden wages can only be  reduced gradually, along with the reorganization of the welfare  system and the development of supplementary insurance.  <H5>  A Stronger Social Security! </H5>   The source of the most severe tensions in the coming years  is  that welfare expenses can only increase slightly. However, the  burdens of the most helpless strata of the society cannot be  increased any more. Therefore, we need a reorganization of the  welfare system in which help really reaches those eligible to  get such help.    Instead of the humiliating eligibility investigations, the  conditions of social welfare must be regulated by laws and local  rules. By modifying the welfare law, we want to increase the  basic social rights and expand the circle of recipients. Within  the welfare expenses, we will curb the bureaucratic  administrative and supervision expenses. We want to encourage  the welfare activity of various civil organizations  (associations, foundations, church services, and so on) by tax  exemptions.    We want to preserve the real value of family allowances  among  the low and middle strata of the population. We will make the  child- care benefits a citizen right, and an active grandparent  who accepts the rearing of a child will also be able to get such  benefits. We think that it is correct for the families to  receive support, rather than the institutions, if these families  enroll their children in nurseries and kindergartens.    We intend to take preventive measures for the benefit of  children and youngsters living in an endangered environment. We  will strengthen both the legal and institutional background of  the bodies in charge of this and of the follow-up care.    The social security self-governing bodies are the  independent  and responsible organizations of social security. We will  strengthen their role by providing them property and broadening  their rights.    We want to make sure that pensions at least increase  simultaneously with the net average salaries. We will guarantee  income supplements as citizens' rights to people over 70 years  of age who totally or partially lack any care. We will  gradually introduce a widows pension supplement. We will  introduce delaying measures for the benefit of women most  affected by the increased retirement age. We will work out a  flexible system of retirement, so that the people in question  can choose the most favorable of the given alternatives.    We are fighting against poverty, not against prosperity.  However, the process of pauperization can be halted at the end  of the next government period at the earliest. Poverty that  humiliates human dignity is everyone's shame. The economy  cannot get into such a situation that anyone starves or freezes  in the street. We regard the need for the society to jointly  and obligatorily help its fallen members as a minimum of human  solidarity.    Everyone has the right to basic health care. We want to  guarantee the circle and quality of services within the  compulsory health insurance by law. It is essential to settle  the financial situation of health-care institutions and the  wages of health workers. We will help the creation of private  practices and the operation of other health and welfare ventures  with adequate credits and tax exemptions. We will initiate a  national cooperation in preventing illnesses leading to early  death or physical impairment and in encouraging and spreading a  healthy way of life.  <H5>  A Chance for Sports! </H5>   We regard physical exercise as an important part of a  healthy  way of life. Therefore, first of all, we want to settle the  legal situation and ownership of the sports associations in  order to save the competitive sports, the student, and  leisure-time sports. We suggest that the sport clubs receive  the facilities they use in the form of public foundations. We  suggest that both private persons and economic units be able to  deduct their support for sports from their taxes.    We initiate the legislation of a sports law that will put  the  entire issue in a uniform framework and will create  institutional conditions for the development of competitive  sports, student sports, and leisure sports.  <H5>  Housing Also for People With Low Incomes! </H5>   We will work out a system of housing support that will  provide two-thirds of the relevant state funds to low-income  families. We will help the construction of new housing projects  with full reimbursement of value added tax.    We suggest that the state should provide support to local  government bodies for the development of plots with public  utilities suitable for housing construction and for the  construction of social housing. We will help young people  acquire their first housing with new and advantageous credits.  We find it extremely important to spread the housing management  ventures in towns, something that serves the mobility of the  population. We want to support the construction of family  houses that guarantee several generations living together. We  will encourage this program with adequate credits, tax benefits,  and proper inheritance rules.  <H5>  A Modern and Democratic Education! </H5>   As a basic condition of modernization, education is one of  the breaking points where we must focus the available resources.  In the wake of the state administration reform, we will halt  the decrease in the real value of educational expenditures by  1996, and we will gradually increase it later.    We want to increase the duration of the general and uniform  basic education, and provide increasingly broader chances for  secondary education. With the introduction of new training  forms, we want to guarantee studies in vocational institutions  and institutions of higher education for an increased number of  young people older than the compulsory schooling age.    We want to stabilize the schooling system. We will support  new institutional forms that exclude the need for an early  career and school choice, reduce the division of families  according to their financial situation, and guarantee the  progress of talented children. It is our basic goal to provide  school textbooks free of charge to children in a disadvantageous  situation. We will take measures to expand the supply of cheap  catering for students. In higher education, we will provide  social scholarships and exemption from tuition fees for students  in need.    We support the extension of the freedom of instruction.  According to the social demands, needs, and support, we regard  the strengthening of church and private schools as important.  At the same time, we think it is the obligation of the state to  guarantee an ideologically-neutral education. We oppose the  instruction of religion or any other organized activity based on  ideology in state schools.    We will eliminate the Educational District Instruction  Centers, and will restore the independence of public education  institutions, colleges and universities. We will make sure that  the state can only appoint leaders to the state institutions who  enjoy the support of most of the teachers and most of the  council members of the respective college or university. We  regard the ability of the educational institutions to use their  own property freely as a guarantee of the autonomy of higher  education. We regard the improvement in the training,  retraining, and living and working conditions of the teachers as  essential. We will assert the rights of student bodies by  creating the necessary conditions.  <H5>  National and Universal Values in Culture! </H5>   We want to serve Hungary's spiritual prosperity and the  preservation of our national culture. Our goal is to develop a  spiritual environment and social public mood in this country  that is favorable to the acceptance of an intellectual role  suitable for a modern society at the turn of the century, namely  to contribute to the financial and spiritual prosperity of the  entire nation by enriching culture in the widest sense of the  word, to make it open to anything new and thus help laying the  foundations of our prosperity, and to constantly signal the  disturbances in the functioning of the society and the mistakes  of the prevailing government.    We want to guarantee the complete freedom of culture, namely  of knowledge, research, arts, religion, publication, and  creation. The state cannot interfere in the culture as a guider  in any way whatsoever. However, it is the task of the state to  maintain the national institutions, guarantee their operational  conditions, and work out the legal regulations regarding  cultural activity. Cultural centers, libraries, and some of the  other institutions engaged in the spreading of culture have  preserved their ability to function so far. It is also a task  for the state and the local bodies to continue to maintain these  institutions and to restore and save those in danger. We are  urging, and we will encourage with tax benefits, the  contribution of local government bodies, public foundations,  civil organizations, private persons, and economic units in  supporting culture.    We regard the freedom and independence of scientific and  technical research as a natural condition. We support the  independence and democratic structural reorganization of the  Hungarian Academy of Sciences.    The Hungarian Radio and the Hungarian Television will  continue to play a special role in informing, educating,  entertaining the population, and in exercising a democratic  control over the government. On the basis of the bitter  experience of the past two years, we think that a law separating  the mass media from the prevailing government, political forces  and balance of power will guarantee an objective, multilateral,  and clear information. We find state ownership over the press  incompatible with the freedom of the press.  <H5>  Independent Churches and Free Religious Life </H5>   Spiritual freedom means the freedom of religious people and  non- religious people alike. We respect the independence of the  churches: They should be independent of the state and should  not engage in the political struggle on either side.    We highly appreciate the role of the churches in supporting  the ill, the old, and the fallen, and we acknowledge their  activity in education. The churches must also receive budget  support for this.    We fully accept the rights of the churches to have their  property restored. Our goal is to see to it that that this  process takes place as soon as possible, to the extent of public  support and actual church activity, with the consideration of  material and financial conditions, and by coordinating the  different interests. We want to assert the spiritual and  religious freedom and the peaceful coexistence of believers and  non-believers in everyday practice in cooperation with the  churches.  <H5>  Public Security </H5>   We find it particularly important that the citizens feel  that  they, their families, and their property are safe. The defense  of life and values precedes every other task. For this, it is  essential to increase the number of policemen, improve their  professional training and technical equipment, and provide  financial appreciation of the police staff.    We need a firm, but not a violent, police. It is expedient  to shift some of the tasks related to public road control and  administration to the local government bodies and give them  rights with which they can influence and control the activity of  the police. The aforementioned changes can only lead to results  if society supports the cause of public safety and the various  civil organizations help this cause.   <H5>    A More Complete Democracy and a Cheaper State! </H5>   There is no, nor can there be, political interest for us the  assertion of which could precede the values of parliamentary  democracy. We consistently defend the principles of a  constitutional state, the democratic institutions, and the  human, national minority, social, and cultural rights. We want  a firm bourgeois democratic regime. We want to formulate the  foundations of such a regime in a new constitution that  expresses the requirements of a social constitutional state.    We will attribute greater role than hitherto to the direct  forms of democracy, to the participation of citizens and their  communities in the decisions. In accordance with the  requirements of social partnership, we will systematize public  dialogue in the legislative process. We want to create a system  of public supervision and control over public foundations  created by the government.    We want parliament to play a genuine role in supervising the  government and we want to strengthen the Parliament's character  of shaping policy. We want to declare the assertion of  ministerial responsibility in the form of a law.    We want to broaden the role of the president of the  republic,  and we find it necessary to create his independent tasks and  authority. We suggest to eliminate the uncertainty prevailing in  the president's constitutional status. We will initiate the  direct election of major public figures by the citizens.    We find it essential to assert the independence of judges  and  of their power. We think it is correct if judges decide on  their leaders.    We want and offer a more thrifty, professional, and  efficient  government and public administration. We will limit the  spreading of government bureaucracy. At the same time, we want  to increase the freedom and responsibility of citizens and their  communities, civil organizations, and self-government bodies.  We will cut bureaucratic expenses considerably: We will  initiate the elimination of compensation offices, decentralized  government offices, and some ministries, or the reduction of  their personnel. We will reexamine the position of minister  without portfolio. However, we will strengthen the organization  of justice administration, police, customs, and tax authorities.    We need non-party-affiliated public servants independent of  government changes, civil officers who deserve social and  financial appreciation on the basis of their professional  knowledge and honesty. We must finally do away with the  property-hoarding personnel policy.    Our goal is to develop self-government bodies that serve the  citizens. For this, we will initiate the modification of the  law on self-government bodies. We find the direct election of  mayors and the expansion of the authority of local referenda  justified. We want to eliminate the regional institution of  republic commissioner; a small county office is sufficient to  replace the republic commissioner. At the same time, we want to  strengthen the role of elected county bodies.    We will continue to play an initiative role in the assertion  of the individual and community rights of national minorities  living in Hungary and in the consistent implementation of the  law on national minorities. We support the creation of national  minority self- government bodies and a change in the national  minority education. We will pay particular attention to  supporting the relevant efforts of the Gypsy population.    We think that a smaller army than today is necessary, one  gradually modernizing, an armed force respected and appreciated  by the society, an army that carries out Hungary's defense with  a well- trained staff free of politics and subordinated to the  country's interests. Just as it is natural that the  organizational order of the Army is based on strict discipline  and relations of subordinates and superiors, the same way we can  expect that human rights are fully implemented in the Army. We  will attribute particular attention to supporting such efforts  by the Gypsy population.  <H3>  Rapprochement With Our Neighbors and Living As Hungarians in  Europe </H3>   We offer a historical rapprochement and reconciliation to  Hungary's neighbors. In our foreign policy, there is no place  for reminding of historical grievances, a mission awareness, or  ideological considerations. We are ready for clarifying debates  and new initiatives in order to lay the foundations of good  neighborly relations. We want to trade, rather than engage in  litigations.    We think that the security and stability of Central and  Eastern Europe can be strengthened by confirming the borders in  the international law and fully asserting the rights of national  minorities. We find it essential to mutually build confidence,  develop bilateral relations and regional cooperation, and to  make the borders open. We want to serve the full assertion of  the rights of Hungarians living abroad and the acceptance of  autonomy efforts in harmony with European norms with a firm and  calm policy. We will continue to take a stand at international  forums for the creation of an efficient system of national  minority protection.    We can only guarantee the foreign resources and markets  indispensable for the development of the Hungarian economy if  Hungary becomes full member of the European Union. The domestic  conditions for joining the European Union must be created as  soon as possible. It is necessary to further develop Hungary's  relations with NATO, but NATO-membership is not the only  possible guarantee for Hungary's security. A referendum must  decide on joining the European Union and NATO.    The Hungarian Socialist Party relies on the best traditions  of the 1,100-year past of this nation, the lively political and  spiritual heritage of the great figures of our nation, and on  the current special historical possibility in which the people  can decide on their own fate. The MSZP wants to serve the  citizens, and does not ask services from them. The MSZP  promises, but does not keep promising.    In harmony with the aforementioned political program, we  formulated our concrete, detailed, and professionally-founded  ideas that could provide the basis of government activity. If  we gain the voters' confidences, we will count not only on those  who voted for us, because we need the support of every Hungarian  citizen for solving the tasks of coming years. The next  government will not receive a 100-day period of grace, because  Hungary's situation demands immediate action.    We call for social peace. Crisis management needs consensus:  on a clear agreement between the government and society on the  goals to be attained, on the distribution of burdens, and on  compensation to be given to those whose interests are hurt. We  need a consensus between generations according to which the  current generations will not be sacrificed on the altar of the  future, and future generations will not become victims of the  present either. We cannot promise exemption from difficulties  for the young people, but we can promise a predictable future.    No government can work wonders. However, the Socialists  would start this country on the road leading out of this crisis  and we would get over the hard part by the end of the government  period, by 1998. We promise an honest, professional, calm, and  rational government that takes every citizen into consideration  as an individual, and we promise protection to the fallen,  reduction of uncertainty and helplessness, and the suppression  of corruption.    The democratic left based on social democratic values is  capable of achieving these goals. This political force  simultaneously represents the freedom that creates democracy,  equality of chances based on justice, and solidarity that  expresses brotherhood.    The stakes are very high: Whether we will succeed in laying  the foundations for Hungary's progress in the coming four years,  or we will helplessly drift to the level of the third world.  The MSZP does not promise salvation; it offers a solution.  The MSZP Congress.</p>

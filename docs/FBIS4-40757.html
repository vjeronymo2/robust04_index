			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- The package of decrees  concerning Russia's economic development signed by President  Boris Yeltsin in May and June is closely linked to the  unprecedented situation in the country's economy at present,  according to Aleksandr Livshits, the leader of the president's  group of experts.    Livshits told a press conference here today that the  distinguishing feature of the situation is that the inflation  rate has been relatively moderate over the past four months,  which brought down the inflation expectations of the population,  and no production slump was registered in the first half of June  from May. "It was necessary to make full use of this  circumstance," the economist stressed.    Aleksandr Livshits said the reaction to the economic decrees  in Moscow and the country as a whole was "restrained but  positive".    The decrees are not ideal, particularly those among them  which call for more discipline, Livshits admitted. But few  people have rejected them out right. As concerns statements  about the unconstitutional character of some provisions,  Livshits noted that some of the documents deal with problems  which are not covered by federal legislation at all. It is  possible that some provisions may be at variance with  legislation but "none of the decrees transcends the boundaries  of the president's message on the state of the nation which was  supported by the State Duma", or the boundaries of the  obligations assumed by the president and the government under  the Treaty on Civic Accord.    He also pointed out that the use of decrees "to boost  reforms  is a forced measure," but the president had "displayed patience  long enough". If the State Duma steps up activity in law  making, there will be no need for presidential decrees at all,  Livshits said. It would be ideal to have the presidential  decrees "dissolved" in subsequent federal laws.    Livshits drew particular attention to the decree concerning  the activity of foreign banks in Russia. He described it as  "the most dramatic of them all", and the story of its  preparation as "a plot for an interesting tale". The question  was not whether to let foreign banks into Russia but when and  what terms. There is no indicator of the most appropriate time,  it is a question of political intuition. "It was necessary to  sense the almost invisible edge to walk on", without infringing  on the rights of either foreign or Russian banks. According to  Livshits, the choice was made correctly. The decree allows five  or six foreign banks, which already have licenses, to begin  operations in Russia from July this year instead of January 1,  1996. As concerns new licencing, decisions on this will be made  by the Central Bank of Russia, depending on the conditions one  or another country provides for Russian banks. On the whole,  the agrement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and  the European Union, which will be signed soon, will "clear up  considerably" the problem of relations with foreign banks.    In the field of the taxation policy, Livshits said, a  tougher  tax paying discipline will be enforced ("this decree will meet  with most resistance," Livshits said). All tax benefits will be  annulled, and the enterprises will be prohibited from settling  accounts in cash, which enable them to evade taxation.</p>

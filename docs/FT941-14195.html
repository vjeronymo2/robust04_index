			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / People: Wimpey replaces finance director Roger Wood has resigned as finance director of Wimpey, the large UK housebuilder and construction group, less than three years after joining the company . Wimpey says Wood, finance director at Burmah Oil between 1986 and 1990, is leaving to pursue other business interests. However, relations between Wimpey and Wood have been strained and a parting had been expected by the City. The company is understood to have felt that the former oil industry executive had not made an easy transition to housebuilding and construction. Under the terms of his contract Wood is expected to receive a severance payment of more than Pounds 200,000. He is the latest in a series of board changes as chief executive Joe Dwyer has moved to strengthen the company's management, although it was Dwyer who appointed him in April 1991. Other directors to have left the group since 1991 include Bob Sellier, managing director, Peter Whitehouse, who headed the group's US operations and Nelson Oliver who ran the housing division. Wood is to be replaced by Richard Saville (above), who has been the company's corporate development director since 1991. Saville was previously director responsible for oil industry research with Morgan Grenfell Securities. He joined Wimpey in 1988 as corporate finance executive working closely with the former finance director Michael Dowdy, since retired. He was closely involved in the group's disposal programme which has raised more than Pounds 300m and substantially improved the group's finances. Saville, 45, will be expected to play a prominent role in Wimpey's plans to expand the group as the housebuilding and construction markets recover.</p>

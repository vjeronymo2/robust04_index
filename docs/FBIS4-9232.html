			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- (Unofficial,  abridged ROMPRES translation of Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin)    Referring to the fact that the Black Sea is a region in a  part of the world where conflicts exist, especially in the  Balkans and in the Caucasus, Hikmet Cetin, minister of foreign  affairs of Turkey, stressed in his address to the Crans Montana  Forum proceedings that the interdependence and regional  collaboration have become more necessary now than ever. He  highlighted his country played an important role in the  promotion of a system of cooperation in the Black Sea region, a  system relying upon economic relations, joint investments, and a  free trade.    Cetin said the purpose of the setting up of the organization  of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone was rather economic,  but that did not mean that political difficulties cannot be  overcome through economic cooperation and development.    The organization will develop economic and technological  cooperation in every domain, but especially in  telecommunications, transportations, and tourism.    The organization was not set up as an alternative to the  existence of the European Union, but it was rather a step toward  achieving the European architecture.</p>

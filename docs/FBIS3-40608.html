Arguments are rampant over appointing heads of states just like  in the Mogul era. The unfortunate historical event of a mother  and daughter fighting for power is also happening within the  People's Party. The scene of a mother being insulted by the  daughter for power is emerging before us. This disgusting scene  has made the ugliness of many struggles for power in history to  be less grisly. Let us save the details of this fight and the  identification of its script writer and directors for some other  time. All this is happening at this very sensitive and dangerous  time when Pakistan is entangled in two extremely important  problems. Efforts to make a decision about Kashmir have been  accelerated all over the world. Millions of Pakistanis and  Kashmiris have been waiting for the resolution of the Kashmir  issue for the last 40 years. Kashmir is the place where the  humble servants of the Prophet are sacrificing their lives  daily. They are occupied fully in working for their goal of  gaining independence from India and joining Pakistan. Not a day  passes without depressing and heartrending news from some corner  of the world about the future of this Kashmir.    Many important people have visited Pakistan and India during  the last few months to talk about it. First, U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Robin Rafael came to Pakistan, followed by a  visit of a deputation led by Roger Godsave, chairman of the  British Parliament's committee on Kashmir. They visited the  United States for one month before coming to Pakistan. On  Monday, Pakistan's worst enemy Senator Pressler arrived in  Islamabad with some other senators. Pressler thought it  important to visit India before coming here. His activities will  be clear to us in a couple of days; however, diplomatic circles  in the capital have firmly declared that whatever Benazir  Bhutto, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and smooth-talking Mirza Aslam Baig  could have done during the 90 days has been done. Now whatever  is happening is just an occurrence behind the facade of which  Benazir will do with Kashmir what she has done with the nuclear  program. We can inquire later whether she had the support of all  these powers that had blessed her when she had frozen the  nuclear program. During the visit by Richard Godsave, who is  considered the leading expert on Kashmir in Great Britain, the  elements associated with those who militarily help the freedom  fighters were very happy. The opinion he expressed about Kashmir  while in Pakistan deserves our attention. He announced loudly  that "this problems cannot be resolved with UN resolutions.  Those who believe that the Kashmir issue can be resolved with UN  resolutions should get out of the dream world. The world has  changed a lot. We must accept facts and look for new ways. The  United Nations cannot resolve this issue. Anyone who says that  the Kashmir issue can be resolved by putting economic  restrictions on India is living in fool's paradise. India's  relations with Europe and the United States are very close. It  is important to think with a cool head at this point." Roger  Godsave threatened: "If Pakistan remained adamant on its  emotional stand on this issue, it will get nothing." Commenting  on his visit with the president and the prime minister, Roger  said: "I feel that Pakistan needs to be flexible in its stand."  Roger also said that the people of Kashmir are the ones who are  actually affected by this problem, and, until they are involved,  this issue cannot be resolved.    The proposal for a three-party discussion was presented by  Sayyed Ali Gelani, an Azad Kashmir leader, at the beginning of  this year. However, this proposal was first presented in the  United States of America. It was organized by Dr. Ghulam Nabi  Fai, the executive director of Kashmiri American Council. It is  said that this proposal was just like the proposal Nawaz Sharif  had presented for the nuclear program. The organizers also  proposal were also sitting far away.    Roger Godsave had presented a formula for resolving the  Kashmir issue during his trip to the United States. This formula  in itself is a masterpiece. Godsave claims that the Kashmir  issue can be resolved if this formula is followed. According to  this formula:    1. The secretary general of the United Nations has to  appoint  a special emissary for Kashmir. This emissary will visit both  sides of Kashmir in addition to visiting India and Pakistan to  get a first-hand account of the situation. He is to present his  report to the secretary general. This emissary will also be  responsible for cooling the emotional attitude of both countries  leaders on Kashmir to enable them to take further steps to  resolve the Kashmir issue. This emissary also have to make both  countries to agree to call back their armed forces out of  Kashmir.    2. In the second phase, steps are necessary for India and  Pakistan to recall their armed forces from the area of Kashmir  under their control.    3. The UN peace force should be sent to Kashmir as soon as  both countries recall their troops.    4. The peace force will stay in Kashmir for five or ten  years  and this whole region will remain under UN control. During this  period, conditions will be made conducive to making a decision  on Kashmir's future. An interim government under the UN  supervision will be established there until the situation  improves.    5. A referendum on both parts of Kashmir will be conducted  during the fifth phase so that the people of Kashmir can decide  on their future.    6. The most important aspect of this formula is that the  representatives of the Kashmiri people will participate in every  important discussions during this interim period.    This proposal is clear about its positive and negative  aspects. The proposal also makes it clear what it means to keep  the whole Kashmir under the United Nations for five to ten  years. We also know what changes will happen when the United  States, hiding behind the facade of the United Nations,  establishes its feet in this region, and in what tone the United  States will talk to Pakistan, India, and China to get them to  agree to certain conditions. The United States will do whatever  it wants during these five or ten years, and it is not difficult  to guess what the result will be when the time for a referendum  comes. The referendum, if it is held, will not be according to  the UN resolutions. As is clear from Roger Godsave's statement,  this referendum will be held in the light of the new  developments and to look for a "new resolution" of the problem.  It is not a hidden fact that many Pakistani politicians are also  thinking in the same vein.    Those who know are saying with confidence that Benazir's  dealings with the United States over resolving the Kashmir issue  is the cat that will be out of the bag in the middle of 1994.  This is not a new thing; this pressure was increasing since the  beginning of Mohammed Nawaz Sharif's government. The path that  Mohammed Nawaz Sharif took to get out of this pressure was to  look for new friends around the world. He had found new friends  in the form of Japan and Korea. However, the results of his  efforts are in front of the nation. There is no one here to  stand up to the U.S. pressure. The whole U.S. effort is to get  India out of this appalling situation which it is in now in  occupied Kashmir. One way to achieve it is to send a message of  disappointment to those struggling in Kashmir by holding talks  between India and Pakistan. It is a different story as to the  kind of impression the Pakistan media will present of these  talks. The main purpose of this exercise is how India uses these  negotiations while they are in progress and later. If an  agreement is reached to declare Siachen a nonmilitary zone  during the first phase, it would be progress toward a solution  that the Americans have been presenting to us for the last few  years. Division of Kashmir is part of this agenda. What they are  saying is:    1. A situation must be created for paving the way toward  implementing Roger Godsave's formula.    2. Kashmir be divided over religion.    3. Line of Control be recognized as a permanent border.    4. By ignoring the UN resolutions, a situation would be  created whereby Kashmir is neither under Pakistan nor under  India.    It is not possible to implement solution number two as this  might result in creating several "East Pakistans" within  Kashmir. The Muslim population has spread into two or three  parts of Jammu and Laddakh in addition to the Kashmir valley.  Any division in this situation will result in additional riots  and the situation will become worse. Similarly, there is no  logic in accepting the Line of Control as the permanent border  nor will it satisfy any side. Suggestions number one and four  appear to be the same suggestion presented in two different  ways, and efforts have been accelerated to implement them. It  appears that some influential supporters for this proposal have  been created in occupied Kashmir. At the same time, those who  raise the slogan for Pakistan in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir have  been so discouraged that the Azad Kashmir leaders are telling  the volunteers that they are willing to accept a solution that  the leadership of occupied Kashmir will approve. This news was  published in the national papers; however, it was not given as  much attention as should have been. No one tried to find out the  purpose of it all. What kind of solution is the leadership in  occupied Kashmir proposing? This is not limited to talks with  India at the government level. Benazir Bhutto has been able to  participate in those talks because of Nawaz Sharif's pressure.  However, efforts are being made to make the U.S. solution  acceptable.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is trying to convince herself  that she has learned a lot in the past and will not repeat those  mistakes that hurt her in the past. At the same time she is  making all the arrangements to encourage the same kind of  uncivil and criminal activities that had brought the people out  in the streets in 1977.    How does the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] want to treat the  institutions established according to the constitution and laws?  One can guess from the incident which occurred last Monday at  the Election Commission office. Three PPP assembly members are  responsible for it. Chowdehry Ishfaq, Pir Mohammed Aslam Bodha,  and Shahid Nazir wanted the Election Commission to issue  notification about their winning the election immediately so  that they could take the oath without waiting. When they arrived  at the Election Commission office, neither the chief election  commissioner nor the secretary of the Election Commission  Humayun Khan was there. They ordered the personal assistants to  the election commissioner and the secretary to issue these  notifications at once. When these lowly workers explained that  it was not within their authority, they went to see Joint  Secretary Sardar Durani. They cursed him and threw a paper  weight at him. The PPP lawmakers were told that these  notifications cannot be issued until the official results are  given by the returning officer and details of property ownership  of newly elected candidates are received. Still, they demanded  that all laws and regulations be suspended and notifications  issued. For one hour S-Block, where the law ministry along with  the Election Commission offices are located, was ruled by  lawlessness. The police on duty joined the onlookers there.  These people finally left after threatening the staff. The  reason was that the National Assembly session was adjourning on  Monday, and these people were going to miss their daily  allowance for several days if they did not take the oath that  day.    At 8:00 p.m. when Chief Election Commissioner Justice  Naiumuddin and Secretary Humayun Khan reached the office, the  staff informed them of the whole story. One government official  told us that the personal assistant of Justice Naimuddin told  him the whole story while weeping bitterly. The old retired  justice could not do any thing except to give a day off to his  staff so they could recover from this abuse. The PPP officials  are the kind who do not respect even active judges. Earlier,  Benazir Bhutto's law minister (he is gone now) Sher Afghan had  put pressure on the Election Commission and had them change the  date for the internal election.    The grisly part of this whole affair is that the newspapers  did not take any notice of it, and only Daily PAKISTAN published  this news item. It is said that the chief election commissioner  called a long meeting with two other judges and high officials  of the commission. It was also discussed if these PPP assembly  members should be charged with the contempt of court as demanded  by the staff. However, after the meeting, Justice Naimuddin  advised his staff to be patient and not to stretch this affair  too far. Allah will look after us. When the staff continued to  insist, Justice Naimuddin told them that since he was the oldest  of them all they should respect his age, and forget this  incident. However, he did receive the written complaints of his  staff. He told this reporter that he had decided not to take any  action over this fiasco and that the case was closed. The  leaders and the members of the PPP have abused every agency and  the weak heads of these agencies are covering up to be commended  for their loyalties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pusan, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Pusan Coalition for  Democracy and National Unification on Monday called for the  retraction of an alleged plan of the United States to build up  arms in South Korea. The coalition with some progressive-minded  people in the Pusan area as its members, said in a statement the  United States should retract an "arms buildup plan" forthwith.  It said that in the buildup plan, the United States seeks to  deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters in Korea.    "The arms buildup plan stands in the way to a peaceful  resolution of the North Korean nuclear question," said the  statement. "It is a conspiracy to heighten tension and thereby  facilitate the sale of weapons whose overseas markets have been  obliterated by the advent of the de-Cold War age."    The coalition also asked the United States to be more  sincere  toward nuclear talks with North Korea and called on the South  Korean Government to turn down the U.S. plan to deploy modern  weapons in Korea and to resume the suspended inter-Korean  dialogue.</p>

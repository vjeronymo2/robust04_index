			<p>BFN     [Text] Sinn Fein face indefinite political isolation if  they fail to grasp the historic opportunity for peace in  Ireland, Irish deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring said today.    The clarification Sinn Fein had been seeking of the Downing  Street declaration on peace in Ulster had been given and they  must now make their decision, said Mr Spring.    "The time for debate, clarification and for equivocation has  ended. Now it's time to sit down and make progress to end the  conflict in this country."    Mr Spring said the Irish Government had been working for a  number of weeks to put forward a framework document about future  peace talks. "We want everybody as part of the democratic  process. Both the Irish and British Governments have worked  very hard at bringing the paramilitaries on both sides away from  the violence. They have to make their decisions. The  governments want to move on and we hope that the other parties  will move with us. I would say to the Unionist and Nationalist  leaderships that there is an opportunity to establish peace on  this island now. That opportunity must be embraced by all  sides."    He added: "If Sinn Fein or others associated with violence  do  not grasp the opportunity that is there now, they are going to  be isolated and they are going to face a long time in isolation  if they are not part of the democratic process."    Asked if he could see Unionists sitting around the same  table  as Sinn Fein, Mr Spring said: "If the people in this country  have an interest in solving the problem, then they should all be  sitting at the table. Obviously, there are certain requirements  and a cessation of violence is one and that has to precede  anything that happens."    Mr Spring was speaking to reporters in Londonderry as he  made  his way to County Donegal for the Euroelection campaign.</p>

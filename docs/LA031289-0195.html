			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET TRIPS IN BRITAIN  </P> <P> Travelers on tight funds can arrange visits to Great Britain at rock-bottom  rates through the Canadian Hostelling Assn.  </P> <P> Budget packages for independent travelers include six nights in Britain (three  in London) for less than $80 U.S. and seven nights in Scotland (transportation  included) for less than $112.  </P> <P> Since the Canadian dollar is worth less than the U.S. dollar, depending on the  rate of exchange, you should save about 20% when you convert the package prices  to American dollars.  </P> <P> One budget package includes confirmed dormitory accommodations for three nights  in London's Hampstead Heath youth hostel, vouchers for three nights at any of  the 300 British youth hostels outside London and a "Countdown" discount card  that's valid in Britain and Europe. Arrangements must be made 10 days in  advance. It costs $99 Canadian (about $79 U.S.).  </P> <P> London has seven internationally affiliated youth hostels. Guests don't need  reservations, but the hostels do tend to fill up by breakfast time each day.  Several impose midnight curfews and most lock their doors during the day.  </P> <P> A second package offers one night of confirmed accommodations in a London  hostel, vouchers for six nights at other British hostels and a 30-day  BritExpress Card. This card is valid for a 33% discount on National Express and  Scottish Citylink bus services. The package price is $89 Canadian.  </P> <P> You can explore Scotland using another package that includes a seven-day  Scotland Citylink Bus Pass, valid for unlimited travel throughout Scotland and  the Isle of Skye, plus vouchers for six nights of hostel accommodations, a map,  bus timetable, hostel handbook and a pass for visiting heritage sites. You must  travel between April 1 and Sept. 30. The cost is $137 Canadian.  </P> <P> </P> <P> And Eastern Europe  </P> <P> Packages for independent travelers are also available for those who want to  visit Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Solo travelers can get seven nights of accommodations, with breakfast, in East  Germany, sharing four-bed rooms (separate for men and women) in any combination  of East Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt and Leipzig. There is a maximum stay of three  nights at any one location.  </P> <P> Couples can usually be provided with a twin-bed room. This must be booked 35  days in advance. The price is $198 Canadian.  </P> <P> Student and youth travel agencies in Vienna offer budget-priced packages for  individuals who want to visit Budapest. You can also make arrangements before  you leave North America. The Canadian Hostelling Assn. offers packages that  include five nights' accommodations in four-bed rooms in a student hotel, plus  vouchers for five lunches or dinners, for $72 Canadian.  </P> <P> Couples can have three nights' accommodations in a two-star hotel in Budapest,  with breakfast, for $39 Canadian per person.  </P> <P> The association also offers packages for budget-priced stopovers in Iceland.  You get three nights of accommodations in a youth hostel in the capital of  Reykjavik, a return ferry trip to Vestmannaeyjar Island with a night's hostel  lodging, and a bus tour to Gullfoss and Geysir with another night at a hostel.  This package is available between June 9 and Aug. 21 and costs $179 Canadian.  </P> <P> The trips are designed for travelers between 18 and 40 but there are no age  restrictions, just that you be "young at heart." You must, however, be a member  of a national youth hostel association.  </P> <P> You can get more details on the Canadian association's tours by contacting  Aventours, 1600 James Naismith Drive, Gloucester, Ottawa, Ont., Canada K1B 5N4,  (613) 748-5725.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, STI Travel, a California-based youth tour operator, has announced  that it will include China in its 1989 tour program. The new 22-day tour for  18- to 30-year-olds visits the Great Wall, Beijing, Xian, Guilin, Suzhou,  Shanghai and Qufu, the birthplace of Confucius. A cruise on the Li Jian River  is also included.  </P> <P> Rates range from $2,895 to $2,975.

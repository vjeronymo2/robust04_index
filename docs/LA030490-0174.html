			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MARYLAND REBOUNDING UNDER WILLIAMS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DESPITE THE THREAT OF NCAA SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PROGRAM  AND DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE, THE TERRAPINS' COACH HAS LED A  RESURGENCE AT HIS ALMA MATER.  </P> <P> Gary Williams emerges from the locker-room tunnel at Cole Field House,  shoulders stooped, chin jutting, eyes straight ahead, a human Leaning Tower of  Pisa. If you did not know him better, you would think he was about to fall on  his face.  </P> <P> It is the purposeful stride of a man in a hurry, which Williams has been since  taking over the job of head basketball coach at his alma mater, the University  of Maryland, in June. In a hurry to win games, in a hurry to earn back respect  in the Atlantic Coast Conference and, most of all, in a hurry to bring life  back to the program.  </P> <P> During the 1989-90 season, Williams has been successful on all counts. The  Terrapins, 9-20 a year ago under Bob Wade, are 18-12. Included among six  conference victories are sweeps of North Carolina and Virginia. In the latter  stages of the season, sellouts for ACC home games were the rule rather than the  exception.  </P> <P> "I think we've accomplished a lot," Williams said. "Attitude-wise, we're  stronger people than we were before. Maybe that's the biggest accomplishment.  But I want to keep it going after the season is over."  </P> <P> It has not been easy. In fact, Williams said recently that this has been "the  longest year I've ever had as a head coach." This campaign marks his 10th  winning season in the past 12 years spent at American University, Boston  College, Ohio State and at Maryland.  </P> <P> What made it even more difficult was an admitted violation by Williams of a  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule that prohibits coaches from watching  their teams work out before the Oct. 15 starting date. Last month, Williams  said that he twice watched the Terps scrimmage informally.  </P> <P> It was an embarrassing blot on what has been one of Williams' best coaching  jobs. In essence, he took a group of players with raw talent, no depth and  little collective quickness -- perhaps the one thread that has run through each  of his programs -- and turned it into the most improved team in the ACC.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing is to believe that you can be successful competing at this  level," said Williams, who inherited a nucleus of four players from a team that  finished 1-13 in the ACC last season. "Once you see the success, it's easier  for you to do the things it takes to be successful.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem was having the players accept something before they saw  results. If I could have promised them that we would beat North Carolina twice,  that we would win on the road at Virginia, it might have been easier (for them  to work hard). Even when we were losing those close games to Georgia Tech, Duke  and Clemson, the players saw how far we had come as a team."  </P> <P> It is not difficult to pinpoint when the players began to understand what  Williams was talking about, and screaming about, in practice. It did not sink  in after they lost to South Carolina at the buzzer Dec. 1 in Richmond, Va., or  after they were blown out by Connecticut three nights later in the ACC-Big East  Challenge.  </P> <P> It happened when the Terps lost at home to Coppin State, 70-63, on Dec. 12.  </P> <P> "If we don't lose that game," Maryland assistant Roger McCready said, "we're  not the team we are today."  </P> <P> During the 10 days between that loss and Maryland's next game, the players  spent the beginning of their Christmas vacation in long, difficult practices.  When they arrived in Hawaii for the Chaminade tournament, the Terps were a  different team. Williams changed his lineup, moving Walt Williams from shooting  guard to point guard, Teyon McCoy from point guard to shooting guard and Jesse  Martin off the bench to small forward. It led to center Tony Massenburg, the  only senior who plays regularly, taking an active leadership role.  </P> <P> "We'd talk from time to time, and I understood his philosophy and what he  expected from his players," said Massenburg, who has gone from being a  talented, yet inconsistent player, to an all-conference candidate. "I've tried  to be sort of his offspring on the court."  </P> <P> If Massenburg is Williams' offspring, then Mike Anderson and Vince Broadnax  have become his playing reincarnates. Neither possesses a great deal of natural  ability, as was the case with Williams when he played at Maryland during  1965-67. But along with freshman Evers Burns, they have helped shape the team's  personality.  </P> <P> His players have learned during the past few months that it's not always how  the volatile Williams says things, or how loud, but it's what he is saying.  Massenburg said what amazes him is the way Williams can seem crazed one moment  and so focused the next. That it happens in the middle of close games, in front  of packed, hostile crowds, only builds confidence.  </P> <P> "We believe in him," said Massenburg, who probably has benefited the most from  this newly instilled work ethic. "He's been through these situations so many  times, and he's a proven winner."  </P> <P> Williams credits his players for helping him pull through the tough moments.  Aside from the admitted violation, which is considered a secondary infraction,  there have been the likely sanctions by the NCAA from Wade's three-season  tenure, which have hung over the program since mid-October.  </P> <P> On top of that, Williams has gone through a difficult year in his personal  life. In November, he was divorced after more than 20 years of marriage. He was  engaged recently to Victoria Chen, an attorney and television personality from  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "All of the other things would have been the same, but the fact that you go  through a divorce is a big thing in anyone's life," said Williams, who turns 44  today.  </P> <P> "I've been fortunate to have Victoria be here. It's been a tough year, but I  also feel good about the way things have gone lately. Coming in, I knew there  were some things that had to be smoothed out. But the positive thing is that we  can do it here. We can win the ACC. We can go to the Final Four. You like a job  where there are no barriers to your success."  </P> <P> There are obstacles. Although the Terps are in position to be considered for an  NCAA tournament bid this season, the program has yet to hear from the NCAA  infractions committee regarding the violations that occurred under Wade. The  severity of the penalty will help determine how quickly Williams is able to  rebuild. But this season was a positive step.  </P> <P> And although there have been bumpy moments, the ride has been smoother than any  in the past five seasons at Maryland. Like many of Williams' other teams, these  Terps, for the most part, have been overachievers. The one notable exception  earlier in the season, sophomore forward Jerrod Mustaf, recently has played his  best stretch since coming to Maryland.  </P> <P> Mustaf scored 20 points Saturday as the Terps defeated Virginia, 89-74, in the  schools' regular-season finale.  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fraser float price set at lowly 180p House of Fraser, the 56-store department chain being floated by its owners, the Fayed brothers, yesterday set its flotation price at 180p. That valued the group at a lower-than-expected Pounds 413.3m. The price was at the bottom end of forecasts, which ranged between 180p and 220p, and puts the shares on an historic p/e of 16.2 times. A dividend of 5p that would have been recommended last year would give a gross yield of 3.5 per cent. Since publication of the House of Fraser pathfinder prospectus most analysts had predicted a price of between 190p and 200p. However, recent volatility in the stock market is thought to have persuaded SG Warburg, which is handling the flotation, to plump for a lower price. COMMENT By fixing the price at 180p, House of Fraser has effectively neutralised the market's reservations, and the shares look attractive. The recent tightening of planning restrictions on retail developments means opportunities for opening new stores will be limited. But there is considerable room for improving sales from the group's very cheap, mainly freehold, existing selling space as the new management refurbishes the stores, improves the range and introduces new systems. The historic multiple of 16.2 times is a 16 per cent discount to the stores sector. On forecasts of Pounds 43m for this year, the discount falls to about 11 per cent, but the management needs to provide more evidence of its expertise if the shares are to move to a market rating.</p>

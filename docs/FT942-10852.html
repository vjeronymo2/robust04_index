			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Thuringia in public funds scandal The eastern German state of Thuringia has been accused of persistent misappropriation of public funds and abuse of office by Der Spiegel and Wochenpost, two German weeklies. If confirmed, the allegations, which appear to be substantiated by the state Audit Office, could damage Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election chances in eastern Germany just as his governing Christian Democratic Union is trying to claw back support. Thuringia is governed by a CDU/Free Democrats coalition, led by Mr Bernhard Vogel, a west German and a close ally of the Chancellor. The allegations coincide with the start of the election campaign in Thuringia, which faces a local government poll on June 12, and state elections and federal elections next October. Opinion polls give the CDU-led coalition less than 23 per cent of the vote in the five eastern states. The allegations touch several ministers. In one case, the government sold a state-owned clinic to a west German company for DM7.6m (Pounds 3m) although Wochenpost alleges the real market value exceeded DM42m. The scandals are expected to be greeted with cynicism in Thuringia which has endured an unemployment rate above 18 per cent. They also reflect the unstable nature of the state's government. Since late 1990, 25 senior officials have either resigned or changed office. These include one prime minister, five ministers, eight state secretaries, three police chiefs, and eight regional councillors.</p>

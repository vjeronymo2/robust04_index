			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Top staff sacked at Canary Wharf CANARY Wharf's chief executive and 33 of its senior staff were made redundant yesterday, four months after the east London office project went into administration. The redundancies, which are seen as a cost-cutting exercise, have come during a critical period for the Docklands scheme. They follow last week's break-down of bid talks with a consortium which was likely to retain the project's senior management. They also follow an offer this week by the project's bankers to contribute Pounds 395m over 25 years to the costs of the Jubilee Line underground extension. The administrators expect the government to take several weeks to reach a decision on the extension, which will be crucial to the future of the project. The redundant chief executive, Mr Michael Dennis, who masterminded the construction of the 4.5m sq ft office complex, yesterday underlined his backing for Canary Wharf: 'Even after it went into administration a number of us stayed on because of our attachment to the project. 'We remain hopeful that the government will accept the administrators' offer (of a contribution towards the Jubilee Line extension), build the Jubilee Line and help make a success of Canary Wharf,' he said. Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young who is a joint administrator, said: 'The redundancies are regrettable but we have retained the essential strengths of the O&amp;Y team to enable us to progress successfully with our strategy.' The redundancies are expected to cut Pounds 2.5m from O&amp;Y's annual payroll of Pounds 6m. Administration costs are thought to be running at Pounds 1m a month, half of which are the administrators' fees. Three directors, Mr Robert John, a former director of County NatWest, Mr Peter Dale and Mr Charles Young, were also made redundant. The other redundancies included heads of departments and senior legal staff. A total of 281 staff remain at Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf including directors Mr Robert Spiers and Mr Gerald Rothman. The administrators said that the 200-strong estate management team would remain intact. The administrators said that talks with potential bidders would resume on a positive decision on the Jubilee Line by the government.</p>

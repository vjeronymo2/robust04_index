Kucan met Federal President Klestil, Federal Chancellor  Franz  Vranitzky, Foreign Minister Alois Mock, and Nationalrat  President Heinz Fischer for talks.    In connection with the Krsko nuclear power plant, Kucan, who  expects Vienna to support Slovenia's European Union [EU]  ambitions, said that Slovenia was as worried about the safety of  its citizens as Austria.    Kucan emphasized his country's interest in Austrian EU  accession and voiced his hopes that Vienna's experience in the  entry talks with Brussels would also benefit Ljubljana in its  objective to join the EU.    Vranitzky underlined that he agreed with Kucan that the  process of European integration would have a positive influence  on bilateral relations.    On the issue of Krsko, Kucan and Vranitzky said that on  Thursday they did not discuss a date for the resolution on  shutting down the nuclear power plant near the border area.    According to Kucan, the plant can be completely shut down  only 10 years after Ljubljana makes a decision to this effect.  He pointed out that first one must clarify the question of an  energy supply for Slovenia, citing as an example more  hydroelectric power stations on the Save River. Moreover, the  decision in Krsko does not lie with Slovenia alone but also with  Croatia, which also has an interest in the nuclear power plant.    Klestil announced that he hinted to Kucan that Austria would  be interested in further developing an early warning system and  that, at the next meeting of Central European presidents, he  would advocate a nuclear-free zone in the region.</p>

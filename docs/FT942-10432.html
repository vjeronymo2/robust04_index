			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Major rejects Tory demands for referendum on Europe Mr John Major yesterday rejected calls from Conservative Euro-sceptics to commit his government now to a referendum on the next stage of European integration. But he sought to defuse Tory party tensions ahead of next month's European elections by insisting he would adopt a tough stance against further integration at the 1996 intergovernmental conference. With his leadership again under fire, Mr Major also underlined his determination not to be driven from office. He told MPs: 'We received a five-year mandate to carry out our policies. I intend to exercise that five-year mandate.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will seek to repair damage caused by the row when he outlines the key planks of the Conservatives' European manifesto to the Scottish Tory conference later today. Mr Hurd will stress that the underlying forces shaping Europe point to a flexible, multi-speed union, in which Britain can feel entirely comfortable  -rather than to the centralised and uniform entity feared by Tory Euro-sceptics. After two days of confusion and division in Tory ranks, Mr Major responded to opposition attacks by refusing to promise a referendum on the outcome of the 1996 conference. He left open the possibility that a future government might take a different view if there was a move to a single European currency. But Downing Street stressed that the referendum issue was off the agenda for the foreseeable future. Despite an upsurge in support for the referendum idea as a potential device to unite the Conservatives before the June 9 European poll, Mr Major indicated there is no question of such a proposal appearing in the party's manifesto. He had not changed his mind since voicing vigorous opposition to a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. He agreed with Sir Terence Higgins, a senior backbench MP, that such votes were 'an alien concept inconsistent with our system of representative parliamentary democracy'. Pledging not to agree to any new arrangements in 1996 which were unacceptable to the British parliament, Mr Major added: 'I don't believe the question of a referendum arises now and it certainly doesn't need to be decided now.' He dismissed calls from Tory Euro-sceptics for a commitment to call a referendum on a future single European currency but in a nod in their direction refused to rule out a change of heart by a future parliament. Pro-European Tories, who have campaigned against any referendum commitment, expressed themselves satisfied with Mr Major's stance while the sceptics claimed he had not closed the door entirely on their referendum demands. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, taunted Mr Major for presiding over a 'hopelessly divided' cabinet. Rightwingers divided, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 25</p>

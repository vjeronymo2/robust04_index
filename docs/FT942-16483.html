			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Food and Drink: Pauillac rivals join hands at an English chateau - Lafite and Mouton-Rothschild have combined to show their full range The two adjoining, sometime rival, first-growth Pauillacs - Lafite and Mouton-Rothschild - have combined to bring examples of all their companies' wines to the UK. Not through the usual trade channels, but in a shop in the refurbished Waddesdon Manor near Aylesbury (described in the Weekend FT of March 26). This is the only place in the world where all can be bought: from Lafite's Chilean Los Vascos '92 (Pounds 6.20) to its grand vin '82 (Pounds 135), and Mouton's Mouton-Cadet '90 (Pounds 6.50) to the California Opus One '88 (Pounds 42.70). Waddesdon, the late 19th century 'French Chateau in England' built for Baron Ferdinand de Rothscild, was left by his great-nephew James in 1957 to the National Trust. But the main responsibility for its running has remained with the Rothschild family. Lord (Jacob) Rothschild has now filled the original cellars with his personal reserve: 11,000 bottles from Lafite, supplemented with 3,000 from Mouton. This starts with a magnum of Lafite 1870, followed by 35 vintages, fine, indifferent and poor, up to 1970. The Moutons begin with a present from Baroness Philipine of half a dozen bottles from 1867 (the vintage before Lafite passed into Rothschild hands) to 1896. For the visitor this is museum stuff, an appendage to the tour of the house, and the wines are binned behind three locked gates though the rest of the handsome cellars, decorated with photographs of the chateau and the Mouton labels, are open to inspection. However, in a newly-created shop on the garden level, wines from more than 30 appellations or brands are for sale. In the last 30 years both estates have greatly widened their interests. In Bordeaux, Lafite has added Duchart-Milon, Rieussel and L'Evangile, and then spread to Los Vascos in Chile and the distinguished Quinta do Carmo in Portugal. Mouton acquired adjoining Clerc-Milon and then joined Mondavi in California for Opus One, but most of its expansion has been to increase its Bordeaux brands, including Medoc, St Emilion and Graves Baron Philippe. All dozen are on sale at Waddesdon, where Lafite also has a Waddesdon Manor Pauillac '90 (Pounds 10.15) Clearly no attempt has been considered to by-pass their traditional trade channels, so Waddesdon is not a place to go for bargains. The sommelier, Henry Beaumont, describes prices as 'fair', and nowhere else in the UK could such a selection be found, including all the grands vins of Lafite and Mouton from 1981 (around Pounds 75) to 1990 (Pounds 80 to Pounds 85) respectively for these vintages: dearer than at auction per dozen, but not there for single bottles. Testings by outside bodies will be encouraged, and the Wine Society of Stevenage, Herts, will hold the first for its members on May 12. Also the shop is organising them on two levels. On the second Saturday morning of each month (the next on May 14) a varied, tutored tasting will be set up at Pounds 20 a head, and then on Wednesdays June 1, July 29, September 7 and 28 and October 12 de luxe tutored tastings will be held, including lunch and a tour of the house, at Pounds 45 a head.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Survey of Malaysia (11): Islam and gigabytes - US disk-maker Komag's Penang operation In Penang, one feature immediately strikes the visitor - a state of the art electronics plant with a Moslem prayer room. It would be hard to find a better symbol in Malaysia of the successful marriage of Islam with modernity and the market, the idea that inspires the prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad. It would also be hard to find a better example of the kind of manufacturing plant which Malaysia desperately requires more of, as it attempts to shift from labour intensive to high value-added production. Komag, the US based advanced disk manufacturer, says its Penang plant is the lowest cost disk producer in the world. For Malaysia it certainly sets new standards of technological sophistication in clean room technology and automation. The plant, which is more like a hospital than a factory with busy people hurrying about in surgeon-like uniforms, currently produces about 20,000 1-gigabyte disk drives per day. The value-added contrast with its next door neighbour, a textile plant owned by Eastern Knitters, could not be more striking. Eastern employs 4,000 people to generate annual sales of MDollars 50m; Komag employs 600 people to produce annual sales of MDollars 270m. Even within the electronics sector Komag is rare. Most of Penang's electronic companies import products which have had 60 to 70 per cent of the value added already in Japan or US, with the Malaysians merely finishing and testing. Komag, on the other hand, takes a piece of aluminium with a hole in the middle costing about USDollars 1.40 and, after processing it, sells it for about USDollars 10. The managerial brains behind the plant is a typical product of Malaysia's cosmopolitan elite. Mr Thian Hoo Tan, 46, worked in the US for 18 years before returning to Malaysia to manage the plant. Before that he was at the University of Malaysia where he roomed with several people who are now in the cabinet or chief ministers of Malaysian states. 'I used to share a room with Anwar Ibrahim (now the deputy prime minister) when he was a hot headed left-wing nationalist. We used to go on demonstrations together,' recalls Mr Tan. While such connections can do no harm, the main reason Komag chose to locate in Penang is the presence of so many customers including Seagate, Western Digital, Hewlett Packard and Conner. 'When we were setting up the plant (which opened in early 1992) I made several good decision and one bad one,' recalls Mr Tan. The bad decision was to believe the Penang authorities when they said they could guarantee uninterrupted electricity supply. The capital and energy intensive Komag plant consumes about 5 per cent of the island's power and is badly hit by the regular power cuts. 'We usually have two or three small power cuts each month, which costs us about USDollars 100,000, then every now and then we have a big one which costs more like USDollars 500,000,' he says. The best decision of all was to scrap the normal job categorisation for such a plant which starts with a low wage operator and moves up through engineers and technicians to supervisors. Mr Tan created instead 'higher value-added jobs', a manual worker/technician grade and an engineer/supervisor grade. 'The manual technicians have to be able to understand some physics and chemistry as well as work with their hands. When recruiting we put people through four to five hours of stringent verbal and practical tests and only hired 9 out of every 100,' he says. 'This was a big gamble but it has paid off, and because the workers understand what they are doing they can use their creativity to improve the process,' he adds. They are paid well above normal rates. A manual technician receives about MDollars 900 basic per month but with fringe benefits and social security costs Komag about MDollars 1700 per month. Mr Tan says that real wage costs are rising at over 10 per cent per year, and effectively doubling every five years. Employees also benefit from a company-wide profit-sharing scheme which hands out 9 per cent of world-wide profits. The result is that the young technicians - average age is only about 25 - remain unusually loyal to the company. 'We have been fabulously successful. We erased our accumulated deficit as early as April 1993 and we were making money one and a half years ahead of schedule,' he says. Komag, believes Mr Tan, represents the manufacturing future for Penang and Malaysia. 'As wage costs surge more and more simple assembly operations are planning to move out. I know of at least four companies which have drawn up plans for re-location,' he says. But he warns that Malaysia does not, currently, have the human resources to replicate the Komag model on a wider scale. At national level he thinks that the practice of encouraging 'twinning' with colleges from Australia or America is not working because too many people are doing the 'wrong' subjects like management and accounting and not enough are doing technical and science subjects. 'Don't forget when we were recruiting we employed only 9 out of 100 applicants; this country has got to work on the other 91,' says Mr Tan. Through the Penang Skill Development Centre the company is helping to raise the general pool of vocational skills in the area. In a few months Komag will be drawing on that pool. The 220,000 sq feet of plant is being supplemented by another unit of 130,000 sq feet, and the number of lines will grow from three to seven. It is the answer to Dr Mahathir's prayers.</p>

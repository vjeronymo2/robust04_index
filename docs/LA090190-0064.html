			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SIDNEY WEISS PLAYS CONUS CONCERTO  </P> <P> The musical bill of fare Thursday at Hollywood Bowl, where Lawrence Foster  conducted the second of two programs this week, included two orchestral works  of household-name familiarity -- as one expects during the summer -- and one  obscure concerto.  </P> <P> The Russian romanticist Julius Conus is remembered -- if at all -- for a single  work: his Violin Concerto, first performed by the composer in 1898. The  archives of the Los Angeles Philharmonic indicate but one previous local  performance of the work; this took place 47 years ago. The artist/archeologist  who excavated and performed the work on Thursday evening was the Philharmonic's  own principal concertmaster, Sidney Weiss.  </P> <P> The single-movement composition is a soloist's concerto -- the orchestra is  truly subsidiary -- and it can sound much like a 21-minute technical exercise.  One listened in vain for a memorable tune -- much less inventive orchestration  or interesting counterpoint. If it is another half-century before the piece has  another hearing in Cahuenga Pass, that will probably be fine with most of the  8,015 who were in attendance.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the work served as a suitable vehicle for Weiss to demonstrate his  warm, radiant tone and technical prowess. His playing remained intense, urgent,  and insofar as the limited score allowed, expressive. Foster and the  Philharmonic provided consistent and effective support.  </P> <P> Following intermission, the conductor turned to Dvorak's popular "New World"  Symphony. Here the rapport between our orchestra and its erstwhile (1965-68)  assistant conductor and frequent podium guest was much in evidence, as the  musicians responded to the native Angeleno's ministrations with spirit and  precision.  </P> <P> Foster, as always, kept his gestures straightforward and economical, but shaped  phrases with individuality and character, projected freshness and spontaneity,  and elicited from the ensemble propulsive, energized playing. Technical  problems were few and insignificant, and the woodwinds seemed to be in  particularly fine form; Carolyn Hove's exquisite English horn solo in the Largo  is but one example.  </P> <P> In the opening work, Liszt's familiar "Les Preludes," the players gave Foster  the same degree of alertness, and brought to their playing both vitality and  sensitivity. The Philharmonic almost made the tiresome symphonic poem sound  like a first-rate composition. TERRY McQUILKIN  </P></p>

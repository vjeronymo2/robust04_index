			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Botnar is to return soon, says Nissan UK NISSAN UK chairman Mr Octav Botnar, for whom the Inland Revenue issued an arrest warrant earlier this week, intends to 'return to the UK shortly', according to the company. It said Mr Botnar had been away on holiday in Switzerland since before Christmas. Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain, said it denied 'absolutely' that the company or its directors had at any time defrauded the Inland Revenue. It said that its record as a payer of tax over many years was 'there for anyone to see'. Mr Botnar was named at Teesside magistrates court on Thursday in charges brought against Mr Tore Arne Thorsen, manager of Scansiris AS, a Norwegian freight transport company, alleging a corporation tax fraud in which Nissan UK pre-tax profits had been understated by Pounds 100m. Mr Michael Hunt, Nissan UK assistant managing director and a large shareholder in the company, and Mr Frank Shannon, a former Nissan UK finance director, appeared at Worthing magistrates' court on Thursday, also charged with alleged corporation tax fraud.</p>

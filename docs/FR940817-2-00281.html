			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 708 of the Defense Production Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158); Executive Order 12919, 59 FR 29525, June 7, 1994; Executive Order 12148, 3 CFR 1979 Comp., p. 412, as amended; 44 CFR Part 332; DOT Order 1900.8; 46 CFR Part 340.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 501 of Executive Order 12919 delegated the authority of the President under Section 708 to the Secretary, among others. By DOT Order 1900.8, the Secretary delegated to the Administrator the authority under which this Agreement is sponsored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Need for this Agreement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _1. The Administrator has found, in accordance with Section 708(c)(1), that conditions exist which may pose a direct threat to the national defense of the United States or its preparedness programs and, under the provisions of Section 708, has certified to the Attorney General that a standby voluntary agreement for utilization of intermodal shipping services/systems is necessary for the national defense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The quantity of military dry cargo (unit equipment, sustaining supplies and ammunition) to be moved for support of a military contingency, national emergency, or war in a foreign area could exceed the shipping capacity normally available for charter or use from the commercial sector. It is desirable to avoid the disruptive effects of ship requisition and of intermodal equipment allocation so long as military requirements can be met by voluntary cooperation between the maritime industry and the Federal government. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Chairman, has issued a finding that dry cargo capacity to meet national defense requirements cannot be provided by the industry through a voluntary agreement having less anti-competitive effects or without a voluntary agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> History of this Agreement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The concept of this Agreement originated in discussions between MARAD and DOD officials on arrangements to promote timely availability of ships, equipment and management services needed to operate them. Most U.S.-flag shipping companies operate ships as part of an integrated land/ocean transportation system. In times of emergency, DOD needs not only vessels and intermodal equipment, but also the management expertise to operate such assets as transportation systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between vessel owners or operators and the Secretary. This Agreement will constitute an Emergency Preparedness Program within the meaning of the amended Title VI of the Act proposed in H.R. 4003. This Agreement will constitute a sealift readiness program when approved by the SecDef and will meet all the conditions set forth under Section 909. An ocean carrier which is a Participant in this Agreement is eligible for award of a Shipping Agreement or a Container Agreement from MSC without enrollment in any other program. An ocean carrier eligible to participate in this Agreement but which elects not to do so is subject to enrollment in the MSC Sealift Readiness Program (SRP) if it (1) receives operating-differential subsidy or construction-differential subsidy or (2) wishes to carry DOD cargo. A carrier, while a Participant in this Agreement, will be subject only to the provisions of this Agreement and not to the provisions of the SRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Participation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _1. An ocean carrier may become a Participant by submitting an executed copy of the form referenced in XI. below. Any ocean carrier organized under the laws of a State of the United States, or the District of Columbia, may be a Participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A company which owns, or has obtained through lease, intermodal equipment may become a Participant by submitting an executed copy of the form referenced in XI. below. Such a company must be organized under the laws of a State of the United States or the District of Columbia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The term ``Participant'' includes the entity signing this Agreement and all United States subsidiaries and affiliates of that entity which own, operate, charter, or lease ships and intermodal equipment in the regular course of their business and in which the entity holds a controlling interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The term ``Participant'' also includes the controlled non-domestic subsidiaries and affiliates of the entity signing this Agreement;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that the Administrator grants specific approval for their inclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. An entity having an operating agreement with the Secretary shall be a ``Participant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. An entity electing to place itself in a readiness program, such as Section 909 or Section 1202(c) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1282(c)), shall, upon signing this Agreement, be a ``Participant.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Special regulations allowing boat people from Indochina  temporary immigration permits pending screening of their  applications for refugee status were abolished Saturday.    The abolition was in line with the results of an  international conference on Indochina refugees held in Geneva  last month, officials at the ministry's Immigration Bureau said.    Under the new system, people from Vietnam, Laos, and  Cambodia, who enter Japan without valid passports will be  deported to their home countries and will not have the option of  seeking refugee status, the officials said.    Residents of Ukujima Island in the Goto group of islands in  Nagasaki Prefecture spotted the 24 people aboard a small wooden  boat anchored some three kilometers southeast of the island at  around 7:20 A.M. and informed the authorities.    The boat people are being questioned by Maritime Safety  Agency officials. They are thought to be from Vietnam and  include seven women and four children, agency officials said.</p>

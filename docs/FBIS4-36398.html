			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bashir al-Barghuti: "To Prevent Differences </F> From Taking a Turn for the Worse"]    [Text] Difficulties and restrictions imposed by the Cairo  agreement itself have started to emerge from the moment it was  implemented. The Israeli side has thwarted the attempts to  contain or bypass them. Not a single day passes without Israeli  measures that aim to remind the Palestinian side of the  limitations of its role and of its responsibility toward what  Israel regards as its security interest.    It would be an extreme simplification to suppose that all  the  problems could be solved in closed rooms without this resulting  in measures in Gaza and Jericho that would affect the  Palestinian citizen and limit his freedom and his ability to  pursue his ambitions toward his national objectives.    I do not think that anyone in our country or our citizens  abroad considers the Cairo agreement to be a fulfillment of  their national objectives or their liberation from the yoke of  occupation. The occupation laws remain, and changing or  annulling them depends on the Israeli side's approval. The  streets of Gaza and Jericho are open for the armed settlers as  well as for the Israeli army. None of the clauses of the  "Gaza-Jericho First" agreement contain any reference to the  possibility of developing it outside the context of the concepts  of the Israeli Labor Party's program, specifically to the  concepts of the Jordan River as Israel's security border, of  withdrawal from the populated areas, and of keeping the  settlements, or the majority of them.    Therefore, it would be naive to suppose that the  antioccupation activities will stop because the Cairo agreement  has been signed or because the Palestinian police have started  to patrol the streets of Jericho and the Strip.    While acknowledging that no one wants internal fighting or  the fabrication of problems with the Palestinian police, we  should not forget the presence of the Israeli side and the  duties imposed by the Cairo agreement on the Palestinian side  toward the antioccupation activities. These might,  unintentionally, lead to friction and tension. We started to  feel some of its aspects in the past few days, such as the  firing on the Jewish synagogue in Jericho, the arrest of armed  agents in the area, and the Palestinian side's compulsion to  hand them over to the Israeli police after showing Israeli  identity cards. Similar incidents took place in Gaza, such as  the killing of two persons accused of being Israeli agents.    We hope that these incidents will remain very limited and  that they will be dealt with patiently and wisely. But the  nature of the exceptional situation in which the Cairo agreement  has placed us makes it a situation fraught with unhappy and  possibly grave expectations.    Hence, matters should not be left to chance. The literal  implementation of the Cairo agreement in an area where armed men  from the Israeli army and settlers move alongside the  Palestinian police and other Palestinian parties will increase  the dangers of friction. Throwing just one stone might create a  major problem. Such problems could also arise in cases where a  Palestinian citizen commits a security violation outside the  Palestinian police's jurisdiction, in which case the latter  would be required to arrest and hand him over to the Israeli  police.    Should such cases happen -- and we hope they will not --  they  will then be a source of tension, more doubts, and unease. The  important thing is that this should not develop into friction  between Palestinian citizens and that the differences should  remain political and expressed democratically and in a civilized  manner. This necessitates the presence of a Palestinian body  that includes supporters and opponents or members acceptable to  these two sides. It should comprise independent Palestinian  figures with political and social weight who are respected by  all. The body would constitute "a panel of jurors" that will  rule on differences between the national forces and prevent  these differences from developing into some sort of fighting  that will only benefit the enemies of our people.    It is a great mistake to suppose that administrative tools  alone are enough to resolve all possible serious problems. The  presence of a "panel of jurors" will not harm the Palestinian  authority, especially as it has already accepted a  Palestinian-Israeli civilian committee for cooperation and  coordination that monitors the activities of its departments and  the extent of their adherence to the agreement. Since this is  the case, why should there not be "a panel of jurors" from  outside the Palestinian authority that can monitor the extent of  this authority's adherence to the conditions of national unity  and the Palestine National Council's resolutions, for the sole  purpose of preventing differences from assuming grave dimensions  that will not be in anyone's interest?</p>

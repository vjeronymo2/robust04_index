			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Indonesia does not oppose the institutionalization  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] if the  institutionalization process is normal is not hasty. Wisber  Luis, director general for foreign economic relations in the  Department of Foreign Affairs, said this to reporters in  Honolulu today in conjunction with the two-day informal meeting  of APEC finance ministers that starts there today. According to  Wisber Luis, currently the institutionalization of APEC is not  proceeding normally because its activities are taking place  outside of normal senior official and ministerial meetings.  Indonesia -- which will host this year's informal APEC summit  -- will call for more dialogue and consultations on  macroeconomic matters during the finance ministers meeting in  Honolulu.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Albanian Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi expressed hope Tuesday [10 May] that Japan will  become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council [SC],  Foreign Ministry officials said.    Serreqi told Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa that it  is "natural" for Japan to become a permanent member considering  its importance in the international community, the officials  said.    In a 40-minute meeting followed by dinner, Kakizawa urged  Albania not to deal "emotionally" on problems involving  Albanians living in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia] and Kosovo in neighboring Serbia, the officials said.    Serreqi replied that Albania seeks to solve the problems  through talks and does not approve of changing borders by force.    Kakizawa pledged to extend a loan of up to 2.16 billion yen  for a project aimed at increasing agricultural production and  processed products and to realize macroeconomic stabilization,  officials said.    The 30-year-loan, with a 10-year grace period, has an annual  interest rate of 1 percent, they said.    Kakizawa also told Serreqi that Japan plans to dispatch  macroeconomic experts in June or July to advise on policies and  to send a mission to Albania this summer to study economic  cooperation.    Kakizawa told Serreqi that Japan will offer economic  assistance on condition that Albania maintain friendly relations  with its neighboring nations such as Macedonia, Serbia and  Greece they said.    Serreqi, 55, will conclude his five-day visit in Japan on  Saturday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Muhammad Salim </F> al-Mutawakkil, referred to as Brigadier General Yahya  al-Mutawakkil, by AL-AHRAM correspondent Ahmad Musa in Tunis;  date not given]    [Text] [Musa] Interrogation of the terrorists suspected of  attempting to assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi has  proved that they were trained in Yemen with other individuals  who were passing through on their way back from Afghanistan.  They also got their instructions from there. What do you think  of these confessions?    [Al-Mutawakkil] With regard to reports of Yemen's connection  with events inside Egypt, we have often pointed out that Yemen  will never become a stage for anti-Egyptian activity. We have  contacted the Egyptian Government to emphasize this. We are  willing to ban the entry of Egyptians or other nationals who  have been convicted of such crimes or have any links with them.  We are willing to increase coordination with Egypt on this. We  have said that we will welcome any Egyptian delegation sent to  Yemen to examine reports of the existence of training camps. We  will give the Egyptian security services the opportunity to  ascertain the facts for themselves.    [Musa] Some parties are planning meticulously for these  organizations. They enter no country under their real names,  something that worries all the concerned security services. In  Yemen, they use noms de guerre and are trained inside  apartments, not at outdoor camps.    [Al-Mutawakkil] Nothing like this has been uncovered. No  camps and no such individuals were found. We have coordinated  efforts with the Egyptian Interior Ministry and are willing to  receive Egyptian security officials. We will examine what  information they have and cooperate with them for the good of  our two countries. The relevant departments are kept informed  of our contracts with Egyptian teachers. We will deport any  individuals staying in Yemen as workers if they are accused of  anything.    [Musa] Suppose the Egyptian security services can prove that  some terrorists are still inside Yemen, will they be handed over  to Egypt for trial?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Extradition of individuals is governed by  pertinent agreements. There are no such agreements between our  two countries. But we will adopt the necessary measures to  prevent our country from becoming a center for such activities.    [Musa] Is there no intention of concluding new agreements to  govern this issue, which is vital to our countries' stability?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I discussed ways of exchanging visits and  data with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on the sidelines of  the Arab interior ministers conference in Tunis last week. The  aim is to control the movement of suspect individuals.    [Musa] When these individuals arrive from Afghanistan,  training is carried out inside apartments in Yemen. What is  your comment on these reports?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Yes, there were such reports. We asked the  Egyptian security authorities to specify where these apartments  are and give us information on them in addition to photographs  of the individuals suspected of such crimes. Our aim is to  coordinate the work of the security forces in our two countries  and to be of assistance.    [Musa] Yemen has recently been the scene of a series of  explosions and assassination attempts carried out by groups of  the al-Jihad Organization "The Returnees from Afghanistan." How  did the security service identify the culprits and unravel the  circumstances of various cases?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Our information indicated that the Yemenis,  who had travelled to Afghanistan, established an organization  known as "al-Jihad." This organization is financed by  businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin. Investigations involving the  defendants in Aden, Lahij, Hadhramaut, and Sanaa showed that  they are responsible for the terrorist operations against the  hotels and for the assassination attempts against personalities.  The investigations have also proven that the perpetrators do  belong to the al-Jihad Organization and receive instructions  from one side. We are currently taking the necessary measures  to refer them to court.    [Musa] How many will be charged?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Some 96 terrorists will stand trial. Some 36  are in prison and the other 60 are fugitives.    [Musa] Do you intend to amend your laws to confront  terrorist  crimes, which are alien to your society?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I have submitted a draft for a new law to  confront terrorism and carrying arms, because Yemeni law allows  people to carry arms. This is a serious phenomenon and it's one  of the factors behind the wave of violence and terrorism. The  Yemeni citizen can carry licensed arms. He can also own arms  without a license.    [Musa] How many weapons have been seized through your  ministry?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We can only seize unlicensed weapons when  they are found in large quantities. In the most recent case, we  seized 100 automatic rifles and machine guns. But personal  weapons are allowed by law.    [Musa] The Yemeni security service has thwarted several  attempts to smuggle weapons. What are the details of these  attempts?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We have indeed thwarted many attempts to  smuggle weapons through coastal borders. We have a good market  for arms trade. The arms are being sold publicly. We can only  curb this dreadful trade through new laws, which will be issued.  We aborted an attempt to unload an arms shipment from a foreign  ship heading from the north to the south.    [Musa] Your Excellency, we know you are pursuing defendant  Usamah Bin-Ladin for his involvement in the terrorist operations  in your country. What are the latest developments in his case?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We have asked Interpol to hunt down  Bin-Ladin  and other fugitives and bring them to Yemen on charges of  involvement in various explosions.    [Musa] Do you have any proof of foreign financing?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We are still looking for all the main  sources  financing terrorism, although all the signs are that Usamah Bin-  Ladin is the principal financier.    [In a note at the bottom of the report, AL-AHRAM states the  following: "Note: A ranking Yemeni source has revealed that the  investigation and information confirm that Usamah Bin-Ladin has  earmarked huge funds to finance the activities of terrorist  trends in some Arab countries, particularly Egypt, Tunis,  Algeria, and Yemen. These funds amount to well over .5 billion  pounds. He is also allocating between $30,000 and $50,000 for  any operation carried out in these countries."]</p>

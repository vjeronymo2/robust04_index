			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (29): Master of fine blanking branches out - Profile: IFB Industries THE Marxist-ruled West Bengal has the dubious distinction of having the largest number of antiquated engineering units of all the Indian states. But in West Bengal is also located IFB Industries, which exports around 80 per cent of its production of fine blanked components used in automobiles, mainly to hard currency areas. Fine blanking calls for the application of highly sophisticated technology. The surprising thing about IFB is that 12 years ago when Mr Bijon Nag, a first generation entrepreneur, chose Calcutta, the biggest city in West Bengal, for investment, a substantial flight of capital from the state to other parts of the country was taking place. Though he would not admit it, the fact that Mr Nag is a relation of Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal for the last 15 years, might well have clinched the issue for him. In any case, IFB is one of the rare cases in West Bengal which has not been visited by industrial unrest since it started operations. Political connections have certainly helped. Even so, as the company's business grew, IFB realised it would be too risky to put all its eggs in a Calcutta basket. In the last few years, it has set up bigger plants in Bangalore and Goa. IFB's forthcoming venture for the production of electric motors in collaboration with Siemens of Germany will also be in Bangalore. Only recently, the IFB-backed Pounds 4m joint venture, European Fine Blanking, has started production at Wrexham in North Wales. According to Mr Nag, the fine blanked components to be produced at the Wrexham plant will, besides reducing the UK's dependence on imports, be exported to Europe and the US. Having mastered the fine blanking technology, the company has decided to create more than one production base in the west. While the capacity of the Wrexham plant will be expanded in the next couple of years, a decision has already been taken to have similar units in Czechoslovakia and the US. The success of IFB is largely attributable to its technical and financial collaboration with Heinrich Schmid AG of Switzerland. The Swiss company has also partnered IFB in the Wrexham venture. Mr Nag admits that the association with Heinrich Schmid has helped IFB in roping in Electrolux Autoliv of Sweden and Rentrop Hubbert &amp; Wagner of West Germany as collaborators for the manufacture of automotive safety belts and car seat reclining systems, respectively. Like fine blanked components, these are largely for export. When the company diversified into the white goods business two years ago, industry watchers thought IFB had made its first wrong move. The Indian market for white goods is worth more than Rs20bn. But much bigger companies than IFB with strong marketing networks were already in the field. IFB did not have any experience in marketing consumer goods. It had to start from scratch. The technical tie-up with Bosch Siemens for the manufacture of washing machines has gone a long way in ensuring the success of IFB's diversification. The washing machine plant in Goa has a capacity to produce 125,000 units a year. According to Mr Nag, IFB will be going all out to develop an export market for washing machines. The company will be making some more white goods, including electric ovens, dish washers and refrigerators. The likely source of technology is Bosch and Moulinex of France. IFB, which hopes to earn a profit of over Rs140m on a turnover of Rs720m in the year to June 1992 is to grow at a rate of 35 to 40 per cent in the next five years, according to Mr R. N. Sen, executive director. Turnover of IFB group of companies is about Rs1.25bn. Recognising the risks involved in the white goods business, IFB diversified by taking over two moribund tea estates in West Bengal. IFB has made these plantations reasonably profitable in the past three years by replanting and by using scientific agricultural practices. In the next five years, IFB's tea production will treble to over 2m kg, according to Mr Nag. A group company called IFB Agro Industries, engaged in the production of extra neutral alcohol and liquor is drawing up plans to make a number of alcohol-based chemicals. The IFB group being already in the financial services business, it is well placed, according to Mr Nag, to take advantage of the liberalisation policy and offer a host of new services. Fairly well established in leasing and hire purchase, IFB has decided to float a mutual fund - the private sector is now allowed to operate such funds. It will also provide venture capital and engage in merchant banking. Raising resources to finance new projects is not a problem for IFB, because of its blue chip status on the Stock Exchange.</p>

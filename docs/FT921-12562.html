			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Books: Dreaming of bananas THE FUTURE TELLING LADY by James Berry Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 147 pages Starting this week, we plan to feature 'The FT Children's Book of the Month'  -not necessarily fiction - selected by our critics from the scores of new children's books. For January: a distinguished Caribbean poet. TOWARDS THE middle of Derek Walcott's epic-length poem Omeros Achille, a poor fisherman named after a hero out of Homer, returns in a moment of visionary ecstasy to his African roots in order to question his own identity. Why was he given such a name? Who gave it to him anyway? And can a descendant of slaves, a no-man amongst no-men, with a dark, unwritten history, ever hope to have a real identity at all? Walcott, the most important Caribbean poet of his generation, has wrestled with this theme throughout a long writing life; and it is a pre-occupation that is shared by the poet, anthologist and short-story writer James Berry, whose outstanding new collection of stories for children, The Future Telling Lady, has just been published. Berry was born in a small Jamaican coastal village in 1924 and arrived in London in 1948. For more than 30 years, his adult poetry has explored two themes - that all Anglo-Caribbean writers seem obliged to wrestle with: the nature of personal freedom ('freedom . . . is an adventure of a new self'); and the need to achieve some kind of reconciliation between Caribbean speech patterns and English as it is spoken in England. It is only relatively recently that Berry has turned his attention to writing for children, and the books he has published in this field - one volume of poetry, When I Dance, and two collections of short stories - are his most assured achievements to date. His adult poetry has often been marred by odd rhetorical flourishes; the books for children display an unbridled love for what Berry describes as Caribbean 'nation language' speech, and seem to be spoken in a wholly authentic voice of his own. The strongest story of the seven in The Future Telling Lady is, as in Omeros, preoccupied with the theme of identity. In 'Banana-Day Trip', Boy-Don, youngest child of the family, prepares to go on a trip to his granny-May's house where he will stay for a whole week's holiday. All the necessary preparations have been made: the dog Browndash has been brushed and brushed again; the grass has been cut and gathered in for Goaty; special feed has been prepared for Rhino the pig. Now it is merely a matter of waiting interminably for the sound of Mr Burke's banana-truck to come spluttering into the village. And when the journey is finally under way, Boy-Don experiences a marvellous love for the oceans of yellow bananas that he sees growing in the fields. He thinks of how they will be carried on to the boats at the port and borne across the world's seas . . . 'He found he somehow had a funny sort of envy for the travel and far-away life of bananas. He imagined how the bananas would travel on a ship on that big, big sea, all landless, touching the skyline all round.' Unfortunately, the mood of euphoria doesn't last. Grandmother and her elderly female friend prove to be uncongenial company - especially when they both fall asleep after the mid-day meal and Boy-Don, having been instructed to sit still and rest on the sofa opposite, fears that they may have died on him. Fortunately for the lonely, cheerful boy, he hears the banana-truck moving past the house on its return journey, and Mr Burke agrees to give him a lift back home. Boy-Don, now an object of ridicule to his brother and sister, salvages his reputation in the only way he know how: by singing one of his mesmerising raps. Poetry and song prove to be the necessary healer. That poetry-as-song has such a healing effect upon the household is a matter of some significance. James Berry, together with other British-Caribbean voices of recent years (John Agard, for example), has brought back to English poetry some sense of the importance of the link between verse, music and movement. Poems are not merely words on a page. They are triggers for communal expressions of emotion - joy, togetherness, wonder. Boy-Don finds himself again through rap. This story, full of loving evocations of Jamaican life, stands at the thematic centre of an extremely memorable collection of stories that will be enjoyed by all children of eight and above.</p>

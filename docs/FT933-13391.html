			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Paris urges rethink on farm trade accord FRANCE yesterday called for a special meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers in September to discuss re-opening the Blair House accord on agriculture reached last year between the US and EC. The call reaffirms France's determination to renegotiate Blair House, but it remains uncertain whether the majority of EC member states are ready to back a move which could torpedo efforts to strike a Uruguay Round deal by the end of the year. Belgium, which holds the rotating European Community presidency, noted France's request at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels yesterday. EC officials predicted that the 'jumbo' council of farm and foreign ministers would probably take place, if only to allow the French to 'let off steam'. Mr Alain Lamassoure, French foreign minister responsible for European affairs, said France's attitude to the recent Uruguay Round talks in Tokyo between the US, Canada, the EC and Japan had been constructive. Now that 'decisive' progress had been made on market access for industrial products, it was time to re-open talks on agriculture.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bolkestein Challenges Democrats 66 </F> To `Build a Bridge'"]    [Excerpt] Frits Bolkestein, VVD [People's Party for Freedom  and Democracy] leader, is not ruling out a "purple" coalition  between the PvdA [Labor Party], the VVD, and the D66 [Democrats  66] but does not want to speak out in favor of such a  possibility at present. He is not ruling out "any serious  party." Nor does he want to indicate his preference.    Yesterday, in a speech at the Erasmus University in  Rotterdam, he reproached his D66 colleague Van Mierlo for always  emphatically having flirted with the "purple coalition,"  adopting the viewpoint that if the CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal] is stripped of its central power position, then "the  whole face of the Netherlands will change."    In response to the remarks made by Bolkestein, yesterday  evening in Middelburg, D66 party leader Hans Van Mierlo said  that he may be prepared to take the lead in forming a "purple"  coalition including the D66, the VVD, and the PvdA.    However, according to Van Mierlo, which party will have to  adopt a leading role in this respect will depend on the outcome  of the elections: "Three parties are involved in such a  `purple' coalition. Furthermore, such an undertaking requires  great wisdom and unanimity." [passage omitted]</p>

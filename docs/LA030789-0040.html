			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The Massachusetts State Arts Council is fighting to stay alive because the Ways  and Means Committee of the state House of Representatives has spiked a proposed  budget appropriation of $19.5 million. Unless some or all of the money is  restored, the agency will cease to exist. Art lovers are comparing the cut to  "being told that civilization had come to an end." The full House is to take up  the matter this week. The cut has stirred protests from various national art  agencies. "My reaction is outrage," Edmund Barry Gaither, director of the  Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists in Roxbury, told the New  York Times. "Minority institutions will be disproportionately impacted because  they don't have endowments and a donor-base reaching back to the 19th Century  as do many other cultural organizations." Most top political leaders are  unwilling to predict the outcome of the fight, but Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has  expressed strong support for the Arts Council, for which he wrote the original  legislation in 1966. The cutback resulted from unrelated forces, including an  unexpected $600-million state budget deficit.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKS DROP PRIME RATE TO 11%, BRINGING RELIEF TO LOAN HOLDERS  </P> <P> The nation's banks Monday dropped their prime lending rate -- the benchmark for  many consumer and small-business loans -- to 11% from 11.5%, convinced that the  weakness in the economy is bringing a general easing of credit.  </P> <P> The move, which reversed a yearlong upward drift in the prime, was kicked off  by Citibank, followed by Morgan Guaranty Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of  America, Wells Fargo Bank and others. The banks' action was based partly on  expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will soon ease credit further by  dropping a key rate it controls, the so-called federal funds rate, economists  said.  </P> <P> Combined with the drop in other rates since March, the cut in the prime will  bring a measure of relief to consumers who have been squeezed since early 1988  by hikes in their adjustable-rate mortgages, home-equity loans and other  variable-rate borrowings. Some economists foresee a continued easing of credit  that will provide more comfort for these borrowers and will help stimulate a  housing market that has stalled in some parts of the country.  </P> <P> "For borrowers who last winter feared floating rates would keep going up, this  is good news," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.,  a major government securities dealer in New York.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve had been raising interest rates for about a year in an  effort to slow down the economy and squeeze out the inflation that seemed to be  building. But signs of an economic weakening have been accumulating in recent  weeks, including reports showing a slowdown in housing starts and auto sales.  </P> <P> The evidence strengthened last Friday, when a government employment report  showed that job growth in May was about 100,000 jobs, half as large as  expected. The report set off wide speculation that the Fed would begin lowering  the federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans among banks -- after a  year of increases that has raised it to 9.75%.  </P> <P> On Friday, the medium-sized Southwest Bank of St. Louis announced that it would  lower its prime to 11%, but no major banks followed suit until Monday.  </P> <P> Some maintain that the likelihood of a big lowering of rates by the Fed has  been overstated. Even some of those inside the Fed who favor lower rates  contend that any move is likely to be small.  </P> <P> "There are several signs pointing to a modest easing, but nothing that warrants  all this attention," said one official, who agreed to speak only on condition  that he remain unidentified.  </P> <P> Among the interest rates that have already declined are those on standard,  30-year fixed mortgages, which have been easing since peaking in mid-March at  about 11.2%. These mortgages are available for 10.25% in some places --  representing a healthy 10% drop in three months, said David Rolley, economist  with the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank.  </P> <P> "When your mortgage cost drops 10%, that's a big deal," he said.  </P> <P> Many holders of home-equity loans will quickly be seeing a reduction in their  monthly obligations, because many such loans are tied to the prime and are  repriced each month based on the prime's movements.  </P> <P> "These are still up sharply from a year ago, but a lot of people were expecting  the next step in the prime would be to 12%, rather than 11%," said Paul Getman,  director of financial services at WEFA Group, an economics consulting firm in  Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.  </P> <P> A homeowner with a $10,000, 10-year home-equity loan would be paying $137 a  month at an interest rate of 11%, said Getman. Last year, when the prime was at  9%, the homeowner paid $127.  </P> <P> The prime's drop may quickly help stimulate more home building, according to  Drexel's Rolley, because loans to many construction companies are tied to it.  "There's been a lot of gloom and doom written about this part of the housing  market, but they're going to breathe a little easier because of this," he said.  </P> <P> The general decline in interest rates has had less effect on the market for  adjustable-rate home mortgages. That market has become tougher in recent weeks  as lenders have withdrawn low "teaser" rates that had been offered at 4% to 5%  below prevailing rates. After years of bruising competition, lenders decided  that they had lost too much money and began pulling back.  </P> <P> Still, some analysts believe that the real estate market has already been  stirred by the decline in rates and that the situation may be more attractive  to buyers by the end of the year.  </P> <P> "We seem to have seen some signs of new life in markets like Washington that  had been dead in the water," said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the  National Assn. of Realtors. He said the decline in the prime "has a  psychological effect -- it makes people less fearful of what might happen  next."  </P> <P> Ken Ackbarali, senior economist at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles,  forecasts a continued fall in the prime that will bring the rate down to 9.75%  by the end of the year. "At that level, many more home buyers can qualify for a  mortgage, even in areas where the prices are above average," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tom Redburn in Washington contributed to this story.  </P> <P> STOCKS TAKE A TUMBLE  </P> <P> The Dow falls 37 to 2,480.70.

Aside from Romania's General  Prosecutor, Vasile Manea Dragulin, the meeting was also attended  by Minister of National Defense Lieutenant General Niculae  Spiroiu; Minister of Interior George Ioan Danescu; Minister of  Justice Petre Ninosu; and by the director of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI], Virgil Magureanu.    At the end of the discussions, Vasile Manea Dragulin stated  to the press that the issues discussed were the stage of legal  investigations on the December 1989 events and the situation of  corruption in general terms. It was emphasized that a critical  and serious examination of the results achieved so far was made.    The Prosecutor General specified that organizational  measures  have been taken in connection with people, who will be involved  in carrying out activities regarding such cases and verifying  certain cases in which -- upon the request of the press, of  other institutions or people directly involved -- solutions were  adopted, which were termed as illegal and unfounded. He added  that firm promises exist on behalf of the SRI that very many  data will be passed on to the Public Ministry by the end of  January and that it is hoped that state institutions dealing  with this kind of information, such as the specialized  departments of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of National  Defense, will cooperate.    Asked when it will be possible for the public to be provided  with information on the stage of investigations, Vasile Manea  Dragulin answered that during January the military prosecutors'  offices will report on what has been done and what is in the  process of being solved in 1993, materials which will be  distributed to all mass media.</p>

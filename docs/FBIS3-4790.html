			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator will  continue to be built even though the government has given  nuclear energy the lowest priority in national energy planning.  Based on studies carried out since the 1970s the Minister of  Research and Technology/Chairman of the BPPT [Research and  Technology Development Agency] B. J. Habibie stated that it will  be difficult for Indonesia to overcome its electricity crisis  without incorporating nuclear power.    "Whether we want to or not, it will be difficult for  Indonesia to overcome its energy problems without nuclear power.  Up to now we haven't known how to do it. But we must be aware  that nuclear power has the lowest priority. If there is no other  way, we will take that path," he said here yesterday after  giving a speech during the program of Choosing National Figures  1993 in the FORUM KEADILAN magazine version. Habibie said this  in response to various policy statements made by a number of  national figures about the development of the Muria I  Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator.    Habibie said that even though nuclear power has been given  the lowest priority, construction will continue on the Muria I  Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator project. This will be done,  he continued, to get ready to face an electric energy crisis.  Preliminary feasibility studies carried out by Newjec Inc  (Japan) were completed in December 1993; they concluded that  constructing the PLTN in Muria is quite feasible. Further  feasibility studies will not be completed until 1997. However,  projections are that it will be opened to construction tenders  in 1995.    The Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator will be the  first nuclear-based electric generator built in Indonesia; it  will have a capacity of 2,600 MW. The results of site studies  show that Ujung Lemahabang is in first place, followed by Ujung  Grengengan and then by Ujung Watu. These three sites are located  on the north shore of the Muria peninsula in Central Java.    Is it necessary to hold a referendum to obtain the agreement  of the populace? Habibie said that he is only helping the  MPR's [Parliament] mandate by gathering scientific and  technological information. His strategic goal is to create job  opportunities. "The GBHN [Broad Outlines of the Nation's  Direction] demands these job opportunities. But job  opportunities need factories and factories need electricity.  Some people say no, just build up the tourist industry, build  hotels. But hotels also need electricity, you know. So we can't  build without electricity," he said.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Portugal ratifies Maastricht THE Portuguese parliament yesterday overwhelmingly ratified the Maastricht treaty, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. Only 22 members of the 230-seat parliament, including the old-guard Communist Party, the conservative Centre Social Democrats and independents, voted against. Ratification will require changes to the constitution on sharing sovereignty, allowing foreign residents to vote, and ending the exclusive right of the central bank to issue money.</p>

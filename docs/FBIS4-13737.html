			<p>BFN     [Text] President Husni Mubarak has emphasized the  importance of the great strides Middle Eastern countries have  made in economic and social development because this is the  sound way to enable them to reap the fruits of peace. These  countries should exert intensive efforts to review their forms  of economic development. This came in a message President  Mubarak addressed to the Bucharest International Forum and read  by People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fathi Surur.    President Mubarak noted that the success of economic  cooperation in the Middle East will not be confined within the  boundaries of this region but will have a positive impact on the  world economy. He said that he does not conceive of such  cooperation growing amid the economic contradictions buffeting  the region and the discrepancy in the level of development, as  well as the difficult economic situation besetting the countries  of the region. He added: Therefore, we expect the European  countries to play the role of main partner in this cooperation  because of the close link between security and prosperity in  Europe and stability and peace in the Middle East.    President Mubarak said that the Middle Eastern countries  look  to the big powers to help them overcome their problems, such as  energy, water, infrastructure, and population. He voiced his  hope that a comprehensive and fair peace will be achieved to  serve as a prelude to eliminating numerous hotbeds of tension in  the world. President Mubarak noted the recent political  transformations in the Middle east, such as the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, which has had an  impact on the whole world.</p>

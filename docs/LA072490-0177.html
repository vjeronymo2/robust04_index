			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'GALLOPING GHOST' RED GRANGE IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE BATTLE  </P> <P> Harold (Red) Grange, football's legendary Galloping Ghost, has been found to  have Parkinson's disease but should be home from an extended-care facility in a  few weeks, his wife said.  </P> <P> "He won't be going dancing," said Muggs Grange, his wife of more than 49 years,  "but he's going to outlive all of us."  </P> <P> The 87-year-old Grange, one of the 17 charter members in the Pro Football Hall  of Fame, went in for a checkup last month at Lake Wales Hospital and was  hospitalized briefly, Mrs. Grange said.  </P> <P> He was moved to the extended-care facility early this month and is receiving  physical therapy because the disease has affected his mobility and speech, she  said.  </P> <P> Grange was the rage of the 1920s when he made the number 77 famous during a  fabulous career as a running back at the University of Illinois and later in  the National Football League with the Chicago Bears.  </P> <P> Grange's speed and electrifying performances helped catapult football from deep  inside sports sections to front-page headlines across the country. He once  modestly admitted, "Yes, I think I brought some attention to the game."  </P> <P> Grange played at Illinois from 1923 to '25 and in his junior year scored four  touchdowns in one game within a period of 12 minutes, racing 95, 67, 56 and 45  yards against Michigan.  </P> <P> He averaged more than 8.4 yards a carry and more than 10 points a game for his  combined college and pro career.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Home truths about Brazil's real debt problem AFTER years of crisis over Brazil's foreign debt, there are now growing worries that a more serious debt problem may lie at home. Even before President Collor was enveloped by crisis, some economists feared the government's domestic debt might soon be out of control. By pushing up interest rates, the crisis heightens these concerns. Even by the government's own conservative estimates, the interest bill will be Dollars 21bn this year. Federal debt in the form of domestic bonds grew 162.7 per cent between last September and March: future growth depends on what happens to domestic interest rates. High real interest rates are the main weapon in the government's fight against inflation, but they dramatically raise the cost of servicing domestic debt. Unless real interest rates come down - ideally by the passage of fiscal reform through Congress, which would reduce the burden on monetary policy - the government sooner or later will find it impossible to service ballooning domestic debt. This cost has caused Brazil to fail to meet the first quarter budgetary targets of an IMF standby agreement. Servicing internal debt will, the government says, cost 4.9 per cent of GDP this year. But analysts say this is optimistic as it assumes inflation will fall, and it has not so far. A study by Mr Mailson da Nobrega, a consultant and former finance minister, warns that by the year-end public sector domestic debt will have risen 53 per cent in real terms to Dollars 92.4bn (21.5 per cent of GDP). This would place it almost at the level inherited by President Fernando Collor in March 1990 following uncontrolled spending by his predecessor. This was before the Collor Plan, which froze assets nationwide, and reduced public debt from 24.6 per cent of GDP to 14 per cent. Mr Francisco Gros, the central bank governor, argues that the internal debt tells only half the story. Internal debt has expanded from a very low base, but this has been mostly cancelled by the shrinkage of the country's net external debt. This has shrunk because, until recently, Brazil's foreign exchange reserves were expanding. Apart from high interest rates, internal debt is being swelled by two factors. The first is the freeing of assets frozen under the Collor Plan. Since last August the government has been repaying around Dollars 2bn of these blocked cruzados a month by issuing bonds. Although the government pays interest on the blocked cruzados, it is paying much more - 30 percentage points above money market rates - on the paper it is issuing to fund their liberation. The second factor is the huge influx of foreign money into the economy, caused partly by high interest rates. This has almost doubled reserves in the last six months to Dollars 13.7bn at end-March, but has swollen internal debt because it is government policy to issue bonds to neutralise the monetary impact of the inflows. Mr Gros predicts marketable internal debt will peak at 7.5 per cent of GDP or Dollars 30bn by year-end, and argues that this is low compared to countries such as Mexico and Italy. 'Public sector debt is not going out of control because both elements which led to its increase are running out of steam.' He says 90 per cent of the frozen cruzados has already been liberated - the rest will be by August - while the central bank has acted to stem the inflow of dollars.</p>

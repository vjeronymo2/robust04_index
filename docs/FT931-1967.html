			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Commerzbank maintains dividend THE SUPERVISORY board of Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest commercial bank, yesterday agreed to bolster reserves and offer an unchanged DM10 dividend for 1992 following one-off 53 per cent surge in group net profits. Earnings rose to DM838m (Dollars 513m) from DM547m, mainly as a side-effect of the absorption last October of the Berlin subsidiary into the parent, Commerzbank AG. After correction, like-for-like net earnings were still higher than in 1991, the bank said. Profits at the parent company rose from DM447.5m to DM746.5m. The board also agreed to allocate DM443m to group reserves, compared with DM235m last time. At the annual meeting on May 7 it will ask shareholders to agree the issue of up to 1m additional profit-sharing certificates in a further move to strengthen the bank's capital base. Full details of the bank's 1992 performance and prospects for the current year will be released later this week. Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive, who in January announced a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to around DM2.2bn, said at the time that a higher dividend would be 'inappropriate'. Provisions for debts in the former Soviet Union would rise from 60 per cent to around 80 per cent. The group would also provide against its exposures to Hafnia, the Danish insurer, and the Olympia &amp; York property group.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Lay a little egg for me - Cricket The average wait for a chicken toastie was 1 1/2 hours in the hotels of Barbados this week. It did not matter what level of establishment either - the super-luxury Sandy Lane or the down market Sunset Crest beach club. Every hotel was overbooked and understaffed and dealing with an overwhelming demand for chicken sandwiches. Which was only to be expected. The England cricket team are in town for a Test match and so are about 7,000 of their 'supporters'. Well, they claim to be supporters, but not many admitted to ever attending a Test in England. They have descended since the beginning of the month on scheduled flights and charters, are jamming the corridors and lobbys of the island's 86 registered hotels, and will take up half the ground for the whole Test match. Locals cannot get tickets. 'I've never known anything like it,' says former England bowler Fred Rumsey, who has been bringing club teams and supporters tours to Barbados for 20 years. 'You can't get a bed or a ground pass for love nor money', he said, sweating profusely from the rigours of organising his party of 420. It is all slightly ironic. England have already lost the series, and are facing their third recent 5-0 whitewash in the Caribbean. England cannot play the game, but it can supply a crowd to watch. So who are these people, and what are they doing in the West Indies? Going on activity holidays has been a growing trend. Water sports or golf trips are booming business, so are packages to international cricket matches, although whether these qualify as active is debatable. The key attraction is that tickets for Tests are guaranteed - the result of the match is irrelevant. The main thing is to be there. A range of retired cricketers, from wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to bowler Paul Allot, are brought in to tell cricket tales, or explain David Gower's ommission. Whereas once the Caribbean was only accessible to the rich and famous, now anyone can go. There are holidays to suit all pockets; from the Pounds 989 Mr Watts from Wolverhampton pays for his self-catering bedsit and terrace ticket, up to Pounds 5,000 for a suite at Glitter Bay and a cushioned seat behind Curtly Ambrose's arm. There are retired gas fitters and insurance salesmen, lift engineers and sales reps all lured here by the affordable price, the safe reputation and Sky TV's animated coverage of the series in the pubs and clubs of middle England. On match days, supporters are herded like sheep to the ground and then put out to graze for the rest of the time. They dress the same, in loud polyester leisure wear and sneakers or tour-issue T-shirts and white socks hitched up to mid-calf. They pontificate incessantly. Their presence accompanying cricket tours around the world has sprouted a generic term - Wincs - Wallies Incorporated. You must avoid rum-swilling Wincs at all costs. This is jolly hard for the players, because they often share the same hotel, and, having endured the searing pace and heat of the West Indies on the field, are then subjected to a barrage of opinions in the bar afterwards. Most escape to their rooms eventually, but it is no understatement to say that playing for England abroad is more of an ordeal than an honour. And yet there are parallels between the players and their followers. Both tend to seek out the creature comforts and will only tip-toe into unfamiliar territory. This cautious attitude arouses both affection and irritation and is consistent with an Englishman's general readiness to be second rate. We - the English - seem to have forgotten how to assert ourselves, even belittling our own proven heroes. By contrast the Caribbean people are still crowing about the feats of Garfield Sobers, even after all these years. Therein lies the absurdity. To commemorate the 40th year of the West Indies uncovering 'the greatest cricketer that ever lived' there have been race meetings, banquets, golf tournaments and a gathering of 70 celebrated adversaries for a parade at the Bridgetown Oval. Yet thousands of Sobers' loyal subjects cannot get in to see it. The West Indies Cricket Board are delighted, of course. As the most impecunious of all cricketing nations, they regard 10 cents on the price of a Banks beer as a profit. Now, having managed to pre-sell thousands of expensive five-day packages to the tour companies for a match that is not expected to last that long, they need to make space for a few extra noughts above the line. It is hard to avoid the suspicion that West Indies cricket is sacrificing its soul in a bid to make money. They are only following the lead of every other major sporting body, but Caribbean cricket grounds will be lesser places without the conch-shell blowers, the musicians, the roti vendors or the boys perching in trees to try and see their heroes. Unfortunately, such is the superior fitness, skill and pride within the West Indies team, that they are likely to overcome England's rather feeble efforts, in spite of being surrounded by a throng of plump, peeling Englishmen. The message is that the meek may inherit the earth, but chickens do not last long in Barbados.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Milan - Other Markets Worries about the economy and the prospects for higher interest rates conspired to keep the pressure on Milan last week. The weight of forthcoming capital calls and privatisations, estimated at more than L10,000bn, also preyed on the market as the new account began last Thursday. This Saturday will see the price set for one of the privatisations, the 51 per cent of shares being offered next week in Ina, the insurance group. The Treasury has already confirmed that the price will be in the range of L2,200 to L2,700 per share for the 2.04bn shares on offer.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Back from the brink  -Norwich Union's troubles in an increasingly tough regulatory market At least there was no army of aggrieved consumers. But the public relations crisis facing Norwich Union this summer in the wake of its highly embarrassing regulatory troubles has been serious by any standards. The problem first surfaced publicly on 29 March when the company, one of the UK's largest insurers, announced that its 600-strong direct life insurance and pensions sales force, as well as some 200 sales agents in companies acting for the insurer, were being temporarily suspended for retraining. That statement came some months after NU had identified serious weaknesses in its selling process which it had begun working to rectify. Unfortunately for the company its initial plans were overtaken by Lautro, the regulator for the life insurance industry, which insisted on more radical remedial action, including taking the sales force off the road for a month. The March announcement meant that NU had to deliver an effective training programme within a short space of time. It then had to cope with another blast of bad publicity at the end of April, when Lautro imposed a record fine of Pounds 300,000 on the insurer for its failures to meet proper standards. The new training programme is made up of three elements. The first entails sitting the Financial Planning Certificate, the basic qualification for independent financial advisers, which is administered by the Chartered Insurance Institute. The second is a test of knowledge of Norwich Union products, covering both regulatory issues and the products themselves. The third test involves a residential sales skills course, based on videoed role play: a sales agent interviews a colleague acting as a client and has to gather enough information to make a recommendation. The following day there is another videoed interview, in which the recommendation is put to the 'client'. While the sales skills assessment has been praised by those who have taken part in it, NU has faced some criticism from participants for relying too much in the rest of the programme on sales agents studying by themselves and not enough on lectures. Gary Cornish was among the 60 per cent of NU sales agents who passed all elements of the course at the first attempt. 'The (sales skills) course was very well done. Before that course it was ludicrous, we were just told to read the manuals,' he says. One extra difficulty faced by NU was managing the introduction of a single training programme for both the direct sales force and appointed representatives - firms of financial advisers who do not work for NU directly but act solely for the insurer. Previously there had been two. Philip Scott, NU life and pensions general manager, says that the appointed representatives, used to running their own businesses, were in some cases less inclined than the direct sales force to be told by NU how they should sell life insurance and pensions. Significantly perhaps, the pass rate for all elements of the training programme at the first attempt was lower among appointed representatives - at 40 per cent. Robin Sainty, who runs Integrated Business Analysis which acts for NU, has a rather different perspective. His team of advisers has all passed the training programme and is enthusiastic about the changes to the training. But he is sharply critical of the way in which NU reached this point. 'We were very angry, particularly because we felt it was avoidable,' he says. 'There were enough people telling NU they were not happy with the quality of training.' He believes the failure to act earlier was a symptom of a more general malaise of 'corporate arrogance'. Scott and Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who set up the training arrangements, emphasise the benefits to those who have passed the programme. 'The vast majority of them are proud of their achievement because they know they have been through a testing process,' Scott says. Whether that sense of pride is as strong for those who manage to succeed only at later attempts remains to be seen. Over the coming weeks the final stragglers will return to selling, while those who have failed at their last chance lose their authorisation. Even among the first successful sales agents, there have been mixed feelings as they meet negative reactions from customers. 'When I first came back I was very pleased to have passed all the exams, but that has been followed by several lows,' says Stewart Davidson, who joined NU last autumn, as he talks of decisions deferred and customers who have gone elsewhere in the meantime. Sainty reports some negative feedback from potential, if not existing, customers, though he sees a longer-term benefit from the improvements in the sales process. 'The next couple of months will inevitably be a bit sticky, but then we will be back beyond where we were: September is my target date for getting back into full swing,' he says. NU can take comfort from knowing that although it has been the first to face this difficulty, in an increasingly harsh regulatory climate, it is unlikely to be the last life insurer to do so.</p>

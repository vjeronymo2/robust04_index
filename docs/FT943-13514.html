			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal pays CDollars 403m for Burns Fry Bank of Montreal plans to expand its investment banking operations in the US and Canada with the acquisition of Burns Fry, a Toronto securities firm. The bank, Canada's third largest, will pay up to CDollars 403m (USDollars 290m) in cash and shares for Burns Fry, which is 26 per cent owned by San Francisco-based Bank of America and 74 per cent by its employees. Bank of America will receive just over CDollars 100m in cash. Burns Fry, which has equity capital of CDollars 200m, will merge with Nesbitt Thomson, the Montreal bank's wholly-owned securities subsidiary. The deal is expected to close before the end of August. The merged firm, to be known as Nesbitt Burns will employ about 3,700 people and along with RBC Dominion Securities and Wood Gundy will be one of Canada's main dominant securities dealers. All are owned by banks, which were allowed to enter the securities business in 1987. The Nesbitt/Burns deal is expected to increase pressure on ScotiaMcLeod, a subsidiary of Bank of Nova Scotia, to expand through an acquisition or merger. Nesbitt and Burns have several overlapping businesses and outsiders predict a large number of lay-offs, although Mr Brian Steck, Nesbitt chairman, said yesterday redundancies would be minimal. Executives of both firms yesterday identified opportunities in the US as one of the main benefits of the merger. Mr Steck said Nesbitt Burns would expand 'aggressively' its research capability south of the border, build up an institutional salesforce based in Chicago and New York, and seek a retail securities base. Bank of Montreal has been the most active Canadian bank in the US. It owns Harris Bankcorp of Chicago, and has set a goal of earning 50 per cent of total income from US operations. The bank employs 160 people in its US investment banking division. Under the deal, Burns Fry shareholders will receive CDollars 283m in cash and stock exchangeable over four years into a maximum of about 5m Bank of Montreal shares. Burns Fry shareholders can choose to receive up to CDollars 30m of the cash payment in additional exchangeable stock.</p>

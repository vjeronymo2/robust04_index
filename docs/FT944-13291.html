			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Judges awarded extra pay rise Judges are to receive a fixed percentage increase in their salaries on top of any annual rise recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, the government announced yesterday, Robert Rice writes. The additional rise will run for five years from April and is designed to bring judicial salaries up to the levels recommended in the body's 1992 report. The biggest additional increase of 2.48 per cent will go to the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, taking his salary to at least Pounds 130,000 by 1999. The second highest increase of 2.41 per cent will be paid to law lords and the Master of the Rolls, taking their salaries to a minimum of Pounds 120,000 by 1999. High Court judges will receive a 1.57 per cent extra rise eventually taking their earnings to Pounds 100,000. They receive Pounds 95,051 at the moment. Senior Circuit judges, who already receive close to the 1992 recommended figure of Pounds 83,000, will nevertheless get an extra 0.63 per cent, taking them past Pounds 83,000 by 1999. At the moment they receive Pounds 82,641. The additional percentage was agreed by the government last November but it has taken until now to sort out the correct percentage increase for each judicial grade.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 15 November the STA announced it has begun  full-fledged joint research with Russia concerning a Reactor  Operation Abnormality Detection System, and this research will  be conducted as part of the atomic energy safety aid to nations  of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The abnormality  detection system, which uses a microphone developed by PNC, will  be installed in a former Soviet-type reactor (RBMK), and Japan  and Russia will conduct demonstration tests together. There are  also plans for cooperation on a comprehensive leak detection  system that uses microphones and piezosensors to maintain the  soundness of reactor piping. This cooperation will be conducted  under the framework of the Japan-Russia Atomic Energy Agreement.  The estimated budget for the project for 1993 [sic] is about  &yen;960,000,000.    Japan and Russia have held three meetings of specialists and  conducted discussions on the framework for cooperation and  technical items. The result was a basic agreement on the  contents of the cooperative project in July. Thereafter,  diplomatic negotiations continued, and a letter of agreement was  signed on 12 November.    The abnormality detection system will be installed inside  the  reactor containment vessel, and it will alert operators to  abnormalities by detecting signals through the microphone.</p>

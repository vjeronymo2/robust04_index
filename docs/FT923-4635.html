			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Warburg ends trade in stocks of 362 companies SG WARBURG Securities, a leading UK stockbroker, is to stop making a market in the shares of 362 companies, claiming it no longer makes commercial sense to trade such illiquid stocks. Yesterday's decision may result in about 90 small companies being put on the Stock Exchange's Bulletin Board, which matches buy and sell orders for illiquid shares in small companies. Warburg's decision to stop making markets in so many shares is a blow to small companies, already hit by the recession. Although some securities houses have stopped marketmaking in illiquid smaller companies' shares 'in dribs and drabs' over recent months, according to the Stock Exchange, none has withdrawn on the same scale as Warburg. The 362 shares being dropped include Alexandra Workwear, a market leader in company uniforms and overalls, Amber Day, which owns the What Everyone Wants discount clothes chain, and Bridon, the wire rope maker. Of the total, 277 have a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 20m; the list includes 47 companies on the second-tier Unlisted Securities Market. Some of the stocks are not ordinary shares, but such instruments as warrants and non-voting shares. Warburg will continue to make markets in about 1,400 stocks, including warrants and convertibles. The group said it had reviewed its past five years' operations and identified the shares it was losing money on. 'We couldn't justify making markets in these stocks to our shareholders because we were losing money on them,' Warburg said. Overall, it said, the group's UK equity business was profitable in 1991 and so far in 1992. Stock Exchange rules say a company must have at least two marketmakers. Warburg's withdrawal will leave about 90 companies with only one. The exchange said it would try over the next two weeks to find these companies a second marketmaker. If it fails, the companies will be put on the Bulletin Board, available on Topic the electronic information system. It gives details of each company and the date and price for the last 12 trades in its shares. 'Being on the Bulletin Board is not as advantageous for the company because it is not so visible there,' said one smaller companies analyst. Alarm bells start ringing, Page 5</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Management: Sashimi and chips - A look at a bold exchange programme between computer company ICL and its parent Fujitsu Donald McGarva is a 32-year-old engineer from Scotland who has a job in a factory. He is also a celebrity. The factory is in Numazu in Japan, and McGarva, who works shoulder-to-shoulder with Japanese engineers, has a worm's-eye view of working practices that are the envy of the world. Diplomats, and businessmen from east and west consult him. Even John Major, who visited Japan this week, dropped in on him to find out how things look from his angle. McGarva is one of 10 junior employees at ICL, the UK-based computer company, who have been transferred for a two-year stint to Fujitsu, ICL's Japanese parent. This select group is matched by a similar band of Fujitsu workers who have been plunged into ICL. Both have had their cultural and professional worlds turned upside down in the interests of what is known as corporate 'synergy'. When Fujitsu bought 80 per cent of ICL three years ago, it was decided that the European company would continue to be run autonomously. Yet in order to make sense of the new relationship, both businesses needed to find a way of extracting some benefit from the other. The exchange scheme was part of a master plan created by Peter Bonfield, chairman of ICL and Fujitsu's president Tadashi Sekizawa. The aim was twofold: to spread ideas from one company to another in an informal way and to create a cadre of high fliers with the wherewithal to deal with an international future. It was recognised from the outset that the plan would only work if the top people were prepared to learn from the trainees. Sekizawa makes sure he knows the E-Mail indentity of each trainee and encourages them to send him messages. This in itself was a breakthrough, as Japanese employees no more dream of putting their own views to the president than of taking their clothes off in the office. Yet already the electronic messages are flying eastwards, and are being heeded. One bold Japanese trainee was astounded to discover that ICL employees volunteered for the exchange scheme, whereas Fujitsu trainees were chosen. The experience of Satoshi Yamamoto was typical: he was told by his boss on his wedding day that he would be leaving for ICL in two months. The trainee suggested to Sekizawa that employees who put themselves forward were likely to be more motivated. The president took note - somewhat to the alarm of his personnel department - and vacancies on the scheme are now being advertised. Nearly 100 people have applied for 10 positions in the latest batch. Bonfield, who lunches or dines with his trainees each time he visits Tokyo, has been told in detail about the impressive technology used at Fujitsu. He had also learnt some home truths about the way certain parts of ICL look from the outside. According to McGarva: 'It's far from a perfect company. There are some areas that I used to be proud of, but which I now see differently. I can see areas where we can become more international.' The lessons that are emerging from the first wave of exchanges are not what one might expect. Japan has long been regarded as having near mystical management ability. During the past decade, British companies have copied wholesale Japanese working practices such as Just In Time delivery and Total Quality Management. But to judge from the Fujitsu/ICL experience, some management lessons are starting to flow the other way. 'Fujitsu people are eagerly seeking our opinions,' says McGarva. 'Japanese companies are changing from the inside. Traditions like life-time employment are starting to change.' The Fujitsu employees have found plenty to admire in the way ICL is run. Yamamoto, who works for the personnel department, is amazed at the care with which ICL graduates are picked. By contrast, the 1,200 or so graduates that are taken on each year by Fujitsu are hired by the yard. He is also impressed by employees' tailor-made career plans. 'In ICL, personnel objectives are clearly defined, and that improves motivation. In Japan people are forced into uncomfortable objectives,' he says. Kenji Watanabe is surprised at the degree of respect given to consultants and technical people - which in Japan is reserved for the managers. Kenjiro Serikawa has sampled the British two-to-three week summer holiday, and finds he prefers it to the three to four days he might expect at home. 'Here I can relax more,' he says. But will these messages get through? 'Many Japanese companies are aware that their style is not a perfect one, and are keen to learn something from overseas,' says Watanabe. These lessons have not been learnt without a cost: both sides have suffered severe culture shock. Heidi Hunter, the first woman to be sent to Fujitsu, had a double dose. 'The biggest shock was on the morning of the first day to hear the company song on the PA, followed by exercises.' As a female engineer, she was regarded as a freak: 'For the first six weeks the Japanese didn't know where to pigeon-hole me. To survive you have to have a lot of confidence. You've got to get up and do it.' For Nigel Beane, who has been at Fujitsu for six months and lives in a company flat, the most difficult moment was being woken up at 7.30am on a Sunday morning by the company tannoy and being told it was a lovely day and to take some exercise. The ICL people came prepared with six months of intensive language and culture training, yet they still felt at sea. But that was six months more than the Fujitsu people had. Although most could already speak (American) English, none had any idea of what to expect from working in the UK. Serikawa found himself on the first day talking to customers in a language that he was uncomfortable with about a computer system he did not know. Watanabe could not understand why British managers found his customary politeness absurd. All have now acclimatised. Watanabe says he can switch the politeness on and off depending on whether he is talking to British or Japanese colleagues. Hunter is now treated like another engineer. McGarva introduces himself as Fujitsu's Donald McGarva without thinking. Much as each side has enjoyed its sojourn, there will be compensations to going home. The Japanese trainees are looking forward to a public transport system that works. Beane is looking forward to a lie-in.</p>

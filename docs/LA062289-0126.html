			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAUCETS, PATIENCE RUN DRY IN TINY ACTON;  </P> <P> WATER SHORTAGES PLAGUE 40 HOUSEHOLDS FOR 3 DAYS DURING HEAT WAVE  </P> <P> After a long, hot day behind the wheel of his delivery truck, Eric McCloskey  longed for a cool shower when he drove home to Acton, only to discover -- along  with dozens of neighbors -- that water taps were dry. He showered by pouring  water from 5-gallon jugs, his earthquake emergency supply, over his head.  </P> <P> After another blistering day behind the wheel, McCloskey happily discovered  Wednesday evening that the water was back on. At least briefly.  </P> <P> "He was taking a shower and the water went off again," said his father, Hugh  McCloskey, with a slight chuckle. "It's been fun if you keep your sense of  humor. But it's also been trying."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Awareness  </P> <P> McCloskey's experience was typical of the annoying inconveniences felt in Acton  for three days during an intermittent water shortage. The shortage affected  only about 40 households in the town of 6,500, but residents said it has  heightened public awareness of the rural community's fragile water supply and  focused attention on the impact of development there.  </P> <P> Unusually heavy water use during the current heat wave left homes without water  for hours at a time, and county workers rushed Wednesday to hook a private well  to the Los Angeles County water system to assist customers left high and dry by  the shortage, authorities said.  </P> <P> The Department of Public Works trucked water to remote households in the rural  community, which is 47 miles north of Los Angeles, to water down sweltering  horses. Department workers walked door-to-door Wednesday, posting flyers urging  residents to conserve water.  </P> <P> Gary Hartley, assistant deputy director of the Department of Public Works, said  the high demand for water left the county's two water tanks, which hold 1.2  million gallons, well below normal levels. The county's one well could not  refill the tanks fast enough so water pressure fell, leaving some homes without  water.  </P> <P> The county's Waterworks District No. 37 serves about 700 homes in Acton. Most  residents obtain their water from private wells and were not affected by the  shortage.  </P> <P> Hartley said the town's water supply is not in danger. "We've got plenty of  water in the aquifer," he said. The problem, he said, was the lack of a  secondary water source to augment the county well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Dipper Water  </P> <P> The department has worked since Saturday to hook the water district to Big  Dipper Water Delivery Service, a private water company. Hartley expected to  have Big Dipper water flowing into the county system Wednesday night, but  apparently not in time for Eric McCloskey's shower.  </P> <P> Since the county has not used Big Dipper water before, the Health Department  urged residents, as a precaution, to boil water for a few days because purity  tests on the company's water have not been completed. Hartley said the initial  rush of water might release contaminants in the new pipes.  </P> <P> Hartley said the problem should be solved in August, when a new well, paid for  by developers, is completed. Under a policy adopted 18 months ago, developers  cannot build until they provide their own water supply, he said. The county is  negotiating to obtain water from the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency,  which receives water from northern California.  </P> <P> Residents angrily blamed the water shortage on developers, county planners and  the Board of Supervisors. "It's a known fact there's a water problem, and they  keep building up here," Sandra Conn said. Conn said she drove to a friend's  house 17 miles away to load up buckets and barrels of water for her three  horses.  </P> <P> Other residents said developers have installed lush landscaping that requires  more water than local conditions will allow. Some newcomers, they groused,  still think they live in Los Angeles and waste water accordingly.  </P> <P> Charles Brink, who has lived in Acton since 1946, said locals understand they  have to conserve in the country. "We just never had water to waste," he said.  "We still have a working outhouse for emergencies. It hasn't been used in 20  years but it's there."  </P></p>

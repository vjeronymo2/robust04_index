			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata is set to leave for his first overseas trip as premier  Monday [2 May] to tour Italy, France, Germany and Belgium.    Hata will explain to European leaders the political  developments that led to the breakup of the seven-party  coalition, government officials said.    Hata, who formed a minority government after the coalition's  biggest party, the Social Democratic Party, defected from the  alliance, will pledge to continue the reform drive launched by  his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa in the field of politics,  administration and economy.    Hosokawa's coalition government ousted the Liberal  Democratic  Party (LDP) last August after almost four decades of its  unchallenged rule.    With the annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major  industrialized nations in July drawing close, Hata will also  elaborate on Japan's efforts to boost world economic growth,  such as income tax cuts, deregulation, market opening and  pump-priming measures to stimulate domestic demand, the  officials said.    Foreign Ministry officials, however, expressed concern  whether Hata will be able to put on a strong performance as it  is widely believed that his government will be short-lived.    The majority opposition could force Hata and his cabinet to  step down or to dissolve the House of Representatives to call a  general election as soon as the budget for fiscal 1994, which  started April 1, has been adopted by the Diet.    He might want to ask for some advice in Italy, the first leg  of his trip and host of the Naples summit, where the average  lifespan of postwar cabinets has not exceeded 309 days, with the  power vacuum between the formation of cabinets averaging some 33  days.    In Rome, Hata, traveling in the company of his wife Yasuko  and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura, is scheduled  to hold talks with both outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi and incoming Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose  rightist Freedom Alliance won a landslide victory in March  general elections.    The agenda in Paris, where Hata will meet President Francois  Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, will include  Japanese-French cooperation in Indochina and Africa, the  officials said.    In Bonn, Hata will reconfirm in talks with Chancellor Helmut  Kohl that Japan and Germany will join forces in their bid for a  permanent seat on a revised U.N. Security Council.    They will also likely formally launch a Japanese-German  cooperation council on high technology and environment  technology, proposed during Kohl's visit to Japan in March last  year, which is to sound out areas for joint research and  development.    Before returning to Japan on May 7, Hata is scheduled to  meet  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and the president of the  European commission, Jacques Delors, in Brussels.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] The bloody and calamitous game in the disarmed and  so-called safe haven of Gorazde has entered a new phase and UN  officials and the Serb criminals are trying to reap fresh fruit  from the joint and coordinated game they have been carrying on.    While the calamitous deaths and the nightmare of the  massacre  of civilians have cast their shadow over the residents of the  oppressed city of Gorazde, UN officials, the Security Council,  and Western leaders are seeking a political solution for the  crisis of the city of Gorazde, which is on the verge of falling.  This is the West's new tactic in response to the world's rage  and concern and the horrific nightmare the Gorazde residents are  facing. It is a pattern of behavior on the basis of the new  rule of acting and interfering after the tragedy. The objective  behind this new tactic is to officialize the presence of the  Serbs inside and around Gorazde and to delineate the political  map of the area on the basis of its current military situation.  And this will grant the Serbs the legitimacy they need.    Basically, the Serbs prefer to have Gorazde, on the basis of  a political agreement, in the war, not as an aggressor to be  confronted and with whom the people are enraged. The Muslims  and the leaders of Bosnia too may have no alternative. This  comes at a time when the world of Islam is silent and  indifferent. In this case, the West and the United Nations and  the Serbs will emerge victorious and respectable from this  bloody and calamitous game.    With this new tactic, the West will achieve its political  objective, which is the political crushing of the Muslims in  Europe, in addition to the propaganda success that the Bosnian  crisis was solved by politics. Once they dominate, occupiers,  aggressors, and their mentors support political solutions so  that they can thus legitimize their aggression and what they  have gained through such solutions and portray confrontation  with such solutions as illegitimate or doomed. The Westerners  also hope to calm people with this game.    The Serbs too will achieve one of their most important  military and political objectives and will gain full control of  east Bosnia. Basically speaking, there could be no better  condition than this for them to reap the political fruit of  their savage military and inhuman crimes.    But behind this deceitful and bloody game, it is clear that  even if the United Nations and the Western officials can  apparently prevent the fall of Gorazde, they can no longer  prevent the fall of the values of Western culture and of the  prestige and credibility of the United Nations in the eyes of  the world.    Gorazde today reminds the world of Islam of the tragedy of  the fall of Andalusia into the hands of the crusaders and of the  fall of holy Jerusalem into the hands of the Zionists and it  will thus leave a great mark in the history that is in front of  Islam and the West.</p>

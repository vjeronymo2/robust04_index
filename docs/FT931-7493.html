			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Bentsen's loose talk OFF-THE-CUFF quips may be powerful weapons in the heat of campaign politics, as US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen memorably demonstrated in the 1988 vice-presidential debate with Mr Dan Quayle. But in the world of international finance they should be avoided. Mr Bentsen's offhand remark to journalists last week that he wanted to see a stronger yen exchange rate against the dollar may not have been intended to signal a shift in US policy towards managed exchange rates. But it sent the dollar crashing all the same, and will have won Mr Bentsen few friends in Tokyo. Mr Bentsen's remarks, if unintentional, were certainly insensitive. By appearing to associate the US administration with proposals for a 20 per cent yen revaluation, currently being touted by Mr Fred Bergsten, assistant Treasury secretary in the Carter administration, Mr Bentsen has not helped his efforts to revitalise co-operation between the Group of Seven industrial countries at this weekend's meeting in London. Not that a rise in the value of the yen is necessarily undesirable. Regrettably, Japan's record bilateral surplus with the US is an embarrassing political problem for President Clinton. A gradual appreciation of the yen is a better solution than the protectionist trade policies that elements in the US Democratic party would prefer, however painful for some of Japan's manufacturers. Yet the prospect of a return to 1980s-style exchange rate management sends chills down the spines of Japanese government officials. For policy co-ordination over the past decade, by concentrating on tinkering with exchange rates while ignoring the fiscal causes of trade imbalances, did more harm than good. The loose monetary policy that US Treasury secretary James Baker persuaded Japan to pursue after 1985 is largely to blame for Tokyo's stock market bubble and subsequent recession. Nor does a rise in Japanese interest rates, to force up the yen, make any more sense today, a fact that US officials understand. Only one senior US Treasury official has a name beginning with 'B' and ending with 'n', last week's Japanese delegation to Washington was reportedly informed. Mr Bentsen's remarks are bound to divert attention from his case for more growth-friendly policies in other G7 countries. The Bush administration's repeated calls for concerted action to speed growth always sounded hollow while the US budget deficit remained large and long-term interest rates high. But the Clinton team can now point to last week's deficit-reducing package as a tangible attempt to rebalance the US economy, and the  1/2 point fall in long-term interest rates since the election as evidence of how fiscal rebalancing might work. Now it is Europe's turn. Germany's dangerously unbalanced fiscal and monetary policy is imposing high interest rates, slow growth and rising budget deficits across Europe. A German package of tax increases and spending cuts is the best way to reduce high European real interest rates. Tokyo, meanwhile, can and should be cajoled into exploiting its healthy fiscal surplus in order to revive the currently depressed state of Japanese domestic demand, the main reason for Japan's rising trade surplus. A further Japanese fiscal package, signalled yesterday and possibly an element in a G7 initiative to revive the world economy, is the best way for Tokyo and the Clinton administration to stall the US protectionist lobby. A by-product of such a package is likely to be a further appreciation of the yen against the D-Mark bloc currencies, and possibly against the dollar too. But the world economy will be a safer place if exchange rate movements occur as a consequence of sensible domestic policies, not instead of them. Lloyd Bentsen, it must be hoped, is in this respect no James Baker.</p>

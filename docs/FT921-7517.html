			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UN urges Israelis to end incursion: Bloody clashes in southern Lebanon prompt appeal by secretary-general THE secretary-general of the United Nations yesterday called on Israel to withdraw its forces immediately from the zone policed by UN peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon. The plea from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali came hours after Israeli armour pushed aside UN peacekeepers and fought bloody battles to occupy strategic hilltops beyond Israel's 'security zone' in Lebanon in a widening effort to wipe out Shia Moslem forces. The UN said Mr Boutros Ghali viewed the incursion with 'grave concern'. In Washington, the US State Department said it was worried by the 'renewed cycle of violence in southern Lebanon' and said it had sent urgent diplomatic messages to Israel, Syria and Lebanon. About 350 Israeli soldiers, backed by 17 tanks, bulldozers and helicopter gunships, seized the villages of Yater and Kafra in southern Lebanon where they blew up buildings and searched for rockets. Israeli leaders said the action was intended to stop Hizbollah firing its Katyusha rockets at Israel and its security zone. Guerrillas in southern Lebanon began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the assassination by Israeli forces on Sunday of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, leader of Hizbollah (Party of God). Military officials said about 100 rockets had been launched by yesterday evening. In their thrust to reach guerrilla forces, Israeli troops yesterday broke through barriers manned by soldiers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil). Unifil troops from Ireland, Finland, Fiji and Nepal erected a roadblock and grappled with Israeli soldiers in an attempt to halt the advance. But Israeli bulldozers and tanks smashed a path through. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in fighting, the fifth successive day of clashes between the two sides. Seven Lebanese militiamen and at least two civilians also died. Four UN soldiers from Fiji and a number of militiamen and Israelis were wounded. In Washington, Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokesman, said: 'We have made high-level demarches to those involved to urge the exercise of maximum restraint in order to bring the violence to an end. We have made those demarches to Israeli officials, Syrian officials and Lebanese officials.' Ms Tutwiler said the US had received assurances from all parties that they would arrive for a scheduled third round of Middle East peace talks due to open in Washington on Monday, in spite of the armoured Israeli thrust. At the UN, Mr Boutros Ghali ordered an official to summon Israel's UN ambassador to receive a protest note. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, said the troops would remain in their new positions for only a limited time. Israel launched a full-scale invasion of Lebanon in 1982 designed to wipe out Palestine Liberation Organisation guerrillas who had attacked Israel from Lebanese territory for several years. Since the army withdrew to the present security zone in 1985, ground forces have occasionally struck north against specific targets, but usually withdrawn in hours.

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Insurer acts against mis-selling Allied Dunbar, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, has changed the contracts of its 350 sales managers to encourage them to take greater responsibility for the activities of sales staff and cut down on possible mis-selling. From this month, instead of being mainly on commission, they will become salaried. Sales managers will also receive a bonus based on recruitment, retention and supervision of their staff. The change is to encourage managers to take greater care to ensure sales staff sell customers the appropriate products. During the past year the industry has been affected by controversy about possible large-scale mis-selling of financial products, especially pensions. New contracts of employment for managers give details about the amount of time they must spend supervising sales staff, most of whom are self-employed and will continue to be paid on commission. Each Allied Dunbar manager has responsibility for an area and is in charge of about 15 sales staff. There are just less than 4,000 sales staff. In the past managers' earnings have comprised commission calculated according to the sales of their staff, plus a small bonus. Now 60 per cent of their pay will be salary, with a bonus accounting for the rest. Under rules drawn up by Lautro, the industry regulator, companies have to adhere to specific training standards and supervise managers and sales staff to make sure customers are given the best advice about products. Allied Dunbar said it was unable to say whether the average pay of managers would change under the new system.</p>

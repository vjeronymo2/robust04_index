			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS TAKE ISSUE WITH FREEWAY LINK AS A SOLUTION  </P> <P> Perhaps Mr. Ristic has forgotten that the Pasadena Freeway, which ends on  Glenarm in Pasadena, cuts South Pasadena in two. Perhaps Mr. Ristic hasn't  noticed that South Pasadena is a very small town, and barely has enough room to  be cut in two, much less four parts. Perhaps Mr. Ristic hasn't noticed that  freeways haven't been moving very freely lately, and are probably not going to  be a long-term rapid transit solution.  </P> <P> CAROLE LEVENSON  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Complaints to adverts watchdog top 10,000 COMPLAINTS to the Advertising Standards Authority, the self-regulatory watchdog, passed 10,000 for the first time last year, although the number of advertisements complained about fell to 607 from 628 in 1990, according to the authority's annual report published yesterday. Of the 10,610 complaints about press and poster advertisements, 667 concerned Benetton, the Italian clothing company. All the complaints against Benetton were upheld, forming more than a quarter of the 2,416 complaints which the authority upheld. The Benetton advertisements which were the subject of complaints featured a new-born baby, and a white and a black child depicted as an angel and devil respectively. The report suggests that spurious claims that products are environmentally friendly are decreasing. Other findings included: Timeshare promotion advertising devices 'regrettably grew in popularity'. Complaints on matters of taste and decency doubled last year, due largely to Benetton's campaign. Complaints about the portrayal of women in advertising fell to 373 from 397 in 1990. The increased number of mail-order advertisements for food supplements and quasi-medicines, claims for which bear little relation to their effect, was 'the most disturbing growth area'.

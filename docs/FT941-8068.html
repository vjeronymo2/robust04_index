			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / O'Reilly moves to increase stake in Independent battle The battle for control of The Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers intensified last night as Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish publisher, moved to increase his stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the two titles. If successful, this move would make it unlikely that a rival consortium led by Mirror Group Newspapers could structure a deal satisfactory to all its members. It is the second time within weeks that the plans of the MGN-led consortium have been frustrated by Mr O'Reilly's group, Independent Newspapers of Ireland. It is expected that Mr O'Reilly, who yesterday morning held 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, will shortly be able to raise his stake to 29.99 per cent - just below the level that would trigger a full bid for the company. Independent Newspapers of Ireland was last night contacting institutional shareholders and offering 350p cash per share, conditional on approval from the Department of Trade and Industry, for the increase in its shareholding. A bid by the MGN consortium was earlier this month trumped within hours by Independent Newspapers of Ireland. On Sunday the consortium increased its offer in an effort to move its 48 per cent stake above the 50 per cent mark. It raised its bid from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a mixture of cash and MGN shares but, as the independent directors of Newspaper Publishing noted yesterday, the cash alternative has not been raised beyond 250p. The latest move means MGN itself could end up with a 20 per cent stake - in second place to Mr O'Reilly - compared with the nearly 40 per cent it originally envisaged. All parties to the battle are due to meet DTI officials today to discuss the future of Newspaper Publishing. The MGN consortium has asked Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to allow a takeover without a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry on the grounds that the newspapers are not economic as a going concern. Apart from MGN, the consortium includes El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and founders of the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the editor-in-chief. It has so far refused to co-operate with Mr O'Reilly's camp and he has been denied representation on the board. But this latest development will put pressure on the consortium to come to an arrangement with him. The independent directors of Newspaper Publishing, who are due to meet again tomorrow, held back yesterday from recommending to shareholders the increased bid from the MGN consortium. They said they welcomed the 'significant improvement' in the bid, but wanted to see further details of how the consortium planned to run the business. The directors are also waiting to see if Mr O'Reilly is prepared to make a full bid, which they have been urging him to do.</p>

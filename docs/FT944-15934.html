			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Revenue's mistake on loan relief I own my house but lodge during the week with my mother because her home is closer to my place of work. I return home at weekends, holidays etc. The Inland Revenue says I can nominate my own house as my 'main residence' for CGT purposes but will not allow me to claim loan interest relief on the mortgage (Miras) on the ground that I spend more time at my mother's address than at my own. Clearly, you are entitled to the benefit of Miras. When your tax inspector has looked at the judgment in Frost (Inspector of Taxes) v. Feltham, (1981) STC 115, he will undoubtedly apologise, put Miras into effect forthwith - and give you the tax relief due for past interest payments. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

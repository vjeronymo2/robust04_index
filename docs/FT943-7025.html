			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Senior Engineering edges ahead to Pounds 12.1m Shares in Senior Engineering Group yesterday fell 14 1/2 p to 123 1/2 p after the tubular products, ducting and thermal engineering company reported sluggish first half profits. Although turnover grew from Pounds 182m to Pounds 196m, disappointing performances by the construction services and thermal engineering divisions contributed to flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 11.4m) in the six months to June 30. Profits were also dented by a Pounds 634,000 loss on the disposal of two non-core subsidiaries - Senior Engineering (Pty) and Senior Phoenix RFS - which were sold for Pounds 1.75m earlier this year. Analysts, who had expected profits closer to Pounds 14m, said the falling share price reflected 'some shock' at the figures. Mr John Bell, chief executive, admitted some parts of the business had suffered from falling sales, but expressed surprise at the market reaction. 'I'm really quite amazed. Orders have been weak in our thermal and construction businesses, but that has been more than offset by the success of the engineered products division.' Rising sales at Flexonics, the group's flexible tubes business, fuelled a 74 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 8.16m (Pounds 4.68m) in the engineered products division. That performance was enhanced by a three month contribution from Metal Bellows and Berghofer, the two connector companies acquired for Pounds 18.6m earlier this year. Mr Bell underlined the importance of the division, which accounted for 62 per cent of the group's Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 11.9m) operating profits, by outlining plans to invest up to Pounds 28m in Flexonics over the next two years. He also warned that it would continue to outperform the thermal engineering and construction services divisions, which both lost sales. Profits in thermal engineering fell 23 per cent from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.84m as orders faltered in both Britain and North America. Construction services - dominated by air distribution systems - suffered from a shortage of larger contracts and saw profits drop to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 3.32m). Earnings per share were unchanged at 3.24p and the group declared an increased interim dividend of 1.3p (1.26p). COMMENT Senior's share price finally ran out of steam yesterday as 5.5m shares were traded. The short, sharp, shock dealt by the market may have been a bit harsh given the strength of its engineered products and the cyclical nature of the downturn in the other divisions. But if it persuades the management to use its Pounds 15.8m cash reserves to pursue new markets for thermal engineering and construction, rather than devote most of it to Flexonics, then it could serve as a useful warning. Full year profits are likely to exceed Pounds 28m, but on a forward multiple of 16.5 the shares look good value only as a long-term investment.</p>

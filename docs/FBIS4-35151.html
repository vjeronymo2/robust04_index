			<p>BFN     [Text] Iquitos, 15 Jun -- At his first stop upon returning  to Peru after an extensive tour of Asia and after having  participated in the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena,  Colombia, President Alberto Fujimori has announced that he will  review every file of the terrorists recently released by the  judicial branch.    He said: "I am worried that outstanding terrorists were  released by the courts. This reaffirms my belief that because  they are dangerous (the terrorists) they should be tried by  military courts, for the security of the country. I hope the  judicial branch acted in accordance with the law, and that it  did not release experienced and dangerous terrorists."    Fujimori added that he would study who they are and how they  were tried.    He said: "If they are dangerous, the appropriate mechanisms  will have to be found to correct this situation."    In another part of the news conference granted to the  reporters who travelled with the presidential delegation,  Fujimori reiterated his decision not to talk with ex-President  Alan Garcia, labeling such proposals "absurd."    He said: "I cannot conceive of any agreement with an  individual who destroyed the country. That can be completely  discarded. I have no idea what motivations lie behind it."    Regarding his participation in the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit, Fujimori said that in the opening session his concepts  about the effectiveness of democracy created discussion. He  reiterated that the goal of trying to balance the government  branches should not go to the extreme of an inner struggle that  would lead to the neutralization of either the executive,  legislative, or judicial branches.    Fujimori added: "Fortunately in Peru there is at least a  better coordination. The actions of the executive and  legislative branches are not neutralized, and the judicial  branch has greatly improved its task. Before 5 April 1992, 220  terrorists had been released, and now over 200 have been  sentenced to life imprisonment."    In this regard he agreed that certain aspects of the  Repentance Law should be improved, but he did not say how.</p>

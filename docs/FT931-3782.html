			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc under strain THE European exchange rate mechanism suffered new tensions again yesterday after the Portuguese escudo fell to a record low against the D-Mark, triggering a slide in the French franc, writes Gillian Tett. In early trading the escudo weakened to Es94.00 per D-Mark, down from its opening position of Es92.50 per D-Mark. The fall was triggered by the previous night's resignation of Mr Antonio Borges, the vice president of the Portuguese bank, and rumours that Mr Miguel Beleza, the governor might follow suit. However, heavy intervention by the bank, which purchased the escudo at Es93.50 per mark, and raised a key interest rate by 0.5 per cent, later arrested its fall. The currency finally closed around Es92.47. Many dealers continued to predict further falls, with some suggesting that if the Bundesbank did not lower German interest rates at its council meeting next Thursday, the Portuguese government could be forced to devalue by as much as 10 per cent. The strains on the escudo spilled over to other ERM currencies. 'It is yet another crack in the ERM, and the indirect effect of this has been to weaken the French franc,' explained Mr Michael Feeny, market analyst at Sumitomo Bank. The French franc weakened from an an opening position of DM3.397. Although the Bank of France was understood to have intervened heavily to prevent it falling through the DM3.4 benchmark, it closed in European trading at DM3.402. The Spanish peseta also fell slightly on the escudo's weakness, closing against the D-Mark at Pta 71.34, down from Pta 71.24. With uncertainty ahead of the French elections likely to raise the pressure on the franc, some dealers predicted that tensions over the ERM could grow next week. 'Next week is a pivotal week,' commented Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The dollar and D-Mark traded in a narrow band, with the dollar closing in Europe slightly up on the previous day. Although the political crisis in Russia continued to undermine the D-Mark, this was being partly offset by the tensions within the ERM itself, dealers said. Meanwhile the Swiss franc continued to make steady gains against the D-Mark, closing up at DM1.094. 'The Swiss franc has been the main beneficiary of the safe haven status in the Russian crisis,' said Mr Feeny. He pointed out that it had also benefited from the recent Italian turmoil, which has weakened the lira.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: German glass maker in profit Gerresheimer Glas, the German glass maker, said it swung to an operating profit of DM3m (Dollars 1.8m) in the first six months of the year to November 30, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf. Gerresheimer made a loss of DM47m during the same period last year. However, the company said it made a net loss in the current half year of DM7m, because of taxes on foreign units. Group sales in the six months were up 12 per cent to DM772m, largely because of the acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Kimble of the US.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROPOUT DARWINISM: SCHOOL COUNSELORS HELPING THE FITTEST, ABANDONING THE REST  </P> <P> The superintendent of an urban school system remarked, at a campus social  function, that a certain boy of considerable promise had dropped out on his  16th birthday. The superintendent was brought up short to hear a first-grade  teacher state emphatically, "No surprise to me."  </P> <P> She explained: "Oh, I can tell the signs. Ask any first- or second-grade  teacher; they'll be able to name all potential dropouts, and I swear if you put  those names in your safe and looked at them eight or nine years down the road,  you'd find we were right on target."  </P> <P> The national dropout rate is now about 25%; some troubled urban areas are much  higher -- a California state report last week put the Los Angeles dropout rate  at 39%.  </P> <P> No one knows for sure how many students stop attending school before they  receive a diploma for completing the required number of courses, but current  nationwide estimates put it as high as 50%. (Last week's California report, for  example, put the Los Angeles "attrition rate" at 56.4%, counting dropouts plus  students who move away or leave for other reasons.) And although students  aren't supposed to drop out before they reach their 16th birthday, clearly many  do.  </P> <P> One reason we know so little about dropouts has to do with school counseling  and college-guidance counselors. In most U.S. public secondary schools, only  those students planning to go to college are given serious guidance.  </P> <P> Vocational students, and all those who signal an interest in immediate job  placement after graduation, are generally guided not so much by counselors as  by their classroom faculty members.  </P> <P> But the student who "isn't making it" -- that youngster pegged by his  first-grade teacher as an academic failure -- is not being given any thoughtful  and consistent guidance in what to do when he or she leaves school.  </P> <P> Nor are dropouts encouraged to talk with guidance counselors during those first  few months, when they no longer are in school but haven't found a full-time job  or a mentor to help with the exigencies of full-time adulthood.  </P> <P> Since the cumulative record for potential dropouts begins to reflect  shortcomings in the primary grades, guidance counselors regularly cull through  their load to find those who are "college material," virtually ignoring the  rest, arguing that counseling them would be a waste of time.  </P> <P> Yet the truth is that in today's world, the high school student who least needs  guidance is the one bound for college. College-prep students already know a  host of people who have gone on to college, and from them they can get an  enormous amount of good advice and guidance.  </P> <P> Most school dropouts have no idea what to do next, or how to do it. They have  neither the academic nor vocational skills to be attractive to employers. Most  lack financial resources and don't know how to get credit. When they do get a  paying job, they have had no training in handling funds to their economic  advantage.  </P> <P> Dropouts, almost by definition, will have to find entry-level jobs, many of  them part-time. Because they are dropouts, they have yet to learn many lifelong  lessons, such as consistency, persistence, inherent self-worth -- the job of  learning, the satisfaction of succeeding.  </P> <P> College bound young people, on the other hand, not only have guidance  counselors helping families work out financial support "packages" while in  post-secondary schooling, but, once at a college, again have counselors  assigned to help financially, socially, academically.  </P> <P> What we have, then, is a system that gives the most highly educated students  the most counseling and struggling ones the least.  </P> <P> Now that's a curious way to treat half the youngsters in our nation. In fact,  it's a national shame. We pay for it in record numbers of young adults  suffering alcohol and drug abuse, in frightening amounts of street violence and  tyranny, and in a serious breakdown in family structures. We will soon be a  "democracy" where more than half of those eligible never vote -- with the  highest percentage of non-voters at the youngest ages.  </P> <P> Can the United States afford to waste this proportion of young citizens?  Business has recently become aware of the problem -- and of the need for  thoughtful, honest, educated citizens. Millions of dollars are being spent on  employees for basic literacy training.  </P> <P> There's no guarantee that providing good guidance counselors for potential  dropouts, rather than lavishing it on the college-bound students, will lower  crime rates, stabilize family structures or lift the general economy overnight.  But as a person who has spent years wrestling with the problem, I am sure that  providing guidance counselors for students who get the poorest grades and skip  the most classes -- helping them with guidance, say, until they are 20 years  old -- would ease that period of transition from full-time adolescence to  full-time adulthood.  </P> <P> A new breed of counselors is needed -- men and women who love and understand  those struggling academically, who know the local community and its entry-level  job openings, men and women who know which social and civic agencies stand  ready to lend a hand to meet each dropout's special needs. And high schools  must welcome back, for counseling, those students who failed to get diplomas.  </P> <P> I recently asked 200 school principals attending a Harvard conference if they  agreed that, nationwide, we fail to give an adequate education to nearly half  the children attending our schools.  </P> <P> They did. I then asked if they agreed that the way we administer our schools --  offering virtually no guidance for school dropouts -- contributed to the  grievous fact that 50% of the nation's children fail to finish high school.  </P> <P> The hands rose -- reluctantly and humbly -- in timorous agreement. It wasn't a  fair question -- many of the principals could boast of guiding and teaching  nearly 100% of their students. But in a nation with more than 12.4 million  students in public school grades 9-12, there are only 68,500 counselors --  about 1 for every 181 students.  </P> <P> Most of those 68,500 counselors are working with youngsters who need help the  least.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Sergey Zhdakayev: "Mine Strikes </F> Advantageous...to the Government?"]    [Text]  <H5>  We Want To Work, but Not for Free </H5>   Tula--Eighty shaftmen from the Beltsevskaya mine refused to  come to the surface. As a sign of protest against detention of  pay.    "This is not a strike," stated trade union leader Sofya  Sirotina in clarifying the position of the miners. "It is an act  of protest. We want to work, but not for free. They have not  paid us since December."    Contrary to directives, but in accordance with her trade  union duties, Sofya Vasilyevna descended to the mine drift with  the workers and sat five days underground while the management  tried to find money.    "If today they find the money for Beltsevskaya," stated  Leonid Zavodchikov, general director of the Tulaugol  association, in predicting the possible development of events,  "tomorrow the entire basin will 'stand down.' The budget owes us  38 billion, but the government is not even thinking about  settling with us."    Leonid Vasilyevich's prediction partially came true. When  the  December-January pay made its way from the bank to Beltsevskaya,  the Zapadnaya mine went on strike. Mostovskaya and Progress  joined in the next day.    Responding to the question of what demands were being made  by  the miners, V. Terekhov, chairman of the trade union of  Zapadnaya mine, stated that the demands were not yet formulated  and a strike committee had not even been organized. The strike  took place spontaneously. The main demand was wages. But  rejoinders are already resounding on early presidential  elections and resignation of the government.  <H5>  Existence Determines Consciousness </H5>   In the opinion of L. Popov, chairman of the territorial  committee of the trade union of Tulaugol association coal  miners, the degree of readiness for a strike is determined by  many factors, and the issue of wages does not always play the  decisive role among them.    Vorkuta mine workers can obtain food products only from the  store. But in the Moscow area, the miners have garden plots, and  so obtain potatoes, vegetables, often pork. This substantially  alters views on conducting strikes. "Some are prepared to strike  today," L. Popov states. "About 30 percent are in this category.  Others promise: 'We will support you.' Then there are those who  say: 'We have not yet determined our position.' And still others  see no sense in any of this. At least now there is something to  demand. But when we just strike the time away, there is nothing  to get out of it. The Lipkovskaya mine, for example, has  consistently avoided strikes all these years."    Even within the framework of one collective there is  divergence of opinion. One example from the plans division of  the Zapadnaya mine: Underground equipment operator D. Shreyder  writes up a petition every time--"I request that the  administration guarantee me work, since I do not wish to  strike." It turns out that one of Shreyder's division coworkers  sympathizes with him. Another, on the contrary, supports the  strikers, believing that necessity has pushed them to this point.  <H5>  A Tool for Burying Money </H5>   L. Zavodchikov attests that there are mines in the Tulaugol  combine that are subsidized to the extent of 98-100 percent by  the state, i.e., they operate for themselves alone. Hundreds of  people go underground, hack their way through the seam, ingest  the dust, and move coal to the surface which then undergoes  combustion to heat up their own mine shafts. An ideal tool for  burying the taxpayer's money.    Nor are the ordinary mines, those that are "average"  according to indices, enriching the country. At Zapadnaya, for  example, 1,246 people are supposed to extract (according to the  plan) 786 tonnes per day, but they actually extract 270 tonnes.  In this regard, the production cost of a tonne of coal is around  40,000 rubles [R], while the selling price is R9,000. For the  combine in general, over 80 percent of the coal production is  subsidized by the state. "In fact, we are budget workers," L.  Zavodchikov admits.    In other words, the coal sector is the operator's  locomotive,  which collides by inertia with the financial stability of the  state. In this manner, assertions that mine workers "make their  living at the expense of the old people" are doubly justified.  And this is where one sees dramatic theater in the coal  industry. It is just that in one instance the old people are  real, and in another--abstract.    Paradoxical as it may seem, today strikes conducted by the  miners are advantageous to the government. The less the miners  work, the less is the detriment to the budget. And judging from  all appearances, the government is aware of this.  <H5>  There Will Be No Easy Decisions </H5>   The ineffectiveness of strikes will hardly force miners to  abandon fighting for their rights. "The mood is very bad,"  asserts V. Terekhov, chairman of the trade union of Zapadnaya  mine workers. "People are prepared to resort to the most extreme  forms of opposition."    And so, the respite the government has received will hardly  be long. And its choices are not great.    The best alternative would be to part from the miners in  civilized fashion, i.e., close down mines that are especially  unprofitable, pay compensation, retrain the people, and create  new job positions. It is this path that is envisaged by the  state program for readjustment of the coal industry developed by  the government.    This path has only one shortcoming--it is too expensive.  According to Popov's assessments, shutting down even a small  mine would require R36 billion. And when you take into account  the fact that this applies to over half the mines in the  Tulaugol combine, it then becomes "more advantageous for the  state not to shut them down, but just let them quietly keep  operating."    Unfortunately, this "inexpensive alternative" also has its  defects. First of all, it does not solve the problem--it  postpones resolution. Secondly, it is not really that  inexpensive. For normal operation of the sector, L. Popov  believes, you need R11.6 trillion. But the new budget has put up  R5.6 trillion.    The difference between these figures constitutes the main  topic of dispute today between government leaders, on the one  hand, and the sector lobbies and trade unions, on the other.    In the event the sector lobby is victorious, the black hole  in the economy into which trillions are being poured will be  preserved. But if the budget prevails, mines will start being  shut down. With all the consequences this entails. There is no  painless resolution here, but there is a choice between  reassuring and hopeless prospects.</p>

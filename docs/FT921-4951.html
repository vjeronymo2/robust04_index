			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities upset by political concerns POLITICAL and economic factors returned to centre stage in the London stock market yesterday, competing with the flow of corporate results for the attention of investment fund managers. An opinion poll, unconfirmed but clearly leaked in the UK press, indicated a five point lead for the Labour opposition party in key marginal electoral constituencies, and set the background for a weak stock market. Equally disturbing was a fall in sterling and in UK government bonds, both challenging confidence in prospects for the cut in base rates which has been virtually built in to stock market calculations. The market opened lower, with confidence additionally bruised by the 21 point fall in the Dow Industrial Average overnight, and soon began to follow the downward trend of other European bourses. At the day's low point, the FT-SE Index was 23.5 down at 2,534.9 but London steadied when Wall Street cut its loss to 1.57 early in the new session. The final reading showed the FT-SE at 2,538.3, down 20.1. Trading volume remained high, boosted by completion of the trading programme which surfaced at the close of the previous session, and also by a handful of large corporate trades. The trend was established early when Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, followed up the deals reported late on Wednesday by announcing that it was operating the authorised purchase of up to 33.6m shares. The company reporting list was again heavy and, on balance, favourable to the market's confidence. Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group, supported the recent trend by maintaining its dividend payment in spite of a heavy fall in profits. Results from Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, were also well taken in the market. But the mood of the equity sector sounded less than happy as strategists weighed up the outlook ahead of the budget speech on Tuesday and the UK general election expected to follow soon after. Government bonds, a full point off on Wednesday, shed a further half point at one stage yesterday as investors continued to shy away from warnings regarding the level of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. Pharmaceutical stocks, which exert considerable influence on the Footsie, looked steadier at first as the sector tried to rally from its weakness on Wall Street. But by the close, most of the leading names were easier, and the sector lacked the support from the US which will be needed for a genuine recovery in London. Wellcome, however, continued to stabilise after the setback provoked by the Foundation's decision substantially to reduce its stake in the equity. The bout of nerves surrounding base rate hopes showed itself in a round of losses among store and similar consumer issues, whose fortunes are closely linked with hopes that a revival in consumer spending will lead the way out of recession in the UK. Seaq volume increased sharply to 608.4m shares from 530.5m in the previous session. Wednesday's retail, or customer-originated, business was worth Pounds 1.2bn, once again indicating a return to healthier trading levels in the London equity market. Trading volumes have increased significantly in the past two sessions, both featured by weaker share prices.</p>

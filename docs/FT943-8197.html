			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rea Brothers declines after losses on bonds Bond portfolio losses of Pounds 854,000 hit Rea Brothers, the private banking group which yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 621,000, down from Pounds 802,000. However, the group recorded strong growth in income from corporate finance, trust and fund management operations, and showed confidence in its core activities by proposing a 0.2p increase in the interim dividend to 0.5p. Dealing contributions turned from a Pounds 500,000 profit to a Pounds 736,000 loss for the six months to June 30, reflecting the provisions against its Pounds 7m fixed interest securities portfolio. The losses were flagged in a profits warning last June, but the overall results were better than expected and the share price rose 3p to 66p. Sir John Hill, chairman, said Rea had now 'substantially hedged' its portfolio following the impact of a drop in bond prices of more than 10 per cent earlier this year. He said the group was confident that such provisions would not recur. Fee income rose by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 5.52m, reflecting an upswing in corporate finance activity, including Hobson's purchase of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's food manufacturing business. The fund management division increased funds under its control by 7 per cent, in spite of declining equity markets, while the trust division reported a 17 per cent increase in gross income. However, there was a fall in interest income from the banking division to Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 1.91m), reflecting the competitive market for deposits. The company has settled legal proceedings against a defunct Rea Brothers pension scheme for an undisclosed figure, which was within provisions of Pounds 300,000 for its settlement made in 1993. Earnings per share amounted to 1.13p (1.42p).</p>

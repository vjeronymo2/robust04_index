			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Major's second manifesto It is not so much a Budget, more Mr John Major's second election manifesto in a year. Rather like President Clinton in the US, the prime minister and his chancellor have collected every marketable proposal that a posse of policy wonks could think up and put the resulting list of items forward as a strategy for growth without inflation, a deficit-reduction plan that causes no obvious or at any rate immediate outstanding pain (except, marginally, to high earners), a road map for the coming three years. Running down its centre is a broad highway. The direction arrow contains the simple words 'general election 1996'. Taken as a whole it will do what all manifestos do. It will initially befuddle the electorate. There was so much unnecessary detail in Mr Norman Lamont's inordinately long and at times soporific speech in the Commons yesterday that only the prime minister, whose personality this Treasury-driven peroration suited to a T, could possibly have enjoyed the occasion. I except the one good joke, at the expense of my trade, which was when Mr Lamont expressed doubt as to whether 'sewerage and newspapers' were 'clearly among the most basic necessities of life'. Touche. Considered in bits the Budget he read out should satisfy several constituencies. There is plenty of material for Mr Major to draw upon whether or not he actually remounts his election soapbox when he asks his backbenchers, his party and the country to accept for a second time that he is the prime minister of their choice. For although he does not have to face the polls for another three or four years, he badly needs to regain his authority before that. The government's offering to the City is 'grip' - a stated and barely credible determination to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement in stages over the coming few years. In this Mr Major has an advantage over President Clinton. His chancellor can put forward a finance bill this year that will provide for all the increases in taxation promised for next year and the year after and be reasonably sure that the bill will be passed. In the US, where a new energy tax is central to the administration's plans, there can be no such certainty. Just a minute. Mr Major himself cannot be sure that his chancellor's extension of VAT to domestic fuel and power will be well received by the Commons. During the coming few weeks the Tory coal lobby will be asked to swallow its disappointment at the number of pits to be saved. It may be a bit tricky to get it to accept an impost that will discourage the use of all fuels after April 1994. Perhaps that is why one of the government's little birds whispered to me the other day that the prime minister had asked the cabinet to go easy on the Maastricht rebels. Their votes would be needed, Birdie said then, for coal closures and for any Budget measures that might prove awkward. We must, however, wish the chancellor well on this. It is, a decent offering to the green lobby, and one for which all who value the environment should be grateful. Mr Major's commitment at the Rio conference last year to reductions of CO by the turn of the century is being three-quarters met. Mr Lamont will have known that such would be his master's wish. The only spoiler is that VAT on insulation materials was not simultaneously zero-rated. The chancellor will be hoping for other kind comments today. Safe. Fiscally prudent. Stimulating. A Budget for the little people. A Budget for jobs. A Budget for small businesses, for the regeneration of industry, for the reduction of the deficit, for the greater glory of Britain. Good old Norman. He played to the Europhobic gallery. The cheers following the few passages in which he attacked the European Community must have been music to the chancellor's ears last night. But will they still love him in the morning? This depends upon events beyond the government's control. Mr Lamont set out a list of measures designed to help the long-term unemployed. The total expenditure - Pounds 230m - and the total number of expected beneficiaries - 100,000 - is derisory even at first sight. The number of people out of work is 3m and rising. The long-term contingent is a third of that. This is seed money, little scatterings here and there. It is reminiscent of Mr Clinton's packages for the inner cities. It shows good intent, but will in itself do little to alleviate the fear in the hearts of many families that one of theirs will lose a job, or fail to find one. The business measures should be welcome to those they benefit - small entrepreneurs, house builders, companies hurt by advance corporation tax, exporters. They too are, mostly, little alleviations, helpful in themselves, but as nothing to the effect of, say, a return to an annual rate of growth in gross national product of 2 to 3 per cent. There is nothing particularly strong or unexpected in the changes in excise duty. Even the 10 per cent increase in the price of petrol, coupled with a pledge to keep up the pressure in later years, should provoke only ritual howls of outrage from the motorists' organisations. We all know that we should use our cars less, or, at least buy fuel-efficient models. The changes in company car taxation will encourage this. Some of the extra taxes announced yesterday may reasonably enough be derided by Labour as betrayals, in the spirit if not the letter, of promises made during last April's election campaign. The increase in national insurance contributions is an outstanding example. Mr Major showed during question time yesterday that he knows he will have to trade punches on this with the leader of the Labour party. More to the point, the prime minister has an ace up his chancellor's sleeve: a promise of an annual widening of the 20 per cent tax band. This gives verisimilitude to the Tories' commitment to bring the basic rate of personal income tax down to that level. That pledge is one the government in general and the prime minister in particular take very seriously. As Mr Lamont came to the paragraph about the 20 per cent band yesterday my mind flashed back to last year's campaign, in which Mr Major spread his hands ever wider to demonstrate that that was what the government intended to do. It is clearly a marker for the next election. Cutting taxes for all lower-paid workers is still regarded as an election winner, even though the new bands add peanuts to their incomes, and take a larger number of peanuts away through non-indexation of allowances and the increases in national insurance. In short, the Budget is a campaign manager's handbook. It enables Mr Major to engage the electorate in a fresh dialogue, in the manner of Mr Clinton. Mr Lamont may attempt the same exercise. Over the coming weeks, he plainly intends to. This is understandable. He would like to keep his job. His speech yesterday sewed up the November Budget and most of the following two. But Mr Lamont's tenure on his office depends upon forthcoming speeches - upon how he performs during Mr Major's summer campaign for the reassertion of the prime minister's own leadership. They could both be saved, if the economy revives and floats them out of danger. But that is up to fate, a force greater than any Budget.</p>

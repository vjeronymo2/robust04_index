			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Golhan Mehmet by Muwaffaq </F> Madani in Ankara; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Madani] How do you view the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Mehmet] First, I would like to express our satisfaction  with  the NATO attack on the Serb positions. Turkey asked the  international circles and the United Nations to interfere two  years ago because it is impermissible for a country to occupy  the territories of another country. The United Nations and NATO  charters stipulate this. Aggressors have to be punished.    Turkey has recognized the four countries that seceded from  old Yugoslavia, but the Serbs are attacking Bosnia. We are  ready to help and have told the international circles that if  your problem is a material one, then we are ready to pay our  dues, and if the problem is the formation of an army, then we  are ready for that, too.    Tens of thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands  have been made refugees. Blood is being shed in Bosnia, and it  is Muslim blood. Emotional ties bind us to them and the blood  being shed is ultimately the blood of human beings, regardless  of their race.    An agreement was reached to withdraw the Serb artillery  adjacent to Bosnia [as published] and this was done. But then  they attacked another city and NATO was forced to attack their  positions. We believe that this decision has come very late.    Anyhow, despite the tardiness of the decision, we still  believe that it was the right one. Several decisions were made  in the past but the Serbs did not abide by them and occupied  Bosnian territories. The United Nations would have lost a lot  if the Serbs had not faced this operation. The implementation  of the UN decision has restored its credibility.    The Turkish Republic was established in 1923, and we have  yearned for peace to prevail all over the world since then. We  sent our army to Korea to maintain world peace on the basis of  this principle. We sent Turkish troops to Somalia last year,  where many soldiers were martyred. But our objective has always  been to help bring about world peace.    We will send Turkish forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina in  implementation of the UN resolutions with the objective of  achieving world peace.    [Madani] Do you believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina will  collapse  if this international intervention does not take place?    [Mehmet] This collapse will, of course, happen if this war  continues. Therefore, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be  stopped immediately. Bosnians and Serbs are bound by ties of  kinship and they have lived for many years under the Yugoslav  regime. Why don't they live in peace now?    [Madani] Has Turkey taken into consideration the possibility  of intervening militarily on its own in this crisis if the  conflict in Bosnia continues?    [Mehmet] We do not attack anyone and have no ambitions in  anyone's territories. We are only defending ourselves. It is  known that Turkey is the strongest country in the Middle East  from military and other aspects. But we use this strength to  deter those who try to attack us or other peaceful countries.    I insist that Turkey has no ambitions in other countries'  territories. I hope that we will have relations of brotherhood  and good neighborliness, especially with our neighboring  countries.    We want peace to prevail in the entire world. We have  welcomed and felt relieved by the agreement concluded between  the Palestinians and the Israelis. We also were much distressed  by what the Israelis did to worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  because it delayed the peace process. Why should there be such  bloodshed? There is plenty of room in the world for all of us,  so why have war when we can live in peace and security? It is  enough for the people to safeguard their territory and laws and  abide by them.    [Madani] Why has Germany refrained from supplying you with  weapons?    [Mehmet] There is a problem of terrorism in eastern  Anatolia.  Turkey has been facing this terrorism for 10 years. So far, the  terrorists have killed approximately 3,300 people in that area,  including 3,000 Turks of Kurdish origin. The Workers Party of  Kurdistan [PKK] is launching a propaganda campaign in Western  Europe saying that they are unjustly treated by Turkey. They  have set up approximately 100 organizations to promote this  propaganda in Germany alone. Using money and other methods they  have influenced the German media until they have managed to  instill in the mind of Germans that there is a minority problem  in Turkey. But there is no minority problem in Turkey because  99 percent of Turks are Muslims. Approximately 29 minorities  speak their own languages in the country. We are all  first-class citizens. For instance, Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin is of Kurdish origin. The prime minister's adviser is  also a Kurd. There is no distinction between Kurds and Turks in  Turkey. Former President Ozal was of Kurdish origin, too. In  the current parliament there are 100 Kurdish deputies. I, for  instance, am a Caucasian [Qafqas], and our friend [not further  identified] is from Georgia. We all live in the Turkish  homeland. But the propaganda in Germany speaks of injustice.  How, for God's sake, could a country oppress its own people?  They also said that we use their weapons against the PKK and  asked us not to use them. For our part, we have honored the  terms of the arms agreement concluded with Germany; namely, that  we do not use their weapons against the Kurds. We do not need  their weapons. We have obtained from the Germans 5 billion  marks' worth of weapons and paid them for the arms. I say that  we do not need the German weapons because there are plenty of  weapons on the world market; in Russia and elsewhere.  Approximately 200 German journalists have visited the eastern  part of Turkey. They were expecting riots during the recent  local elections, but there were no riots. We use Russian  weapons that are similar to German weapons. So they thought we  were using their weapons, which is not true. They misunderstood.    [Madani] Is there a possibility for a cease-fire between  you and the Kurds so that a dialogue to achieve genuine peace in  eastern Turkey can begin?    [Mehmet] Not at all. I do not sit with terrorists and  highway bandits. I cannot think of it. Their problem will be  over this year. How can we talk to those who kill children and  smuggle hashish and weapons? How can we sit with those  terrorists at the negotiating table?    At some point in time, they were in your country, in  Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley. Now they are divided in al-Biqa',  Syria, and Iraq. There is no way out of this. I feel sad for  those among them who are killed in battles who are only between  15 and 20 years old. I feel very sad for those children whose  beards have not appeared yet.    There is no complete solution to this problem other than  death. Therefore, we call on them to surrender their weapons to  save their lives. Between 10 and 20 of these young men die  every day. I feel sorry for them; after all, they are human  beings. No country in the whole world has ever surrendered to  terrorism. Strong Turkey, with its 60 million people and its  strong Army, will not give in to 10,000 terrorists.    [Madani] Does the growth of the Islamic trend, represented  by  the Welfare Party, constitute a threat to your ruling regime?    [Mehmet] They won the votes of the angry people. We entered  those local elections at the hardest of times. I say in the  name of my party, the True Path Party, that media and senior  businessmen opposed our party because we raised taxes. In  elections, more taxes mean lower votes.    The economic hardship and the rise in the value of the  dollar  before the elections made it easy for the opposition to attack  us. The whole opposition joined its forces against us. It is  known that Turkey has 14 parties. Despite all these  circumstances, we came first in the elections. The voters did  try the Welfare Party before, when they withheld their votes  from the Motherland Party because they were angry with the  government. But this lasted for only a short period, and I  believe the current situation will end soon because it will be  difficult for the hardship to continue.    [Madani] Some say that Turkey is facing the threat of the  Islamic trend and that you are heading toward a difficult  situation parallel to what is happening in Algeria.    [Mehmet] Turkey is not Algeria or any other country.  Extremists are found all over the world, not only in Turkey.  There are left-wing extremists as well as right-wing  extremists. But the majority of the Turkish people are  moderates.</p>

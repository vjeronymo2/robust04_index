			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Hungarian nationalists to form breakaway party HUNGARIAN nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka are expected to form a breakaway far-right party after being expelled formally from the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum at the weekend. Within the Forum, Mr Csurka has already built up the Hungarian Justice parliamentary platform and the Hungarian Way mass movement. Now he is expected to fuse these into a formal political party. The nationalist leader can hope to take about half the 29 MPs of Hungarian Justice with him, leaving Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate prime minister, with a fragile parliamentary majority. Mr Csurka, an author, is regarded as the spiritual father of the Forum. He also commands the passionate support of many party activists. The weekend's defections threaten to weaken the Forum's grassroots campaign to retain power in the general to elections to be held before next spring. Aides of the prime minister expect to limit the far-right share of the vote to less than 10 per cent. Poor turnout at last Friday's demonstration for the return of Hungarian territory lost after the first world war suggest there is little support for extreme nationalism. Government officials also believe that the support they lose on the right can be regained in the centre and that the expulsion of Mr Csurka makes it easier for the Forum to find new coalition allies. The Forum government can also begin to erase the international embarrassment suffered through association with Mr Csurka ever since last August when the author published a controversial nationalist manifesto.</p>

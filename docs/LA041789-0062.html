			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GROWTH TREATMENT TESTED  </P> <P> A new approach to treating children with growth disorders caused by  insufficient production of human growth hormone is being successfully tested  clinically, according to chemist Arthur Felix of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. in  Nutley, N.J. Such children are now treated with hormone produced in bacteria  through genetic engineering techniques, but the relatively expensive protein  must be used in fairly large amounts and must be injected three times a week.  </P> <P> Hoffmann-La Roche has been working with a different protein, called growth  hormone releasing factor, that was discovered in 1982 by researchers at the  Salk Institute in La Jolla.  </P> <P> The releasing factor, about a quarter the size of the growth hormone, is  produced in the hypothalamus gland and stimulates production of several forms  of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. It can be used in much smaller  quantities than the hormone and, because it is a much smaller protein, can be  administered through a skin patch rather than by injection. He predicted that  the hormone could be used on 10,000 children in the United States.  </P> <P> Felix and his colleagues have developed a derivative of the releasing factor  that is smaller still and that appears especially effective in animals.  Research in cows and pigs has shown that it increases milk production and the  efficiency with which feed is converted into muscle, while making the animals  leaner.  </P></p>

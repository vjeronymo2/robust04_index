			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hidden Truths" column by Tomas Cabal: "Questions </F> Arise Regarding Origin of Perez Balladares' Fortune"]    [Text] PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] candidate  Ernesto Perez Balladares up until now has evaded serious  questioning regarding the origin of his vast fortune.  Protecting himself under the so-called Santa Maria Agreement  [Pacto de Santa Maria] and a strategy designed by his advisers,  "Toro" [Perez Balladares] has avoided all forums in which his  performance as a government official could be scrutinized by  people who know the inside of the mistakenly labelled  "revolutionary process."    Recently, the PRD candidate refused to accept an invitation  from the daily LA PRENSA by arguing that media was not  "impartial." Sources close to the candidate point out that  "Toro" knows his role as a minister and a government official of  the military will not stand up to serious analysis or  questioning. Other sources who know the details of the vast  fortune controlled by Perez Balladares appear surprised that the  other candidates have not even bothered to question the origin  of the PRD candidate's assets and riches.    Former officials of the military regime indicate that the  funds to install the television station controlled by Perez  Balladares and his associates were supplied on direct orders  from Omar Torrijos. Upon Torrijos' death, the balance of the  funds required for the station to operate was handed over by  Panama Defense Forces [PDF] staff members, according to the  source. Meanwhile, Perez Balladares and his running mates have  been effective in criticizing the current government's  inefficiency and corruption.    With Guillermo Endara in the Presidency surrounded by a  number of individuals who profited under the umbrella of the  military garrisons, the PRD campaign has been relatively easy.  No one can deny that this government has been a complete  failure. This fact, together with the Torrijist myth that  "everything was better" in the past, facilitates "Toro" and his  followers' election propaganda.    We are certain that the Panamanian people have not forgotten  the dictatorship's excesses. Nevertheless, it is also obvious  that many lower income Panamanians long for the times of "cash  favors and petty gains" [salve y rebuscas]. PRD members have  been effective in presenting the military government as a period  of economic bonanza where everyone had hopes of "meeting the  family's basic needs."    For a people battered by hunger, malnutrition, unemployment,  insecurity, and poverty, this is a powerful message being  successfully exploited by the PRD. The PRD has conveniently  forgotten the $962-million loss at the National Bank; the  world's largest per-capita foreign debt; and the embezzlements  in the Social Security Fund, the National Savings Bank, and  other state institutions.    The PRD, its founders, and representatives were accomplices  of robbery and theft. Mr. Perez Balladares, as well as many of  his followers, cannot explain the origins of their fortunes.    "Toro" and his running mates are all members of a "native  aristocracy" that did not hesitate to surrender and sell out to  the military. Perez Balladares and the other "hand picked"  officials who worked for the military have no right to talk  about or criticize the democratic government's inefficiency.  They and the majority of their followers profited from and  exploited the Panamanian people during 21 years of military  dictatorship.    With Noriega in jail and Torrijos in hell, it is easy for  PRD  members to sidestep the truth by not replying to awkward  questions related to their political and business activities.  These activities must be brought into the open during this  political campaign.    The thefts and arrogance that characterized the PRD  administration will be repeated if they gain power again. It is  then time to question in detail Mr. Perez Balladares on the  origin of his vast fortune. The questioning should take place  in public forums and through campaign propaganda to determine  whether he can respond and convince the voters that he has made  his fortune through honest work.    It is said that the people choose the leaders they deserve.  If we accept the results of the latest polls, it appears we are  going downhill, repeating the errors of the past by electing  pirates and privateers whose sole goal is "Everything for our  own personal gain," ["Todo por la papa," play on words on the  former PDF slogan "Todo por la patria" -- "Everything for the  fatherland."]</p>

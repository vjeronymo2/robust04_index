			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / People: In Detention UK Detention Services, the private prison company that last week attracted Michael Quinlan, 51, former director of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons, to its board, is strengthening its management with a second US appointment. LT (by which he is known) Brown is to become director of operations for UK Detention Services, which manages Blakenhurst Prison, Redditch. After 22 years in the US public prison service, Brown joined Corrections Corporation of America, a US private prison operator, in 1988. CCA is, with John Mowlem and Sir Robert McAlpine, a partner in UK Detention Services. David Brooke, who joined UK Detention Services as director of Blakenhurst this year, is to become director of business development. He has a long career in the British public prison system, including serving as governor of Wormwood Scrubs, London, and on HM Inspectorate of Prisons. The new director of Blakenhurst will be Bernard Higgins, who spent 14 years as a governor in the British public prison service before joining UK Detention Services. Although there are currently only two privately run prisons, the government is committed to extending private management to about 10 per cent of the system. Potential private sector operators are strengthening their management teams with experienced recruits from the public sector and overseas.</p>

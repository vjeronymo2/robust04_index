			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: LVMH net climbs 35% as luxury goods sales recover The buoyant state of the luxury goods market was highlighted yesterday by news that LVMH, one of the largest businesses in the sector, increased net profits by 35 per cent during the first half of 1994.

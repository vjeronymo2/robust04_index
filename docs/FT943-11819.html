			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Transatlantic Reuters advances 14% Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news group, underlined its international credentials yesterday by crossing the Atlantic to report a 14 per cent increase in interim profits. The UK-based group presented its results for the six months to June 30 in New York, where about a third of its equity is listed as American Depositary Receipts. Analysts and journalists in London participated by satellite in the presentation. Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said this use of technology provided a 'truly level playing field' - information was released in London and New York at the same time, and questioners were able to judge the demeanour of executives. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 245m on revenue which increased 22 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn. The revenue figure contained Pounds 55m from acquisitions, including Quotron, the US-based equity trading service, and Teknekron, which supplies digital trading systems to banks. Excluding acquisitions, revenue rose 16 per cent. Reuters said it paid net cash of Pounds 102m for the acquisitions, but confirmed it could receive up to Dollars 100m to cover Quotron's continuing losses, until 1996, from its vendor, the US bank Citicorp. Mr Job said Quotron would retain about 37,000 screens and was on target to be profitable by 1996. Instinet, the US-based equity brokerage service, and Thamesway, the institutional broker which Reuters bought in November, more than doubled profits to Pounds 26m. Mr Job said: 'We experienced record levels of new orders in the first half, reflecting generally favourable business conditions. Following the corrections in the bonds and equities markets, we saw lower levels of new orders in May and June but they were comfortably ahead of last year.' Europe and the Americas generated strong growth with Asia held back by a lacklustre Japan. Emerging markets continued to flourish. Mr Job played down Globex, the group's loss-making venture into electronic futures trading, which has recently been rejected by London and one of the Chicago exchanges. He accepted the group could have spent about Dollars 100m to date on the project, but emphasised the financial impact would be much less - even if it were closed. The group's operating margin declined slightly, from 20.6 per cent to 20 per cent, mainly because of acquisitions and new investment programmes. Mr Job acknowledged 'a depressant effect (on margins) from going into other markets, which we intend to do. We have no particular ambition to improve the margin, because it's pretty high at the moment.' Net cash fell from Pounds 450m to Pounds 428m. Earnings per share grew 21 per cent to 10.4p (8.6p), boosted by last year's Pounds 351m buy-back of shares. The interim dividend rose 23 per cent to 1.9p (1.55p). Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons easier Disappointing figures from Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, prompted a general downgrading of forecasts and pushed the shares 6 1/2 lower to 170 1/2 p. The company announced a first-half profit of Pounds 42.3m, at the lower end of the range of forecasts. It also warned that profits from its instrument arm were likely to 'fall significantly short of last year's'. Lehman Brothers came down to Pounds 105m for this year from Pounds 130m previously. Hoare Govett cut its full-year estimate by Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 109m and the figure for next year by Pounds 33.5m to Pounds 127m, but argued that the yield of 6.4 per cent was attractive.</p>

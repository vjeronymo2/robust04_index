			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Consortium meets to agree Argentina-Chile gas pipe - Construction expected to start this year A GROUP of Chilean, Spanish and Italian companies will meet Argentine natural gas producers this week to finalise the supply contracts for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) trans-Andean gas pipeline that will export gas from Argentina to Chile. The consortium - formed by Chilectra and ENAP of Chile, Italgas and SNAM of Italy, and Gas Natural and Enagas of Spain - wants to tap the natural gas fields in southern Argentina. It will then transport gas across the Andes, along a 1,200-km pipeline to Santiago, the Chilean capital. The pipeline is the biggest infrastructure project between neighbouring countries in Latin America since the international debt crisis of the 1980s put a halt to ambitious schemes of what were then military governments in the region. Pre-feasibility studies for the pipeline have been completed and the consortium has retained Chase Manhattan Bank of the US to act as adviser for the financing of the project. Construction work is expected to begin this year, with completion scheduled for early-1996. 'The pipeline makes economic sense for the two countries,' says Mr Brian O'Neill, Chase Manhattan's senior vice-president for corporate finance. 'Argentina is in a strong position to become an energy exporter, while Chile clearly needs to burn cleaner fuels,' he said. Chilean energy officials back the project as a means to convert industry, buses, taxis and other fleets of vehicles to compressed natural gas, thereby reducing the smog that is suffocating Santiago. Mr O'Neill believes that, if the trans-Andean pipeline is a success, Argentina will be able to set its sights on exporting natural gas from its northern fields to the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil, that country's industrial heartland. Chile's recent return to international standards of creditworthiness also makes the financing of the Dollars 1bn project more apt to be feasible. Chase Manhattan envisages a blend of funding options, including bilateral government credits, commercial bank loans and tapping of the Chilean capital markets, as well as a significant equity component from the companies involved.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Old assumptions fail to fit in the modern world Summary of paper by Patricia Hewitt: The assumption behind the 1944 white paper was that full employment meant full-time jobs for men, and that the working life stretched from the completion of compulsory education to retirement. This model does not fit the modern world. It seems safe to assume that by the end of this year women will already be half the British workforce, and their numbers will continue to grow as women now at home with children re-enter employment and those now in employment take shorter breaks when they have children. In future, full employment must mean employment for women as well as for men. With most women working part-time for part of their lives - and a growing minority of men doing the same - full employment must include part-time as well as full-time employment. The crisis of unemployment in the European Union has awakened interest in shorter working hours as a route to job generation. It is frequently argued by economists that such proposals suffer from the assumption that the total amount of work to be done is fixed and that, therefore, the only way to employ more people is to share the work out more frequently. The alternative, they argue, is to increase output. But this is itself fallacious. It ignores the impact of productivity gains. In the sectors where technology is driving productivity upwards most rapidly, very large increases in output can be achieved with no growth in employment - or even a continuing fall. Second, the argument ignores the fact that, for any given level of output and demand - and for any given level of increase in demand - the number of hours worked by each person will determine the number of people employed. Unemployed people and their families are trapped between a flexible labour market and inflexible social security. But instead of creating incentives, the benefits system locks claimants out of those jobs which form the majority of vacancies. There are several examples. Employment of 16 hours a week or more disqualifies a claimant from income support. Family credit is available only to low-paid workers with children. It can take several weeks to establish a claim and loss of a temporary job can mean further delays in re-establishing a claim. If the partner of an unemployed claimant keeps, or gets, a job, benefit is cut once earnings exceed the permitted threshold. This is one reason why the wives of unemployed men are so much less likely to have jobs than the wives of fully employed men. Instead of locking people out of part-week and part-year employment, the social security system should encourage and enable people to work part-time. In some cases part-time employment will be preferred. In others a part-time job may be all that is available for someone who wants full-time employment. Such a person should be able to combine part-time employment with part-time unemployment benefit.</p>

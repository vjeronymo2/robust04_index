			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSE APPROVES FUNDS FOR HANSEN DAM LAKE  </P> <P> The U.S. House of Representatives approved on Tuesday a bill containing  $272,000 for the continued development of a recreational lake at Hansen Dam.  </P> <P> The House also approved language requested by Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama  City) that directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to apply the money  exclusively to the development of a recreational facility at the dam.  </P> <P> It also directs the corps to continue a dredging operation until the dam basin  is fully excavated, Berman said.  </P> <P> "This is another important step toward a lake at Hansen Dam," Berman said.  "Restoring this recreation area remains one of my highest priorities in  Congress."  </P> <P> The financing, contained in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 1990, is  now subject to approval by the Senate.  </P> <P> In 1969 and 1980, floods brought in millions of tons of debris into the dam,  burying the one-time 130-acre lake.  </P></p>

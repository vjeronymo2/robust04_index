			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Housing starts weaken dollar THE DOLLAR yesterday lost ground against the D-Mark in Europe, but bounced back towards the close of trading after dealers failed to push the US currency convincingly below the DM1.5860 level, writes James Blitz. The US currency was under pressure against the D-Mark from a number of quarters. The dollar again weakened sharply against the yen in overnight trading in Asia, reaching a new record low. At the same time, there were rumours that the Bank of Finland was engaged in heavy dollar sales as part of a restructuring of its currency portfolio. Another factor hanging over the dollar was the growing attitude that the Bundesbank has been easing monetary policy more slowly than expected. Yesterday, the German authorities announced a variable rate repurchase agreement in their weekly money market operation. With call money at 8.19 per cent and the lowest accepted repo at 8.11 per cent, the chances of a significant easing in the repo rate today looked slim. There was cause for concern, too, about the sluggishness of the US economic recovery, with a poorer than expected housing starts figure which fell 4.6 per cent in March. The market assumed that it was partly due to the month's bad weather. However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said the data underlined that US GDP had peaked in the fourth quarter of last year at about 4.7 per cent, and that the first quarter figure for 1993 would be about 2.5 per cent. At lunchtime in Europe the dollar was pushed as low as DM1.5825 after closing the previous night at DM1.5995. But in the afternoon it rebounded on technical trading by dealers to close at DM1.6000. In New York it finished at DM1.5968. In Tuesday's trading in Tokyo, the dollar weakened to an historic low of Y110.20 as the market continued to believe that there was no consensus between the US and Japan to bring down the yen's exchange rate. There were suggestions that the Bank of Japan had intervened to the tune of Dollars 1bn to support the dollar. However, Mr David Cocker of Chemical Bank in London said that both the US and Japanese authorities are notoriously poor at supporting currencies on their own. At best, the Federal Reserve was seen checking prices. The dollar ended in London at Y110.70, from a previous Y111.0. It eased to a Y110.50 close in New York. The D-Mark remained mostly unchanged against European currencies. Sterling failed to react to poorer than expected figures for UK public borrowing in March and closed  1/2 pfennig firmer at DM2.4675. One exception was the peseta, which weakened to a Pta72.31 per D-Mark finish from a previous Pta72.26. The Spanish currency is now around the Pta72.32 level at which the Bank of Spain has regularly intervened in recent weeks.</p>

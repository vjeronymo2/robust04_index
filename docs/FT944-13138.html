			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: ANA drops 79% despite increase in traffic All Nippon Airways (ANA) reported a sharp drop in recurring profits, before extraordinary items and tax, for the first half of the year, in spite of a moderate recovery in passenger volumes. The recurring profits declined 79 per cent to Y1.19bn (Dollars 12.2m) from Y5.66bn a year ago, as revenues slipped slightly to Y401.6bn from Y404.4bn. Net income fell 40 per cent to Y798m from Y1.34bn last time. ANA, Japan's second biggest airline, said Japanese travellers were returning to the market, but the benefits had been overshadowed by a sharp decline in prices. 'We are seeing increases in passengers but with the rampant price sensitivity it hasn't helped our revenues much,' the company said. The yen's strong appreciation lured Japanese passengers back on to international routes, where passenger numbers were up 5 per cent, ANA said. European routes, in particular, did well. However, revenues from international routes were up only 3 per cent. If prices had not fallen, ANA would have added Y800m to passenger revenues of Y2.4bn in the period. On domestic routes, passenger numbers were up only 1.8 per cent. 'With Japan's economy showing signs of recovery, the prolonged downward trend in air travel demand appears to have bottomed out,' ANA said. Business class appears to be recovering, particularly on European and North American routes. ANA initiated a restructuring plan in February to cut costs by about Y6bn and increase revenues by about Y20bn by March next year. The plan includes a 10 per cent cut in its workforce through natural attrition and cuts in controllable costs. In the first half of the year, the company has been able to cut operating costs by Y600m. It has started to hire cabin crew on a contract basis in a programme that is being adopted by Japan's troubled airlines and which caused substantial controversy this summer. ANA does not expect a strong recovery, in spite of a promising outlook for international passenger travel, which is forecast to rise by nearly 10 per cent in the full year. The company expects revenues for the year to rise 2.5 per cent to Y794bn and is 'cautiously confident of keeping the airline in the black'.</p>

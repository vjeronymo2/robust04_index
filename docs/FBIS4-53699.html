			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Keiji Urakami] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- The recent attempt by a  Japanese rice retailer to offer discount gasoline may accelerate  a drive to eliminate a complicated web of rules and regulations  in this country.    Earlier this week, Nagoya suburbs-based Kanare Beikoku  created a stir in Japan's consumer front by opening without a  license a gas station that sells gasoline at 10-15 yen less per  liter than at other stations.    "The move was in protest against the government's licensing  policy," said an official at Kanare Beikoku.    Analysts say the rice retailer challenged conventional  gasoline distribution networks firmly protected under  administrative guidance of the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI).    MITI's local unit did not issue a business license to Kanare  Beikoku, claiming it could not confirm the routes by which the  retailer plans to obtain gasoline supplies.    MITI says the rule, stipulated under the Gasoline Sales and  Distribution Business Law, is intended to secure a stable supply  of gasoline.    Kanare Beikoku cuts middlemen and buys cheaper gasoline  directly from trading houses, defying a usual practice among  Japanese gas stations of securing product sources by belonging  to one of the major oil wholesalers.    It is widely believed that Kanare Beikoku did not clarify  the  supply routes, expecting a licensing application without forming  an affiliation with major wholesalers would be rejected by MITI.    "MITI's administrative rule effectively blocks new business  entry by gasoline discounters," said Katsutoshi Kano, president  of Kanare Beikoku.    MITI has appeared baffled by an unexpectedly large media  coverage of the case that said the rule in question keeps  Japanese motorists paying four times what their American  counterparts pay for gasoline.    One editorial at a major newspaper has cast doubt even over  the necessity of securing "stable" sources of gasoline.    "Any gas stations having trouble in securing gasoline go  under," the editorial said. That's a market mechanism.  Consumers would not be affected."    In an apparent softening of the ministry's previous stance,  Vice MITI Minister Hideaki Kumano told a press conference that  there is room to review the rule.    A senior official at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency  admitted the regulation was originally crafted as a way to  prevent excessive price-cutting competition among gas stations.    "But it may be timely to discuss the validity of maintaining  the regulation," he said, apparently having in his mind the  recent "price revolution" in all consumer fronts in Japan.    The latest incident over gasoline sale may have embarrassed  MITI because it took place just one day after the ministry  announced a set of bills aimed at scrapping or easing government  control on rules and regulations.    MITI submitted nine bills to the current Diet sitting Friday  [20 May] along with 31 other bills written by other ministries,  in line with the government's deregulation policy.    Among the nine bills, one calls for abolition of a rule that  requires antidecay treatment of lumber for use in telegraph  poles and railroad ties.    "Nobody uses lumber for such purposes now," MITI explained.    Earlier this week, MITI placed "letter boxes" at its local  offices across the nation to receive complaints, requests and  opinions from general consumers on its deregulation policy.    In view of the recent national trend toward deregulation,  Kanare Beikoku may have a fairly good chance of winning a fight  against MITI, often labeled abroad as a faithful guardian of  rigid administrative rules.    The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata recently vowed  to come up with powerful deregulative measures by the end of  June as part of efforts to bolster domestic demand and hence the  nation's appetite for imports.    Relaxing economically restrictive government regulations is  a  mission of his administration, Hata said.    During the previous administration of Prime Minister  Morihiro  Hosokawa, the Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman of the  Economic Planning Agency was upgraded to ministerial level.    Earlier this month, the Ombudsman proposed a set of  deregulative measures in response to complaints from consumers.    The proposal covers many aspects of people's livelihood,  ranging from a simpler auto inspection system designed to cut  inspection costs running over 100,000 yen to a reduction in a  layer of procedures for obtaining import permission for  cosmetics and perfume.    The social trend appears difficult for MITI to reverse.    Under the law, Kanare Beikoku faces fines of up to 300,000  yen. But the senior official at the Natural Resources and Energy  Agency, a MITI unit, said MITI does not plan to enforce the law  immediately.    "We will patiently ask the retailer to take a due  procedure,"  the official said, hinting that the ministry wants to look the  other way in order not to draw public attention on the issue.    Imposing penalties against the gas station would only  aggravate public sentiment against MITI.    Kanare Beikoku's President Kano may be encouraged by strong  support of consumers.    The gas station proved an instant hit with motorists, with  their cars lining up early in the morning to buy gasoline at 100  yen per liter.</p>

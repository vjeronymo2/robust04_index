			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a glance): Capital Gains Tax Last week's Capital Gains Tax indexation table omitted the figures for the first four months of this year. Multiply the original cost of an asset by the following figures: 1.027 for an asset bought in January, 1.022 for February, 1.019 for March and 1.004 for April. If you subtract the result from the proceeds of a sale made in May, the difference will be your taxable gain or loss.</p>

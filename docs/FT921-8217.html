			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Italy's monetary parting of ways: Reforms at the Bank of Italy and the Treasury AFTER a century together, the Bank of Italy and the Treasury last month took a step towards divorce with the decision to give the central bank autonomy to set the discount rate. The move, while largely symbolic, was designed to bring the country closer into line with European Community commitments on economic and monetary union after the Maastricht summit in December. While the discount rate, the key rate charged by the central bank to commercial banks, used to be determined by the Treasury, it was only on the recommendation of the Bank of Italy located just down the road. Nevertheless, greater independence of central banks from governments was a key demand from the Germans in particular, and few EC countries will benefit more than Italy. Treasury officials have for years fought a losing battle against free-spending politicians, who have given Italy Europe's second-biggest government deficit after Greece. A more independent central bank, with muscle to match its reputation for professionalism, is as welcome to reformers in Rome as it is to the architects of Emu. The Bank of Italy's enhanced stature has been accompanied by moves to upgrade the Treasury's own abilities in economic policy management and macro-economic research and forecasting, which had previously been entrusted almost exclusively to the central bank. In its first big re-organisation since 1889, the Treasury has appointed five new director-generals, equivalent to permanent secretaries in the UK civil service. Mr Mario Draghi, the highly-respected former official of the International Monetary Fund brought in to replace Mr Mario Sarcinelli as director general last year, is being promoted to a higher grade. Meanwhile, two of the newcomers are being brought in from outside. One, Mr Francesco Giavazzi, a prominent economist from Milan's Bocconi university, will be responsible for macro-economic research and forecasting. Among his first jobs will be to come up with names for the new 10-man council of permanent advisers, probably top economists, which was another of last month's innovations to reinforce the Treasury analytical skills. The second outsider is Mr Enrico Granata, formerly head of the legal department at Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, a respected public-sector financial services group. He will head a new directorate in charge of organisational matters relating to monetary and fiscal policy. More important, he will also supervise the Treasury's hand in dealing with public-sector banks, especially over privatisation. A frustrated Mr Sarcinelli left Italy for one of the deputy chairmanships of the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development after hitting out at the persistent inability of Italian politicians to get to grips with the budget deficit. In his parting letter, he also drew attention to the scarcity of economic expertise in the Treasury. The most important step - yet to come - is the curtailment of the Treasury's right to use the Bank of Italy to fund the budget deficit. As in other countries, the Treasury has an account with the central bank for financing day-to-day public spending. However, the Italian account also carries an overdraft facility which would shame the most open-handed bank manager. The credit line was originally intended to give the Treasury some flexibility in managing liquidity. But over the years, it has grown into a tool for financing budget deficits. Cumulative usage of the line has risen to more than L70,000bn, (Pounds 32bn) according to Mr Riccardo Barbieri, an economist with J P Morgan in Milan. Use of the line has been more limited in the past two years. However, there are still periods, such as last September, when the Treasury has gone on a binge. Mr Guido Carli, the veteran Treasury minister, has vowed to reform the credit line, a move that will probably go hand in hand with steps to reduce Italy's currently high bank reserve requirements. With only hours before the dissolution of parliament last month, Mr Carli even put forward a draft law to underline his commitment to reforming the credit facility. Swept aside in the torrent of more pressing last-minute legislation, the bill had no chance of passing into law. But Mr Carli has laid down a marker for the next government. At 77, Mr Carli, a former central bank governor, has earned a rest, but he may want to soldier on a little longer to see cherished legislation, such as that on limited privatisations, take effect. With the main political parties likely to emerge weakened from the general election in April, Mr Carli's continued presence at the helm would also be a strong signal to other European partners, and to the new blood being brought into his ministry, that change, this time, really is at hand.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FIGURE IN HASTINGS CASE ORDERED JAILED  </P> <P> A federal judge on Tuesday found disbarred attorney William Borders in contempt  of court and ordered him to jail for refusing to answer questions from a Senate  panel gathering evidence in the Alcee L. Hastings impeachment trial. U.S.  District Judge Thomas Pennfield Jackson gave Borders until 10 a.m. Friday to  surrender to federal marshals.  </P> <P> The committee is collecting evidence concerning charges that Hastings conspired  with Borders to obtain a $150,000 payoff and lied about it before a jury that  acquitted him in 1983. Borders was convicted in 1982, disbarred and sent to  prison for 33 months.  </P> <P> Hastings, who was impeached by the House in August, 1988, is also accused of  improperly disclosing information that government investigators obtained  through a court-approved wiretap.  </P> <P> Once the committee finishes its report, the full Senate will vote on whether to  remove Hastings from the federal bench and thus take away the $89,500 annual  salary he continues to receive.  </P></p>

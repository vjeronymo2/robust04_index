			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S HOW HE PLAYS GAME, NOT HOW HE BETS ON IT  </P> <P> Yes, everyone, baseball is the All-American sport. Retired players, active  players and managers in baseball abide by ethical standards and are corruption  free.  </P> <P> Isn't that what we're told as Little Leaguers? I remember coaches saying,  "Brad, Pete Rose hustles -- now go shag that ball -- on the double!" and "Brad,  Steve Garvey doesn't use profanity, and neither will you," and "Brad, Wade  Boggs keeps his eye on the ball. That's why he gets so many hits."  </P> <P> Times have changed. What do coaches tell their players today? "Brad, if you  ever want to make it to the big leagues, you'll need a mistress, a few  girlfriends with whom you can have children out of wedlock, a bookie and maybe  even a few good drugs."  </P> <P> Is that what it takes to be one of the innocent boys of summer these days?  </P> <P> BRAD STERN  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

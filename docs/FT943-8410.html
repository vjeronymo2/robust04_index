			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: DnB posts record at mid-term Den norske Bank, Norway's largest bank, recorded its biggest half-year profit in the first six months of this year, helped by the reversal of a long trend of heavy loan-loss provisions. DnB, state-controlled since it was bailed out of a loan-loss crisis by the government in 1992, reported a pre-tax profit of NKr1.48bn (Dollars 208m) compared with a surplus of NKr218m in the same period of the previous year. The result was achieved in spite of lower interest income and a fall in profits from its bond and share portfolio. The most striking feature of the result was a net gain of NKr124m made under loan losses, as amounts written back on previous loan losses exceeded new provisions. At the same stage last year, DnB made net provisions of NKr1.99bn. The turnround followed a similar gain by Christiania Bank, Norway's second largest bank, and provides evidence that the strengthening Norwegian economy is bolstering the recovery of the banks from the crisis of the early 1990s, when most of them come under state control. 'We are pleased that in such a short time the Norwegian business sector has improved its position more than anyone envisaged just a year ago,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, DnB's chief executive. 'This has enhanced the quality of our loan portfolio and made it possible to reverse a small portion of previous loan-loss provisions,' he said. The volume of non-performing loans was cut at the half-way stage to NKr8.4bn from NKr10.2bn at the end of 1993. However, DnB, formed in 1990 from the merger of Den norske Creditbank and Bergen Bank, said operating profits before write-downs fell sharply to NKr1.35bn from NKr2.26bn in the same period last year. Net interest income fell in the first half to NKr2.44bn from NKr2.64bn. Other income slipped to NKr1.2bn from NKr1.87bn as the interest rate turbulence of the past few months sent bond trading profits spinning down to NKr71m from NKr666m and share profits fell to NKr87m from NKr189m.</p>

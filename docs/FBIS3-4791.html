The meeting will take place when U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher visits Japan from March 9 to 11, Aichi said.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will not join the  mission but Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will  accompany Christopher and attend the meeting, he said.    Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  and Aichi, Japanese officials said.    The planned gathering aims to promote communication and  understanding between the foreign and defense chiefs to prevent  the bilateral trade friction from affecting security affairs,  Aichi said.    Christopher will visit Japan as part of a three-nation tour  of the Asia-Pacific region. While in Tokyo, he will attend an  international conference on reconstruction of Cambodia on March  10 and 11 and meet Japanese leaders to discuss a broad range of  bilateral issues.</p>

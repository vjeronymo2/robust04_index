			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENDER GAP CLOSES ON HOMELESS WOMEN;  </P> <P> * COUNTY SIMPLY MUST FIND ROOM IN ITS HEART FOR THEM  </P> <P> As recently as a decade ago, homelessness was mostly confined to middle-aged  alcoholic men in urban skid rows. Today, homelessness has come to the suburbs  and has become more an equal opportunity problem. The Urban Institute says that  women represent about 19% of the urban homeless, and the National Coalition on  the Homeless grimly notes that families with children -- nearly all of which  are headed by women -- are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless  population.  </P> <P> Details about homeless women in Orange County are sketchy, but what's clear is  that there is a woefully inadequate number of beds and services to address the  problem. The Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force estimates there are  10,000-12,000 homeless people in the county, about half of them children. A  survey taken last year by the task force found that a third of those questioned  were women, but the actual number is thought to be somewhat lower.  </P> <P> What is the profile of these homeless women? The county's major women's  shelter, the YWCA in Santa Ana, says that homelessness affects women of all  ages and ethnic backgrounds, but that most are 25- to 45-year-old whites who  lived in Orange County well before losing their homes.  </P> <P> Service providers say that the problem of homelessness is compounded for women  by feelings of failure in their role as nurturers. According to a USC study of  100 homeless families, women were concerned about their inability to provide a  "home" for themselves and their children. Moreover, women are more vulnerable  to rape and other street crimes than their male counterparts. They are more  likely to seek services or shelters.  </P> <P> Even without a place to live, homeless women try to provide as well as they can  for their families. Last September, when the Orange County Rescue Mission  offered 150 back-to-school packs to homeless and other very poor families, 900  people showed up to claim them.  </P> <P> There are many reasons why a person becomes homeless, including drug abuse. But  there also are pervasive societal conditions that have made women increasingly  vulnerable to homelessness: housing prices, high divorce rates, wife battering,  a dearth of child care assistance and a job market where unequal pay rates and  age discrimination are common.  </P> <P> Younger women can have trouble getting a foothold in the economy. Older women  have their own problems, especially if their Social Security benefits are  meager. Once evicted, they can't get together the first- and last-month rent  and deposits to obtain a new apartment. Some sleep in their cars or wait in  line for a room at shelters. But today, there are barely more than 100 shelter  spaces for women in Orange County -- a fraction of the need.  </P> <P> Homelessness is expected to significantly worsen over the next few years,  experts say. Recent efforts in Orange County to build single-room occupancy  hotels -- dormitory-type housing for single adults -- can help, but similar  housing is needed for families as well. Also, community support is needed for  agencies that provide services for the homeless, including United Way, Share  Our Selves and the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. Partly because of  a crisis in donor giving last summer, food and shelter crisis relief agencies  plan an early start this year to bring the community together to avert similar  shortages. That's a good step.  </P> <P> In the meantime, more women will find that, for them, the gender gap  unfortunately is narrowing. And one thing is clear: Orange County is only  beginning to deal with the problem.  </P></p>

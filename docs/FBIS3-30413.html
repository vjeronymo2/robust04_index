			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F> Liberal Democratic Party, by Ali H. Zerdin in Bled; date not  given: "You Will Polish the Boots of German and British  Officers"]    [Text] [Zerdin] Are you satisfied with the visit to  Slovenia?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am. Everything has been in order, peaceful,  clean, cultured. The service in the hotel has been good.    [Zerdin] Are you satisfied with the meetings with the  representatives of the Slovene parties?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, we have agreed on cooperation. We signed  a joint statement with the Slovene National Party and I have  invited them all to the congress of my party on 2 April.  Everybody liked this. Generally speaking, you do not have many  problems here. For example, the Trieste area used to be  controversial, namely, whether Trieste would go to Yugoslavia or  to Italy. There were no other conflicts. However, conflicts must  be resolved in a peaceful manner, and once they are over, the  Slavs will only smile at our conflicts in the past. The problems  must be resolved so that Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia will be  more compact.    [Zerdin] Compact?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, compact and not in pieces. If there will  Bosnia-Herzegovinas and Montenegros then there will be endless  quarrels and wars there. There should only be three parts:  Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia, full stop. And Bulgaria. All  foreign armies should leave Yugoslavia.    [Zerdin] What about the Muslims?    [Zhirinovskiy] There is no Muslim question. Historically  speaking, the Muslims are ethnic Croats and Serbs. This is a  complex region, anyway. However, this was also the case in  France. There used to be the Normans, the Gaelic, and the  Bretons there.... And France, which is a peaceful country  nowadays, has emerged from all this. This could have also been  the case with you, the South Slavs who have had Yugoslavia, but  it did not work out. If this must be so then let it be only  three parts there: Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia. And not eight  pieces. Such a quantity cannot ensure quality. If there are  eight countries, there will be wars.    [Zerdin] What about Macedonia?    [Zhirnovskiy] Macedonia? That is Bulgaria. Actually, the  Turkish Thrace, Romanian Dobrogea, Bulgaria, and Macedonia are a  sort of unity.    [Zerdin] So what should this be, Macedonia or Bulgaria?    [Zhirinovskiy] Instead of Bulgaria, it should be named  Macedonia. This would be more fair. Serbia should get the  Serbian part of the present Macedonia, but otherwise this would  be a big country. Alexander the Great, who conquered all of Asia  Minor and got all the way to India, was from this area.    [Zerdin] What about Russia?    [Zhirinovskiy] See, what is Ukraine? It is Russia.    [Zerdin] And Czechia and Slovakia?    [Zhirinovskiy] Because of the Sudetenland and Moravia, the  Czechs are closer to the Germans. Practically speaking, Czechia  has no future. Germany will gradually take it over. Bratislava,  however, could turn into a center for East European Slavic  cooperation. This would be a counterbalance to the West European  alliance. Bratislava could be something similar to what  Strasbourg and Maastricht are for the Western Europe.  Economically, the Slavs could have been stronger than Western  Europe. However, they would have to act without ideologies. The  entire Western Europe is infected with fascism: Spain, Italy,  Greece, Germany. Eastern Europe used to be ailing from  communism. Now there is a threat of nationalism. There is  killing again and there are wars. This must be stopped. In the  21th century, the arms will speak for the last time against  those who will be against democracy. This will be a religious  war against the Muslim world. Well, it is already happening. For  this reason, I have also written the book -- the Last Push to  the South.    At the end of the 20th century, there will be no more  international wars, however, religious wars will begin. You see,  Turkey toward the Caucasus, Azerbaijan against Armenia.... These  are religious wars. Here is Tajikistan, and if these wars spread  World War II will take place. We are in a situation similar to  Europe in 1935. Nobody expected a war then and suddenly it has  all started. Now Turkey and Iran can push toward Caucasus, the  Turks are penetrating into the Balkans, Iraq in Central Asia,  Afghanistan in Tajikistan. You will have pan Islamism, Balkans,  Arabs. France and Germany will be destabilized. Finally, Europe  will be in a state of war.    [Zerdin] Who can stop all this?    [Zhirinovskiy] Only Russia. Russia could be a factor of  stability. It could stop the process of disintegration of  Europe, the Balkans, and central Asia. You see yourselves what  has happened after Russia has withdrawn from the Balkans. A war  has happened. If Russia helps, war can be prevented.    [Zerdin] Slovenia would like to become a NATO member.    [Zhirinovskiy] Well, if Slovenia becomes a NATO member it  will really be a servant. A servant! You were in the army,  weren't you? You know how one has to polish boots. You will  polish boots to the German and British officers. NATO will be  able to send its troops in Slovenia and you will have to feed a  foreign army. Only this and nothing more. Nobody will attack  Slovenia, that is true, but it will be occupied by a foreign  army.    [Zerdin] So what do you propose?    [Zhirinovskiy] Neutrality is the best. If you join NATO you  will lose everything. Foreign soldiers will idle around and  drink in your courtyard, while you will have to work for them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 28. Paragraph (h) in &sect;31.303 is amended by adding the following sentence at the end thereof:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;31.303  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Performance Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h) *&blank;*&blank;* The annual performance report must be submitted to OJJDP no later than June 30 and address all formula grant activities carried out during the previous complete calendar year, federal fiscal year, or State fiscal year for which information is available, regardless of which year's formula grant funds were used to support the activities being reported on, e.g., during a reporting period, activities may have been funded from two or more formula grant awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. Paragraph (j) in &sect;31.303 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;31.303  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Disproportionate Minority Confinement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minority Detention and Confinement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Pursuant to section 223(a)(23) of the JJDP Act, States must demonstrate specific efforts to reduce the proportion of juveniles detained or confined in secure detention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails and lockups who are members of minority groups if such proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in the general population, viz., in most States, youth between 10&hyph;17 are subject to secure custody. It is essential that States approach this statutory mandate in a comprehensive manner. Compliance with this provision is achieved when a State meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Identification. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Provide quantifiable documentation (State, county and local level) in the State's FY 1994 Formula Grant Plan (and all subsequent Multi-Year Plans) Juvenile Crime Analysis and Needs Assessment to determine whether minority juveniles are disproportionately detained or confined in secure detention and correctional facilities, jails and lockups in relation to their proportion of the State juvenile population. Guidelines are provided in the OJJDP Disproportionate Minority Confinement Technical Assistance Manual (see Phase I Matrix). Where quantifiable documentation is not available to determine if disproportionate minority confinement exists in secure detention and correctional facilities, jails and lockups, the State must provide a time-limited plan of action, not to exceed six months, for developing and implementing a system for the ongoing collection, analysis and dissemination of information regarding minorities for those facilities where documentation does not exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assessment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each State's FY 1994 Formula Grant Plan must provide a completed assessment of disproportionate minority confinement. Assessments must, at minimum, identify and explain differences in arrest, diversion and adjudication rates, court dispositions other than incarceration, the rates and periods of prehearing detention in and dispositional commitments to secure facilities of minority youth and non-minority youth in the juvenile justice system, and transfers to adult court (see Phase II Matrix). If a completed assessment is not available, the State must submit a time-limited plan (not to exceed 12 months from submission of the Formula Grant Application) for completing the assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Intervention. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each State's FY 1995 Formula Grant Plan must, where disproportionate confinement has been demonstrated, provide a time-limited plan of action for reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority juveniles in secure facilities. The intervention plan shall be based on the results of the assessment, and must include, but not be limited to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Diversion. Increasing the availability and improving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of diversion programs for minorities who come in contact with the juvenile justice system, such as police diversion programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Prevention. Providing developmental, operational, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment assistance (financial and/or technical) for prevention programs in communities with a high percentage of minority residents with emphasis upon support for community-based organizations (including non-traditional organizations) that serve minority youth;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Reintegration. Providing developmental, operational,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and assessment assistance (financial and/or technical) for programs designed to reduce recidivism by facilitating the reintegration of minority youth in the community following release from dispositional commitments to reduce recidivism;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Policies and Procedures. Providing financial and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical assistance that addresses necessary changes in statewide and local, executive, judicial, and legal representation policies and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

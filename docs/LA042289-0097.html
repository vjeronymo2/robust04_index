			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gibraltar Won't Seek to Remove Regulators: Gibraltar Financial Corp. of Beverly  Hills, parent of two still-solvent savings and loans that federal regulators  seized last month, said it will not seek to remove the regulators from running  the thrifts. The company said the decision stemmed from its belief that, if it  took such an action, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board would withhold its  cooperation and assistance and a liquidity crisis would result. Regulators  seized the thrifts March 31, saying they were being operated in an unsound  manner and had dissipated their assets.  </P></p>

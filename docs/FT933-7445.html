			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Holy grail still proves elusive: UK retail costs for wealthier households appear to be rising faster than for poorer families Anyone who chose to renew their house insurance, pay their children's school fees and make a long train journey this week might wonder just how the UK's annual inflation rate can be as low as 1.4 per cent. Consumers who paid their gas bill and monthly mortgage and bought a new washing machine and a pair of jeans would, on the other hand, find themselves spending considerably less than they did on the same items last year. Such vast differences in individual experiences are hardly surprising. The 'retail prices index' is designed to reflect the price of an 'average' shopping basket. For anyone who is not average, it is a far from perfect indicator of inflation. If the information used to compile the index is dissected and put alongside anecdotal evidence collected by the Financial Times, the signs are that costs for wealthier households have risen faster than for poorer families. Figures this week put Britain's annual inflation rate at 1.4 per cent. That was only slightly higher than June's 30-year low of 1.2 per cent and boosted government and City hopes that the UK was achieving growth without inflation. and But many consumers facing price rises may wonder if the figures reflect reality. If not, many aspects of everyday life are based on wrong information. Inflation figures are used as a basis for wage negotiations, influence companies' pricing decisions, determine how state retirement pensions and certain social security benefits are upgraded, and set the levels of interest paid on index-linked National Savings certificates and indexed gilt-edged stocks. The retail prices index (RPI) is based on 130,000 prices collected across the country each month by the Central Statistical Office for 600 goods and services. Items are weighted according to the proportion of family spending they represent. Inevitably the RPI is a compromise. When deciding what weightings to use, spending patterns of low-income pensioners and households with incomes in the top 4 per cent - those earning Pounds 925 or more a week - are excluded on the grounds that they differ significantly from the majority. 'Nobody actually consumes the average basket of goods,' says Mr James Banks, an economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies who is researching how different groups spend their incomes. 'It would be useful to have a series of RPIs for different groups,' he says. 'In the 1970s, for example, increases in food and fuel prices adversely affected poorer groups, while in the 1980s the bias was against higher income groups with the prices of luxuries rising and prices of basic goods falling.' If such figures were published, they would almost certainly show that many more households than just those deliberately excluded would find changes in their own bills out of line with the RPI. As incomes increase, households spend a higher proportion of their money on leisure services, such as entertainment and holidays, motoring, alcoholic drink, and clothing and footwear. The first three categories have risen in price by more than the overall RPI; the prices of clothing and footwear have been static. At the same time, wealthier households spend proportionately less on housing, fuel, food and tobacco. The prices of housing and fuel have both fallen over the last year, with only tobacco outstripping the prices index. So if the RPI were reweighted to reflect the spending patterns of the better-off, the inflation rate would probably be higher. Moreover, some costs that fall heavily on wealthier households are not included in the RPI at all - for instance fees for private education, which increased by an average of 8.3 per cent this year, according to the Independent Schools Information Service's annual census. Another expense of the better-off - the cost of private medical insurance - is also rising fast, according to Ms Jan Lawson, of Private Health Partnership, a specialist intermediary. She says medical insurance has risen by about 17-18 per cent over the last year, largely because of the increasing use of expensive medical procedures under private cover, and the general rise in medical costs. Research by the FT suggests the super-wealthy may have been insulated from some price rises over the past year, as the recession has forced many companies offering high price goods or services to keep price rises in check. For a 'basket' of luxuries, including a return flight from London to New York on Concorde, a holiday for two in Grenada, a magnum of vintage Bollinger champagne, a pair of handmade brogues from Lobb's of St James's Street, a 'Richmond' hamper from Fortnum and Mason, and a Savile Row suit, the overall rise was 1.2 per cent - below the RPI. Several prices were unchanged (see chart). For the less adventurous consumer, the picture is more mixed. A survey of prices across retail sectors supports the view that the general level of increases over the past year has been low, with many prices falling - but there are important exceptions. Smokers, for instance, are paying more for cigarettes. The March Budget put 10p on the price of 20 king-size cigarettes. Earlier this month, tobacco companies raised prices of most leading brands by up to another 4p a pack. Transport costs have risen considerably. InterCity and Network SouthEast increased season ticket rates by up to 9.5 per cent this year. A typical InterCity first-class return fare has risen by about 6 per cent. But some of the biggest increases have been in insurance premiums. General Accident said its comprehensive motor insurance had risen 4 per cent and non-comprehensive policies by 30 per cent, reflecting the increase in theft. Households are also paying the cost of rising crime. The Consumers Association said that, across large UK insurers, household contents premiums had risen by 10-15 per cent, again reflecting rising theft and the growing incidence of fraudulent claims. Holidays, which have been included in the RPI only since February this year, are more expensive. According to Thomson, the tour operator, package holiday prices are set to tumble next year, but short-haul packages are still more costly this year than last. A family of four travelling in high season to Majorca, on 14 nights' half-board, would pay Pounds 2,148 - 3.6 per cent more than in 1992. But the reason why the official measure of inflation shows a low rate of price increases is largely because many households have been helped by the steep fall in the cost of a mortgage. The standard variable mortgage rate in July last year was 10.65 per cent; it is now 7.99 per cent. According to the Halifax building society, the average mortgage is Pounds 50,000. A 30-year-old non-smoking man with an endowment mortgage will have seen his monthly payments drop from Pounds 448 to Pounds 354 - a 21 per cent reduction. The underlying annual inflation rate, which excludes mortgages, was 2.9 per cent in July. In addition, heating and lighting costs have dropped. British Gas has been forced to cut domestic prices by a tough formula set by its regulator, restricting price rises to five percentage points below the RPI. Household electricity prices have fallen by an average of more than 2 per cent since April, mainly owing to lower coal prices, although price changes have varied by area. Consumers are also paying less - or only a little more - for clothing and footwear, household and leisure goods. Competition among store chains has been intense, with high levels of promotional and discounting activity trying to tempt recession-weary consumers to part with their cash. For Levis 501 jeans, for example, monitoring by Verdict, the retail market research group, found prices at four national chains had not changed over the past year. But one store chain had lowered its price by Pounds 5, reducing the average from Pounds 40.32 to Pounds 39.49. Marks and Spencer, the UK's largest clothing retailer, launched an 'outstanding value' promotion last autumn, cutting the prices of a quarter of its clothing and freezing the price for the rest. Argos, the catalogue retailer whose products range from jewellery and household goods to furniture and sports equipment, said that 75 per cent of items carried over from its spring/summer catalogue to its recently launched autumn/winter catalogue were at the same price. Prices for electrical goods have also come down. GfK Marketing Services, which supplies pricing information to national chains, said average costs of both brown goods such as televisions and hi-fi, and white goods such as fridges, had fallen over the past year. Food price inflation has been kept low by a combination of increasing price competition, fostered partly by the rapid spread of discount chains that sell a limited range of goods at very low prices, and other factors. Many fresh food prices have been falling this year, with several important commodity markets moving into surplus at the same time, and plentiful production of seasonal produce such as salad stuffs and vegetables. The many pressures on prices highlight the difficulties in predicting where inflation will go next. While mortgage rates are expected to remain low, fuel costs will rise next April by 8 per cent with the first stage of the imposition of VAT. Seasonal factors that have kept food prices down cannot last. GfK Marketing Services said it was seeing evidence of prices for electrical and leisure goods levelling off as summer promotions came to an end. Vauxhall announced yesterday that it was putting up the price of its cars by an average of 2.1 per cent from Wednesday. So it may be too early to assume the UK has reached the 'holy grail' of growth without inflation. Consumers who have been hit by the biggest prices rises might believe it is not even on the horizon.

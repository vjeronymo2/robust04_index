			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Reference News" by Juo Jan (5387 3544): "Deng Liqun Says </F> Mainland is Taking the Capitalist Road"]    [Text] "Part-time general secretary" Deng Liqun recently  made a study tour of Zhejiang Province and made some  enlightening remarks at an organization meeting of old cadres in  the province. He said that if the present political line  continues to develop, China will become a capitalist society led  by a communist party guided by non- Marxist theories in less  than 15 years, or even in seven to eight years. We cannot use  the manifesto of a ruling party as the standard for judging what  road a country takes and what structure it establishes, but must  look at the political line of the ruling party and the specific  principles and policies its pursues. The so-called leftist  political parties, the socialist parties and labor parties of  the European countries, also practice capitalism. Today, I can  say with certainty that there cannot even be half of the total  number of party members who think that the present political  line is following the socialist road. Deng Liqun also said: I  will not waver at all in my own beliefs.    Deng Liqun's remarks were excerpted from bulletins issued by  the General Office of the CPC Central Committee.</p>

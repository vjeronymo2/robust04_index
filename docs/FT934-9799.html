			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Deregulation for London buses dropped: Manifesto pledge scrapped after pressure from MPs THE GOVERNMENT has for the first time pulled out of a manifesto commitment made at the last election by abandoning plans to deregulate the London bus service in the lifetime of this parliament. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday the government would proceed with new reforms of the capital's bus system, opening up more routes operated by London Buses Ltd to competition. But more radical legislation - which would have allowed any private company to operate a bus service in London - has been dropped after a summer-long campaign against deregulation by Conservative backbenchers and local councillors. Backbenchers, including Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North and a former minister, had claimed deregulation would have led to road congestion and fare rises in the capital. The abandonment of deregulation is one of the clearest indications yet that the government will avoid introducing legislation in next week's Queen's Speech which lacks the support of a broad cross-section of Tory MPs. In the last parliamentary session, several key areas of the government's legislative programme, including the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, were threatened by its thin majority of 17 in the House of Commons and the activities of backbench Conservative rebels. Several controversial pieces of legislation have already been postponed. These include the Pensions Equalisation Bill, which contained politically sensitive plans to raise the state retirement age for women, and the privatisation of the Post Office, which was delayed partly because of backbench fears over the impact on the postal service in Tory-held rural constituencies. Both pieces of legislation will not appear until the 1994-95 session at the earliest. Mr MacGregor yesterday announced plans to push ahead next year with privatisation of the 10 London Buses subsidiaries and the tendering of the bus routes. This could mean more private companies operating services in colours other than the traditional red. The transport secretary also said London Transport would move from the previous system of 'gross cost' contracts to 'net cost' tendering, which gives operators an incentive to attract more passengers and improve efficiency. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, approved the government's decision to drop the 'crackpot idea' of bus deregulation. 'They simply dare not face the electors of London with traffic gridlocked from Stratford to Ealing. Every sensible person will welcome this decision,' he said.</p>

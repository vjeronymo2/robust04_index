			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is prepared  for the possibility that North Korea will improve its relations  not only with South Korea but also with Western nations when its  nuclear issue is solved.    If the nuclear problem is settled, inter-Korean relations  will rapidly improve and at the same time North Korea's  relations with Western nations will make considerable  improvement, unification minister Yi Yong-tok told the Advisory  Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification on Friday.    The government has a set of measures to prepare for such a  possibility, he said.    "North Korea will guardedly seek to open its doors on a  limited scale so that the open-door policy doesn't stand in the  way of maintaining its political system," he said. "And I think  the North Korean nuclear issue will be solved in a manner  desirable to us, though the timing is a question."    He stressed the need for a positive posture toward North  Korea.    "We must now slough off the negative and passive view of  North Korea we held in the past and take a positive posture  toward desirable change in North Korea."    He warned against inter-Korean dialogue for dialogue's sake  or for show.    "We must now strive to hold a dialogue that will be of  substantial help to solving the problem."</p>

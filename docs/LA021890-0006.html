			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT WE DON'T TELL THE CHILDREN  </P> <P> Feathers in the yard this morning.  </P> <P> My cat?  </P> <P> Or the two black strays,  </P> <P> ominously staring with orange eyes  </P> <P> from corrugated, rusted sheep-shed roof?  </P> <P> I hear them at night  </P> <P> yeowling --  </P> <P> shush of branches, squeals and shrieks,  </P> <P> then silence.  </P> <P> Artist couple rented around the  </P> <P> corner last month. Were ecstatic  </P> <P> about this primitive place.  </P> <P> She came over one morning,  </P> <P> arm bandaged, boyfriend  </P> <P> stern-faced, sucking air through teeth,  </P> <P> she said, "My cat went belly up,  </P> <P> no animal is supposed to attack another  </P> <P> belly up. Those blacks are vicious.  </P> <P> Ought to be put to sleep."  </P> <P> Her Siamese crossed Blacks' territory,  </P> <P> she came upon them, kicked one Black,  </P> <P> and it scratched her arm in defense.  </P> <P> They moved out month after they moved in,  </P> <P> truck loaded with paintbrushes, canvasses,  </P> <P> cameras, to find another primitive place,  </P> <P> tranquil as a pond in autumn evening  </P> <P> where golden-tipped wheat leans,  </P> <P> place with no problems, no animal  </P> <P> attacks another, where gentle folk  </P> <P> are as groomed as heirloom porcelain,  </P> <P> where there is no pollution, no drugs,  </P> <P> no world gone belly-up  </P> <P> the rest of us are trying to heal.  </P> <P> After they left, Antonio and I  </P> <P> sat on the patio, talking how he  </P> <P> and Blacks played hide-n-seek,  </P> <P> how he crouched in cool cracks  </P> <P> reaching his arm under boards  </P> <P> by the fence, they squirmed under,  </P> <P> pawing at him playfully, their claws  </P> <P> tucked in their furry mitten-paws  </P> <P> safely.  </P> <P> "Where's the other Black Papi?"  </P> <P> "I don't know, mejito," I said.  </P></p>

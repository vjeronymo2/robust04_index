			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: European sector consolidates but remains nervous European government bonds continued to consolidate, but market sentiment remained jittery and investors were keeping a low profile following the recent sharp sell-off. 'The mood is still nervous and uncertain, and it would be very justifiable to remain cautious,' said Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss Bank Corporation. Uncertainty over the pace of German easing continues to overhang the markets. While the Bundesbank last week cut its discount rate by  1/2 point, it left its more important repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent. Most observers agree that a cut in that rate would kick off another leg in the bond rally, which is still seen as justified by Europe's economic fundamentals. However, a cut in German rates is seen to hinge on the resolution of the labour dispute in the German engineering sector, and inflation and money-supply data. 'Until these factors are out of the way, European markets will remain very exposed to the US market,' said Mr Hall. While UK gilts ended lower, dragged down by their European counterparts, traders said the auction of Pounds 2.5bn 7 per cent gilts due 2001 went smoothly. The auction was covered 1.48 times, with a tail (the difference between the highest and average accepted yields) of 6 basis points. While the cover was in line with expectations, news of the long tail caused prices to dip briefly. Recent auctions have rarely had a tail of more than 2 basis points. However, prices soon retraced their losses as little follow-through selling emerged, and dealers said the new supply was absorbed with relative ease. German bunds rose initially on a larger-than-expected liquidity injection at the Bundesbank's repo allocation, but erased their gains in the afternoon to end slightly lower. The March bund contract on Liffe stood at 97.74 late in the day, down 0.09 point on the day. 'Technically we're still in a downward trend, and the fundamental situation isn't promising either,' said a Frankfurt bund dealer, pointing to the imminent release of January M3 money supply data. Although the market is discounting a bad number, he said M3 could knock prices sharply lower if it had been boosted not only by typical seasonal factors but by growth in the underlying components, such as credit expansion. In the French bond market, curve-steepening trades put pressure on the long end and underpinned the short end. Ahead of next week's 10 and 30-year auctions and amid hopes for a near-term interest-rate cut, that trend is likely to continue, a Paris trader said. US bond prices went into a sharp downturn yesterday after the Treasury's monthly auction of two-year securities drew little demand. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 lower at 94 29/32 , with the yield rising to 6.641 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was off  3/16 to 98 13/16 , to yield 4.631 per cent. The Treasury awarded the Dollars 17bn issue of new two-year paper at a yield of 4.66 per cent, about 2 basis points higher than expectations, when the auction failed to generate sufficient interest to warrant the lower rate of return. The lack of aggressive bidding came on the heels of renewed concern over the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to boost short-term interest rates. Near midday, prices on the long end of the yield curve dropped amid speculation that the Fed would lift its Fed Funds target following the release of January durable goods data today. In his testimony before a congressional committee on Tuesday, the Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, said trends in durable goods orders were a valuable tool in forecasting inflation. Early in yesterday's session, the fixed-income markets appeared to have been reassured by the overall tone of Mr Greenspan's comments. As a result, prices drifted lower in thin trading before jitters over interest rates resurfaced in the hours before the note auction.</p>

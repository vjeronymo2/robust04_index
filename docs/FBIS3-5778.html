			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By chief editor Chong Mun-hwa] </F>   [Text] Active during the 1970s and 1980s in the front lines  of the nationalist-democratic struggle against the military  regime, former People's Party [Minjungdang] [PP] Policy  Committee chairman Chang Ki-pyo was released in early November  after completing a one-year jail term for "negligence" in  connection with the "Yi Son-sil Incident." In view of his  relative importance and influence in opposition circles, the  course of action Chang Ki-pyo takes is predicted to have  considerable influence on the nationalist-democratic movement  and on the problem of making a political force out of the  opposition camp.    In 1989, during his time in the National Democratic Alliance  of Youth and Students, Chang Ki-pyo seriously raised in the  students movement the issue of transforming the opposition into  a political force, giving birth to the PP. With its failure in  the 1992 general election, however, the possibility vanished for  the PP to be an independent political force of the opposition.  In his very first interview after being released from prison,  Chang Ki-pyo showed a strong attachment and intention to build  an independent political party uniting all the opposition, and  set up the construction of a "new, progressive,  political-party-oriented political organization" as his  immediate task.    I met with Chang Ki-pyo in his Tongjak Cultural Center  office, which he created as a base for regional activity when he  ran for office as a PP candidate in Kap-ku, Tongjak in 1992.  There I heard his perceptions on the domestic situation during  this transition period and his ideas on the progress of the  nationalist-democratic movement and the problem of making a  political force out of the opposition.    [Chong Mun-hwa] First of all, in the opposition movement  too,  people are evaluating the reform policies of Kim Yong-sam's  civilian government in a variety of ways. What is your  evaluation of these reform policies?    [Chang Ki-pyo] The series of reform measures carried out  by the Kim Yong-sam administration after its inauguration,  forcing the military to withdraw from politics, the  personal-assets registration of senior government officials, the  implementation of the real-name financial system, the refusal of  the Blue House to accept political funding, and so on, were  immensely well done. These were epoch-making measures which  liquidated the vestiges of the military dictatorship. Some,  including the media, criticize this as a one-man show without  the support of the legal system, but that is not appropriate. In  a nation with a president-centered system, it is right for the  president to boldly carry out reform. The National Assembly  began last year, but what reforming has it done? There had also  been a public servants personal assets registration law before,  but because the presidents were not determined to carry it out,  it was never put into practice. The series of reform measures  was just and it is excessive criticism that really impedes  reform.    Overall, the Kim Yong-sam administration's reform has great  significance and should be highly evaluated historically. It is  regrettable that the media, opposition parties, politicians not  presently in office, and so on, are not supporting the Kim  administration's reform as they should and are not leading it  into an even deeper reform.    [Chong] Although it is a fact that the Kim administration's  reform has contributed to the consolidation of procedural  democracy, some criticize that the administration is  strengthening an anti-masses stance with its delay in amending  labor law, its conglomerate-centered, economic-growth policy,  and its opening of the rice market. What do you think of this?    [Chang] From a political standpoint, I think the Kim  administration will further the reform. As for economic  problems, however, I don't think it will be able to solve them.  Hence, it seems that the administration will have a hard time  gaining continued public support. Early on, the administration  intended to induce economic growth by correcting the  conglomerate-based economy, but it changed this to a  conglomerate-centered policy. For the solution of economic  problems, there must be technological development through  guaranteeing business and worker autonomy and educational reform.    Concerning farm and labor issues, it is not right to  identify  the Kim Yong-sam administration with the military governments of  the past. I don't even think the response of the administration  to the labor-management dispute in Ulsan this year was a bad  one. The struggle of the Ulsan workers is just, but they should  have controlled themselves. Only then can there be progress in  both the labor movement and the reform. The Labor Law must be  revised, but the efforts of those in the labor movement are  lacking as well. The nationwide struggle to obstruct the opening  of our rice market is significant, but we must consider policy  on the assumption of an opening. History is developing in the  direction of globalization; the world is becoming a global  village.    [Chong] Since the birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration,  the influence of the nationalist-democratic movement is  receding. How do you evaluate the present stage of the movement  and in what direction do you think it must go to overcome this?    [Chang] At present, the opposition is not much supported  by the public. People commonly say that this is because it is  radical and excessive, but this is not an appropriate analysis  of the causes of the problem. The core of the problem is that  the opposition is unable to present a good alternative. The goal  which has long been presented by the opposition is the  withdrawal of the military dictatorship; their ideological  alternative was reflected in a socialist society in which  ideological workers and farmers were the masters. The former has  been achieved; the latter has already been confirmed as being  unrealistic. The movement has no goal. It is unable to present  alternatives for even everyday problems. If it is to present  good alternatives, it must have new ideology. Some in the  movement are still clinging to Chuche Thought or  Marxist-Leninism. Therefore, they are unable to get public  support. Only when they gain a new sense of the developmental  stages of world history and develop a new ideology and policy  befitting it will they will be able to gain public support. Past  socialist ideology is a product of the 20th century. The  conservative-progressive concept of former days has already been  superseded as a standard of measure. Also, the  neo-conservativism represented by Reganism and Thatcherism  failed as well. A new, progressive ideology can come out of an  accurate analysis of the developmental trends of modern society.    The developmental trends of modern society are toward  globalization, toward an information society, and toward a mass  society. A recognition of the fact that knowledge is the main  dynamic of production demands of us a tremendous change.  Technology is important and we must have educational reform. The  sovereignty of the masses demands pluralization and  decentralization. There must be a change in our fundamental  understanding of the developmental trends of world history.  Having this sense of world history, a new, progressive ideology  should be set up under the following five fundamental principles.    First is the realization of a democracy based on the  sovereignty of the masses, the overall dissemination of  democracy, and the realization of a communal democracy. Second,  an economic system and labor process must be achieved which  guarantees the self-realization of labor. Third is the  establishment of a social security system with a new philosophy.  Welfare policy must be productive and guarantee opportunity.  Fourth, we must set up an environmental development strategy  capable of symbiosis with nature. Fifth, we must prepare an  international policy based on peace, cooperation, and common  prosperity. We must escape from past international relationships  of domination and exploitation. These five principles are  universal worldwide. For our country, we must present plans for  the unification of our people.    We must leave behind obligatory, emotional unification  plans.  Unification policy should be developed within the context of  world history and a Northeast-Asian developmental strategy.  Unification must be one in which the masses are sovereign. It  must be democratic, peaceful, and creative. North and South must  change in the process of unification. There must be an easing of  tensions and a reduction of military spending.    What is important, together with the creation of a new,  progressive vision, is that the form of "opposition" political  forces is no longer appropriate. Institutional political forces  must encompass the opposition. The opposition too must operate  within the framework of the system. Institutional political  forces and the opposition must play the game with one set of  rules. The opposition must not concentrate on a competition of  criticism, but on a competition of alternatives. We must compete  with one set of rules and in one arena. We should become a part  of the institutional political forces, not remain as an  opposition political force. Social movements and political  capabilities must be divided and reorganized into  institutionalized political forces, citizens-movement forces,  and class, mass-movement forces.    The opposition movement must take actions that are  politically responsible. It must overcome the fact that it is  understood by the masses as critical and constraining movement.  It must be acknowledged as a political force responsible to the  public. Aiming for political power, it must seriously develop  ideology and policy and set out as a professional political  force, capable of representing the political intentions of the  people. It must form a new political force.    [Chong] Through what channels and with what methods will you  form an institutional political force?    [Chang] That is a question to discuss and decide with  members of the opposition movement. My personal thoughts are  that the opposition is unlikely to build an independent,  progressive party in the near future. Channels must be arranged  for and preparations made. The opposition must carry out  activities for which the public can have sympathy and show  support. A minimum unit and framework is needed for this. If  this activity works out well, there can be a large-scale  expansion of participation by expert intellectuals. The  opposition concept is not necessarily limited to  nationalist-democratic-movement forces. It should comprehend all  of society's talented who, while not of the established  political sector, pursue a progressive vision with a positive  determination to put theory into practice. For this, there first  needs to be traffic direction within the camp of the  nationalist-democratic movement.    A cooperative relationship with the Democratic Party [DP] is  important for the political growth and development of the  opposition. Only when the opposition has secured considerable  independence through its activity and power will unity and  solidarity with the DP become possible. The greatest objective  of my activity, however, is for the opposition to create new  alternatives, and so gain public sympathy and support. A new  political organization is needed to change the content of  opposition activity. Also, we have to go fundamentally in the  direction of a political party. The strategy of creating a new  party is efficient, whether in working out our relationship with  the DP or for promoting a reorganization of politics. We will  create a new political organization directed toward a new and  progressive political party. This is right in principle, but it  is also tactically desirable.    [Chong] Evaluations of PP activity have been unfavorable and  attempts to form an independent, progressive party are  repeatedly failing in the arena of real politics, how will you  get your forces together?    [Chang] A common evaluation of the PP's failure is that  the people will not yet support a progressive party. I do not  agree with this evaluation. It was because of our shortcomings  that we couldn't get support. The opinion that we were not  supported because the political level of the public is low is  erroneous. Antiquated progressivism won't work. We must  reconsider it and give it new content. Lacking political  ability, we were unable to inform the public of the true content  of the PP. Another shortcoming was the severe friction within  the PP. We failed because of our own shortcomings and those of  the movement and PP. The public does have a problem. It is  regional enmity.    Things will change a great deal in the future. Without a new  progressive ideology, we cannot overcome economic problems,  political distrust, and so on. Independently, a general  consensus is being formed that the opposition must not continue  in its present form. We can form ranks different from those of  yesterday's PP.    [Chong] How are you going to overcome obstacles, such as the  general perception that it would be difficult to create an  independent party?    [Chang] In carrying out political party activities, the  question of activity funding is also difficult. In the future,  Labor Union Law Article 12 must be revised and the masses must  participate in political activity. The most central problem is  that we must present epoch-making alternatives and policy with  which the people can sympathize.    [Chong] What do you think of the question of solidarity  among  the Popular Political Alliance [Minjung Chongchi Yonhap], which  decided on the creation of a progressive political party, the  Committee for the Promotion of a Progressive Political Party  [Chinbo Chongdang Chujin Uiwonhoe], and others?    [Chang] I believe solidarity with forces espousing  socialist ideology unlikely.    [Chong] What about solidarity with Chonguk Moim [National  Gathering] president Kim Kun-tae, who is discussing the  construction of a new political organization?    [Chang] In political ideology and policy, I believe that  Kim Kun-tae and I think the same. If there is a difference, it  is only the issue of an independent party. I believe it  important for the opposition to establish itself as a political  force distinct from the established political sector, as a new,  progressive political force capable of squarely participating in  a competition of visions with neo-conservativism. I plan to work  with Kim Kun-tae.    [Chong] What do you think of the Yi Son-sil spy ring  incident?    [Chang] The Agency for National Security Planning  announced that Yi Son-sil was a North Korean spy. I had no idea  Yi was a spy. I cannot understand this incident at all. The PP  tends to be anti-Chuche Thought. I don't know how North Korea  intended to approach us. The claim that North Korea did it is  unbelievable and even if North Korea did it, I think it was to  stop exchange between the North and South. Personally, I feel  that my treatment was completely unfair. But as a main PP  executive, I regret that I was unable to stop Yi Son-sil  beforehand and I regret causing concern to the public and to  persons who have cared for the PP.</p>

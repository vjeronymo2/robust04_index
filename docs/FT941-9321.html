			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 2.7%, sharp falls in Hong Kong, Taiwan The failure of the US-Japan trade talks, the sharp rise in the yen as a result, and technical selling stemming from the listing of the Nikkei 300 stock futures contract depressed investor confidence and the Nikkei 225 average plunged 2.7 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 lost 531.45 to 19,459.25 after a high of 19,938.99 and a low of 19,368.24. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 26.16 to 1,581.98. Traders said that the market was driven down by small-lot selling in low trading volume. 'Half of the cause was the rise in the yen, and the other half the shifting of futures positions from the Nikkei 225 to the Nikkei 300,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. The yen moved to a three-month high against the dollar, closing at Y105.69. However, rumours that the Bank of Japan had intervened in the currency market to stop its ascent triggered buying just below the 19,400 level. The Nikkei 300 index, against which the Nikkei 300 futures contract was listed in Osaka, fell 4.4, or 1.5 per cent, to 292.41. 'The fate of the market is in the hands of currency market traders now,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. He added that in a worst case scenario, the Nikkei 225 could fall to 18,500 in the next few days. Volume was 300m shares against 359m, declines leading advances by 934 to 155 with 82 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 16.90 to 1294.40. Export-related stocks plunged on the yen's appreciation. Sony lost Y240 to Y6,050 and TDK Y110 to Y4,160. Automobiles, however, were mixed, with Nissan Motor down Y19 to Y819, and Toyota Motor up Y10 to Y1,910. Banks were lower on profit-taking. The Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y50 to Y3,270 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,930. The telecommunications sector, recently up on the 'multimedia' theme, lost ground, Fujitsu shedding Y50 to Y1,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y29,000 to Y926,000. Pharmaceutical shares, un-affected by currency fluctuations, were firm. Takeda Chemical rose Y20 to Y1,300 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical gained Y10 to Y1,580. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 288.65 to 21,490.97 in volume of 38.1m shares. Roundup The year of the dog opened with a whimper, as Hong Kong and Taiwan came back to sharp losses from last week's holiday. HONG KONG looked at Tokyo and a worrying couple of days on Wall Street, added expectations of tighter domestic credit and dropped equities in thin volume. The Hang Seng index ended 515.22, or 4.5 per cent lower at 10,988.81, about 100 points above its worst. Unfortunately, London decided the fall was not steep enough, and knocked off another 1 1/2 per cent, the Fleming Hong Kong index falling 167 to 10,822. Turnover was HKDollars 6.29bn against HKDollars 5.04bn in last Wednesday's half-day session on the final day of trading before the lunar new year. TAIWAN dropped 4.4 per cent after heavy selling in the finance sector, the weighted index ending 278.87 lower at 6,015.26 in moderately active turnover of TDollars 58.93bn. The market had been closed for a week which had seen losses elsewhere, and sentiment was also hurt by the possibility of tighter liquidity in the money market this week. The financial sector lost 6.3 per cent with Cathay Life and the big three banks limit down. BOMBAY's speculators sold to comply with a Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) order to liquidate all forward positions by March 12, and the BSE 30-share index closed 79.69, or 2 per cent down at 3,911.69. This followed a 2 per cent decline last week, and a two-month long bull run which sent share prices up by nearly 50 per cent. SEOUL reacted to its own market-cooling measures with the composite index losing 15.77, or 1.7 per cent, at 901.38 in a correction in which, it was estimated, expensive blue chips and and other low PER stocks have fallen by about 30 per cent. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrials index fell 22.30 to 2,319.30 but a sharp fall in the index stock Wing Taion going ex-rights contributed to the fall, brokers said. Wing Tai was quoted SDollars 1.46 lower at SDollars 3.00. AUSTRALIA recovered from an early sell-off in early trade, defying the Tokyo and Hong Kong trend to close with the All Ordinaries index only 2.8 lower at 2,238.6. ANZ rose 16 cents to ADollars 5.68 in 4.6m shares, but the better trend in industrials was balanced by lower metal prices, which dragged the all resources index down 10.2 down to 1,345.7. BANGKOK featured cautious bargain hunting by Thai investors which pushed the SET index up 5.86 to 1,422.20. Turnover was still low at Bt7bn against Friday's Bt5.5bn, and brokers said that investors were waiting for a lead from New York. KARACHI closed higher on settlement day, driven by interest in liquid stocks in the textile, cement and energy sectors, and prompted by reports of buying by a foreign fund. The KSE 100 share index rose 39.64 to 2,379.34. COLOMBO rose 19.37 on corporate earnings growth expectations, the approval of a second Sri Lankan country fund, and low interest rates. The CSE all-share index ended at a new 1994 high of 1,207.18.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the petitioner, the western boundary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the St. Helena viticultural area is not strictly delineated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by historical custom. The petitioner states that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> western boundary should be dictated by the eastern boundary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the adjacent Spring Mountain District viticultural area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which utilizes the 400-foot contour line. The petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that although some people might draw the western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary of the St. Helena viticultural area at the 500 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600-foot contour line, the 400-foot contour line defies no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historical precedent and prevents the overlapping of the St.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Helena viticultural area with the Spring Mountain District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to the eastern boundary, the petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that the historical records indicate that Conn Valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a separate area and should not be included in the St.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Helena viticultural area. The records indicate, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Pratt Valley is clearly part of the St. Helena area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the location of the Pratt and Chabot winegrowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properties, according to the petitioner. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crystal Springs Road area and Dago Valley should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included, according to the petitioner, due more to recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developments there rather than earlier history. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the petitioner states that the old Rossini property, where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the historic Burgess-Souverain Winery is located today, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Leunenberger property, where the original Sutter Home-Ballantine Winery was located (today Deer Park Winery),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be included because they are located on the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slopes of Howell Mountain rather than in the St. Helena area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner uses mostly the 400-foot contour line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a short portion of Howell Mountain Road and a longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of Conn Valley Road to delineate the eastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Geographical Features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data prepared by Dr. Elliott-Fisk in support of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition provides the following geographical information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Climate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed St. Helena viticultural area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lies within a relatively narrow and constricted portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the upper Napa Valley proper. There exists a subtle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interaction of climatic factors which affect grapes grown in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this valley floor area. These subtle climatic influences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are part of a continuum across the entire floor of the Napa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Napa Valley proper is classified as a coastal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valley. Along the valley floor from Napa to Calistoga,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are pronounced mesoclimatic variations which relate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the penetration of marine influences from San Pablo Bay and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a lesser extent, to the rise in elevation as one proceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up Napa Valley. This marine air incursion is caused by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warming of the valley floor and surrounding hillsides during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the daylight hours of the growing season. This warming land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass causes the air in the area to rise, creating pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gradients which draw in marine air off of San Pablo Bay to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the south. During the growing season, this phenomenon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally begins in the early afternoon and continues into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evening. Due to proximity to the bay, the areas in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> southern portion of the valley receive the most direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of these pressure gradient winds. These winds have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling effect throughout the Napa Valley.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the grape growing season, this cooling plays an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important role in the development of the grapes by allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them to better retain their natural acidity which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical in the production of high quality wines, according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the petitioner. In the proposed St. Helena viticultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, this cooling effect is moderated compared to the areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further south. However, while the St. Helena area has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively warm conditions, it is the daily maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extremes, for which the area to the north (Calistoga) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better known, that distinguish the St. Helena and Calistoga  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traditionally, the dividing line between the area of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calistoga's higher daily extremes and St. Helena's warm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coastal climate has been the section of land around Bale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lane. It is at this point that the Napa Valley and Napa River take a pronounced directional change of course from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> north/northwesterly to more westerly. To the north of Bale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lane, the exposure of the valley floor to the sun also is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more directly aligned than to the south where there is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The area to the north of the proposed St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural area, particularly around the city of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calistoga, is also affected by a secondary marine air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incursion, far less dramatic than that off of San Pablo Bay,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which penetrates the upper Napa Valley through the Knights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley area. This marine influence, according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioner, does not typically penetrate as far south as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> St. Helena viticultural area. When present, these moist,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling winds serve to moderate the generally hotter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures in Calistoga, making this area ideal for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing premium wine grapes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Elliott-Fisk also finds that there are significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> climatic differences between the St. Helena viticultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area and the surrounding mountains. To the east of St.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Helena lies Howell Mountain and to the west is Spring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountain. These mountain areas range in elevation from 400  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 2,600 feet for Spring Mountain and from 1,400 to 2,400  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feet for Howell Mountain. On average, temperatures fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along the valley floor approximately 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each 1,000 foot fall in elevation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Quelimane by correspondent Abdul Madib] </F>   [Text] A communique issued by the Zambezia branch of the  Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, Palmo, and disseminated  by Radio Mozambique, says it is worried about recent political  developments in the country and about peace, in the wake of the  emergence of the so-called Rombezia [Rovuma-Zambezia] grouping.  Palmo says Rombezia is headed by militants of the ruling Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party who, together with Gimo  Phiri, have been forcibly recruiting youths, training and arming  them. The communique says Rombezia stems from a Frelimo  maneuver aimed at disrupting the elections scheduled for October.    We spoke to Domingos Sande, a member of the Frelimo Party's  Provincial Committee and head of its Organization Department.  Sande says he regrets Palmo's attitude in disseminating, quote,  a shameless lie, unquote. He said the communique is completely  false, noting that Frelimo stands for national unity, whereas  Rombezia is for secession.    [Begin Sande recording] As reported, Rombezia is a movement  with separatist tendencies. That is against the Frelimo Party's  policy. Actually, we have already informed the Central  Committee and the issue was debated at its last session. We  have been working with the government to disband the group.  [end recording]</p>

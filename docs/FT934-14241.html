			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity National Power and PowerGen have sensibly kept a low profile in the most recent debate about the future of coal. The two generating companies did nicely from the deal struck in March, and the reduction in coal stocks will allow them to reduce working capital substantially in coming years. There was, however, an expectation that they would take extra coal to support some mines, and while the encroachment of competing fuels provides some excuse, their reluctance to do so will have won them few political friends. That comes at a time when electricity pool prices and the generators' market dominance is under investigation by the regulator. He is under pressure to act against the generators because spot prices have risen. National Power and PowerGen can point to their declining market share, but they still control all of the marginal plant which dictates the pool price. If the regulator decides that such market power is unacceptable he faces a choice of devising a market solution to solve it or making a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Cynics have suggested that no reference will take place while the government still wants to sell its 40 per cent stake in the generators. Yet a reference remains a real possibility since market solutions will not be easy to find. Those who are pencilling in a secondary share offer for next July may just be in for a disappointment.</p>

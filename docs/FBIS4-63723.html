			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that  statements by different Russian politicians towards Ukraine were  "not in conformity with international standards." For instance,  Kravchuk criticized the statement of Russian Kremlin Chief of  Staff Sergey Filatov who had suggested that development of the  Crimean conflict was beneficial for the presidential structures  in Kiev since they were interested in postponement of the  presidential elections.    Kravchuk wondered whether this was a personal point of view  of Filatov or the official position of the Russian leadership.    Commenting on the recent statement by Russian President  Boris  Yeltsin who had warned Kravchuk that no force must be used in  Crimea, Kravchuk said that the president could warn his own  structures but not the president of other state. Kravchuk said  that such warning also contradicted "international standards."    Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine was acting in accordance  with  the Ukrainian constitution.</p>

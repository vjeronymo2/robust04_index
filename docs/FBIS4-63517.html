			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 22 May -- The autonomy's Ukrainian  parties held a meeting at the officers' house. The meeting  established Crimea's shadow parliament, the Civic Council of  Crimea. The parliament is elected from 66 constituencies  according to the majoritarian system: groups of citizens who  support Ukraine's statehood and territorial integrity nominate  candidates from parties of the same political stand.    It is planned that the parliament will have 98 seats divided  between parties. The following parties will nominate candidates  to the parliament: the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian  Republican Party, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Crimean  branch of the People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], the  All-Crimean Prosvita Society, the Society of Teachers and  Educators, the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian National  Assembly, the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea, the Vasyl Stus  Memorial Society, and the Organization of the Crimean-Tatar  National Movement. The newly established parliament, the  meeting said, is not pro-Ukrainian by nature. It is a  multiethnic parliament that supports Ukrainian statehood.    According to the approved program documents, the Civic  Council of Crimea is a representative body of Crimean residents  who regard themselves as citizens of Ukraine and do not  recognize independent Crimean statehood. The participants of  the meeting approved the principles according to which the  shadow parliament is formed. The parliament aims to help the  deputies of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments work out  legislation, conduct expert appraisal of Crimean laws, and their  accordance with the Ukrainian constitution.</p>

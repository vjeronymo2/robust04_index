			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALL IN THE TRADE DEFICIT DECLINE SPELLS WOES FOR U.S.  </P> <P> The outsized U.S. trade deficit, which declined smartly last year, is leveling  off at an ominously high plateau.  </P> <P> Even the most optimistic forecasts show it shrinking only marginally for the  rest of this year, and some studies predict that it will soon start heading  back up.  </P> <P> "Some very disturbing trends already are in place," said William Cline of the  Institute for International Economics.  </P> <P> The causes are wide ranging: from the stubbornly strong dollar to the low U.S.  saving rate, from American consumers' insatiable appetite for imports to  American manufacturers' traditional reluctance to export.  </P> <P> And the possible consequences are alarming: upward pressure on prices, new  turmoil in financial markets and, ultimately, the end of the U.S. economic  expansion, which is now in its seventh year.  </P> <P> But the prescriptions for reducing the trade deficit further are not  particularly appetizing either. The United States could push the dollar's value  down further, which would increase the attractiveness abroad of U.S. products  but would aggravate inflation. Or it could intentionally slow the economy  enough to curb the appetite for imports.  </P> <P> "The trade-offs now are all bad," said David D. Hale, chief economist of Kemper  Financial Services in Chicago. "Anything that policy- makers do to deal with  the problem is likely to be painful."  </P> <P> Four years ago, by contrast, the cure for the growing trade deficit seemed  clear -- a cheaper dollar. The highly valued dollar had made imports cheap in  the United States and U.S. goods expensive abroad.  </P> <P> The dollar began declining in 1985 and, after a longer-than-expected lag, the  trade deficit finally shrank markedly in 1988 to $120 billion, down more than  20% from the record $152 billion the year before. It was the smallest annual  trade deficit since 1984.  </P> <P> Already, however, improvements in the trade deficit have stopped, and the  monthly merchandise trade deficit has been stuck on a plateau for about six  months. The Commerce Department reported recently that the trade deficit for  February widened to $10.5 billion, up from $8.7 billion the previous month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollar Relatively Stable  </P> <P> At the rate of the first two months of the year, the 1989 trade deficit will  reach about $114 billion, only a slight improvement from 1988.  </P> <P> The stall-out can be traced to a host of factors:  </P> <P> Although the dollar's value has declined dramatically from its peak in early  1985, it has remained relatively stable for the past 20 months. Thus, U.S.  goods have gained no price advantage for that long in their competition with  foreign products.  </P> <P> Despite some recent signs of a slowdown in the economy, Americans are still  consuming far more than they produce and relying on imports to make up the  difference.  </P> <P> Many popular consumer items, such as videocassette recorders, are not made in  the United States. Likewise, many of the capital goods that industry needs for  expansion -- essential items such as machine tools and electronic equipment --  can only be purchased abroad.  </P> <P> Many U.S. industries -- such as chemical producers and pulp and paper  manufacturers -- are operating at flank speed and cannot move to boost  production quickly enough to take advantage of export markets. Many U.S. firms  have been reluctant to spend money to increase their production capacity until  they become convinced that the overseas market will last.  </P> <P> Oil prices are rising again, increasing the dollar value of the goods that the  United States imports. Although the value of oil imports fell $3.4 billion in  1988, it is expected to rise $10 billion this year and another $8 billion in  1990.  </P> <P> Finally, Americans are not saving enough to finance what the country needs to  invest in new production facilities. As a result, America -- both the  government and individuals as well -- must borrow the difference. And to be  able to cash in their foreign money, they must use it to buy goods and services  from abroad.  </P> <P> Any serious move to help bring the trade deficit down further is likely to  spawn problems of its own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fed May Push Rates Up  </P> <P> Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington,  warns that pushing the dollar's value down much further would add to inflation  by raising import prices significantly. And a cheaper dollar, he says, would  make it even easier for foreign investors to buy U.S. firms and real estate at  bargain prices.  </P> <P> At the same time, Lawrence points out, a cheaper dollar would discourage  foreign investments in U.S. stocks and bonds because their rates of return  would decline with the dollar. That would deprive the U.S. economy of an  important source of funds.  </P> <P> To prevent the dollar from plummeting, the Federal Reserve might feel obliged  to push interest rates up, even though that would slow the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Another possible solution is to reduce the federal budget deficit. That would  free up more domestic savings for more productive investments than Treasury  securities and at the same time it would curb Americans' appetite for imports  by having a depressing effect on the economy.  </P> <P> But if imports fell too sharply, that could seriously hurt the economies of  such U.S. allies as Taiwan and South Korea, which depend heavily on sales to  the United States. That is why economists prefer to narrow the trade gap by  raising exports rather than lowering imports.  </P> <P> "We've essentially run out of options," Barry P. Bosworth, a Brookings  Institution economist, said.  </P> <P> Not all analysts find the long-term outlook so bleak.  </P> <P> "While it is admittedly true that there has been a certain marking of time in  the rate at which these external imbalances are being reduced, the basic trend  remains one of encouraging improvement," said Satoshi Sumita, the governor of  the Bank of Japan.  </P> <P> Paul R. Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, believes  that it is too early to tell whether the improvement in the trade deficit has  stalled. He points out that the combination of the lower dollar and stable  wages have made the United States an inexpensive place in which to produce,  compared with most other industrial countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reindustrialization'  </P> <P> "No matter what the econometric models say, it's hard to see why, given a  little time, U.S. firms shouldn't shift their production facilities back to the  United States," he said. "If they do that soon, over the long haul, you'd find  that our exports would increase."  </P> <P> Krugman already sees some evidence that the impact of the weaker dollar is  slowly bringing about "a fundamental reindustrialization" in this country that  eventually will see American firms moving back into industries they once  abandoned.  </P> <P> "The problem is, the things you could do quickly in that line are pretty well  exhausted," Krugman said. "You have to allow a five-year time horizon for any  change. The dollar must stay where it is during that period, and people must be  confident that it's going to stay."  </P> <P> But many economists find little room for hope. Hale says the stall-out seems  almost certain to push the dollar lower as currency investors lose confidence  in the future of the U.S. economy. To prop up the dollar, he says, the Fed will  raise interest rates here at home.  </P> <P> That, he predicts, will "almost guarantee stagflation" -- the kind of slow  growth and high inflation that characterized the 1970s. "There's no question,"  he says, "that the stall-out is here."  </P></p>

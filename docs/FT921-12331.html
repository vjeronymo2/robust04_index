			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Poland secures vital gas deal from Moscow POLAND has won a new agreement with Russia which should guarantee gas supplies and get Polish heavy industry working again, an embassy official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Ms Agnes Niszesta, Polish embassy press attache in Moscow, said yesterday Russia had agreed to provide Poland with 7.6bn cubic metres of natural gas in 1992, below a previous agreement for 8.1bn but above an earlier offer of 6.1bn. 'It is not as much as we wanted, but enough for our industry,' she said. New gas supplies would start to arrive from February 1. All of Poland's heavy industry and most of its chemical plants have been idle since last week because of gas shortages caused by lower Russian supplies and higher demand for energy as temperatures fell. The 180 large-scale idle factories, which account for 70 per cent of Polish industrial gas consumption, were using just enough gas to prevent damage to machinery from freezing temperatures. Household users of gas have not been affected by the cuts but their increased usage in the cold weather has depleted supplies to industry. Steel mills and fertiliser plants have been the worst hit, although these sectors had already sharply lowered production over the past two years as a result of Poland's recession. Ms Niszesta said the new deal was sealed in Moscow this week after an emergency meeting between Russian authorities and Mr Adam Glapinski, the Polish foreign trade minister The original deal, agreed in December and worth about Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.5bn), guaranteed Poland supplies of 8.1bn cubic metres of natural gas and 5m tonnes of oil in 1992 in return for food, sulphur, coal and medicines. But Russia cut gas deliveries on January 1, days after the barter deal had been agreed. Poland is sensitive to any disruption of gas supplies from Russia as it depends entirely on a pipeline network inherited from the now-defunct Soviet-led Comecon trade organisation. Gas supplies have been running at some 45 per cent below agreed levels since the beginning of the year. Gas imports reached 7bn cubic metres last year, with deliveries restricted to pipelines linking Poland with the Siberian gas fields. Alternative supplies are impossible until new pipelines are built to the North Sea oil and gas fields. Talks with Statoil the Norwegian supplier are expected soon. The position on oil is not quite as worrying as the Soviet Union accounts for just 57 per cent of Polish oil imports. However, deliveries from the Soviet Union ceased altogether last month after only 125,000 tonnes out of an agreed 5m tonnes for the year had been delivered. Poland has alternative supplies of oil from Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as the North Sea, all of which can come be pumped through the Gdansk oil terminal on the Baltic. Last year Poland imported 11.5m tonnes of oil, with 6.5m coming from the former Soviet Union.</p>

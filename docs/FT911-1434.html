			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Letter: Marks and Spencer and a question of philosophy Sir, The reasons given in your article ('Marks and Spencer adopts a harsh diet', April 30) for the 850 job losses in Marks and Spencer were sadly unconvincing. With the advantages of customer and employee loyalty, huge investment in information technology and low payroll costs as a percentage of sales revenue, it is not at all surprising to learn that profits will be up on last year despite trouble in the High Street elsewhere. What is surprising is that the cuts should be explained by lame statements about industrial trends and lack of immunity from recession. Such words cut no ice. The fact is that these are policy cuts called for by the new hard man at the top and designed to reposition the company as an employer and with the cuts go the career hopes of hundreds of bright young graduates, each courted by the company and attracted by its universal reputation as an employer, many with several years service backed by further training and periodic assessment. To move the goalposts at this stage of their careers is callous enough: to refer to them in as 'a lot of dead wood which is now being thrown overboard' is unforgivable. How sad that the new chairman has departed so savagely from the philosophy of his illustrious predecessor. In 'Don't Ask the Price', Lord Sieff wrote that 'the improvement of good relations in the working place' was one of three things he would continue to strive for in the September of his life. The April of Mr Greenbury's chairmanship may well become the winter of discontent for the erstwhile flagship of the retail sector. A L Dowding, Radley College, Abingdon, Oxon OX14 2HR</p>

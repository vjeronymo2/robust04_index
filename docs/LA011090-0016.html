			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD AND BLACK AMERICANS  </P> <P> Benjamin Stein raises very significant issues in his article, "Why Can't We  Cheer for Black Americans?" (California Commentary, Dec. 25). He has correctly  pointed out that African Americans are still stereotyped and defamed by the  electronic media.  </P> <P> Stein focuses on the vilification of black people in the movies and on  television shows. It is our belief, however, that the most devastating images  are presented daily on prime-time and late-night news programs. Three brief  examples should make the point:  </P> <P> 1. In spite of the fact that Robert Dupont, former director of the National  Institute of Drug Abuse, has publicly declared that 80% of America's drug  abusers are white and only 14% are black, virtually all news reports on drugs  center on the black community.  </P> <P> 2. Although the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (1989) reveals that whites committed  71% of all juvenile crimes in this country in 1988, the major networks focused  most of their attention on black street gangs and vandals.  </P> <P> 3. Following the recent earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area it was widely  reported that roving gangs in predominately black West Oakland were taking  advantage of the chaos by looting. What police thought to be looting turned out  to have been black youths rescuing victims of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway. The  officers apologized for the mistaken reports, but few news programs retracted  the much-publicized tale.  </P> <P> Whether on the movie set, in the TV studio or in the newsrooms, conscious  decisions are made on a daily basis to perpetuate the degradation of African  Americans. The resultant negative depiction of black people in the media is  largely responsible for the rising tide of racism in this country today.  </P> <P> LEGRAND H. CLEGG II  </P> <P> Chairman, Coalition Against Black Exploitation  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

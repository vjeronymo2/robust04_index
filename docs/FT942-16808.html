			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Lottery criminal checks planned The National Lottery Office has found that a number of directors of companies associated with bids to run the UK's national lottery have criminal convictions that they failed to disclose, Raymond Snoddy writes. All eight bidders yesterday received letters saying that some people had not made the full and detailed disclosure required. Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the lottery, who is expected to announce the winner of the licence next month, has stressed the importance of probity in all aspects of the lottery. Yesterday's letters do not specify which bids involved directors with apparently undeclared convictions. The lottery has asked all bidders for permission to approach all those involved so that the information it has can be 'confirmed or negated'. The lottery, to be launched late this year or early next, is designed to raise money for five 'good causes' in equal proportion - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport.</p>

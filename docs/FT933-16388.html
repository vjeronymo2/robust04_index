			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Exeter's benefits bypass investors - Doing the Splits HAS Exeter Preferred Capital investment trust been a success or a failure? Much depends on your point of view. The managers have been able to increase the assets by 34.3 per cent, to 128.9p per share, since the launch in January 1992. But investors have scarcely seen the benefit; the share price is now 101p, just 1p above the issue figure. Exeter Preferred is not strictly a split capital trust. Technically, it has only one class of share; its zero coupon security is a debenture rather than a preference share. But it invests exclusively in the shares of split capital trusts. Its fortunes (and that of its investors) are tied up with those of the split capital sector. And its manager, Ian Henderson Associates, specialises in split capital trusts and has launched a range of unit and investment trusts devoted to the split sector. At launch time, the idea behind Exeter Preferred sounded clever. It would invest in high-yielding income shares and zero dividend preference shares of split capital trusts. Then, it would make annual provision for the rise in the value of its zero debenture and offset this, for tax purposes, against its dividend income. Benefits would be twofold: tax efficiency, since the trust would pay tax on only a small part of its income; and enhanced performance, since the 'interest' on the zero is not actually cash flow and can, thus, be re-invested. Furthermore, while the zero debenture increased in value at 11.15 per cent a year, the trust's aim was to invest in other zeros yielding 11.5 per cent a year and income shares (yielding 15 per cent). The result would be to 'gear up' the return on the ordinary shares to 13.5 per cent a year. Shareholders, however, would find that this return did not come as income because the trust would be retaining its income for the tax-efficient reasons described previously. So, the return would be as capital gain, and the managers felt confident enough to predict a final net asset value, in 2002, of 340p a share. In other words - as the trust's broker, Greig Middleton, said in a research note at launch time - the ordinary shares were 'designed to look and behave like zeros.' All this might have been extremely sophisticated but problems occurred very early in the trust's life. As the UK recession continued to bite, it became clear that many companies were being forced to cut their dividends. In turn, that raised doubts on whether split capital trust income shares could maintain and increase their dividends. The prices of income shares fell by 20 per cent between January and October 1992. That had a direct impact on Exeter Preferred's portfolio; by October 1992, the net asset value had dropped to 85p. While income shares were falling, zeros were rising and, indeed, the trust's own zero debenture was still growing relentlessly at 11.15 per cent a year. Accordingly, in September last year the trust changed its strategy. It sold some of its holding in zeros and used the money to 'de-gear' by paying off Pounds 6m of its own zero debenture. This might have led to confusion about its aims. David Thomas, of Greig Middleton, wrote recently: 'EPC's simple arithmetic of adding an assured dividend return to a rolled-up dividend yield has subtly given place to something different. 'The zeroes remain safety ballast but there is now a considerably geared exposure to heavily-geared hybrid income and capital shares. EPC will depend much more on the movements in equity prices than it did at inception.' Now, the portfolio is divided between zeros (42 per cent); old-style income shares - those which have a fixed repayment value (30 per cent); geared income shares (18 per cent), and capital shares (9 per cent). The good news is that prices of both income shares and zeros have rebounded very heavily since sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, and the subsequent falls in interest rates. The trust decided to increase its gearing in June by raising Pounds 7m in the form of a bank loan, yielding 8.37 per cent. Thus, it has, effectively, replaced part of the zero debenture with cheaper debt. So why, given some of the positive events of recent months, is the trust at such a wide discount of 21 per cent? Perhaps it is the structure, which might be perceived as too clever by half. Perhaps it is because shares, which apparently were devised to behave like zeros, have not done so. Certainly, the Budget change to advance corporation tax did not help. By reducing the tax credit on dividends, it hit the core strategy of Exeter: the re-investment of gross dividends. Can Exeter come back into favour? 'There is the prospect of the discount narrowing once investors realise the potential of the trust for turning high-yielding income shares into capital gain,' says Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities. 'But they should also understand the risks. The interest rate effect which boosted the zeros in the portfolio could work the other way. However, on balance, the trust should provide a good total return - at least equal to the market - over time. ' Key facts Exeter Preferred has total assets of Pounds 63m, and is due to be wound up in 2002. The annual management fee of Ian Henderson Associates is 0.3 per cent of gross assets, subject to a minimum of Pounds 30,000 a quarter. Board Chairman Timothy Kimber is a former executive director of Lazard Brothers. Other directors are Peregrine Banbury, head of the investment department at Coutts; David Brooke, a director of JO Hambro; Peregrine Moncrieffe, chief executive of Buchanan Partners; and Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, managing director of Victoria Palace Theatre. Savings scheme and Pep details There is no savings scheme. The trust shares are Pepable via a self-select plan. This is the last in our series on split capital investment trusts. Next week, we begin a series on unit trusts.</p>

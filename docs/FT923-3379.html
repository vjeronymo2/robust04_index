			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Man in the News: Ex-monk on a motorcycle - Peter Middleton When Lloyd's of London began the search for a new chief executive, it can hardly have expected that a motor-cycling ex-monk from Middlesbrough would be the best man for one of the insurance market's top jobs. As Lloyd's struggles to emerge from one of the most difficult periods in its 300-year history, the choice of Mr Peter Middleton, a 52-year-old former diplomat and businessman who lacks any experience of the insurance business, might seem curious, even risky. But Mr Middleton, a tall, clean-cut, tanned and self-confident figure, may be what Lloyd's needs at this turbulent time, though his background and style set him apart from other senior figures at Lloyd's, and most of the Names, the individuals who stake their personal wealth on the market's fortunes. From a working-class family on Teesside (his father was a foreman at an ICI chemicals plant) Mr Middleton speaks with a Geordie accent and says he has an 'unrequited love affair' with his home-town football club, Middlesbrough FC. He also professes a passion for motorbikes. This week he has travelled to interviews on a Suzuki 800cc Easy Rider-style machine. Educated at a local Catholic grammar school, he later joined a monastery in Paignton, Devon, run by a small French monastic order, the Society of Mary. 'It was something I felt attracted to. I'm immensely pleased that I did. It was a real education,' says Mr Middleton, who adds that he retains his religious convictions in a 'private kind of way'. After the monastery came a year in Paris studying philosophy at the Sorbonne, where Mr Middleton acquired fluency in French, and three years at Hull University, where he read social studies. His education left him with a lasting appetite for literature - he is currently re-reading Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility - as well as an ability to survive on three to four hours' sleep a night. 'A bloke would ring a bell at some unholy hour and I would stagger down to matins,' he says, adding he can make do 'with two hours a night but not for more than a fortnight'. Many Names would consider his lifestyle austere, perhaps spartan. He does not have a house in the country, living with his wife and three children in Twickenham, south-west London; he never drinks alcohol on 'work premises' and runs, on average, 30 miles a week. Like his early life, his career defies easy categorisation. After graduating from Hull in 1969, Mr Middleton joined the foreign service, spending two years in Indonesia and two in Tanzania, before returning to London. Between 1977 and 1982 he was senior British embassy counsellor in Paris, where he became acquainted with Labour and Conservative government officials. His diplomatic skills will be useful at Lloyd's, where he will need to come to terms with the market's complex politics and byzantine structure. Mr Middleton has personal warmth as well as tact, says Sir John Trelawny of Godard Kay Rogers, the recruitment agency. 'That will serve him well in a market where relations between the corporation (which administers and provides back-up services) and the market (the agents and syndicates) have been slightly scratchy.' Negotiating skills will also be helpful in dealing with those Names facing financial ruin as a result of Lloyd's recent record losses. But it is Mr Middleton's experience in business that made the case for his appointment so strong. At 45, he was recruited to Midland Bank by the French ex-Midland banker, Mr Herve de Carmoy, who wanted to see if top British civil servants could work equally well in the private sector, like some of their French counterparts. He then spent two years at Midland International, before joining Thomas Cook, Midland Bank's travel subsidiary, in December 1987. Midland had rescued Thomas Cook from British Rail in 1972, but the company had lost its way and staff were demoralised and directionless. 'There was no sense of purpose that I could detect. There were independent pockets of excellence but they'd decided to go unilateral,' says Mr Middleton, assessing the mood of pessimism prevalent at Thomas Cook when he joined. He decided to expand business in Europe and North America and develop new specialist leisure and business travel areas. Mr Middleton moved the group into retail foreign exchange dealing. Layers of senior management were discarded and specialist teams recruited to implement the plans. The changes aggravated problems in the short term, but there is general agreement that they paved the way for the revival in Thomas Cook's fortunes. Mr Middleton was negotiating the successful sale of Thomas Cook to a German consortium comprising West Deutsche Landesbank and one of Germany's largest charter airlines when he was approached by Lloyd's. 'When I was first approached, to say I was surprised is an understatement. I couldn't take it seriously. I couldn't imagine I'd be offered the job,' he says. Yet despite the obvious differences of size and business, the outside headhunters and the Lloyd's committee responsible for recruitment were intrigued by the similarities between Thomas Cook and the insurance market. Both are world-famous British brand names. Thomas Cook's business was in decline, so is Lloyd's. And like Thomas Cook, Lloyd's is embarking on a change of strategy. Last year a task force of senior market professionals mapped out a five- to 10-year blueprint for Lloyd's, designed to reduce costs, increase competitiveness and reverse the loss of market share in reinsurance and commercial insurance. Mr David Rowland, who headed the task force, is to become chairman of Lloyd's in January and, as head of a newly created market board, Mr Middleton will work closely with him in refining the strategy and persuading the market to back it. This will be his first task. It will prove difficult, but it is a challenge Mr Middleton relishes. When he was steering a new course at Thomas Cook, he says, he thrived on the pressure. There will be no shortage of that at Lloyd's.</p>

Liu Fangren pointed out that the province at present should  devote great efforts to the following aspects with regard to  united front work:    1. It is necessary to uphold and perfect the multi-party  cooperation and political consultation system under the CPC's  leadership, and to do a really good job in fostering, selecting,  appointing, and employing non-CPC personalities. Party  committees, governments, and organs concerned at all levels must  wholeheartedly and effectively serve democratic parties and  other non-CPC personalities in all circles and help them solve  actual problems.    2. It is necessary to work really hard to win the support of  representative personalities of the nonpublic economic sector,  with a view to promoting the development of the non-state-owned  economy in the province.    3. It is necessary to attach great importance to nationality  and religious affairs. Party committees and governments at all  levels must take the initiative in selecting, fostering, and  employing cadres from minority nationalities in accordance with  the guideline laid down in the documents concerned issued by the  central authorities. To do a good job in handling religious  affairs, all localities must comprehensively implement the  party's policy toward religions and should do a better job in  safeguarding normal religious activities. At the same time, all  localities must make greater efforts to do a still better job in  united front work abroad, to extend the united front, to unite  with the vast number of Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao  compatriots, and overseas Chinese, thus contributing to the  economic development of the province.    In his speech, Liu Fangren demanded that party committees at  all levels strengthen leadership over united front work, really  attach great importance to united front work, and place it on  important agenda, thus making greater contributions to the  economic prosperity of the province.</p>

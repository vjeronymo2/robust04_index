PLO Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah said the  committee decided at its meeting last night to continue its  suspension of the talks with the Israeli side and not to resume  them before securing adequate protection for the Palestinian  people.    A high-level Palestinian source said that Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  the head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks and  'Arafat's political adviser, will leave for Washington within  hours on an assignment from the PLO leadership to explore the  aim of the U.S. invitation to move the talks to Washington. The  source added that Sha'th will explain to the U.S. Administration  the Palestinian side's concern over the failure to meet a  request to provide protection for the Palestinian people under  occupation. The official described the U.S. stance as bad and  said it was worse than the Israeli position.    Ghawshah said that the PLO Executive Committee has rejected  the Israeli proposals and offers because they do not meet its  basic demand of providing protection for the Palestinians. He  added that the PLO also rejected the Israeli proposals to resume  the negotiations because there are new realities and the  circumstances created by the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron  need radical remedies.    Ghawshah declared: We are waiting for Israeli measures that  will deal with the essential problem which is the settlements.    He noted that the PLO has not yet made a decision whether to  accept or decline U.S. President Clinton's proposal to move the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to Washington and that this  issue is under intensive discussion among the Palestinian  leaders to explore the aim behind the proposal, whether it will  give impetus to the peace talks, and the possible role that the  United States can play in these talks.    Ghawshah added that the PLO decided to conduct a series of  consultations and communications with the Arabs and other  concerned parties.    Head of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi and Fatah  Central Committee member Abu-Mahir Ghunaym are due to visit  Damascus today for discussions with Syrian officials about the  peace negotiations.    An envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin is also due to  arrive in Tunis later today to discuss the latest developments  of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.    'Arafat earlier sent a message to Indonesian President and  the president of the Nonaligned Movement Suharto asking for an  urgent and immediate meeting of the movement's Palestine Bureau  or Presidency Bureau to discuss the implications of the Israeli  massacre, possible international protection for the  Palestinians, disarming the Zionist settlers.    'Arafat also sent a message to Senegalese President Abdou  Diouf, current chairman of the Islamic Conference Organization  [ICO], asking for an urgent meeting of the ICO chairmanship  bureau to discuss the implications of the Israeli massacre of  the Palestinian citizens, the need to provide international  protection for the Palestinians, and disarming the settlers.    The PLO Executive Committee will continue its discussions of  the position that it will adopt on the peace negotiations and  the U.S. proposal to move them to Washington. It has been  learned that the Palestinian leaders will not make any decision  until the Security Council issues a resolution about the Hebron  incident.    It has also been learned that during last night's meeting  sharp arguments took place and diverse attitudes surfaced. A  considerable number of the Executive Committee members demanded  that the negotiations continue to be suspended, and perhaps  boycotted. This group rejects the U.S. proposal to move the  talks to Washington unless the Palestinian demands are met.    Meanwhile, 'Arafat and several other members urged patience  before making a final response to the U.S. proposal, suspending  the negotiations for a certain period, perhaps for a week, but  not boycotting them so that it might be possible to resume them  after the Palestinian anger cools down. The Palestinian public  is demanding a boycott of the negotiations and even abolishing  the agreement reached with Israel.    'Arafat, who wishes to resume the talks on condition that  several Palestinian demands are met, is in a difficult position  after Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon declared they were boycotting  the Washington talks to protest the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.  They said they will not resume the talks until after the  Palestinians do so.</p>

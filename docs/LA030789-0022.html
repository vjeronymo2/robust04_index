			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI OFFICIALS MAKE FINAL PITCH FOR SCHOOL BOND MEASURES  </P> <P> Simi Valley school officials are making a last-minute effort to get out the  vote and win passage of $43 million in school bonds when voters go to the polls  today for a special election.  </P> <P> The vote caps an aggressive campaign to inform voters of the 27-school  district's need for more money for a new set of three R's -- renovation,  rehabilitation and restoration -- to go along with reading, writing and  arithmetic, said Chet Howe, assistant to the superintendent.  </P> <P> Howe said volunteers telephoned voters Monday night and will be poll-watching  and telephoning this afternoon as well to remind people to vote in favor of  Measure A and Measure B.  </P> <P> A $35-million bond issue failed by 147 votes in April, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Citizens Committee  </P> <P> A citizens committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 volunteers  and raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay for other  campaign expenses.  </P> <P> "If someone needs a ride to the polls, we're going to take them there," Howe  said. "If someone needs a reminder to vote, they're going to get a call."  </P> <P> Ironically, property tax rates will actually go down if both measures pass.  Legislation sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and signed  into law last month extends the district's repayment of its existing state  loans.  </P> <P> As a result, even with payments for the new bonds, the annual school taxes on a  $100,000 home would drop from $113 per year to $88 per year. Tax rates would  drop again after 1994, when the state loan is to be repaid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $35 Million  </P> <P> Measure A, if passed, would provide the district with $35 million, much of  which would be spent on air conditioning and heating. The rest of the money  would be spent on plumbing, roofing and asphalt repairs.  </P> <P> Measure B, which will not go into effect unless Measure A is also approved,  would provide the district with $8 million to construct three new junior high  school gymnasiums and an auditorium at a fourth junior high.  </P> <P> Each measure must be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to gain  passage. No organized opposition to the bond issues has emerged during the  campaign.  </P> <P> "We think we are going to be successful," Howe said. "We feel that this year we  have informed more people on more issues and we hope they understand the needs  and will rally around their community responsibility."  </P></p>

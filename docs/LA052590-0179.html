			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GAO'S REPORT TO SENATE FAILS TO BACK IOWA BLAST THEORY;  </P> <P> TESTS FAIL TO BACK FINDING OF SABOTAGE IN FATAL IOWA BLAST  </P> <P> Congressional investigators said today that their tests did not support the  Navy's finding that sabotage caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard  the battleship Iowa.  </P> <P> The congressional report, which came a day after the Navy reopened its  investigation into the disaster, said the explosion could have resulted from  gunpowder bags in the ship's guns being rammed at "higher than normal speeds."  </P> <P> The report was presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee by the General  Accounting Office, which investigated the Navy's controversial finding that  gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig probably sabotaged the battleship in the April  19, 1989, explosion.  </P> <P> Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said today's testimony by  the GAO report "cast grave doubts on the Navy's findings" that foreign material  had been found in the gun barrel.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to the GAO report, said he would  "reserve judgment" until further investigation.  </P> <P> "They did the best job they could. Now there's new evidence, new information  that warrants reopening the investigation," Cheney said. "But I think at this  point I'd want to keep my powder dry, so to speak, until we have a better sense  of exactly what this new information may contribute."  </P> <P> Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, who attended the hearing, told reporters: "My  brother was only a victim . . . I hope after today this will get rid of any  doubt in anyone's mind."  </P> <P> Retired Adm. Fred Moosally, the Iowa's skipper at the time of the explosion and  an outspoken critic of the investigation, sat in the front row during the  hearing. But he declined to comment, saying, "I'm only here to listen."  </P> <P> The Navy said it would have no immediate comment. But on Thursday, it ordered a  halt to any firing of 16-inch guns aboard the service's four battleships after  an "unexplained" ignition of some gunpowder bags during testing.  </P> <P> Nunn said the GAO finding "will essentially eviscerate the Navy's conclusion"  that the explosion aboard the Iowa was the result of a wrongful, intentional  act.  </P> <P> The GAO said tests at the Sandia National Laboratory "could not corroborate the  Navy's technical finding that an improvised chemical device initiated the  explosion."  </P> <P> Last fall, the Navy said Hartwig, who was killed in the explosion, "most  probably" had placed "some type of detonation device" between gunpowder bags  when he supervised the loading of the warship's guns.  </P> <P> The GAO analysis made no mention specifically of Hartwig in its report.  </P> <P> The report said the Sandia Laboratory was "confident in its findings."  </P></p>

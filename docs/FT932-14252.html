			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Happy with the boss Working in a small business is often thought to involve poor working conditions and putting up with an autocratic boss. But a survey* of small firms in the services sector and their employees paints a more favourable picture. Ninety four per cent of employees said they got on well with their boss while three quarters of owner-managers said they had arrangements for consulting their staff. Most employees said supervision was not close, the researchers from Kingston Business School found. The survey covered 81 businesses and 175 employees in four business sectors: advertising, marketing and design; computer services; employment and secretarial agencies; and pubs, wine bars and restaurants. Six out of 10 employees said they received full pay when off sick while more than one in five had a company car. But pension schemes and paid holiday arrangements were less generous than the national average. Forty per cent of employers said they would resist recognising a union but nearly a third said they would not object if their employees wanted union representation. However, only a quarter of employees would join a union if the opportunity arose. One third of employees were part time and more than half were women. While most employers had no preference for either men or women, those who did expressed a preference for women, who were regarded as more hard-working and reliable. Nearly half of employers reported problems in finding suitable staff regardless of local unemployment levels. Few made use of agencies or job centres, preferring direct approaches and personal recommendation by existing employees. *Employment and Employment Relations in the Small Service Sector Enterprise, by James Curran and others.

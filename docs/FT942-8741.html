			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Jobless figure at lowest for two years The number of people out of work fell for the third consecutive month in all regions of Britain in April, taking the unemployment rate to its lowest level for two years. Unemployment fell by 36,800 in April compared with March, bringing the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed down to 2.682m, the Department of Employment yesterday said. This leaves unemployment running at 9.5 per cent of the total work force - almost a percentage point lower than last April's rate of 10.4 per cent. Coming after similar large drops in February and March, the figures also suggest that unemployment fell by more than 100,000 during the last three months, at an average monthly rate of 36,000. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, yesterday welcomed the figures as evidence that unemployment was on 'a firm downward trend' at an accelerating rate. One of the most significant falls, he said, had occurred in the 18- to 24-year-old age group, where unemployment had dropped by 61,100 in the last quarter, and by more than 100,000 in the past year. This trend was most marked among males aged between 20 and 24, with a drop in long term unemployment of 12 per cent in the last year. A drop in the number of young unemployed men is usually regarded by economists as a key sign of recovery. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, denounced the figures, claiming they concealed a 'huge army of missing millions' pushed off the social security register. 'Since January last year the number of unemployed people on benefit has indeed fallen by 289,000, but that does not mean that they are all finding work,' he said. This scepticism was echoed by some City economists, who pointed out that the drop in unemployment did not appear to be entirely matched by evidence of new job creation, not least because employment levels in production industry had actually fallen recently. Total employment in the manufacturing industries fell by 12,000 during March, while employment in the energy, water and supply industries was down by 5,000. However, this was partly offset by a growth in vacancies and overtime, analysts added. Seasonally adjusted vacancies at job centres rose by 5,300 to 145,900 in April, taking the number of vacancies to their highest level since October 1990. Hours worked per week in manufacturing industries rose to 9.72m in March, nearly 500,000 per week up on the previous month. As a result, Mr Leo Doyle, economist at Kleinwort Benson, said that most city analysts were now sufficiently convinced of the underlying downward trend that they were prepared to discount small doubts about the details. 'I think there is an element of exaggeration in these unemployment figures, but you can't dismiss them - the trend is clearly down,' Mr Doyle said. Meanwhile, the number of work stoppages in the 12 months to March fell to 168, the lowest level since the department began keeping records in 1920.  -------------------------------------------------     UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE  ------------------------------------------------- Northern Ireland                13.3 percent North                           11.4 percent North-west                       9.9 percent West Midlands                    9.8 percent Wales                            9.8 percent Yorks &amp; Humber                   9.7 percent Scotland                         9.4 percent South-east                       9.3 percent East Midlands                    8.9 percent South-west                       8.5 percent East Anglia                      7.3 percent UK                               9.5 percent  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  -------------------------------------------------</p>

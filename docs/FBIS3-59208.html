"I will withdraw my signature because I don't want to make  agreements with the People's Party," League official Roberto  Maroni announced, adding that if Segni "ever thought that the  League and the PPI could be together, he was fooling himself."    Maroni and Segni on Wednesday signed an accord that outlined  a government program but fell short of an official alliance for  the March 27 elections.    Segni today commented that the League was standing in the  way  of a broad anti-left alliance and, in apparent response to  Segni, Maroni said that "we were with the Pact and were not  three-way."    Maroni stressed the differences in political thinking  between  the People's Party and the program outlined in the agreement  between League and Pact, especially the part calling for direct  election of the prime minister.</p>

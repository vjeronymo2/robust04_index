			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Zulu factor South Africa's nightmare came a step closer on Monday. In the past, the country's political leaders have stepped back from the brink, but with an election barely a month away tensions are rising. The country's Transitional Executive Council, effectively South Africa's ruling coalition between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, is understandably tempted to take drastic action to ensure stability. One option is to declare a state of emergency in Natal, send in the security forces and effectively depose the man they hold responsible for the crisis: Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of KwaZulu homeland and leader of the predominantly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. Chief Buthelezi has decided to play the ethnic card, and it is a dangerous one. Zulus are by no means a monolithic voting bloc and it is probable that the ANC commands the allegiance of the majority of the electorate in Natal. But deeper passions are at play: a sense of nationhood, a wounded pride, a violent and belligerent past. Chief Buthelezi can readily exploit these characteristics, creating a situation in which political preference takes second place to blood loyalties. It is not illegitimate to base a political party on such an appeal. Ethnic loyalties remain a fundamental factor in African politics. The danger of such appeals come when they cannot be accommodated by the country's constitution. Chief Buthelezi is admittedly an infuriating negotiating partner and, judging by his administration of KwaZulu as a de facto one-party state, is not a democrat by nature. Yet his power to damage South Africa is out of proportion to the number of votes he can command. He cannot be allowed to exercise a veto over South Africa's search for a stable democracy. But the constitutional options which might lead to his participation in elections have not been exhausted. All parties have already agreed to submit the problem to international mediation. Little has been done, however, to put this agreement into effect. Until this is done, the TEC should stay its hand. There may come a time, if Chief Buthelezi refuses to co-operate, when government needs to intervene in the interests of ensuring an orderly election in Natal as well as elsewhere. But premature action could lead to disaster. Such advice runs counter to the prevailing mood in a country where politics has become a bloodsport conducted with as much subtlety as bear-baiting. There are those in the ANC anticipating a once-and-for-all victory over an adversary they loathe, taunting Chief Buthelezi with the threats of tanks in Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital. They should be restrained. Hasty use of force before all negotiating possibilities have been exhausted could play into Chief Buthelezi's hands and give him a cause around which to mobilise resistance for decades to come.</p>

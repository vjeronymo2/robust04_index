			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Mercury flight call Air UK will be the first European airline to offer its passengers a range of in-flight services via the Mercury Flightlink system when it is installed on selected routes early next year. The service, a digital air-to-ground communications system, will allow passengers to access a range of information services while in the air. As well as being able to make in-flight telephone calls, passengers can receive news, weather and financial reports and make hotel and car hire reservations. Travellers will access these services via a seat-back colour screen and an armrest mounted handset.</p>

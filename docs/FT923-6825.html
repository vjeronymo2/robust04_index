			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Credit insurer sees no upturn yet: Trade Indemnity is still not optimistic about a short-term UK recovery TRADE INDEMNITY, the leading trade credit insurer which closely mirrors the strength of the UK economy in its performance, offered businesses little hope for short-term recovery as it announced interim results yesterday. Mr Victor Jacob, managing director, said: 'Regrettably we cannot at this stage be optimistic. There will be an upturn at the earliest in spring 1993, and when it comes it will be slow and it will be tentative.' Trade Indemnity unveiled net claims down 14 per cent to Pounds 27.7m in the six months to June 30 and passed its dividend, in better-than-expected results. Provisions were Pounds 8.2m compared with Pounds 37.7m on the same period last year, while estimated underwriting losses for continuing operations were sharply downward, from Pounds 31.7m for the 1990 underwriting year to Pounds 9.4m for 1991. The results, which were unexpectedly brought forward by several weeks as part of a new management strategy, had little effect on the share price, which has fallen sharply during the year. It closed down 1p at 21p on the day. Mr Jacob said he believed the company's own performance would improve regardless of the extent of wider economic recovery. 'We would hope that 1992 will be rather better than 1991. We would be disappointed if we didn't see a major turnaround.' The change reflected the company's action to toughen underwriting procedures and raise premiums, as well as its clients adopting tighter credit control procedures, conducting less business or no longer taking out insurance. Mr Jacob said the number of claims for which Trade Indemnity had made provisions had fallen to 8,100 in the first six months of the year at an average of Pounds 6,300 each. This compared with 9,400 at Pounds 8,250 each for the same period last year. Gross premium income rose 2.3 per cent to Pounds 69.7m, and gross claims were down by 11 per cent to Pounds 72.2m. The company also announced that Mr Tony Brend, chief executive of Commercial Union, is to join the board, and will take over as non-executive chairman on the retirement of Mr Peter Dugdale next year. Mr Jacob said competition for business had intensified, particularly from Dutch and Belgian insurers, but Trade Indemnity still held more than four-fifths of UK trade credit insurance.

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> Use stakes to support the stalks of taller gladiolus or delphiniums.  </P> <P> Decorating the vegetable garden with marigold plantings seems to help keep  snails away because of the musky smell of the foliage.  </P> <P> If you're partial to Mexican food, plant some tomatillos in your garden this  year. They're a basic ingredient in salsa verde.  </P> <P> Try gerberas for a brilliant display of daisy-like flowers in a shaded border  as a container plant or for cut flowers.  </P> <P> If planting nasturtium seeds, they need total darkness, so be sure to cover the  seeds to a depth of one-quarter inch.  </P> <P> Planters that attach to the railing of an apartment or condo balcony allow  maximum use of limited space.  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Manchester City sees full listing as goal Details of Mr Francis Lee's takeover at Manchester City Football Club emerged yesterday as the premier league club confirmed that it intended to apply for a Stock Exchange listing. The shares are currently traded under Rule 535.2. Mr Lee, the club's former player and England international, has been appointed as chairman and Mr John Dunkerley and Mr Colin Barlow have been appointed directors. Former chairman Mr Peter Swales, has resigned as a director but has accepted an invitation as life president. Mr Lee has acquired 112,337 ordinary shares in the club from Mr Swales and Mr Stephen Boler at Pounds 13.35 per share. Together with concert parties, he now holds 224,998 shares, or 29.99 per cent of the voting share capital. Although Mr Lee will not make an offer for the entire share capital at this stage, he has undertaken to meet any obligation to make a general offer which might arise under the Takeover Code, as a result of any future share purchases or loan stock conversions. An extraordinary meeting will be asked to approve the issue of up to Pounds 4m of convertible unsecured loan stock at par. Mr Lee has agreed to subscribe for at least Pounds 3m of loan stock, which on conversion would result in the issue of up to 300,000 ordinary shares (28.6 per cent of enlarged voting capital). The funds will be used to meet working capital requirements and for player acquisitions and ground development. Mr Lee received a rapturous reception at the weekend from the club's Maine Road fans when the team, currently struggling near the bottom of the premiership, achieved only their second league win in four months, against Ipswich Town.</p>

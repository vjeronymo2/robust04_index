			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / France to push Serbsin Paris meeting PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand of France will host talks in Paris tomorrow between international mediators for a peace settlement in Bosnia and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in an attempt to hasten an agreement between the warring parties, it was announced in Paris yesterday. The meeting, which will take place shortly before the scheduled resumption of peace talks between the Bosnian Serbs, Moslems and Croats in New York, was called at the request of the two mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. A statement issued by Mr Mitterrand's office said that the purpose of the meeting would be to discuss in what way Serbia could help the peace process in the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, how to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan. It is not the first time Mr Milosevic has been called upon to put pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at a difficult moment in the peace process. It was thanks to the Serbian president's arm-twisting in Geneva last January, that Mr Karadzic accepted the first part of the Vance-Owen package, consisting of a constitutional framework for Bosnia. Ever since the talks moved from Geneva to New York at the beginning of February it has appeared probable that the mediators, faced with the intransigence of both the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, would again call upon President Milosevic at a crucial stage of the talks. With the Moslem president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, indicating that he might soon sign the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which Bosnia would be divided, the mediators have clearly decided that the moment for putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs has arrived. If President Izetbegovic signs the map next week, perhaps after a number of further small modifications, Mr Karadzic would be the only leader not to have endorsed the last outstanding part of the peace package.</p>

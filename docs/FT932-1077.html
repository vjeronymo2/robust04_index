			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / BA cuts cabin service standard BRITISH AIRWAYS, winner of a best airline food and wine prize, is having to make embarrassing refunds to business class passengers from Gatwick who are being served sandwiches instead of a full meal on some European services. It has been forced to downgrade its normal Club class service on some Gatwick flights because of a shortage of cabin crew and an unexpected upsurge in traffic. Disgruntled Club class passengers are being refunded the difference between their fare and the normal economy fare to compensate for the substandard meal service. Economy passengers are being given vouchers to buy refreshments at airports. A BA official said the airline had been a 'victim of its own success'. 'We just did not expect so much traffic on our new Gatwick services,' he explained, adding that BA was recruiting an additional 35 former Dan-Air employees to boost flight crews on the Gatwick services.</p>

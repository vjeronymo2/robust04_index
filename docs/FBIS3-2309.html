			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The Second Plenary  Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's leading  organization for united front work, opened in the Great Hall of  the People here this afternoon.    Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and central  government Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu  Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren attended today's meeting to  extend their greetings.    The meeting was presided over by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the  CPPCC National Committee, and attended by 1,860 CPPCC National  Committee members from all over China.    The meeting first examined and adopted an agenda for the  current session of the CPPCC National Committee. According to  the agenda, members of the national committee will: examine a  work report by the CPPCC National Committee; attend the second  plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)  as nonvoting delegates; deliberate draft amendments to the CPPCC  Constitution; discuss a report by the proposal sub-committee of  the CPPCC National Committee; examine various resolutions; and  elect new vice-chairmen, standing committee members and  secretary-general of the CPPCC National Committee.    Entrusted by the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National  Committee, CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairman Ye Xuanping  delivered a report on the work of the Standing Committee.    Ye said that since its first plenary session held a year  ago,  guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the CPPCC National Committee has been  exploring new ways to engage in political consultations and  exercise supervision over government work.    "The CPPCC National Committee is now playing a significant  role in China's political, economic and cultural life," he told  the meeting.    Ye described 1994 as a "year of vital importance" for  China's  reforms, opening up and modernization drive.    He called on all CPPCC organizations and members to hold  high  the banner of patriotism and socialism, work hard to help  implement the central task of the CPC and the government, and  better perform their duties of participating in political  consultations and exercising democratic supervision over  government work.    The CPPCC leader also called on these organizations and  members to improve their work efficiency and make greater  contributions to continued reforms, open policy implementation,  economic growth and social stability.    Attendants listened to an explanation on draft amendments to  the CPPCC constitution, which has played an important role in  creating a new situation in CPPCC work since its adoption in  1982.    However, given a changed situation brought about by reforms,  implementation of the open policy and the modernization drive,  and in view of new developments of CPPCC's own work, a number of  stipulations of the constitution stand in need of revision,  according to the explanation.    The draft amendments to the CPPCC constitution have been  adopted by the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee of the  CPPCC National Committee and are being submitted to the general  session for examination and adoption.</p>

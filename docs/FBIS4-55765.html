			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) will not change the tone of its campaign  preceding the May 29 run-off of the parliamentary elections.  Instead of slinging mud at its main rival, the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP), it strives to emphasize differences  between the two parties and demonstrate why it would be  advantageous for the country to vote for the Free Democrats,  SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a party meeting at Budaors today.    "The SZDSZ fared well in the first round and retained almost  all of its electoral base," Peto said, attributing his party's  success to its unique reliability and well-founded policy.    "In the first round, voters cast their ballots on parties  rather than candidates because they wanted to dismiss the  governing coalition. Now they will rather consider which  candidate would better fit the post," Peto said.    "For this reason, it would be advantageous for SZDSZ  candidates to expound their views to the broadest possible  audience, in various forums covered by local TV stations. In  this competition, the SZDSZ has excellent chances because it has  fielded plenty of highly qualified candidates," Peto said.</p>

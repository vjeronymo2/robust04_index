The delegation was given the authority "to  hold consultations with representatives of bodies of state power  and the socio-political forces of the Russian Federation."    The delegation includes 13 people, whose posts fully  correspond to the posts occupied by their colleagues in the  Russian delegation, Interfax learned from the Chechen  government. The Chechen delegation at the consultations will be  led by one of the vice-premiers Musa Dashukayev.

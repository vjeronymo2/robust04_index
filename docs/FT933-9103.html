			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Presidential election revives Chilean political dynasties: A look at the prospective candidates' lineage AFTER 17 years of military rule and more than three years of transition to democracy, a certain familiarity has returned to Chilean politics. The old family names that dominated public life for much of the century have resurfaced, as the son of one former president and the grandson of another prepare to do battle in December's presidential election. Four months before Chileans are due to go to the polls, the result is almost a foregone conclusion. Barring extraordinary mishap, Mr Eduardo Frei, son of the much-acclaimed president of 1964-70, will gain the presidency as head of the ruling Concertacion coalition of centre-left parties. For months, opinion polls have shown 42-year-old Mr Frei more than 40 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival. However, the gap is now likely to close, following the selection on Sunday of Mr Arturo Alessandri, grandson of one president and nephew of another, as the compromise candidate of the rightwing electoral pact, the Union for Chilean Progress. Chileans like 'trademark names', said Mr Alessandri shortly after gaining the nomination, and now they have two. The nomination of Mr Alessandri, 69 and considered by many a political lightweight, was largely a result of the rivalries that have plagued Chile's right since the handover to democracy. The two main opposition parties, Renovacion Nacional and the Union of Independent Democrats, could not agree on a common presidential candidate, allowing Mr Alessandri, an independent, to emerge as a compromise. It is a further sign of disarray among the opposition that Mr Jose Pinera, the architect of many of Chile's successful economic reforms and arguably the most respected rightwing politician, has deserted the electoral pact and is running his own presidential campaign. Mr Pinera, whose Ross Perot-type stance casts him in the role of 'anti-politician', has taken to sniping from sidelines, calling the pact 'marginal' to the presidential elections. Mr Frei, on the other hand, came through May primaries with consummate ease. After a period of friction within the Christian Democrat-dominated coalition, Mr Frei negotiated a deal with his main rival, the Socialist leader Mr Ricardo Lagos. Mr Frei inherits from President Patricio Aylwin, a fellow Christian Democrat, an economy that grew by 10.2 per cent last year, and the leadership of a coalition that has successfully stolen the right wing's thunder. Under Mr Aylwin, the Concertacion left virtually unaltered the liberal, export-led economic development model established under the regime of General Augusto Pinochet. The right, which used to suggest the Concertacion was incapable of applying the model successfully, has given up that attack after three years of exceptional economic growth. Its campaign has now moved on to issues of personal liberty, law and order and government bureaucracy. Diplomats say Mr Frei's main task was to keep a low profile and shy away from controversy. He has, they say, become an expert at not saying anything. He will instead stress continuity of policy and will pledge to deepen economic reform and extend its fruits to Chile's more than 3m poor. He has also promised to pay more attention to health and education, which have been neglected in recent years. The real interest of December's poll - the first handover from one democracy to another since 1970 - lies in the congressional elections, according to Mr Francisco Javier Cuadra, a political analyst and former minister under Gen Pinochet. The right enjoys a blocking vote in both the 120-member chamber of deputies and the 47-member senate, which it will be desperately seeking to maintain. Much of the right's congressional strength stems from the 1980 constitution which allowed Gen Pinochet to appoint nine non-elected senators and which weighted national elections in favour of the opposition through a complex binominal voting system. 'The Concertacion can only change the constitution if it gets a two-thirds majority, but it can only win a two-thirds majority by changing the constitution,' says one observer. Significant areas of government legislation, such as tax reform, have been watered down in congress. Likewise, the opposition has stonewalled attempts to reform Gen Pinochet's 1980 constitution, which, among other things, prevents the president from sacking military commanders-in-chief. It is in this context that the opposition's electoral pact and its selection this week of Mr Alessandri as presidential candidate becomes important. If the right had shattered and failed to agree common electoral lists, as at one stage seemed possible, the Concertacion might have achieved a more than two-thirds congressional majority. Mr Frei's ability to reform the constitution, something he has vowed to attempt, would have been significantly strengthened. It is a measure of Chile's long and stable democratic tradition that 17 years of military rule have not greatly affected voting patterns. For much of the century the electorate has lined up in roughly equal blocks  - a third on the right, a third in the centre and a third on the left. That pattern was almost exactly repeated in last year's municipal elections. Electoral rewards have usually gone to those parties best able to negotiate pacts and coalitions across these voting blocks. The Concertacion has forged an alliance of left and centre parties that will certainly win the elections in December. But it has probably not done enough to upset the right's crucial role in the balance of power.</p>

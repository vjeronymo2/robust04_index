			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK faces European censure on workers' rights laws The UK government is likely to be condemned by the European Court of Justice for failure to implement European employment laws safeguarding the rights of British employees. Britain's union leaders said an advisory ruling yesterday in infraction proceedings brought against the UK by the European Commission was a shattering defeat for the government's policy of opting-out of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Walter Van Gerven, advocate-general of the court, said the UK had deliberately avoided implementation of key aspects of the European acquired rights and collective redundancies directives. Advocate-generals' findings are almost always later confirmed by the full court. Mr Van Gerven said that in translating the European rules into English law through the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, the UK had failed to require that workers' representatives be designated for consultation when businesses change hands. The UK had failed on the same point in relation to collective redundancies. Britain was also guilty of trying to limit the application of the European rules and failing to provide effective sanctions against employers who failed to consult. British unions are confident that if the opinion is adopted by the full court later this year, the government will have to provide workers with the legal right to representation through trade unions, at least in situations involving collective redundancies, the contracting-out of services and privatisation. Lawyers also claimed yesterday that the UK government could face a flood of claims for compensation from workers whose rights were adversely affected by the privatisation and contracting-out programmes. But the Department of Employment said the advocate-general's opinion held no implications for UK legislation and no right to compensation flowed from it. The government legislated last summer to bring the regulations more closely into line with Europe. The possibility of the censure emerged as ministers admitted they had decided against offering staff at DTELS, a Home Office unit due to be privatised, a guarantee for the protection of their redundancy money if its new owner became insolvent. Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said: 'This is a welcome statement from Europe and we will be pressing the government to act. Once again British workers have been shown to be denied rights that are accepted in law in all other European countries.' Port sackings unfair, Page 8</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Konovalov: "NATO Joins in Conversion"] </F>   [Text] The International symposium on the conversion of  concentrated energy systems -- powder, solid propellants for  missiles, explosives, and pyrotechnic mixtures -- has ended in  Moscow. This was the first time that scientists from the East  and the West, among them representatives of NATO's scientific  committee, had worked together at such a forum.    "If someone had told me five years ago that I would be in  Moscow discussing problems of the peaceful use of secret rocket  fuels with Russians, that would have seemed pure fantasy," Dr.  H. Krause, a member of that committee, told me.    Professor H. Schubert, one of the organizers of the  symposium, stressed that the exchange of experience and ideas in  this sphere is extremely useful -- mountains of weapons have  been stockpiled and represent a great danger. From time to time  these weapons remind you of their presence with colossal  explosions endangering the population and the natural  environment. However, the reports delivered by academicians B.  Zhukov, G. Sakovich, and V. Tartakovskiy, Professor Yu. Frolov,  and many others showed that an explosive that has become surplus  to requirements can be of use to people.    TNT, for example, can be used to produce polymer film and  artificial diamonds can be made from substandard powder. Powder  charges can be used in magnetohydrodynamic generators, which in  turn can be used to detect mineral deposits and increase the  accuracy of long-term earthquake forecasting. Converted  missiles can be used in reverse to drill bore holes. It is  surprising but true that even fires can be put out using powder  charges, which release flame-extinguishing aerosols from the  warhead casings. These casings can be fired straight from a  grenade launcher through the window of a blazing apartment to  put out a fire.    These are many examples of this kind but they require prior  scientific research work which is, unfortunately costly. Here,  too, cooperation with the West could prove highly useful.</p>

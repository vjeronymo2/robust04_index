			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Observer: Strange drift It's a funny old world when British Coal closes one loss-making pit and finds that it has to start importing coal from an overseas loss-making pit. But this is what seems in danger of happening as a result of last week's closure of Easington colliery in County Durham. It sounds like British Coal will be forced to turn to overseas competitors so that it can honour one of its most hallowed traditions - provision of 'concessionary' coal to miners, pensioners and their widows. Although primarily a power station supplier, Easington also produced about 90,000 tonnes a year of house coal, much of which was earmarked for the 16,000 users of its 'concessionary' coal. Fortunately for British Coal, Easington was declared a smokeless zone last month. But British Coal admits that it is making alternative arrangements for the minority who are still permitted to burn the black stuff. Observer hears that the miners of Poland are being asked to to fill the unexpected order.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (27): Some severe image problems - Computer Leasing, collapse sparks an eventful year STATISTICALLY speaking, 1990 was a dull year for the UK computer leasing sector. Figures released last month by the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA) show a 4 per cent decline to Pounds 2.25bn in computer/office equipment leased by its members, who represent more than 80 per cent of the UK leasing industry. This is the first decline registered for at least eight years, although 1987 produced only minimal growth following exceptionally strong demand from the financial services sector in the preceding year. According to Mr Brian Hassell, ELA chairman, 'the decrease in 1990 reflected the general slowing down in the economy.' In all other respects, the last 12 months have been extraordinarily eventful. Starting last April with the British &amp; Commonwealth subsidiary Atlantic Computers, a succession of independent equipment leasing companies have collapsed or found themselves in serious difficulties. With 1,800 employees at the time the administrators were called in, Atlantic was once the world's third-largest computer leasing specialist. Its customer list in 1983 included the UK Atomic Energy Authority, BAT Industries, Hanson Trust, ICI and Penguin Books. Its 1988 turnover amounted to Pounds 756.9m. The most prominent of the subsequent casualties was Blackspur Leasing, the specialist printing-press leasing company, and ICS, a diversified leasing group whose turnover, at its peak, was approximately Pounds 70m. In addition, the trading position of Capital Computers - another computer leasing specialist - has deteriorated to such an extent since the end of March 1990, according to the most recent directors' report filed at Companies House, that it has been considering 'the sale of all or part of its lease portfolio to third party companies and is also taking steps to review its position in the leasing market place.' While the increasingly recessionary business climate has undoubtedly been partly to blame for the problems that companies have encountered, in certain cases lax management and the questionable structure of the profferred leases also played a role. Atlantic pioneered an arrangement called the Flexlease which offerred customers the ability to take advantage of advancing technology by upgrading their computers yet which appeared - at least initially - to be extremely attractively priced. Unfortunately, the Flexlease concept also resulted in the accretion of contingent liabilities due to the leasing company's commitment under certain circumstances to make good its customer's payments over the final year or years of the lease. Not surprisingly, this year's collapses appear to have been the Flexlease's death-knell. According to Mr Geoff Sewell, director general of the European Computer Leasing &amp; Trading Association (Eclat), 'it is very rare now that anyone tends to look at the Flexlease, although most of the operating leases written give customers the option of going back and renegotiating a new deal.' With the Department of Trade and Industry investigating Atlantic and the fraud squad in at ICS, the collapses have also left the industry with a severe image problem. This can itself have serious knock-on effects. One of the factors cited by Capital Computers for the deterioration in its performance was 'the lack of confidence in the leasing market . . . following the failure of the number of leasing companies trading in the UK.' Perhaps the chief beneficiaries of the turmoil in the independent leasing sector have been the computer manufacturers themselves, particularly IBM. Ms Carolyn Jacks, director of Grosvenor Consultancy Services, the leasing consultant, says the situation 'provided a marvellous opportunity for the computer manufacturers to market their own lease offering as the safe alternative.' The annual European computer leasing survey commissioned by Solihull-based Eclat underlined 'the increasing dominance of IBM's captive financing subsidiaries.' More than 70 per cent of the survey's respondents ranked IBM among the top three competitors in the industry, versus 16.2 per cent for Comdisco, its nearest rival. A year earlier, IBM had polled 54.9 per cent, versus 27.5 per cent for Atlantic in second place. The survey also claimed to reveal 'a rising trend of involvement by IBM' in used equipment and buy-back transactions - a field traditionally dominated by the independent leasing companies with their often painstakingly acquired expertise in the market for second-hand computer equipment. Though competition remains intense, the pressures being brought to bear on the independents are now prompting expressions of mild concern from some industry observers. Mr Sewell says: 'Few people can specify five years ahead the equipment that will meet their needs. 'The independent sector gives them the option of mixing and matching to meet their technical requirements. Without them we would be back to the original position at the end of the 1970s where the only alternatives available were finance leases.' Mr Sewell stresses, however, that 50-60 per cent of the installed computer base is still leased through independent leasing companies. According to Ms Jacks: 'For the manufacturers, leasing is a sales-aid method which assists with marketing their new products - they cannot be expected to provide their customers with the ability to change suppliers readily.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the talks on variable tariff reductions  between the Republic of China [ROC] and the United States  completed the agenda for the first day; however, apparently both  sides have not reached an accord. Our side had proposed to the  U.S. to try to achieve the objectives through bilateral  negotiations on tariff cuts related to the ROC's bid to rejoin  GATT as soon as possible, but the U.S. still prefers to assess  the situation after the current talks have been completed.  Please listen to a report by Huang Mei-ping.    [Begin recording] [Huang] According to information received  by the Economic Affairs Ministry from our delegation,  representatives from both sides to the Sino-U.S. talks had fully  exchanged their views on tariff reductions in the first day.  U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Cassidy said: Tariff  reductions are extremely important to the ROC's accession to  GATT. At the same time, the ROC has not attained the targets  set under the four-year tariff reduction plan. This time it has  proposed taking measures for possible tariff cuts on only 40-odd  industrial products, but this is still a far cry from U.S.  demands.    Huang Yen-chao, director general of the Board of Foreign  Trade, stressed to the U.S.: Our side was psychologically  prepared for tariff concessions; however, variable tariff  reductions should conform with legal procedures. There are only  40-50 items that our side can offer for tariff cuts, and it is  hoped that the other items would be incorporated into ROC-U.S.  tariff reduction talks relating to the ROC's entry to GATT as  soon as possible, and that tariff reductions should be effected  by amending relevant tax regulations through legislation so as  to be in line with the interests and demands of both sides. The  U.S. has not specifically responded in this regard, apart from  saying that it would assess the outcome of the present talks to  determine whether it would formally enter into GATT talks with  the ROC.    An Economic Affairs Ministry official said that judging from  the talks on the first day, although nothing specific was  concluded, representatives from both sides are still working  hard for an accord. Meanwhile, our delegation is aware of the  possible formation of the World Trade Organization at an earlier  date; however, authorities in Taipei have not given any  instructions to the delegates to negotiate with the U.S. in  light of this development.    This has been a report by China Broadcasting Corporation  reporter Huang Mei-ping from the Economic Affairs Ministry. [end  recording]</p>

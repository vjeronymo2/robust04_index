			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Potential Pipeline Partners Emerge: Two more potential partners emerged in the  competition to build a natural gas pipeline into California. Pacific Gas &amp;  Electric agreed to drop its opposition to a proposal by Coastal Corp. for a  Wyoming-to-Kern County pipeline in return for the option to supplant the  California portion of the proposed line with an expansion of PG&amp;E's  existing lines. That could significantly cut the cost of the project, said  officials at the California Public Utilities Commission. At least four other  projects are in the works, including a separate line from Canada proposed by a  PG&amp;E subsidiary, which the utility said it would continue to develop.  </P></p>

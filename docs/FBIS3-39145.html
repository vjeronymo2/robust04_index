Arzalluz made these statements in  Barcelona at the conclusion of the meeting of the PNV and  Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Executive Committees, at  which the two Christian Democratic parties decided to demand of  the government that it drop its centralist criteria in European  building and allow the presence of representatives of the  Catalan and Basque governments in Community institutions.    Arzalluz showed himself "optimistic," albeit with  reservations, when referring to the negotiation with the  Socialists on the pending transfers [of areas of responsibility]  to the Basque Country, and so asked Felipe Gonzalez to continue  contacts in order to find a "political solution." The Basque  leader said that the PNV's observance of the Constitution  depends on the implementation of the autonomy statute, and so,  if this process is not carried out, a "very grave" situation  will be reached. Arzalluz also pointed out that the agreement  on the statute had as its background observance of the  constitutional system by the PNV, since the party did not  approve the Constitution. In view of this he warned that "we  cannot allow implementation of the statute not being completed"  in the current legislative term, the government's "refusing to  implement it," or, if it does so, subsequently "undermining" it  through laws, decrees, or Constitutional Court rulings.    The meeting between Union and the PNV -- the first of the  meetings which will henceforth be held every six months -- was  basically aimed at establishing a joint stance on the presence  of Catalonia and the Basque Country in the European Union. In  this connection the two parties believe that the Spanish state  is the "most centralist" in its European role and demand that  the autonomous governments' presence in Community institutions  be ensured, and also that the autonomous communities be able to  take part in the state's political stance on European issues, as  is the case in Belgium and Germany, for instance.    To achieve this, Union leader Josep Antoni Duran Lleida  explained, the electoral law for the European elections must be  amended, replacing the single constituency covering the whole of  Spain with regional constituencies. They also demand the  involvement of the Catalan and Basque governments in the  allocation of Community funds, and the political normalization  of the missions which both autonomous communities have abroad.  Arzalluz asserted that the European integration process is  being carried out with "centralist criteria" and that it is  being used to enable the central government to "take back  power," since "a standardization process is being attempted in  Spain in the name of European unity."    In addition, the two parties reiterated their intention to  put forward a joint program in the European elections since  their European deputies are in the same group in the European  parliament. UDC and the PNV did not raise at this meeting the  possibility of running together in the European elections, as  the Basque party proposed in 1989 -- a request opposed by  Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC). Arzalluz said that  "we are already running together, albeit not on the same list,"  although he asserted that the Basques "are not coming to  separate anything in Catalonia," while Duran asserted that Union  "gives priority to the coalition with CDC" and rules out running  with the PNV, even though he still believes that "we would like  to run together."</p>

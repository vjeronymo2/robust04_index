			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Thames Riverbus cancelled THE NEW THAMES riverbus service, which was due to come into operation on Monday, has been cancelled after Catamaran Cruisers, the operators, failed to attract the funding needed to run a service between Canary Wharf and Charing Cross, John Willman writes. The Port of London Authority board will meet on Monday to consider whether an alternative operator should be given the licence. Three other companies that were on the shortlist when the licence was awarded to Catamaran Cruisers have been invited to reapply.</p>

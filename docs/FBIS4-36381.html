			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>   [Text] Next month Washington will launch a working plan to  carry out economic projects between Jordan and Israel after  these two countries have surmounted the most important obstacle  to the progress of their bilateral negotiations, by forming a  committee in Washington yesterday to demarcate joint borders.  The committee will rotate meetings in Jordan and Israel  starting in July.    The U.S. plan is based on two studies; the first is  Jordanian  and the other Israeli, which were presented in Washington.  Washington will deduce the joint points included in the two  studies to formulate a plan that is acceptable to both sides in  order to be discussed by the tripartite committee in Washington  next month.    The Jordanian file includes, in particular, the two seas  canal plan, to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea, while the  Israeli plan speaks about linking the Mediterranean with the  Dead Sea.    This Jordanian plan enjoys Washington's support, which  considers it more realistic and useful, and closer to  implementation.    Moreover, Amman no longer opposes the holding of the  international economic conference on its territory. It will be  held here next year, after a preparatory conference has been  held in Morocco in November.    These developments come at a time when Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali is preparing to reshuffle his cabinet  today in which he will introduce approximately 10 deputies.  This will allow the participation of the legislative council in  the decisions of the executive branch at a time when Jordan has  expressed its readiness to sign a border agreement with Israel  without waiting for the conclusion of a peace treaty.</p>

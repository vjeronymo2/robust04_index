			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans has written  to the federal Labor [Party] caucus strongly defending the  government's decision to recognize the former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia [FYROM]. The move has drawn threats of a political  backlash from Australia's large Greek community which objects to  the use of the name, Macedonia, also the name of a Greek  province.    A protest rally by the Greek community in Melbourne  yesterday  attracted a crowd of about 60,000. Senior Liberal Party figures  joined the rally, condemning the government's recognition of the  former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- speeches described by  Senator Evans as the worst kind of dangerous political  opportunism.    Sen. Evans has told his caucus colleagues the government  will  always conduct Australia's foreign policy to advance and protect  Australia's national interests. He also told them the  government will govern for all Australians, not just those who  shout or threaten the lives, he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rest of the comments on range/oven product classes argued that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department had proposed far too many different classes in the September 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance notice. As mentioned, Aloha Systems, Inc. recommended a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product class for electric cooktops. The American Council for an Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Efficient Economy, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Commission, and the Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council all stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there are too many classes for conventional ranges and ovens. (Aloha  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systems, Inc. No. 2 at 1; American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 6 at 1; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 25, California Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission, No. 24 at 5; and Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council, No. 60 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9). ENTEX proposed that the Department specify freestanding, drop-in, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slide-in ovens and wall ovens as one class. (ENTEX, No. 58 at 6). Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, a manufacturer of ranges and ovens, suggested that DOE not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze those classes with low sales volumes, and instead restrict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis to the following nine classes: Electric cooktops with open coil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements; electric cooktops with solid disk elements; standard or catalytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric ovens; self-cleaning electric ovens; conventional or sealed burner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas cooktops (with and without power cords); standard or catalytic gas ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (with and without power cords) and self-cleaning gas ovens. (Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation, No. 31 at 16). Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that three of the classes listed in the Advanced Notice of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking for gas cooktops, conventional burners with electrical cords,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional burners without electrical cords and sealed burners, should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated into two classes, namely, conventional and sealed burners with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrical cords and conventional and sealed burners without electrical cords.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47, 48).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments and reviewing the data, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that many of the classes proposed in the September advance notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were not warranted on a utility and performance basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this proposed rule, four product classes were considered for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric cooktops: Low or high wattage open (coil) elements, smooth cooktops,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grill with or without downdraft feature, and griddle with or without downdraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feature. The baseline cooktop element selected for smooth cooktops is a solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disk element. As compared to open coil element cooktops, smooth cooktops are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much easier to clean. Because cleanability is a consumer utility, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that a separate class is warranted for smooth cooktops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Induction cooking, halogen lamps, and radiant elements were considered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design options for smooth cooktops and assessed according to the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of the particular design. Because of the small amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> empirical data on grill and griddle cooktops, the Department was unable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze these classes. In addition, the DOE test procedure is presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to measure grill or griddle energy consumption, and the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not proposed to include the testing of grills or griddles. As a result, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department is not proposing any standard for these two classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four product classes are now considered for gas cooktops: Conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners, grill with or without downdraft feature, griddle with or without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downdraft feature, and warming/simmer burners. For other designs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department does not believe that significant utility issues exist, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, in the ability of the appliance to operate during electric outages,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would require that classes be established into gas cooktops with and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without electrical cords. Between 90 and 93 percent of residential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity customers experience no electric outages longer than four hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per year. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  Designs which use electricity were evaluated on their economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages and disadvantages. Other classes in the Advance Notice of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking (sealed and radiant burners) were considered as design options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional cooktops. There were no utility issues warranting separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes for sealed and radiant burners. As with electric cooktops, because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the small amount of empirical data on grill and griddle cooktops and warming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners, the Department was unable to analyze these classes. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE test procedure is presently unable to measure grill, griddle or warming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burner energy consumption, and the Department has not proposed to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing of grills, griddles or warming burners. As a result, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not proposing any standard for these three classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A.P.

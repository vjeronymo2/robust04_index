			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Vietnam Fund to raise Dollars 20m VIETNAM Fund, the Dublin-listed investment fund, will seek to raise a further Dollars 20m this year to add to the Dollars 10m it has raised and committed to projects in Vietnam. Vietnam is regarded as one of Asia's most exciting investment opportunities, but international fund managers have found it hard both to raise money and to find worthwhile projects; two other funds for Vietnam have already folded. Mr Donald Lemon, Vietnam Fund consultant, said the fund had so far invested in a company growing vegetables for export and was planning to put money into at least four property development projects. The fund is also considering investing in packaging and rubber-wood processing plants. A further 150 proposals in a range of sectors had been rejected, he said. Vietnam Fund will probably attempt to raise the extra Dollars 20m in two parts, first from institutional investors in Europe and Australia and later in the year from the US; Americans are banned by Washington from doing business in Vietnam under an embargo dating back to the Vietnam War, but the Clinton administration is expected to lift this. Mr Lemon said the fund might issue partly-paid units so it would not have to manage substantial amounts of cash.</p>

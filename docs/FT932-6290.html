			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (9): Familiarity breeds success - Profile of Black Country BLACK Country Development Corporation started work in 1987 with the aim of creating 25,000 jobs over a lifespan of about 10 years. Bringing new companies into one of the most derelict industrial areas of the UK was one way of achieving that end. Helping the expansion of those already in the area was another. For the fledgling corporation, charged by the government to regenerate 10 square miles - a tangle of factories, homes, small shopping centres, narrow roads, canals and rivers between Birmingham and Wolverhampton - the first task was to establish awareness that the Black Country exists. London Docklands and Leeds are readily identified. Not so the Black Country, said Mr Ian Page, the external affairs director. 'Our initial technique in the early days was to get the name of the Black Country across to people - where it is and the role of BCDC as a facilitator,' he said. And that, as its heavy advertising shows, it is still doing. In the late 1980s, BCDC did not have extensive land or prepared sites to offer incoming companies. Indeed, a strong element of its work has been the assembly of land, frequently in fragmented ownership. While the economy was growing, the effort was directed towards drawing property developers into the area. But as the momentum of BCDC's activities gathered force, the economy went into decline, forcing a change in the emphasis of its approach to land assembly and sales. 'With recession and the developers not being prepared to do speculative development, we looked more towards end-users and occupiers,' said Mr Page. Five years into its life, BCDC has accumulated land, most notably at and around the old Patent Shaft Steel Works site. Here it has been able to focus its marketing pitch from the general to the specific by offering the site as an automotive components manufacturing park. It is having talks with two British subsidiaries of German and US manufacturers. The planned components park points up the strength and the weakness of BCDC in the relocation marketplace. First, the Black Country is playing to its traditional economic role as a manufacturing area, rather than as an area for glitzy offices. Second, its geographical position, close to the M5 and M6, puts it within easy reach of the motor assembly plants of the Midlands. Third, while its central location is an advantage, the internal transport links have been poor; hence the importance which has been attached, since BCDC's inception, to building a new road which will provide dual carriageway access to the motorways from the Patent Shaft site. Only now is construction beginning. The translation of promise to execution for better internal transport links, added to the hard-won possession of sites, means that BCDC is now able for the first time to go to, for example, automotive component fairs in Detroit and property investment exhibitions in Cannes with, as Mr Page put it, 'something to sell'. Although, the gradual return of confidence which appears to be seeping into the UK economy no doubt has something to do with it, the level of inquiries for sites in the BCDC area is this year running one third up on last year. Most of the inquiries from overseas companies come to BCDC through the West Midlands Development Agency, a body which, with a mixture of locally generated and central government funds, acts for the region as a whole in seeking to attract inward investment. BCDC does not seek to duplicate the role of the WMDA, but rather to co-operate with it. To attract British companies, however, it is on its own and in competition with nearby centres such as Birmingham, Coventry and Telford. If a company wants a greenfield site, it will not be attracted to the Black Country. But, like other development corporations, it has an array of powers to help incoming and resident companies. It is the planning authority. It administers, with the department of environment, city grant. It can ease applications for regional selective assistance. It can put companies in touch with local authorities to obtain funds under the Inner Urban Areas Act. These powers have been used recently to assist overseas companies such as Bohler, the Austrian steel importing and processing group, Hofesa, the Spanish curtain track and window blind company, Huf (UK), the subsidiary of the German locks manufacturer, and Luigi Fontana, the Italian fasteners company, all of which have recently arrived or have expanded foot-in-the-water operations. Similarly, British companies which have consolidated manufacturing operations in the Black Country from other parts of the UK include Laporte, the chemicals group, John Cotton (Colne), the car headliner manufacturer, and Biwater Engineering Products, the water engineering group. No figures are available which separate out jobs created by inward investment, jobs created by companies relocating their operations or jobs created by corporate expansion in the area. Nor indeed are there figures for jobs lost by companies moving out of the area. But BCDC said that jobs on new developments established since it came into existence totalled 9,898.</p>

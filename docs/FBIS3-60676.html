			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [``Electric Power Problems Report Series'' column, by staff </F> correspondents Chen Zujia (7115 4371 3946) and Zhu Jingruo (2612  4552 5387): ``Nuclear Power: An Option That Leads Us out of the  `Bottleneck'''--first paragraph is editor's note]    [Text] This newspaper followed the report series on the  railway problem in the first half of the year with another  series on the electric power problem in the second half.  Beginning with the article ``Electric Power: Another  `Bottleneck' for China's Economy,'' the series eventually ran  for two months, during which it produced 12 articles--all of  them carried in a prominent place--and attracted widespread  attention from various circles. The following article is the  last in the series. In coming days, this paper will carry a  synopsis by Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry. We would  like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who  cared about and supported the electric power report series, and  to those who offered assistance to reporters in their coverage.    The entry of nuclear power into our country's economic life  is only a recent event.    On 15 December 1991, the Taishan nuclear power plant,  situated on Hangzhou Bay, delivered powerful electrical current  to the east China power grid. Toward the end of this year, the  No. 1 generator at the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Guangdong  will go into commercial operation. There will be a continuous  supply of nuclear power to Guangdong and Hong Kong, turning a  new page in the history of China's energy.    At the time we were cheering the takeoff of nuclear power in  our country, nuclear power alrady had supplied one sixth of the  world's power generation, and in 1992 there were 424 nuclear  reactors operating in countries around the world.    Changes in the energy consumption structure determine  economic upturns and downturns. Following coal and petroleum,  the peaceful use of nuclear energy has changed, in its turn, the  world economic pattern.  <H5>  I: Nuclear Power--the Key To Solving Problems in Development </H5>   In the last 40 years, nuclear energy has been one of the  main  reasons why many countries along the Pacific rim and on the two  shores of the Atlantic Ocean achieved rapid economic development  despite their remoteness from or shortage of energy resources.    In the 1960's and 1970's, when southern China relied on the  constant supply of coal from the north, nuclear power rose  rapidly to the fore in Europe and the United States. In the  course of 30 years, the United States built more than 100  nuclear reactors and became the country with the largest nuclear  power capability. France made developing nuclear power its  national policy for solving the energy shortage, and in the 17  years from 1973, increased its proportion of nuclear power from  4 to 72 percent. A cheap and quality-constant nuclear power  base has supported the French economy. Now, all the EC  countries, which once were plagued by energy shortages, see  one-third of their electric power generated by nuclear energy.  Given all this, the developed European countries and the United  States still believe that they will not make it into the 21st  century without nuclear energy.    In the 1980's, the center of economic growth shifted to the  Asia- Pacific region. Countries along the Pacific Rim, having  pierced the dark clouds surrounding the nuclear incidents on  Three Mile Island in the United States and at Chernobyl in the  former Soviet Union, now see nuclear energy as the golden key to  solving difficulties in economic development.    Japan, with 44 nuclear power plants, sees nuclear power as  the ``key energy source.'' The government, the economic sector,  and the power companies worked jointly, formulating long-term  development plans. By the year 2000, Japan's nuclear power will  account for 40 percent, as compared with the current 27.7  percent of national power generation.    India has announced the building of another 22 nuclear  reactors by the end of this century. The ROK and our country's  Taiwan Province began developing nuclear power in the mid- and  late 1970's, respectively. By 1988, it was accounting for about  half the total power general in the ROK and Taiwan. Taiwan was  able to halve its unit power price after it had successfully  developed nuclear power.    News keeps arriving that Pakistan, Indonesia, the  Philippines, and Thailand either are studying or are developing  nuclear power plants. The trend of developing nuclear power  plants in Asian countries is growing.    Meanwhile, nuclear technological sectors in Europe, the  United States, and Japan have joined forces in researching a  safer, cleaner, and more economical fast-reactor that can use  nuclear resources more efficiently. Developed countries also  have intensified research into nuclear fusion, a study that  might offer mankind unlimited energy.    By now there is no doubt that nuclear power will be the main  source of energy in the 21st century. It is now a global  consensus that countries which fail to attain nuclear energy  will never become developed.  <H3>  II: Nuclear Power--The Ideal Recipe for Economies Along the  Southeast Coast To Get Out of the Impasse </H3>   Power shortages have become the ``bottleneck'' in our  country's economic development--something the southeastern coast  has felt most acutely. The region is reeling under the pressure  of transportation bottlenecks and environmental pollution.    These transportation and environmental pressures all can be  traced to the region's unbalanced energy structure.    Our country's coal energy is concentrated in the ``three  Xi's'' (Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western [xi] Inner Mongolia), while  70 percent of its water resources come from the southeastern  coastal region. Eighty percent of the electric power supply to  the southeastern coastal region is generated from coal. The  north and west supply the south and the east with coal.  Forty-six percent of the rail freight on the Beijing-Shanghai  and Beijing-Guangdong lines is coal for power generation  purposes, and 30 and 26 percent of the freight traveling the  busiest waterways and highways--again--is coal for power  generation. This rate, however, is still far from meeting the  demand. At one time, 40 percent of Jiangsu's state-managed  generator units were shut down because they had run out of coal  for power-generating purposes.    Coal-generated power is the engine of economic development,  as well as the cause of high transport volumes and environmental  pollution. A million-kilowatt thermal power plant each year  releases tens of thousands of tonnes of toxic particles, such as  sulphur dioxide and oxidated nitrogen, and hundreds of kilograms  of such carcinogenic particles as mercury, cadmium, and trityl  ditacene.    How can we solve the three great problems--energy,  transportation, and environment--afflicting the southeastern  coastal region? In the manner of curing the pathological  sources of three diseases with one surgical operation, it would  be ideal to have one kind of energy, with a one-time investment,  benefiting all quarters. Beyond the horizon of long-distance  hydropower energy, people can catch a glimpse of nuclear power.    The advantage of nuclear power, compared with coal-generated  power, is plain and obvious. A one-million kw water-pressurized  nuclear reactor need change only 30 tonnes of fuel each year,  one- 100,000th of the transport volume required by a coal power  plant of the same capacity, thus solving the transportation  problem at one stroke. The environmental pollution caused by a  nuclear power plant operated under safe conditions is  practically negligible, its radiation release being smaller than  that from a coal power plant of similar capacity. Therefore, Dr  Sieberg, a Nobel Prize-winning nuclear chemist, said on the  occasion of the 50th anniversary of the nuclear fission of  plutonium: ``Nuclear energy is the safest and most  environment-friendly source of electrical power.''    As early as 1970, Premier Zhou Enlai said in a relevant  debriefing session: We will have to rely on nuclear power if we  want to solve the fundamental power shortage problem of  Shanghai. Nuclear power has solved a wide range of problems for  many places having large populations and rapid industrial  development, but suffering from a shortage of energy resources.  No doubt it will prove a good recipe for the southeastern  coastal region of our country.    Although the advantages of nuclear power are very obvious;    Although our country has a relatively rich uranium resource,  sufficient for the development of nuclear power;    Although in the process of developing nuclear weapons, our  country has fashioned a complete nuclear technological and  industrial system, ranging from mining and the fission of  uranium isotopes, to the production of nuclear-fuelled  components, the design and construction of nuclear reactors, and  the reprocessing of volt-amperes reactive fuel [fa ran liao hou  chu li 0040 3595 2436 0683 5710 3810];    Although our country has a 30,000-odd strong nuclear  technological contingent, all members of which have been tested  by decades of field work and are quite capable of hardship and  working under pressure;    Although our country's infrastructural industry has  experienced considerable development so that it can meet the  needs of the development of nuclear power;    Nuclear power still plays a negligible part in our lives. By  the end of this September, the Taishan nuclear power plant,  which now is operating steadily, had generated an accumulated  total of 1.7 billion kw of power. This, plus the total power  volume generated by the two 900,000 kw generator units in the  Daya Bay nuclear power plant up to the end of 1993 and mid-1994,  respectively, has amounted to only about 1 percent of our  country's total power generation.    We are late in starting; we missed the best time for  development. On 28 February 1990, Qian Sanqiang, Li Jue, Jiang  Shengjie, and Wang Ganchang wrote to Jiang Zemin and Li Peng,  urging them to outline a long-term nuclear power development  program, an action demonstrating the earnestness for the country  and the people of these four highly decorated veteran  scientists. Premier Li Peng replied to them on 30 April: ``A  plenary session of the State Council Leading Group for Nuclear  Power Plants on 15 March this year confirmed that nuclear power  has been incorporated into the national economic development  program.''    Today, coastal provinces such as Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu,  Shandong, Liaoning, and Hainan, as well as inland provinces like  Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan, all are submitting requests for the  construction of nuclear power plants. The strategic task  confronting us now is to speed up development in order to catch  up. In August 1993, the China National Nuclear Industry  Corporation centralized facilities and talents in the design and  construction of nuclear projects and in equipment procurement  and technological services, so as to establish the new China  International Nuclear Power Engineering Group Company, in order  to benefit from the advantages of group companies in the nuclear  power market.    Although we are working hard to catch up, every step along  the way has proved extremely difficult. The status and  functions of nuclear power in our country's economic development  have yet to be fully appreciated by decisionmaking departments.  The state nuclear power management is unable to muster enough  muscle to centralize leadership, which has become a major  constraint on the development of nuclear power. The absence of  assured financing through institutional channels also has  affected nuclear power research and pursuits.    Nuclear power plants require a relatively large initial  investment, and their success ultimately depends on safety  guarantees and financing pledges. The two nuclear power plants  slated to be built--in Guangdong and on the Bohai Bay in  Liaoning--have been assured of meticulous designs, but will they  get stable financial guarantees?    The development of nuclear power is a complicated  systems-engineering project. Owing to the highly specialized  nature of the intensive research and production of key  installations, the production of matching equipment for  designated projects, the supply of nuclear fuel, the  reprocessing of volt-amperes-reactive fuel, the disposal of  ``three kinds of waste products,'' the determination of sites  for the power plants, and arrangements for their retirement, the  process of actual implementation requires highly centralized and  unified leadership, and firm and efficient day-to-day  management. Otherwise, nuclear power will not be able to display  its advantages in freeing us from economic ``bottlenecks.''  This is the eager wish of the majority of dedicated nuclear  power workers and the true voice of countrymen eagerly hoping  for a full power supply and never-ending light. Nuclear power,  may your light and heat help push us out of ``bottlenecks!''</p>

[Koichi Amemiya, president of U.S. Honda] Actually, we  didn't want to raise our prices at all this fall. The minor  increases that were announced in February and April were meant  to dramatize an "Accord price freeze" for the new car year. But  the yen rate suddenly shot up when we were at the final stage of  setting prices. Because some of our cars are imported from  Japan, we couldn't absorb the higher rate otherwise.    [Kobayashi] Why wasn't everything produced in the United  States?    [Amemiya] We were ready to, for our part. But the problem  was over on the Japan side. Personnel adjustments on their side  haven't kept up with the speed that localization is taking place  here in the United States.    [Kobayashi] I imagine you'll have to be concerned about the  U.S. automobile industry accusing you of dumping if there are  only minor price adjustments despite the higher yen.    [Amemiya] We locally sourced 82 percent of the parts for the  Accord. And local production accounts for 80 percent. So there's  no need for price increases to reflect the higher yen in its  entirety. I can say with confidence that our prices are the  result of our efforts to rationalize our operations.    [Kobayashi] Then, in terms of prices, will you be able to  compete with U.S. cars?    [Amemiya] GM's fall increase was on a par with the Accord's,  a 1.8 percent increase, but GM didn't raise its prices in the  spring. So, all together, our increase is on or around the 4  percent level. U.S. car makers also give a bigger mark down to  their dealers. On the other hand, until now, people have been  saying that with the same accessories, Japanese cars are $2,000  higher than U.S. cars. With this new Accord, however, I think  we've cut that difference down to $500. That's sufficient to  make the Accord competitive.    [Kobayashi] Does it look as though you'll be able to regain  your position in 1994 as having U.S. best-selling car?    [Amemiya] When we lost our top seating in 1992, there were  people in Japan saying, "Given the trade friction between our  two countries, that might have been for the best." But in the  United States, winning is what counts. When we export the Accord  to Asia, there, too, we're asked, "When is the Accord going to  recapture first place?" Placing first in the United States is  very important.    [Kobayashi] How about the business end...?    [Amemiya] What with a combined sales slump and start-up  costs, 1993 was a very tough year for us. But the Accord should  be contributing fully next year. We'll also be adding our own  version of the Rodeo (recreational vehicle) to our battle lines.  Higher priced imports like the Acura are having a tough time  because of the stronger yen, but profit-wise, by the end of this  term, we should be seeing the end to our present slump.</p>

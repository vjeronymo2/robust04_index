			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Technology: Stamping out food poisoning The UK claimed a world first this week in the battle for improved food safety with the launch of a Pounds 7m scheme that uses computer models to predict the growth, death and survival of common food-poisoning bacteria. The new product, Food Micromodel, could make a major contribution to the food industry's competitiveness by speeding up development times in fast-growing product sectors such as convenience foods. It is already generating worldwide interest. The scheme, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, could also allay public worries about potential health hazards from ready-to-cook and other foods following recent outbreaks of poisoning by Salmonella or Listeria bacteria. Nicholas Soames, the food minister, said the product offered 'huge benefits' to the food industry. It would not have been possible without collaboration between the food industry and the public sector. The aim of the scheme is to reduce the need for the food industry to use time-consuming 'challenge-testing' to measure the bacterial safety of food. These are only relevant to the foods and conditions tested. In contrast, Food Micromodel will use a comprehensive database drawn up from tests over the past three years, along with commercial and academic data, to generate predictions for how a particular bacteria would behave in a wide range of foods and conditions. The system could be used by a food manufacturer to discover quickly the microbiological consequences of, for example, reducing a product's salt content. Alternatively, a user could check which formulation for a new product most effectively inhibited the growth of food-poisoning bacteria. The ministry has licensed Food Micromodel to the Gloucestershire-based Campden Food and Drink Research Association which, along with five other research organisations, will provide expert centres for users to contact by telephone. Soames made clear that Food Micromodel will be self-financing from 1994, when the ministry's five-year involvement in the product ends. A Food Micromodel hotline has been set up on 0386 840274.</p>

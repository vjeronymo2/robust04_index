			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter U Chong-chang] </F>   [Excerpts] There is a plan code-named "Peace Plan." It has  been worked out the ministries dealing with unification. A  similar plan prepared by the Ministry of National Defense is  called "00 Plan."    The "Peace Plan" spells out the government measures to cope  with a drastic political change or an emergency situation in  North Korea. It provides a scenario covering all possible  contingencies, such as the sudden death of Kim Il-song, the  outbreak of war, a military coup, food riots, mass exodus of  North Koreans, a change in the system patterned after the  Chinese style policy of opening up to the outside world.  [passage omitted]    Because the plan was amended and supplemented for nearly 30  years, its volume is staggering. An official said, "It takes 2  days to skim through it." [passage omitted]    The "measures to cope with radical change in North Korea"  prepared by all the ministries concerned pass as "Peace Plans."  But the one prepared by the Defense Ministry carries a  different name. Those prepared by the Defense Ministry are  divided into two. The first one, "the War Plan," already  existed. After the civilian government was installed, the  Defense Ministry worked out the second. The Defense Ministry  plan combining these two measures is code-named "00 Plan."    The scenario in the "Peace Plan" begins with changes in  North  Korea. There are three types of contingencies in North Korea  foreseen by our government. They are: "the provocation of war,"  "the fall from within," and "a voluntary reform of the regime."    Of these contingencies, the possibility of North Korea  invading the South is the one our government constantly keeps  in mind. North Korea is constantly sending signals through  various channels indicating that it will not hesitate to go to  war. However, in our government's view, "that possibility is  very slim."    In terms of combat capability, including troop strength, the  number of combat divisions, equipment, and training, North  Korea is slightly ahead of South Korea. In terms of "combat  strength index" used to measure fighting capability in war  (combat strength equivalent to one armored division is rated as  one ED), North Korea leads South Korea by a slight margin.    However, according to military experts, under these  circumstances it would be difficult for any commander with the  power of reasonable judgment to think of launching an all-out  war. Still, the possibility exists, although a slight one, just  in case a special situation of political and economic confusion  should develop in the South, undermining our government's  ability to command war efforts, or in case North Korea should  fall into self- abandonment.    Experts on unification share a similar view. According to  them, several scenarios anticipating war have this common  feature: "After succeeding to power, Kim Chong- il touches off  war in an attempt to find a way out of internal difficulties,  but he is defeated." According to these scenarios, with just one  day for us to detect the telltale signs of a surprise attack,  North Korean troops advance 60 to 70 kilometers in three weeks  to occupy Seoul, but they are forced to retreat in the face of  ROK and American counterattacks. Most experts say that as time  goes by, the possibility of war will diminish.    Our intelligence authorities think that Kim Chong-il is not  yet in complete control of the North Korean military. Proof of  it is his constant expression of thanks to the troops in  frontier areas. Recently, Kim appointed his trusted lieutenants  as aides-de- camp to division commanders in the frontier areas  north of Pyongyang, such as Wonsan, Chongjin, Kanggye, and  Sinuiju. Reportedly, these aides, each carrying a pistol and a  lunch box called "kwakbap" on the waist, accompany their  division commanders for 24 hours. The Chinese government has  already received information that North Korean division  commanders are strongly complaining about their "kwakbap"  aides-de-camp. It is our government's assessment that the  possibility of war is slim at this time when Kim Chong-il is  not in full control of the military and when it is difficult to  look forward to Chinese and Russian support.    The second contingency, namely, a North Korean internal  collapse, is subdivided into "invasion of the North by the  South," "the collapse of the regime under a popular uprising,"  and "an anti-Kim Il-song coup." But there is no possibility  whatsoever of the South invading the North.    Experts are generally negative about the possibility of "the  collapse of the regime under a popular uprising." They give  these reasons: North Korea is an almost completely closed  society; the people have been brainwashed through a  man-remaking campaign; and the regime has maintained strict  social controls. Said Ko Yong-han, former North Korean Foreign  Ministry official who defected to the South: "As long as the  regime can supply only rice and red pepper to people, it will be  able to hold on to power for the next several decades." Thus he  ruled out a popular uprising. Our government is also skeptical  about it.    However, recently the situation has changed rapidly. The  number escaping into Russia or China is sharply increasing.  Some point out that this phenomenon resembles what happened at  the beginning of the fall of the East European bloc. Concerned  ROK officials even maintain that "recent escapees should be  regarded as refugees, not defectors."    Some observers predict that "if North Korea fails to tide  over the spring famine season, riots may break out because of  the food shortage." It is nothing new that North Korea is  distributing for human consumption the corn or soybeans it  imported from China as animal feed. Our government recently  confirmed this through field reports. North Korean officials who  contact our officials or businessmen abroad openly request food  aid from the South. Judging from all this, there is quite  strong speculation that the food shortage has reached its worst;  it may touch off a popular riot. That is why quite a few  experts predict the possibility of the regime's collapse under a  riot.    The third possibility, an "anti-Kim Il-song coup," is  thought to be high. Our government speculates that a palace coup  by loyal followers, is a greater possibility than a military  coup. In this connection, it is worthy of note that recently,  there are some ominous signs of change in the situation  surrounding Kim Chong-il. [passage omitted]    The scenario of the palace coup is roughly as follows: "The  moment Kim Chong-il takes power, Kim Il-song's younger brother  Kim Yong-chu, Kim Chong-il's stepbrother Kim Pyong-il, and Kim  Pyong-il's mother Kim Song-ae stage a coup with military  support and build a collective leadership hand in hand with  Young Turks in the party and economic bureaucrats."    This possibility is high, but the question is whether or not  the new regime created would be friendly to us. Speculation by  experts on unification is that "even if a coup is successful,  they won't present the new North Korean regime to the ROK as a  gift." However, our government has drawn up a plan to help  North Korea should the new forces that replaced Kim Il-song ask  for an economic aid.    What worries our government most about a palace coup is a  civil war in North Korea in case the coup should fail, and the  resulting confusion under the reign of anarchy. It is estimated  that in that event millions of North Koreans would escape to  flee the civil war. Internal government data estimate the  number of North Korean refugees at 5 million. It is expected  that refugees would exit through these areas: the armistice  line, the east and west coastlines, and the Chinese and Russian  borders. According to foreign press dispatches, the Japanese  government has drawn up a plan to block North Korean refugees  on the high seas before they can enter Japan by boat.    If refugees cross the armistice line, how would our  government handle them? Would it take them in? If North Korean  troops massacre fleeing North Koreans, would our government sit  back and do nothing? These are the agonizing questions.    In this regard, the government has drawn up special measures  to cope with specific types of contingencies. These are the  core of the "Peace Plan." The plan is said to have been drawn  up on the basis of humanitarianism. This is to say it calls for  the admittance of refugees if there are refugees.    The third contingency, "voluntary reform," has nothing to do  with convulsive changes in North Korea. But voluntary reform is  the common wish shared by our government and experts on  unification because it is the best alternative that can  minimize sacrifices attendant to the process of unification.  Its shortcoming, however, is that it will take a long time to  reach the goal of unification. This point is touched on in the  "Peace Plan."    Currently, the North Korean economy is believed to be on the  verge of ruin. North Korea will have to change course by  necessity, not by Kim Il-song's choice. The anticipated change  of the system will be a Chinese-style reform: establishing  special economic zones [SEZ's] in isolated areas and reviving  the economy, with pollution from capitalism shut out. If North  Korea shifts to this course, the timing for the transition  would be Kim Il-song's birthday (15 April) or shortly before.    Experts speculate that North Korea has completed  preparations  for reform. But it is trying hard to exact economic assistance  from the United States and Japan beforehand. According to  experts, it is out of this calculation that North Korea is  engaged in protracted negotiations with the Clinton  Administration over the head of the ROK Government.    North Korea is said to have organized a special team to  coddle the United States. The government speculates that the  team includes Hwang Chang-yop, who visited the SEZ's in China  this past January, and Kim Yong-sun, former secretary in charge  of South Korean affairs. According to a government official  concerned, of the two Hwang is the front man and Kim has real  power. The speculation that there will be a major change in  North Korea has been sparked by reports about this team.    On the possibility of war, a senior official familiar with  the details of the "Peace Plan" said: "It is a difficult  question to which nobody has a ready answer, but in my personal  opinion, the chances are minimal." He argued: "The stronger  our stand not to hesitate to go to war, the slimmer the chances  of the North invading the South." He speculated: "In the  future the North-South relationship will gradually change as  North Korea reforms on its own."</p>

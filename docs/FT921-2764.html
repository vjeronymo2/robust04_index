			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: Few changes planned for the top personnel MIDLAND and Hongkong are no strangers, write David Barchard and Angus Foster. After Hongkong Bank took its original 14.9 per cent stake in Midland in 1987  -amid talk of an eventual merger - some of Midland's operations passed to Hongkong, while others, for example some leasing and trade finance operations, have been run jointly. For much of the late 1980s there was a quiet contest among senior officials in the two banks over how operations and territory would be shared out after a merger. Yesterday Hongkong Bank indicated that it intended to keep Midland as a 'stand alone' operation, making few changes to its top personnel and retaining its outward presence in the high street largely unchanged. Mr Brian Pearse, previously finance director at Barclays, will be retained as chief executive. Unlike his immediate predecessor, Sir Kit McMahon, Mr Pearse is able to communicate easily with the rank and file of the bank's branches and his departure now would probably throw branch morale even further into the doldrums. There seems little doubt that Midland is in for a culture shock. Hongkong will make sweeping changes inside Midland in the medium and longer term, and operations will be combined where possible, though since they overlap in only a few areas there seems to be little scope for speeding up Midland's drive to cut costs in the UK. With a stronger capital base, Midland will be better placed to compete with the other three large high street banks than it has been for several years. Its executives enjoy one main asset. They are steeped in the business of UK-style retail and small company banking, an area in which Hongkong Bank has little previous experience Indeed, to compete in the rapidly-changing banking markets of late 20th century Britain, Hongkong Bank must make some fairly drastic adaptations of its own. Despite its international ambitions it remains at heart a paternalistic, and very colonial, institution. Junior employees are not allowed to marry before 25, and curry is served for lunch every Thursday. Most of the senior management are British, especially Scottish, and the bank only recently started recruiting grad-uates. The chairman of 'the Bank', as it is known in Hong Kong, is always invited to sit on the Hong Kong Governor's elite Executive Council, the most powerful decision making body in the colony. Mr William Purves, chairman since 1986, is a Scot who has continued the international expansion initiated by his predecessor, Sir Michael Sandberg. Mr Purves is due to retire in the next two years, and he now has the chance to complete the final part of the jigsaw, by giving Hongkong Bank a meaningful European presence through the Midland merger.</p>

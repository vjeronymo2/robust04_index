As a Beijing delegation delegate,  Li Peng arrived this morning at the Beijing Hall of the Great  Hall of the People to participate in a forum with Beijing  delegates attending the second session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC], to solicit their opinions and to  discuss the major policies on reform, development, and stability.    Hardly had Zhang Jianmin, Beijing Municipal People's  Congress  Standing Committee chairman and presiding forum chairman,  finished his remarks when Huang Da, Chinese People's University  president, said "Premier Li Peng's report is encouraging." He  added that the report has embodied scientific and truth-seeking  spirit and expounded the relationship between reform,  development, and stability, which represent the overall  situation for doing a good job on various work. He expressed  the belief that as long as we can maintain the mutual  coordination of reform, development, and stability, and as long  as we can bring about mutual promotion of reform, development,  and stability, we will surely and victoriously accomplish  various reform tasks and fulfill the economic development plan.    Doing a good job on the production and management of  state-run large and medium-sized enterprises is extremely  important to maintain the sustained development of the national  economy. Therefore, Lui Yifeng, deputy director of the Economic  and Technological Information Research Institute under the  Beijing Chemical Engineering Group, offered his views to Premier  Li Peng. He said: "The introduction of a new taxation system  will benefit most state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises; but it will pose new problems to some enterprises,  particularly poorly run ones. It is hoped that relevant  departments will work out effective measures to help solve such  problems as chained debts and wage reform at enterprises."    Zhang Zhanlin, head of the Liuminying Ecological Farm Ranch  in Daxing County, straightforwardly touched on the issue which  concerns farmers most: solving the issue of the inadequate  reserve force for agriculture. He said: "Premier Li Peng's  report has pointed out the farmers' innermost thinking, it  proposed strengthening the position of agriculture, the  foundation of the national economy, and a number of measures to  comprehensively develop the rural economy. It is hoped that  these measures will be genuinely implemented."    Qinghua University Professor Mei Zuyan said he greatly  appreciated the following passage: "Various levels of  governments should cut expenditures in other areas and try every  possible means to do several concrete things for education."  This, he said, reflects the government's plan to raise  education to a strategic position and to give education priority  development. He, however, hoped that the government would  gradually increase investment in education.    Also taking the floor to speak at the meeting were Wang  Bilin, Beijing Municipal No. 11 Middle School senior teacher; Li  Bosheng, special-grade jade sculpture master at the Beijing Jade  Workshop; Hu Dapeng, Municipal Individual Laborers' Association  deputy director; and Hu Yamei, honorary president of Beijing  Children Hospital. They proposed their respective suggestions  to Premier Li Peng on such topics as attaching importance to  education, promoting folk arts, developing the private economy,  and reforming the medical care system.    Following the delegates' speeches, Li Peng said: "I thank  you  for your affirmation and support of the "Government Work Report"  and the government's work. And I thank you for expressing your  opinions and proposing suggestions." He said he would seriously  study those opinions and suggestions and would try his best to  meet with the delegates' demands and wishes, adding: "This is  our unshirkable responsibility."    Li Peng said party and government leaders should not only  assume the responsibility for correctly handling well the  relationship between reform, development, and stability, but  also need to help all to reach a common understanding over the  correct handling of the relationship between reform,  development, and stability, as they are very important in  accomplishing the various tasks that will be set forth at the  current NPC session and to bring about a sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy. He said he is  pleased with the delegates' reaching a common understanding and  with their approval of and support for this year's basic policy  for the whole party and for the nation's work. Li Peng pointed  out the tasks of reform and development will be very arduous  this year. At present, reform plans for major reform of the  economic structure have been introduced, thus representing a big  step forward for establishing a socialist market economic  system. He called for the resolute implementation of various  reform plans. He also called for adopting a cautious attitude,  for the timely solving of problems once they surface, and  ensuring the smooth progress of reform and development.    Li Peng jokingly said: "As I am also one of the Beijing  delegation delegates, please allow me to express several  opinions." Laughter immediately broke out upon his remark.    The first opinion that Li Peng advanced was related to  commodity prices. He said prices constitute an important factor  in maintaining social stability. Since implementing the reform  and opening up policy, we have adopted a step-by-step approach  with regard to reforming prices. Practice shows that our  approach has been a success. Control over 90 percent of  commodity prices have been lifted. Macrocontrol, however, is  required over commodity prices that have been decontrolled. I  hope more efforts will be exerted and more work will be done in  this area so that increases in commodity prices will be  controlled within the masses' tolerable limit. Regarding  commodity price work, Li Peng pointed out the need to pay  particular attention to solving well the "vegetable basket"  problem for urban and rural citizens. It is necessary to ensure  the supply of a vast variety of vegetables at reasonable prices.  Commercial networks should be increased in urban areas. Steps  should be taken to improve distribution systems. Urban areas  should open their doors wider so as to facilitate vegetable  growers to sell their produces and to help stabilize the prices  of agricultural sideline products in urban and rural areas.    Another of Li Peng's opinion was related to the  establishment  of a labor market. According to him, labor force flow is an  unavoidable phenomenon in the course of economic development.  Labor force flow not only meets construction demands in  economically developed areas, but also helps the masses in the  economically not-so-developed areas to shake off poverty and to  become better off. But he urged the creation of a positive  guidance for labor force flow and for enhancing management over  the labor market, so that the labor force will not flow in a  blind and unregulated manner, but in a rational and orderly way.    Li Peng also raised the issue of attaching greater  importance  to improving citizens' housing conditions. He spoke about the  great changes in the urban outlook of Beijing. He said everyone  knows that Beijing is becoming a modernized metropolis. He  expressed the hope that citizens will make new strides in  housing reconstruction. He urged adopting the method of pooling  funds from the government, work units, and individuals to  accelerate the pace of housing construction, particularly in  giving priority to building medium- grade residential housing.  Li Peng also said that improving housing conditions is a  practical issue which the broad masses show the biggest concern  and which requires a speedy solution.    Li Peng said, as the country's capital, Beijing is the  miniature and window of the great socialist motherland. In  addition to doing a good job in building material civilization,  people in Beijing should set an exemplary role in the building  of spiritual civilization. It is necessary to make greater  efforts to further do a good job in the comprehensive management  of social order; to create a stable working and living  environment for the citizens; to encourage healthy trends; to  oppose unhealthy trends and bad practices; to adopt diverse ways  and use healthy and uplifting spiritual products to enrich the  cultural market and satisfy the masses' needs in daily life; and  to help shape a healthy social trend.    Li Peng's opinions won warm applause from the delegates. The  heart strings of the people's delegates drew a little bit closer  to that of the Republic's premier...... [ellipses as received].</p>

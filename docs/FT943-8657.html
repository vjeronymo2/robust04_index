			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Calor responds to fall in shares Shares in Calor Group, the liquefied petroleum gas distributor, fell 7 per cent, or 20p, to 270p yesterday, following press reports on Sunday about a price war in the bottled gas market which threatened 'to undermine Calor', which has a 50 per cent share of the market. Calor responded yesterday, saying the market for bottled gas remained 'very competitive', but it believed it was 'currently maintaining market share, with pressure on margins being matched by cost reductions and operating efficiencies.' The shares recovered to close down 9p at 281p. Calor is due to announce its results for the six months to June 30 on September 14.</p>

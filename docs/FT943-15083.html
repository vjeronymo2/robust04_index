			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: EU increases quota of toys from China The European Commission has proposed a 24 per cent increase in the value of the EU quota on toy imports from China this year, in an effort to ease disruptions to trade caused by the abrupt imposition of the curbs in February. The Commission proposal, to be announced tomorrow, must be approved by the Council of Ministers. It would raise the value of the quota by Ecu150m (Pounds 115.5m) to Ecu780m. The increase would be retroactive to March 15, when the quota took effect, and would run to the end of the year. The quota, which covers items including teddy bears, was imposed as part of a package deal under which EU members agreed to scrap about 6,500 national import restrictions inconsistent with the single European market. The quota was designed chiefly to mollify Spain, where toy makers are worried about low-cost competition from China. Toy Manufacturers of Europe, the main industry group, has said 500 jobs would be lost in Europe, and its members' sales and profits would suffer. Though the proposed relaxation is likely to be welcomed by the industry, it does not fully compensate for the 50 per cent drop in imports' value expected this year before the quotas were imposed. Last February's decision is being challenged in the European Court of Justice by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which sought unsuccessfully to block it in the Council of Ministers. Last week, China attacked the quota on toys, silk and other items.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Range Rover steers towards luxury niche Land Rover, the leading European maker of four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles, is moving into new territory with the launch today of a new generation Range Rover. Developed in a four-year, Pounds 300m investment programme as a luxury flagship for the Rover group, the new Range Rover is aimed at moving the company into direct competition with established luxury car producers such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus (Toyota). It is priced between Pounds 31,950 and Pounds 43,950 and with a top speed of 125mph (200kph). Mr John Towers, Rover group chief executive, said: 'The major business opportunity is to appeal to a much wider group of traditional luxury saloon owners.' The only vehicle in the world to have been exhibited at the Louvre in Paris as a work of art, the Range Rover, launched in 1970, is already a classic in the world motor industry - an executive/luxury car with polished wood trim, but with the capability of crossing fields, streams, deserts and jungles. The off-road capability is being maintained, but Land Rover has spent heavily to develop the new Range Rover's on-road credentials as a luxury car to allow it to move into more rarified territory. The new Range Rover is only one element in an ambitious strategy being developed by Rover - a subsidiary of BMW of Germany since early this year - which could more than double Land Rover production by the late 1990s. The company is moving for the first time to establish a presence at the lower end of the market. Behind the scenes it is developing a range of smaller Land Rover vehicles as part of the Rover group's Pounds 1.5bn, five-year new model investment programme. Rover is reluctant to comment on future product plans, but Mr Towers said: 'It is sensible and right to consider a business proposal to allow Land Rover to spread its net and create an ability below Discovery prices to attract people into the Land Rover fold.' Output at Land Rover's plant at Solihull, near Birmingham totalled less than 50,000 a year before the launch of the medium-priced Discovery at the end of the 1980s. Production, expected to reach a record 85,000 this year, is forecast to exceed 100,000 for the first time in 1995, as sales are boosted by the launch of the new generation Range Rover and by the moves into new markets. The Discovery, priced in the UK between Pounds 17,600 and Pounds 26,800, accounted for 50 per cent of Land Rover sales last year. The launch of a small Land Rover could have a similarly dynamic effect - increasing sales to between 150,000 and 200,000 by the late 1990s. With the new Range Rover - the biggest single investment at the Solihull site - the company has started to lay the foundations for the much lower-cost manufacturing operation needed for higher volume output of a smaller vehicle. Mr John Hall, director of the Range Rover project, said that the new vehicle 'takes little more than half the time to build compared with the previous model', in spite of its greater complexity. About Pounds 70m has been spent to modernise the manufacturing facilities in the body welding, paint, final assembly and engine shops. The number of parts for the new Range Rover axles, for example, have been reduced from 338 to 214, and the axles take 30 per cent less time to assemble. Rising output has created extra jobs at Solihull in spite of the greater efficiency of the manufacturing operation, and the workforce has grown to 9,700 from 8,100 two years ago. Land Rover is planning output of 640 a week of the new Range Rover on a single shift, but has already moved to two-shift working this year for both its Discovery and Defender ranges.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE RANGE OF ROVER  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Land Rover sales               DISCOVERY   RANGE ROVER   DEFENDER   TOTAL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986               -        14,495       22,026    36,521 1987               -        20,505       20,686    41,191 1988               -        24,185       22,515    46,700 1989           1,088        28,096       23,088    52,272 1990          21,828        23,774       20,583    66,185 1991          20,157        17,809       20,369    58,335 1992          24,323        15,653       16,474    56,450 1993          36,433        17,719       19,375    73,527  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

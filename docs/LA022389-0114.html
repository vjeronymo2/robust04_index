			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY TO TEST 6 SITES FOR PICKUP OF LABORERS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to create six alternative hiring  sites for day laborers as part of a six-month pilot project to get the  immigrant workers off street corners.  </P> <P> If the pilot project is successful, the council also agreed to create hiring  sites in each of the city's 15 council districts in what would be the nation's  most sweeping effort to regulate itinerant immigrant workers.  </P> <P> Immigrants rights groups hailed the decision and praised Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores for withdrawing a proposed ordinance that would have banned day  laborers from soliciting work on city streets. Many unanswered questions  remain, however, as to how the program would actually work.  </P> <P> City officials said thousands of men look for work on Los Angeles streets each  morning, an increase since the 1986 federal immigration law made it illegal for  employers to hire undocumented immigrants. Council members said they have  received complaints about the workers from residents and merchants in Pacoima,  Koreatown, West Los Angeles and other parts of the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Great Start'  </P> <P> "This is a great start, a model program" said Father Tom Smolich of the Dolores  Mission and coordinator of an adopt-a-corner program to organize day laborers  throughout the city. "We're glad that there is this positive sense of helping  people, rather than arresting people and running them off the streets."  </P> <P> Flores last month proposed a ban on workers soliciting employment on street  corners after Harbor City residents and merchants complained about groups of up  to 100 men blocking streets and harassing customers.  </P> <P> Immigrants groups argued that the proposal would violate the workers'  constitutional right to freedom of assembly and deprive them of their  livelihood. But after meeting with representatives of the Coalition for Humane  Immigrants Rights of Los Angeles and other groups last week, Flores agreed to  withdraw the proposal.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure that a complete ban would work because it would just move people  to other areas," Flores said at a press conference before the council meeting  Wednesday.  </P> <P> She then asked the council to establish two alternative hiring sites, one of  which would be in Harbor City. But Councilman Joel Wachs called for setting up  six hiring sites during a six-month trial period and a total of 15 sites if the  trial program is successful. His proposal was adopted on vote of 15 to 0.  </P> <P> Other council members praised Flores for reaching a compromise that would  address community complaints while allowing the immigrants to solicit work.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo said the workers "are not out there just to commit  crimes (or) to be on welfare; they're out there to look for a day's work,"  while Councilman Richard Alatorre called the proposed trial program "a fair  compromise on a difficult issue."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consultant Needed  </P> <P> Wednesday's action calls for the Community Development Department to hire a  consultant to conduct a study of sites where the day laborers could look for  work away from the dangers and problems of the street.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Flores' office said that it would be at least four weeks  before the hiring sites could begin operating. The council offered no criteria  on how to select the sites, or whether neighborhood groups would have a veto.  The council allocated $90,000 in general funds for the program.  </P> <P> Alternative hiring sites for day laborers were created last year in Costa Mesa  and Glendale, where about 50 workers gather in search of employment each  morning at a Catholic Youth Organization preschool. The Costa Mesa site is open  only to day laborers with work permits, while all workers can look for work at  the Glendale site, regardless of their immigration status.  </P> <P> Flores said before the council meeting that the workers at the pilot sites  would not be asked if they have work permits. "The sites will be open to anyone  who is looking for work or workers," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More May Be Needed  </P> <P> Father Smolich said that more hiring sites may be needed eventually because  there are thousands of men looking for work in the city. "To deal with it  properly is going to take more than a few alternative sites," he said. "I hope  the city is going to talk with the various organizations that have been  involved with the day laborers. I know that we're all willing to help."  </P> <P> The council took the action after a 90-minute public hearing in which a dozen  Harbor City residents and merchants complained that the day laborers had become  an intolerable nuisance in their community.  </P> <P> "We've become prisoners in our own neighborhood," said Kay Kaplan, who  complained about men gathering on the front lawn of her home.  </P> <P> "Any car that comes to the intersection is completely surrounded by people,"  said Steven Tillack, owner of an auto restoration shop on Pacific Coast Highway  near Normandie Avenue. "The numbers have increased dramatically over the past  few months."  </P> <P> About 40 day laborers also attended the council meeting, most sitting quietly  in benches at the rear of the council chamber.  </P> <P> "We would like to thank Mrs. Flores for recognizing her mistake," Gabriel  Valdes, 22, a native of Mexico, told the council through an interpreter. Valdes  said he represented workers who seek shelter at the Dolores Mission in East Los  Angeles. "We will protest any law that will violate our rights," he said.  </P></p>

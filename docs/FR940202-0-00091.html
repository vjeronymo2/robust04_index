			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective July 1, 1993, a new statutory amendment eliminated the limitations on the disregard. Therefore, we have changed the regulation to implement the new statutory requirement that all student financial assistance received under programs in title IV of the Higher Education Act or under Bureau of Indian Affairs educational assistance programs will be disregarded as income and resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 101&hyph;392, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990, enacted September 25, 1990, substantially amended the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (20 U.S.C. 2301  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) by authorizing grants to States and Indian Tribes to carry out various vocational education assistance programs. Section 221(a)(1) authorizes the use of certain funds to provide, subsidize, reimburse, or pay for preparatory services, including instruction in basic academic and occupational skills, necessary educational materials, and career guidance and counseling services, in preparation for vocational education and training that will furnish single parents, displaced homemakers, and single pregnant women with marketable skills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(a) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act specifies that the portion of any student financial assistance received under this Act that is made available for attendance costs defined in section 507(b) of the Act shall not be considered as income or resources in determining eligibility for assistance under any other program funded in whole or in part with Federal funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 507(b), attendance costs are defined as: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same academic workload as determined by the institution, and including costs for rental or purchase or any equipment, materials, or supplies required of all students in the same course of study; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An allowance for books, supplies, transportation, dependent care and miscellaneous personal expenses for a student attending the institution on at least a half-time basis, as determined by the institution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Living expenses are not designated as attendance costs under section 507(b). Therefore, such expenses will be disregarded only when they are provided as part of miscellaneous personal expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, section 507 of Public Law 90&hyph;575, the Higher Education Amendments of 1968, and implementing regulations at &sect;233.20(a)(4)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) require that any grant or loan to an undergraduate student for educational purposes made or insured under any program administered by the Department of Education will be disregarded as income and resources in programs under titles I, IV, X, XIV, XVI(AABD), or XIX of the Social Security Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The combined effect of section 507 of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act and section 507 of the Higher Education Amendments of 1968 is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Educational loans and grants provided to undergraduate students under any programs administered by the Department of Education, except those in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, will not be counted as income or resources for purposes of the AFDC and adult assistance programs; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Educational assistance provided for attendance costs under programs in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act will not be counted as income or resources for purposes of the AFDC and adult assistance programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

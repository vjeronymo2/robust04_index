			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- The "SJ-4" [Shijian-4]  satellite, which was successfully sent into space on 8 February  1994, has entered its prearranged large, flat orbit.  Researchers at the Space and Applied Research Center of the  Chinese Academy of Sciences said that ground control received  the satellite's remote measurement signals at 0423 [2023 GMT] on  9 February immediately after the satellite entered China's  airspace for the first time. Initial scientific data has been  obtained following the decoding of some signals indicating that  the six scientific probing instruments on board have started  working normally.    According to a person in charge at the Space and Applied  Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who had just  returned to Beijing from the Xichang Satellite Launching Center,  the "SJ-4" is China's first special large, flat,  high-altitude-orbit satellite designed to study the space  environment and its effects [as received]. Immediately after  the satellite entered orbit, the Satellite Measurement and  Control Center of the State Commission of Science, Technology,  and Industry for National Defense captured the satellite's  remote measurement signals and measured the satellite's orbit.  The satellite's greatest altitude from the earth is 36,133 km,  its lowest altitude from the earth is 217 km, and its dip angle  is 28.58 degrees. On 12 February, the Measurement and Control  Center began an experiment which applied high pressure on its  static analyzer remote control. Monitoring and measuring data  indicated that the high pressure applied on instruments was  normal and that the instruments had begun to sent back  space-plasma data. Now, all the probing instruments on board  have been put into normal operation.    With the special characteristics of the present orbit of the  "SJ- 4" the major purpose of the "SJ-4" is to probe and study  charged particles in near-earth space and their effects on space  vehicles. Its obtaining of systematic environmental data will  help boost our country's research into the plasma environment.  The successful launch of the "SJ-4" is helping to accumulate  experience in using our country's powerful carrier rockets to  launch applied satellites and in using experimental rockets to  carry small scientific research satellites.</p>

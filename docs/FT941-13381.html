			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Public-sector views 'harden' on pay freeze Opinion among public-sector workers has hardened in the past few weeks against the government's public-sector pay bill freeze, according to union leaders, who believe there is a danger of industrial conflict in the early summer. 'Our members were subdued. Now they are saying we have had enough,' said one senior union official. But the unions are expected to drop their plan for a day of action on April 11, expected to be endorsed at a TUC meeting next Tuesday. Instead they aim to gain public support through a long campaign focusing on the lower-paid public-sector workers. Union leaders yesterday called on the government to abandon the pay bill freeze and honour the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies, which cover 1.4m public sector workers, including nurses, teachers, doctors and dentists, and the armed forces. Review body reports for doctors and nurses - now with the government - suggest rises of up to 3 per cent. Members of the review bodies are in a politically sensitive position. They must recommend what they believe public-service workers should be paid compared with similar workers in the private sector, but they do not want their reports to be rejected by the government. Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, associate general secretary of Unison, Britain's biggest union, said: 'Any undue pressure or interference by ministers would be a bitter betrayal of the review bodies' key role in keeping industrial stability.' He warned that there would be a backlash among nurses and other public-service workers if the government tried to attach productivity strings to their pay rises this year. Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Nurses expect to be treated no differently over their pay than members of parliament who received 2.7 per cent this year.' Nurses, midwives and health visitors are seeking pay rises of up to 10 per cent. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, accused the government yesterday of making up its policy of freezing the public-sector pay bill 'on the hoof'. 'The policy as it stands blatantly discriminates against public-sector workers,' Mr Monks said. 'It will create enormous problems with retention of staff and recruitment and widen the pay gap between different grades, not to mention the effect on morale.' He added: 'We will see a massive pay gulf opening up between the public and private sectors. The policy is just not sustainable.' The Institute of Directors called on the government yesterday to abolish national pay bargaining for the public sector. 'It is the last vestige of the corporate state and should be swept away,' said the institute's policy director Mrs Ann Robinson. 'It is no longer appropriate that teachers and nurses are paid exactly the same throughout the country on a national pay scale,' she added.</p>

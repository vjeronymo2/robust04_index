			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Coles Myer investment fuels battle with Davids THE strategic battle between Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer, and the country's largest wholesale grocery supplier, Davids Holdings, has flared up in public again. Coles Myer yesterday announced it had paid ADollars 18.2m (USDollars 12.3m) for a 14.9 per cent interest in Queensland-based QIW Retailers. Davids has a takeover offer in force for QIW, but the offer has been bogged down by legal action alleging breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Last year, Davids unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent Coles Myer from buying QIW shares. Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive officer of Coles Myer, said last night that the QIW purchase was a strategic investment that would allow Coles to expand into the wholesale grocery market. 'The independent wholesale grocery market has become increasingly important and it has been obvious for some time that there would be major rationalisation in that segment,' he said. Coles would seek appropriate representation on the QIW board but had 'no present intention' of purchasing further shares, Mr Bartels added.</p>

The male  driver died on arrival at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, a nursing supervisor  said.  </P> <P> One of the boys, about 8 years old, was in extremely critical condition at the  hospital Friday evening, the nursing supervisor said. The fourth boy, thought  to be about 15 years old, was in serious condition, she said.  </P> <P> Robbins said the flatbed trailer, loaded with couches, chairs and other heavy  objects, crossed the center divider and collided with the eastbound Cadillac,  which burst into flames.  </P> <P> The driver of the Toyota truck that was towing the trailer was not injured,  Robbins said.  </P> <P> All eastbound lanes were closed until about 7:40 p.m. Westbound lanes were  reopened about an hour after the crash.  </P></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Mellon buys The Boston Co for Dollars 1.4bn SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street securities firm owned by American Express, is selling The Boston Company, a private banking and investment services company, to Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank for Dollars 1.45bn (Pounds 730m). Yesterday's announcement triggered fresh speculation on Wall Street that the disposal might be the prelude to the sale by American Express of Shearson itself or an offer of its stock to the public. American Express has repeatedly denied any such plan. Shearson announced in early August it planned to sell The Boston Company, which has loans and other assets of around Dollars 9bn and is involved in mutual fund administration, trust and custody services for institutional investors, institutional investment management and private banking for wealthy individuals. The acquisition expands Mellon's sizeable position in these fields. It will become a leading US provider of mutual fund administration services. The deal reinforces Mellon's strategy of focusing on revenues from the provision of services as much as on lending activities. The strategy was put in place in the late 1980s after Mellon, suffered serious loan problems in the property and energy markets. The Dollars 1.45bn Shearson will get for The Boston Company is higher than market expectations and underscores the premium prices commanded by fund management and investment services companies. Shearson expects to book an after-tax gain of about Dollars 150m from the sale, which would reduce goodwill around Dollars 100m, increasing tangible equity Dollars 250m. The sale will cut Shearson's assets, boosting its equity-to-assets ratio towards the level analysts say is necessary for American Express to sell the company or float a tranche of its stock. Mellon will pay Dollars 1.301bn in cash, Dollars 115m in the bank's common stock and Dollars 37m in share warrants. It will fund the deal by issuing a further Dollars 150m in common stock, Dollars 150m in perpetual preferred stock and Dollars 815m in senior debt. The bank said it expected to book a one-time after-tax charge of Dollars 112m for consolidation expenses. Mellon shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 40 1/4 in New York. American Express rose Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 22 3/4.</p>

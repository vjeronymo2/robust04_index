			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KAIFU WINS 46.5% IN JAPAN OPINION POLL  </P> <P> Japan's new prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, won 46.5% support in an opinion  poll, one of the lowest ratings for an incoming premier but far above that for  his ill-fated predecessor, Sosuke Uno, the newspaper Tokyo Shimbun reported  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Uno started his brief term with only 35.5% support in the polls and resigned 68  days later, taking responsibility for the Liberal Democratic Party's  humiliating defeat in July upper house elections and discredited by allegations  that he paid a geisha for sex.  </P></p>

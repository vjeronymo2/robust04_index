			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons in the bid frame TAKEOVER speculation over Fisons increased yesterday, partly as a result of heavy trading in the derivatives market by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank and securities house. The whole drugs sector was in favour again, rebounding from its recent poor performance on the belief that losses related to US healthcare reforms had been overdone. However, Fisons ended the day, against the overall market trend, as one of the strongest performers in the FT-SE Index of London's 100 most highly valued stocks. Rumours have circulated around the company for some time but speculation has increased over the past few days. One bearish analyst said yesterday: 'The company is an obvious takeover target because the management has lost credibility.' Hanson, French group Rhone Poulenc, and ICI's soon to be demerged pharmaceuticals arm Zeneca, were cited as companies that might be interested in making an offer. Fisons shares avoided the malaise in the market on Tuesday and yesterday the shares added 10 at 246p. Turnover of 5.8m was at the high end of average volumes and was further boosted by the equivalent of another 2.5m shares in the options market. Insurers troubled The well-flagged Pounds 428m rights issue by Commercial Union caused no real problems for the shares, which bounced after an initial markdown by dealers and a brief flurry of selling. But it troubled other composites as the market focused on the next potential group to raise equity capital. CU shares dropped to 580p following the cash call news before stabilising and staging a strong upward push to close 12 higher at 610p. Mr Trevor May, insurance analyst at BZW, said the market's support reflected the company's 'proven track record' but cautioned that the shares were 'fully valued'. Other specialists were more enthusiastic. Mr Youssef Ziai, at Morgan Stanley, said worries about a cash call had acted as a brake on the shares and he now expected a period of outperformance. Switching out of General Accident to take up the CU 'rights' and worries that GA may be the next insurer to raise capital saw the former's shares 26 weaker at 569p. It was pointed out that GA followed CU in raising capital via preference issues last year. Guardian Royal eased 3 to 167p but was not seen as likely to launch any fund-raising short term. Nor was Royal, 4 better at 273p. Reuters hit News and information group Reuters Holdings dropped sharply on selling from the US following the company's results statement on Tuesday, as well as some disillusionment among UK investors. Reuters shares were below 1200p at one stage and closed a net 66 lower at 1316p on active turnover of 3.4m, the highest for almost a year. The slide was prompted principally by a fall of Dollars 3 7/8 in the American Depositary Receipts on Wall Street ahead of a results presentation for US analysts. In addition, agency broker James Capel reiterated its sell recommendation, arguing that the stock was over-rated and needed to fall another 100p before reaching a justifiable level. A barrage of sell recommendations unsettled the oil majors, where BP dipped 5 to 266p and Shell 7 to 588p. Mr Jeremy Hudson, oil analyst at Lehman Brothers, described both stocks as trading sells ahead of this weekend's Opec meeting. He said BP has risen 46 per cent since the dividend cut last August and had outperformed the FT All-Share Index by 11 per cent during the last month. 'There is very little room for disappointment at the Opec meeting or for any reversal of the pound against the dollar,' said Mr Hudson, who added that current valuations now appear to discount most of the strong 1994 earnings recovery prospects. NatWest Securities adopted a bearish stance on Shell, citing 'awful margins in refining and chemicals'. There was no let-up in takeover speculation surrounding the bank sector, with old favourites Standard Chartered and TSB both sharply higher on stories that Lloyds Bank could be about to embark on a big bid. Lloyds is scheduled to announce preliminary results tomorrow. TSB closed 8 1/2 up at 171p on heavy turnover of 9.6m shares but remained well below the 179p all-time peak they achieved at the start of last week when the latest spate of rumours first emerged. Standard Chartered, due to report 1992 profits well ahead of last year's Pounds 205m on March 10, jumped 21 to 631p. Lloyds held at 515p. Trafalgar House gained 2 at 86 1/2 p on talk that an expected cash call would be in the form of convertible stock issued to shareholders and amount to between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m. Cadbury-Schweppes rose 6 to 467p on talk of a positive note and upgrade by SG Warburg. While moving its figures from the bottom to mid-range in the market, Warburg was seemingly pointing up Cadbury's currency attractions and the fading need for a rights issue as a result. Selected food retailers bounced after the recent pounding on the back of VAT fears. Argyll Group firmed 6 to 367p, Kwik Save 7 to 802p and Tesco 5 to 239p. J. Sainsbury missed the party, the shares being under a shadow from a line of unplaced stock. They closed steady at 529p. However, Albert Fisher managed to place its overhang and the stock rose 3 to 69p. Turnover was a large 11m. Bid talk around Alexon refused to die, the shares adding a penny at 82p. Boots shed 4 to 486p on worries over NHS prescription costs. Kingfisher fell 10 to 516p on concern over the rights issue to fund its supposed purchase of Darty, the French electrical retailer. Storehouse confirmed the departure of its chief executive and it lost 10 to 184p. ICI fell 26 to 1145p after investors sold heavily in the US on Tuesday night. There was also growing concern that actual and expected rights issues, combined with the UK government's heavy gilts programme, would drain money from the market and cast doubt over any ICI fund-raising exercise. If ICI is unable to raise money after its results on February 25, some analysts are doubtful over the likelihood of the proposed split between the chemicals and pharmaceuticals arms going ahead. BOC firmed 3 to 739p ahead of figures today. The market is looking for a first quarter profit of about Pounds 89m. Shares in Simon Engineering tumbled after the company revealed a Pounds 5m contract loss. The news prompted analysts to reduce profits forecasts and the shares fell 20 to 119p. Bid talk in Vickers gathered momentum and the shares jumped 8 to 132p. Industrial group Charter Consolidated, which sold its stake in Johnson Matthey on Tuesday, was once again mentioned as a likely predator. Charter shares were a penny easier at 655p while those of Johnson fell 5 to 468p. Late selling of Lucas Industries saw the shares give up 6 to 139p in trade of 3.3m. The company has been seeing analysts and some said trading conditions in the automotive division are worse than expected, although this might be offset by tough cost-cutting plans. Heavy two-way business persisted for a third day in Forte, with dealers saying that buying led by James Capel was being met by bears in the market still convinced that the dividend may be at risk. After gaining against the market trend, the shares lost 4 to 186p in heavy turnover of about 8m. French press talk persisted over changes being planned by Walt Disney management to their arrangement with Euro Disney which would be beneficial to the latter's shareholders. The shares surged, but later retreated to close just 2 ahead at 915p. Rights issue talk pervaded the drinks stocks, with the usual favourite, Allied Lyons, being joined by Grand Metropolitan. According to market gossip, GrandMet was casting around to make a Pounds 200m-plus call in order to finance debt and a possible acquisition. Its shares weakened 7 to 437p, with Allied 3 off at 586p. Market rumours ahead of the latest consultation from Ofwat, the water regulatory authority, proved wide of the mark. The paper, released yesterday, said that Ofwat would 'look carefully' at the way growth is financed. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (108).

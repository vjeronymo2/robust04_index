			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Dylan - Pop concert What drives Bob Dylan on to tour and tour again remains a profound mystery. The never-ending circuits of the world must fulfil some deep psychological need that a more sedentary form of existence could not. For Dylan to stay in seclusion, dispensing the occasional album with the seigneurial flourish befitting a rock legend of his luminosity obviously would not suit him. Yet there is no evidence that he takes any obvious delight in the contact with his fans; for two hours he gives and the audience takes, while not a word is spoken and smiles are strictly rationed. It is an uncomfortable prospect; there are too many gruesome reports from around the world of an apparently bored Dylan going through the motions oblivious of surroundings while his band does its best to second-guess the next move, to approach any appearance with positive expectations. Tuesday's concert was the third in Dylan's week-long London run. By his standards it was a relaxed and involved affair; at times he seemed almost perky. It was also, in its way, totally spell-binding. There were plenty of ragged edges (does this man ever rehearse a song from beginning to end, one wonders?), a sprinkling of miscalculations (usually involving the harmonica), but never a hint that he was anything but fully engaged. His current four-piece band has a country-rock feel, leavening its heavyweight guitars and drums with string bass, slide guitar and mandolin; that sound was laid down at the very start of the set, moving from 'Maggie's Farm' through 'Every Grain of Sand' and 'Tangled Up in Blue' (the resilience of this song in particular tested almost to destruction) on to a fierce, unforgiving 'All Along the Watchtower' which gradually built in intensity and concentrated Dylan's efforts ever more. The same kind of momentum was generated at the end of the evening, by which point it was possible to adjudge that Dylan was, really, enjoying himself. Perhaps that is the point. It is the search for the fix that comes from the occasional great performance which keeps him going, so that each concert is an experiment, an attempt to find another means to that end. How else to explain the constant worrying away at the lyrics and the melodic lines? In a treasurable acoustic set halfway through Dylan refurbished something of his most familiar songs from the sixties. There was nothing arbitrary or wilful about it - the tender way in which 'Mr Tambourine Man' was recast, shorn of its yearning vocal line and delivered as an introverted chant complete with haunted harmonica coda, or 'Don't Think Twice' had its melody completely recast seemed anything but arbitrary. For the fans hearing those songs now may be a precious exercise in nostalgia; for Dylan still, extraordinarily, they carry the potential for renewal and refinement. At the Hammersmith Apollo until Saturday</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Airlines of Britain in black and strong start this year AIRLINES OF Britain, the holding company for British Midland Airways, remained in the black last year despite a recession that has pushed some direct competitors in Europe into substantial losses. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 834,000 in the year to end-December on sales which moved ahead 14.5 per cent at Pounds 392m. However, Sir Michael Bishop, chairman, said the airline rebounded from a poor start last year to record a strong first quarter in 1993. British Midland, the largest airline, made operating profits of Pounds 833,000 (Pounds 2.56m); losses at Loganair were reduced to Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.97m) while Manx Airlines saw profit decline to Pounds 87,000 (Pounds 1.6m). 'We have kept the business in the black in one of the most difficult periods I have seen in Civil Aviation,' Sir Michael said. The first half had been affected by passengers trading down from business class. Passengers were now returning to the front of the aircraft, partly due to the introduction of the Diamond Euro-class. After British Airways' takeover last autumn of Dan Air, passengers had also moved back to Heathrow from Gatwick, leading to a strong last quarter, Sir Michael said. Mr Austin Reid, managing director of British Midland, said that despite recession the group had met its strategic target of expanding the international side of the business. International sales had grown from 15 per cent five years ago to 50 per cent today. Mr Reid said British Midland had regained some market share on the Belfast and Glasgow routes after British Airways last month reduced the frequency in its flights. The increase in frequency in 1991 had been an attempt to 'marginalise us', said Mr Reid.</p>

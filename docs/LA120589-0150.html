			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> COCOA GROUP EXPELS U.S. FIRM  </P> <P> The U.S. commodity trade house Philipp Brothers Inc., known as Phibro, was  expelled from the French cocoa trade association today, dealing the firm  another setback in its bid to become the world's largest cocoa trader.  </P> <P> Phibro, a unit of brokerage powerhouse Salomon Inc., was banished from the AFCC  because it missed a Dec. 4 deadline for paying compensation to the  International Cocoa Organization and five trade competitors, the organization  announced.  </P> <P> The AFCC had ordered the compensation, estimated to total at least $4.7  million, after Phibro failed to deliver cocoa to the ICO and the trade houses  in 1988.  </P> <P> Cocoa traders said the expulsion would have little immediate practical impact  on Phibro. But they said it would tarnish the firm's image and perhaps damage  its relations with Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer and a former  French colony.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Eligibility of Activities and Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible Activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following activities are eligible for funding to the extent that they are essential to the goal of improving and maintaining a lower vacancy rate at the PHA. The extent to which activities requested for funding are essential to the achievement of this goal will be determined by HUD on the basis of the application and the vacancy assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Management improvements that have the following characteristics:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The management improvements generally may not exceed 25% of the hard costs to be funded (exclusive of costs for lead-based paint abatement and handicapped accessibility), except that higher amounts for management improvements may be approved when such expenditures are deemed by HUD to be critical to the reduction of vacancies in the PHA. Management improvements include, but are not limited to: activities permitted under paragraph 2&hyph;3 of CIAP Handbook 7485.1 (Rev. 4); equal opportunity and civil rights training; and the development of appropriate procedures when there are management problems regarding the PHA's administration of equal opportunity requirements; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The management improvement costs shall be funded one time only, to cover a period not to exceed three years or, with regard to PHAs with serious management difficulties, such period as is proposed by the PHA and approved by HUD. Where an approved Vacancy Reduction Program includes management improvements that involve ongoing costs, such as security, HUD will not be obligated to provide any continued funding or additional operating subsidy after the funded period. The PHA shall be responsible for finding other funding sources or reducing its ongoing management costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Rehabilitation or repair of vacant eligible units to bring the unit at least into compliance with the Housing Quality Standards (HQS), as set forth in 24 CFR 882.109. Correction of HQS deficiencies outside the unit is not required, unless the correction of the HQS deficiencies is essential to the marketability of the vacant units in the development. Any physical component that is replaced must meet the standards for such components set forth in the Public Housing Modernization Standards Handbook, 7485.2 Rev.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Costs necessary to provide accessibility in eligible units to persons with disabilities, in accordance with the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Lead-based paint activity, as defined in Section I.D of this NOFA, in eligible units. For lead-based paint (LBP) activities, the PHA is required to comply with 24 CFR part 965, subpart H, and 24 CFR part 35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Development-wide improvements that are essential to the marketability of the eligible units, such as improvements made to enhance security or ``curb appeal.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Reconfiguration of the interior of buildings or units when there is documentation of significant problems in marketability for the currently available unit size. Documentation for reconfiguration must meet the requirements of HUD Handbook 7465.1 REV. In addition, where reconfiguration is requested, applicants must document that the lack of demand for these units is not compounded by the failure of the PHA to transfer inappropriately housed families. Approval of an application under this NOFA that includes reconfiguration activity will constitute HUD approval of the reconfiguration and no further HUD approval is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) When vacancies are attributable to families being overhoused, activities relating to reassigning those families and repairing of the occupied units made vacant by the reassignment may be included in the PHA request, if the reassignment is essential to correcting the vacancy problem. However, such units will be considered only if the reassignment and repair is likely to result in a decrease of the vacancy rate in the PHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Other related activities and improvements eligible under the modernization program (see 24 CFR part 968), such as administrative expenses, fees and costs, nondwelling structures and equipment, and relocation, but only to the extent that such costs are necessary to support activity otherwise eligible and are essential to the achievement and maintenance of a lower vacancy rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Demolition of vacant units, when a demolition application has been approved by HUD and the demolition has not been previously funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) If the PHA has fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, the PHA will be reimbursed for the costs of rehabilitating the formerly vacant units only if funds remain available after the Department has funded all other eligible costs at all PHAs applying for funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible Costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The total amount of funding for which a PHA is eligible is the sum of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) For each development, the necessary costs of rehabilitation of eligible units; development-wide physical improvements, including common areas; demolition; or reconfiguration. These costs are not to exceed $8,000 times the number of eligible units in the development at the time of application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Necessary costs of management improvements, not to exceed 25% of the total hard costs to be funded for all developments (exclusive of costs for lead-based paint abatement and handicapped accessibility), except that the Assistant Secretary may approve higher amounts for management improvements when such expenditures are deemed critical to reduction of vacancies in the PHA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Other related costs as discussed in paragraph (1)(h) (under ``Eligible Activities'') of this Section I.F;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Necessary costs for lead-based paint containment or abatement in eligible units; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Necessary costs for handicapped accessibility for eligible units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ineligible Activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Activities are not eligible if the activities are under contract; have been selected for funding from other sources, such as Urban Revitalization Demonstration (URD) grants, CIAP, or State or local funding; or if the PHA has sufficient funds in its operating budget or pursuant to its formula grant under the CGP to fund the activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sufficiency of funds will be determined as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) For hard costs, a CGP agency will be deemed to have insufficient funds for the activities if the Assessment of Physical Needs in the Comprehensive Plan shows a need for funds greater than the funds expected to be available to the PHA under the CGP in the next five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For management improvements, a CGP agency will be deemed to have insufficient funds if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For CGP agencies, the Management Needs Assessment in the Comprehensive Plan shows a need for funds greater than 10% of the funds expected to be available to the PHA under its CGP in the next five years; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The PHA plans to use at least 10% of its CGP funds for management improvements in each of the next five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In addition, for CGP and Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) agencies, operating funds will be deemed to be insufficient only if the PHA has an operating reserve of less than 75% of the maximum allowable reserve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Resident Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHA shall develop a process that assures that residents are fully briefed, have an opportunity to comment on the proposed content of the PHA's application in response to this NOFA, and to be involved in all phases of the process. Particular attention shall be given to opportunities for resident employment. The PHA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of residents. The process shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Informing residents of the applicable housing developments about the preparation of the application, including a discussion of the report of the assessment team and actions that will be taken to address any deficiencies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

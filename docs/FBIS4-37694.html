			<p>BFN     [Text] Dawud al-Zir, chairman of the Union of Palestinian  Contractors, held a news conference today in the press office of  the embassy of the state of Palestine in Amman. The news  conference was attended by a number of journalists and media  figures.    During the news conference, brother al-Zir stressed that the  Palestinian leadership, because of its great eagerness to  preserve strong, brotherly Palestinian-Jordanian ties, wants to  give Jordanian contractors an opportunity to work in the  self-rule areas on an equal footing with their Palestinian  brothers.    Mr. al-Zir called on Palestinian and Jordanian contractors  to  now join efforts; huge efforts are required to rebuild the  infrastructure of Palestinian authority, destroyed by years of  occupation. He stressed that the projects in the self-rule  areas will be large and numerous and will encompass all aspects  of life.    He added: The projects under proposal are large and beyond  the capabilities of local contractors. We have worked together  with our Jordanian brothers in several countries and we must  work together again. As the economic agreement between Jordan  and Palestine provides for free trade between the two countries,  contracts should also be free from restrictions, he said.  Brother al-Zir concluded by saying that the agreement to be  signed by the two countries will include this fundamental issue  so that Palestinian-Jordanian relations will be strong and free.  He called on everyone to cooperate, bolster mutual interests,  and coordinate the conditions of work.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSHA PROPOSES STANDARD ON BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS  </P> <P> The Labor Department on Tuesday proposed regulations designed to protect 5.3  million workers from exposure to blood and other bodily fluids potentially  infected with AIDS, hepatitis and other serious viruses.  </P> <P> Occupational Safety and Health Administration spokesman Frank Kane said the  proposed standard would be the agency's first formal regulation on biological  hazards.  </P> <P> Kane said 4.7 million health care workers would be covered by the standard, as  well as an additional 600,000 persons working in law enforcement, fire and  rescue crews, correctional facilities, research laboratories, blood banks and  the funeral industry.  </P> <P> "It's a very big deal," said Jordan Barab, health and safety director of the  American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "We have members  all over the country working at hospitals and, despite all the publicity about  precautions, people tell us over and over that gloves aren't available, needle  boxes aren't available," he said, referring to two of the precautions  recommended for protecting workers.  </P> <P> Hearings on the proposal are scheduled for the fall and Barab said it could  take a year for the proposal to be finalized.  </P> <P> The rules would require employers to evaluate routine tasks and procedures in  the workplace that involve exposure to blood or other potentially infectious  materials, identify the workers performing these tasks and use several methods  to reduce the risks.  </P> <P> Some of the approaches to be used to reduce risk include a written infection  control plan, changes in equipment, such as the use of puncture-resistant  containers for the disposal of needles, and the use of protective clothing,  such as gloves.  </P> <P> OSHA officials estimated that the proposed standard would prevent 10,000  infections and more than 200 deaths a year for both health care workers  initially exposed to blood-borne diseases and other viruses, as well as those  who may be subsequently exposed to viruses by other workers.  </P> <P> "It's basically a sound proposal, but it's long overdue," said Margaret  Seminario, the AFL-CIO's health and safety director. Unions first petitioned  OSHA in September, 1986 to enact an emergency standard that would have codified  guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control governing worker  exposure to blood-borne diseases. But OSHA declined to act.  </P> <P> In November, 1987, OSHA began to enforce the CDC guidelines through the use of  its general duty clause, a catch-all provision of federal safety and health law  that requires all employers to maintain a workplace free from recognized  hazards. The new regulations would be considerably more specific and easier to  enforce, Seminario said.  </P> <P> Barab expressed concern that the proposed regulations do not set priorities for  compliance methods, a deviation from OSHA's normal practice.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> FEE DISTRICT OKD TO FUND INTERCHANGE  </P> <P> To raise more than $8 million of the city's share for constructing a Santa Ana  Freeway interchange at Bake Parkway, the City Council recently approved a fee  district that will charge developers in the yet-to-be-built portions of the  Irvine Spectrum business complex.  </P> <P> The private fee district was requested by the Irvine Co., the major landholder  in the affected area of the Spectrum complex that is between Alton Parkway and  Lake Forest Drive.  </P> <P> According to a November, 1988, study ordered by city and county officials, the  developer fees will raise $8.4 million toward the projected $15.5-million cost  of the interchange.  </P> <P> The other $6.7 million will come mostly from developer fees charged under the  Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan.  </P> <P> That plan was established by the county to help fund road construction in the  unincorporated area encompassing the communities of Lake Forest, El Toro and  Rancho Santa Margarita, officials said.  </P> <P> Because of the fee district, the city of Irvine will not have to pay for  building the interchange. Fees will be charged to landholders in the district  when they apply for building permits at City Hall.  </P> <P> The fees will vary depending on the location and size of the project.

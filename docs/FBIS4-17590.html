			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "General Grachev Sees No Tragedy </F> in Breakdown of Sevastopol Talks"]    [Text] "The dividing up of the Black Sea Fleet, in my  view, is part of the election campaign, and it is impossible to  resolve this problem until the presidential elections in  Ukraine," Russian Defense Minister Army General P. Grachev  stated in answer to a question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent.    On his return to Moscow from Sevastopol, where he headed  Russia's official delegation at the talks with Ukraine on the  problem of dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, the general held a  press conference for Russian and foreign journalists. Grachev  described the Ukrainian delegation's stance vis-a-vis Russia as  discriminatory.    Kiev proposed creating a base for the Russian Black Sea  Fleet, which, as is well known, includes 85 percent of the  fleet's ships and craft, in a small coastal settlement. Kiev's  representatives also refused to discuss dividing up the fleet's  infrastructure, namely bases, aircraft, airfields, depots, and  shore units, without which the fleet cannot exist. Moreover,  the Ukrainian military proposed that Russian ships should put to  sea and return only via a single channel, each time securing the  Ukrainian side's permission three days in advance.    The Russian defense minister said that his department has no  confrontation with the Ukrainian military. No tragedy occurred.  Russia expressed its viewpoint and listened to the Ukrainian  side's position, and let the presidents now put the military  right. The two sides simply must resolve the problem on a  compromise basis in the interests of both countries, their  peoples, and the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet.    Russia's position is this: We must continue the talks, set  up a state commission under the leadership of the prime  ministers or their first deputies, and include in the delegation  not only military men and diplomats, but also specialist  economists, financiers, and others.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / ITV poised to raise Pounds 15m in sponsorship INDEPENDENT Television is likely to raise about Pounds 15m this year through sponsorship deals, reaching about Pounds 50m a year by 1995-96, according to Mr Alan Chilton, chairman of the ITV sponsorship committee. Mr Chilton presented results yesterday from four examples of ITV sponsorship deals in the past 12 months: Beamish Stout, owned by Courage, sponsored Inspector Morse, the detective series from Central TV, for Pounds 750,000 from January to April this year. Beamish said its market share of stout sold in pubs increased from 4.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent over the period of the series. Sales of Beamish in cans increased by 145 per cent during the same period compared with the corresponding period last year. Croft Port, owned by International Distillers and Vinters Morgan Furze division, paid Pounds 300,000 to sponsor the Thames TV courtroom drama series, Rumpole of the Bailey, between October and December last year. According to the ITV sponsorship committee, Croft's sales increased by 50 per cent during the period. Barclaycard sponsored the Thames TV travel programme Wish You Were Here between December last year and March this year for Pounds 500,000. Viewer awareness of Barclaycard increased significantly. Sega, the electronic games manufacturer, paid Pounds 2m to sponsor ITV coverage of the European football championship in June. ITV research found that 70 per cent of all males aged between 10 and 25 who watched seven or more matches were aware that Sega had sponsored the programmes. Mr Chilton foresaw expanded interest by advertisers in using ITV sponsorship avenues. He said the company was looking to follow the French model and to achieve 2 per cent of net advertising revenue from sponsorship.</p>

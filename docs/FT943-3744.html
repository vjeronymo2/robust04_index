			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Bolger forced into first coalition New Zealand has its first coalition government for 50 years following the decision of junior minister, Mr Ross Meurant, to form his own party which will continue to support the administration of prime minister Jim Bolger. Mr Bolger said in a radio interview yesterday that Mr Meurant's move was expected and he believed another party backbencher, Michael Laws, would also announce he was forming a new party soon. Mr Meurant announced the formation of the Right of Centre Party on Sunday night He said it aimed to appeal to disgruntled former members of the National party who wanted a more moderate approach, and to provide a potential coalition partner for the National party after the next election. Right of Centre would pitch itself at 15-20 per cent of voters in each constituency, and hoped to gain at least 10 seats. Mr Bolger has said for some time that he expected defections from both main political parties as New Zealand moved towards adopting a voting system giving parties seats in parliament if they achieve a minimum threshold of the national vote, as in Germany. If the National party retains its narrow majority, the next election will be held under this system, favouring smaller parties, rather than the British Westminster system. Mr Bolger said he had entered into an agreement with Mr Meurant who would support the government on all main issues to ensure it stayed in power for its full three-year term. Mr Meurant will retain his post as agriculture and forestry under-secretary. Mr Meurant is a controversial MP who sprang to national prominence in the early 1980s when, as a senior policeman, he led the so-called Red Squads that battled street demonstrators who were fighting against South African rugby tours.</p>

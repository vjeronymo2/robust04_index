			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>   [Text] The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry has opposed  the Foreign Ministry bid to join the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA), which was put into force in January this year  by the United States, Canada and Mexico. The trade ministry has  claimed that Korea would suffer more loss than benefit from its  entry into the trade bloc in an analysis on strategies of world  trading blocs.    The ministry pinpointed four positive aspects if Korea  joined  the tripartite agreement but feared greater loss.    First of all, the entry would promote competition among  businesses as it is expected to accelerate the speed of market  opening and internationalization of domestic companies, the  analysis said.    It forecast that exports to North America would increase as  a  result of the scrapping or reduction of tariffs and U.S.  companies would be promoted to increase investments and  technology transfer to Korea.    Domestic manufacturers could also expect to increase exports  of raw materials and parts, which are strictly applied to  "origin of country" regulations, to the three nations, according  to the ministry.    On the other hand, negative effects would be more serious in  the financial and foreign exchange industry, intellectual  property rights protection, the farm market, labor and  environmental sector.    The ministry said that U.S. tariff rates will be cut to 4  percent non average in four years due to the Uruguay Round [UR]  accord from current 6.2 percent. As a result, the merit from  tariff cut will be meager, it said.    It noted that several items, including garments and musical  instruments, would benefit from the entry as they are  competitive in the United States as U.S. duties will be zero to  bloc members in 10 years.    But the ministry analyzed that sluggish export to the United  States has not resulted from high tariff rates but has derived  from weakened competitiveness.    The domestic agricultural market would be harder hit from  the  entry into NAFTA than from the Uruguay Round accord as the  United States is expected to push ahead with the export of rice,  beef, orange juice and dairy products to Korea. Now a third of  Korea's farm imports comes from the three North American nations.    Textile exports will grow sharply even if Korea gains NAFTA  membership as trade of textile products subject to the  multilateral fiber agreement (MFA) is to be liberalized in  accordance with the UR accord.    Exports of electronics goods and automobiles are expected to  increase as the country of origin regulations will not be  strictly applied to member nations.    Korea will be obligated to open 77 services markets to U.S.  firms completely. Financial, telecommunications and  transportation markets are likely to become the ground of U.S.  companies in case Korea joins the NAFTA, the ministry said.    U.S. high-tech firms in telecommunications equipment,  medium-  and large-sized computers, power generation and the environment  are expected to make inroads into Korea's government procurement  sector.    Korea will also have to remove restrictions on market  access,  foreign exchange dealings and investment.    The United States is certain to mount pressure to protect  its  intellectual property rights through monitoring activities of a  committee set up under the NAFTA pact.    The analysis also pointed out that U.S. manufacturing  companies would not be attracted here than expected as  production costs are higher than those in Mexico and other Latin  American nations in a move to join the body. [sentence as  published]    Based on the analysis, the trade ministry is very cautious  about its entry into the NAFTA, saying that comprehensive  measures would have to be drawn up such as formation of a  special partnership to NAFTA and consolidation of cooperation  with the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) and the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC).    But Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu insisted on two occasions  early this year that Korea should tie up with NAFTA to avoid  possible isolation from NAFTA and Southeast Asian economic blocs.    At the foreign ministers talks, Han called on his Canadian  counterpart to help Korea join the NAFTA in February. Mexico  and Canada have expressed welcome to NAFTA.</p>

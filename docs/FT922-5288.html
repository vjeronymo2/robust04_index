			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (10): A national diet of movies and soccer - Private tv takes on the public networks FROM A computer terminal at his secretary's desk, Juan Cueto is able to watch one of his fantasies slowly become real. He runs Canal Plus, Spain's only pay-TV channel, and the screen he watches gives him a real time count of the number of people subscribing. The formula is simple. 'Spaniards only queue for two things,' he says. 'Movies and football.' And that is what they get on Canal Plus. By the end of this year, he says, Canal Plus will have won half a million subscribers and start making profits. It is just two years since Spain licensed three new private television channels and, if one believes their managers, they are all very close to making money. One, Tele Cinco - controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, the Catalan financier Javier de la Rosa and the Spanish charity for the blind, ONCE  - already challenges the big state-owned networks with a brash mix of game shows, films and an increasingly good news service. As a pay channel, Canal Plus is an outsider. Owned by Canal Plus of France and the publishers of Spain's biggest newspaper, El Pais, it is more easily managed and its finances more clearly definable. The third new channel, Antenna 3, is generally reckoned to be the most vulnerable financially. Concentrating on a more journalistic talk show format has limited audiences but, says its managing director, Mr Manuel Martin Ferrand, the channel will make about Dollars 4m this year. Antenna 3 is controlled mainly by the Godo family, which owns Barcelona's biggest newspaper, La Vanguardia, and its future has been boosted recently by the arrival of of rich and powerful new shareholder, Banesto, one of the country's big five commercial banks. At the moment, signals from these new channels reach about 80 per cent of Spain's television audience and this will rise to 90 per cent by the end of 1993. But there, possibly, the good news may end. Both Tele Cinco and Antenna 3 face a huge hurdle in the form of the State for before granting private sector licences Madrid set in motion one of Europe's most ambitious and expensive public television expansion programmes. This involved allowing the country's 17 autonomous regions to create their own television channels which, like the two big national state-owned channels TVE1 and TVE2, would finance themselves through advertising. That might have been less noteworthy during the 1986 to 1989 boom when advertising was growing sharply, but total TV advertising revenues grew just Dollars 30m to Dollars 1.96bn between 1990 and last year. Television swallows up about 33 per cent of advertising spending in Spain and the State, in addition to being the biggest TV advertiser, is also its biggest consumer. Television channels captive to the parties that rule in the regions have been established in Catalonia (which has two), Andalucia, the Basque Country, Galicia, Valencia and Madrid. Collectively, they form one of the biggest drains on the Spanish public purse and last year were paid direct subsidies by their local governments of Dollars 500m. On each channel, the biggest advertiser was also the local government, which might be counted as a hidden subsidy. By some independent reckonings, these channels may be being subsidised by close to Dollars 1bn a year. The regional channels took 15 per cent of the Spanish television advertising cake last year in what all of the new private channels (including, from a political point of view, Canal Plus which carries no advertising) privately lament as an insurmountable barrier. It is quite likely that more regional channels will emerge as regional political leaders succumb to the lure of controlling such a powerful means of communication. Subsidies to the channels have grown so fast that even the OECD made an oblique criticism of them them in its last report on the Spanish economy. But, for the private channels, the nightmare does not stop there. TVE1 and TVE2 take a full 56 per cent of the TV advertising market. Together, these channels, the oldest in Spain, give new meaning to the now discredited idea that commercial television is a licence to print money. They lost more than Dollars 400m last year and recently announced that between 1992 and 1995 they would lose another Dollars 1.7bn. This year or next, for the first time, TVE may go to the markets to raise up to Dollars 300m to finance itself but they are too valuble a political tool of whatever Government runs the country to be allowed to wither. Private channels privately accuse the public operations of fierce price cutting, meanwhile. In fact, if official tariffs had been applied, TV advertising in Spain would have risen 26 per cent last year. 'We can live with this competition from the State but we cannot progress much,' says Mr Martin Ferrand at Antenna 3. Fortunately for him the Godo family's newspaper and radio operations make negotiating with agencies easier. Spain, meanwhile, has still not implemented the European Community broadcasting directive limiting advertising during films - which always attract the highest audiences in Spain - to just one break every 45 minutes. When it does, something - private, regional or national - will have to give.</p>

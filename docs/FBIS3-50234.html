			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tosho Mukhtanov, chairman of National </F> Assembly Defense Industry Commission, by Major Spiridon  Spiridonov; place and date not given: "The Arms Industry Cannot  Expect Serious Orders"]    [Text] [Spiridonov] Your commission has already begun to  discuss the state budget draft bill. What are your first  impressions?    [Mukhtanov] Our first discussion was primarily related to  the budget of the Ministry of Defense. It is clear that the  means allocated by this draft for material supply are  insufficient, not to mention any import of or orders for  equipment, weapons, and spare parts for our defense industry.  Our military-industrial complex could produce to the tune of  roughly 10 billion leva. If all you have at your disposal is  800-900 million leva for aircraft, vessels, artillery, missiles,  and radar equipment -- what will you do first? Import something  or commission the local defense industry to produce something?  It is obvious that the army cannot commission any orders for  the military-industrial complex.    [Spiridonov] Was your attention directed only at the defense  budget?    [Mukhtanov] We also discussed the budget of the "State  Reserve and Military Stocks" Main Administration. This  administration has not received what it needed in the last few  years, either. On the other hand, material supplies whose  expiry date has been reached have been taken out of the stocks.  This is a very important state system, which, like all other  systems, is continuously being destroyed. It would not be able  to function in the case of a natural disaster. There is an even  greater danger that it would not be able to function in the face  of a military threat. In this context the budget suffices only  for the current maintenance of the warehouses, and the  expenditure on wages, heating, and telephones. The system needs  233 million leva just for its maintenance. The draft budget  allocates 210 million, while the system needs more than 2  billion leva to restore the most necessary elements.    [Spiridonov] The draft budget is not the first sign of the  military-industrial complex's problems.    [Mukhtanov] The idea that was vested in parliament's  decision of last summer to maintain a state policy on the issue  of mobilization readiness and the military-industrial complex  still has no clearly marked dimensions. Soon we will be  demanding a meeting with the Interdepartmental Council, because  so far nothing has changed. There are still not enough people  who could work and analyze the information. The old decisions  from last summer have not been implemented, no new decisions  have been made, and the parameters of the military-industrial  complex have not been outlined. Obviously, a lot of work lies  ahead.    [Spiridonov] The financial means that were allocated are  insufficient, but, nevertheless, are there no reserves?    [Mukhtanov] I implied a certain unused reserve, but let us  not fully specify it. Most private business is making good  profits, but so far most of the tax burden has been carried by  the state structures. Private business remains on the  sidelines. This business should be charged with commitments to  our defense and security, because the army also protects the  interests of those people. We will try to discuss this issue.  However, we lack practical experience in this sphere. We have  passed the Tax Administration Bill. Obviously, now the Accounts  Chamber Bill must be adopted and then mechanisms must be created  for private business to pay specific customs charges, taxes, and  other fees.    [Spiridonov] Nevertheless, is 800-900 million leva too  little?    [Mukhtanov] There is nowhere a specific budget for the  defense industry. We are discussing the Defense Ministry  budget, which is supposed to cover orders for the  military-industrial complex. When the budget is 800-900 million  leva, while the needs amount to 17 billion leva, it is  unthinkable to speak about any orders. Furthermore, the complex  has military-technical property, which the army needs, but does  not have any money to purchase it. If the army had the  necessary budget, both it and the military-industrial complex  could benefit.</p>

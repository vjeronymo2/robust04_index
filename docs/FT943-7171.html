			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Russians catch uranium thieves Two unemployed Russian men have been arrested trying to steal low-grade uranium from a weapons plant in central Russia. They were caught on Saturday with almost 10kg of uranium-238 at the Arzamas-16 plant near Niznhy Novgorod. The arrests followed a joint investigation by the counter-intelligence service, the interior ministry and local security officials. Nuclear experts said that although the material was dangerous it was not of sufficient quality or quantity to make a nuclear bomb. The Russian authorities said that the arrests showed the effectiveness of current security measures. Following talks in Moscow at the weekend between Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Kohl's intelligence co-ordinator, and the Russian authorities, both countries have promised a greater exchange of intelligence information and co-operation to counter plutonium smuggling. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, plans raise the matter with European Union colleagues next month. President Boris Yeltsin is expected to visit Britain next month, Downing Street said last night. British officials said it was hoped he would be in the country over the weekend of September 24-25. An official announcement would be made nearer the time.</p>

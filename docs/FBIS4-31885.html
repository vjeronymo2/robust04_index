			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 15 June (MTI) -- The special cultural  committee set up by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) to prepare the coalition  agreement between the two parties, held a session on Wednesday  [15 June]. The committee deals with cultural, educational,  sports, media, minority, and church policy issues.    At a press conference following the session, committee  Co-Chairmen Gyorgy Janosi (MSZP) and Gabor Fodor (SZDSZ) said  the two delegations worked in a very constructive atmosphere.    As regards the relationship with churches, the coordinated  position of the committee was that the separation of church and  state should be implemented in full.    The committee discussed the situation of minorities in  Hungary and agreed that the existing minority law is a good  starting point from which to determine which tasks relating to  minorities must be given priority by the government. At the  same time, they believe that parliamentary representation for  minorities is an issue which remains to be solved.    The committee began discussions about media-policy issues,  but intends to complete these deliberations only on Friday [17  June]. A decisive issue, according to both parties, is to  prepare and work out a media bill as soon as possible.  According to Fodor, this implies the earliest possible  enactment of a law on genuinely free radio and television.  Janosi added that the opposition should be involved in the  process, in order to reach consensus. He said all parties have  learned from the events of the previous parliamentary cycle, and  have appraised the consequences of the lack of legal regulations  for the media.    Speaking to reporters after the session, both Janosi and  Fodor reacted to the announcement by Prime Minister Peter Boross  that he would initiate relieving the vice-presidents of  Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television of their posts. Janosi  said that had Boross taken this step earlier it would have  elicited political recognition and would have received support  from the media workers. The fact that this step is being taken  directly before the change in government confirms the suspicion  that "this is an escape route from extensive economic,  financial, and labor-rights investigations." According to the  MSZP politician, such an investigation must be carried out on  the previous activities of the two media vice-presidents.    According to Gabor Fodor, with this announcement the prime  minister has acknowledged that the two vice-presidents are  unsuited for the work they have been doing so far. The SZDSZ  politician added it would have been useful if the step had been  taken earlier, as it now has little significance.    Fodor was also of the opinion that offering to relieve the  two vice-presidents is a last action to save the two leaders, in  order for them to escape being held responsible for their  actions. According to Fodor, it would have been more correct for  the two vice-presidents to resign, and for the new government to  evaluate whether or not they had done everything possible to  create an impartial public service media.</p>

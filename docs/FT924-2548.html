			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses upset by Bundesbank's stance THE Bundesbank's decision not to cut interest rates upset continental share prices in the afternoon, but Scandinavian markets were cheered by the effective devaluation of the Norwegian crown, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT traded quietly ahead of the Bundesbank's statement which came after the official close. The DAX index closed down 6.11 at 1,494.48 but after hours in London, the German component of the FT-SE Eurotrack fell 1.3 per cent. Turnover rose to DM4.2bn from DM4bn. Analysts were not surprised by the Bundesbank's stance, taking the view that rates were likely to ease next year when it became more apparent that Germany was in a recession. Daimler, down DM3.30 at DM514.40, said that it expected to show a decline in profits for 1992 in spite of a 40 per cent rise in sales on the year. The company also said it was likely to lose Dollars 1.3bn after Northwest Airlines cancelled an Airbus order this week. Deutsche Bank lost another DM6.50 to DM641.50 following disappointing 10-month figures earlier in the week, while Commerzbank slipped DM1.10 to DM239.00. Dresdner lost DM2.50 to DM346.50. PARIS ended 1.2 per cent lower on disappointment about the Bundesbank's decision, which sharply reduced the possibility of a cut in French interest rates at a time when the economy was suffering and companies were issuing warnings about profits and trading prospects. Dealers said that only speculation about a devaluation in the franc would continue to keep investors interested in French equities. The CAC-40 index fell from the day's high of 1,806.59 to close 21.68 lower at 1,769.48 in good turnover of FFr2.83bn. LVMH dropped FFr175 or 4.7 per cent to FFr3,515 after Guinness, the UK drinks group in which it has a cross-shareholding, issued a gloomy trading forecast. BSN fell FFr18 to FFr948 in sympathy. Saint-Gobain fell FFr12 to FFr516 after Pilkington, its UK rival in the glass industry, reported a sharp drop in first-half pre-tax profits. Lyonnaise des Eaux shed a further FFr6 to FFr454 in spite of news of an Argentine contract, while Elf relapsed by FFr10.50 to FFr339.50 on US selling. OSLO soared 7.5 per cent in response to the government's decision to let the Norwegian crown float free from the Ecu. The crown weakened about 5 per cent from its central rate against the Ecu after the news. The all-share index jumped as high as 404.56 before closing 27.97 higher at 399.38 in turnover worth NKr710m. Industrial shares had the biggest gains on prospects of greater competitiveness. Norsk Hydro rose NKr17.5 to NKr164, while Elkem jumped NKr12 to NKr40. COPENHAGEN was lifted by the Norwegian crown float and expectations of a possible devaluation in the Danish crown. The KFX top-20 index gained 1.11 to 77.18 in turnover of DKr83m. Novo Nordisk and Sophus Berendsen gained DKr13 and DKr2 respectively to DKr583 and DKr387. STOCKHOLM showed a more muted reaction as the Affarsvarlden General Index added 2.9 to 901.1 as turnover declined to SKr734m. Trading in Astra continues to dominate the market ahead of the company's meeting with analysts next week. The B share added SKr16 to SKr743. MILAN was dragged down by Fiat which fell further after the previous day's poor car sales data for November. Position-squaring ahead of the close of the December account next week also put downward pressure on the market. The Comit index fell 6.55 to 425.48 in turnover estimated at L145bn after L135bn. Fiat dropped L195 or 4.7 per cent to L3,930, which reflected its heavy fall after hours on Tuesday. ZURICH remained in positive territory although off earlier highs. The SMI index closed 7.9 higher at 1,988.6. Georg Fischer bearers fell SFr65 or 9.5 per cent to SFr620 after Wednesday's disappointing forecast for 1992. AMSTERDAM ignored a small cut in domestic interest rates and the CBS Tendency index closed 0.9 weaker at 105.3. Nedlloyd lost Fl 2.20 to Fl 30.70 as the group said that it would be making fresh cash calls on the capital market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 10 THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1056.02  1055.16   1054.31  1054.24 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1129.24  1129.36   1129.33  1129.30                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1056.15  1054.24   1050.45  1049.63 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1132.97  1129.87   1126.53  1123.58  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dec 9     Dec 8     Dec 7     Dec 4     Dec 3 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1054.06   1051.12   1056.02   1052.78   1055.11 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1133.46   1135.64   1137.52   1133.53   1136.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1058.77; 200 - 1133.69 Low/day: 100 - 1048.97  200 - 1122.83  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

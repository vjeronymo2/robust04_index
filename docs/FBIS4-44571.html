The  effects of technical parameters such as the pH values, solvents,  and drying processes on gelling time and gel properties are  studied. The transition process from gel to PLZT powder is  investigated with XRD and TG-DTA [thermogravimetry/differential  thermal analysis]. The effects of gel structure and roasting  temperature on the properties of PLZT powder are also examined  with XRD and TG-DTA. Experiments show that the gel forms PLZT  solid solution at 520C and that when roasted at 550C,  the gel produces PLZT powder with particle diameter smaller than  0.2 m.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The ceramic (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O[.sub]3[/] (PLZT) has good  electro-optic properties. Especially, PLZT thin film has great  application potential in optoelectronic devices such as  photo-sensitive valves, electro-optic displays, etc. Recently,  other countries have researched various synthesizing methods to  make PLZT ceramic powders, among which are the solid state  method,[.sup]1[/] the co-precipitation method,[.sup]2[/]  the alkoxide hydrolysis method,[.sup]3-5[/] etc. This  investigation adopts a sol-gel method. The different raw  materials of proper compositions in solution state are first  mixed; thus, the mixing proceeds among the molecules. The final  powder product made from the solution has superior properties  such as very fine particle size, precise chemical composition,  good uniformity, high reactivity, and low synthetic temperature.  The future of the sol-gel process is appealing.    Fine powder with the composition of (Pb[.sub]0.91[/],  La[.sub]0.09[/])(Zr[.sub]0.65[/],  Ti[.sub]0.35[/])O[.sub]3[/], or PLZT (La/Zr/Ti = 9/65/35)  is prepared by the sol-gel method with metal isopropylates as  raw materials. The effect of gelation process on gel properties,  as well as the effect of gel quality and roasting temperature on  powder particle size and properties are studied. Some useful  results are obtained.  <H5>  2. Experimental Work </H5> <H5>  2.1 Preparation of Raw Materials </H5>   (Note: All the experimental chemical agents are either  analytically pure or chemically pure.)    Preparation of Zirconium Isopropylate and Titanium  Isopropylate: Zirconium isopropylate and titanium isopropylate  are prepared by the following equations:  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Preparation of Lead Isopropylate: Pure dehydrated lead  acetate is prepared by heating trihydrate lead acetate at  80C-90C for 8 hours. Sodium isopropylate is prepared  through the refluxed reaction between a proper amount of  metallic sodium and isopropyl alcohol at 40C to 50C  for 1 hour. After that, lead acetate and a proper amount of  benzene are added into the bath. The refluxed reaction is  continued for another 2 hours. Finally, lead isopropylate is  obtained by filtering the solution and removing the benzene at a  reduced pressure. The reaction is shown as follows:  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Preparation of Lanthanum Isopropylate: First,  LaCl[.sub]3[/] is prepared from the reaction between  La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and NH[.sub]4[/]Cl; then the  reaction of LaCl[.sub]3[/] with sodium isopropylate produces  La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] according to  the following equation:  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  2.2 Preparation of Gel and PLZT </H5>   According to the molar ratio, specific amounts of  Pb(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]2[/] and  La(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]3[/] are loaded in a  three-port flask. A proper amount of isopropyl alcohol is then  added into the flask and the reaction is refluxed for 1 hour.  Then, the isopropyl alcohol solutions of  Ti(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] and  Zr(i-OC[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]7[/])[.sub]4[/] are  successively and gradually added, and the reaction is refluxed  for another hour before a proper amount of water is added to the  solution. The specific pH value of the solution is adjusted with  HAc and NH[.sub]4[/]OH. The refluxing goes on until the  solution turns into sol, which is transferred to a plastic  container. The assembly is transferred to a clean location. At  room temperature the sol turns into wet gel, then the wet gel is  dried into dry gel under certain conditions.    The dry gel is loaded in a muffle furnace. After the furnace  temperature is raised to 550C at a prescribed heating rate,  and maintained at 550C for 2 hours, the dry gel decomposes  into PLZT microfine powder.  <H5>  2.3 Property Evaluation </H5>   The gel apparent density and gel porosity are measured by  the  ethanol soaking method. The DTA and TG curves of the gel are  measured with a PCT-1 differential thermal balance (made by  Beijing Optical Instrument Plant). The specific surface area of  PLZT powder is measured by the BET low temperature nitrogen  adsorption method. The X-ray spectrum of the powder is  determined with a Rigaku D/max-rB X-ray spectrometer made in  Japan. The powder surface configuration is observed with a Type  S-250Mkj scanning electron microscope (SEM). The powder particle  diameters (D[.sub]50[/] and D[.sub]v[/]) and their  distributions are measured with a BI-90 laser scattering  particle analyzer made in the United States.  <H5>  3. Results and Discussions </H5> <H5>  3.1 Effect of pH Value on Gelling Time and Gel Structure </H5>   The sol-gel process of metal isopropylates is generally  believed to be a two-step reaction process, the hydrolysis and  the polycondensation of the metal isopropylates. The speed and  the degree of completion of both reactions are determined by  factors such as pH values, catalysts, etc.    Measurement of gelling time: The gelling time is measured  from the time when the sol reaches room temperature to the time  when the gel solidifies to such a condition that its surface  does not move while the container is tilted to  45.[.sup]6[/]    Figure 1 shows the effect of pH value (from 2 to 9) on  gelling time. It shows that the longest gelling time occurs when  the pH value is between 6 and 7. When the pH value is greater  than 7 the gelling speed increases rapidly. When the pH value is  less than 5, the change of gelling speed is not apparent. It is  easier to control the gelling speed by adding acidic solution.  Besides, acidic solution also produces uniform transparent gel.  It is difficult to control the gelling speed with a basic  solution, which also makes the gel less transparent.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Effect of pH Value on the Gelation Time&lt;/graphic&gt;     The pH value of the solvent also clearly affects the gel  structure as shown in Figure 2. When the pH value is low, the  gel apparent density and gel porosity change only slightly with  change in pH value. When the pH value is greater than 6, with  increase in the pH value, the apparent density (Curve 1) rapidly  decreases and the porosity rapidly increases (Curve 2).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Effect of pH Value on the Apparent Density and  Porosity of the Gel&lt;/graphic&gt;     The aforementioned results show that the catalytic effects  of  acid or base on the sol-gel process are quite different. Further  study on the catalytic mechanism is needed.  <H5>  3.2 Effect of Solvent on Gel Structure </H5>   Figure 3 displays the apparent densities of gels made with  different monohydric alcohols as solvents. It shows that when  straight-chain monohydric alcohol is used, the dry gel apparent  density increases with the increase of solvent surface tension.  During gel drying, the capillary force controls the gel frame  contraction. And the capillary force is in direct proportion  with the surface tension of the solvent. Therefore, lower  surface tension will produce lower contraction pressure, which  is favorable to the forming of larger voids, resulting in lower  apparent density. On the contrary, higher surface tension  produces a gel with higher apparent density. However, this is  not the case when isopropanol alcohol is used as solvent.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Relationship Between Apparent Density of Gel and  Surface Tension of Solvents Used&lt;/graphic&gt;     Isopropanol alcohol has the lowest surface tension (21.7 x  10[.sup]-3[/] N-m[.sup]-1[/]) but the dry gel produced by  it does not have the lowest apparent density. This phenomenon  indicates that the effect of solvent on gel structure is not  simply reflected in gel apparent density. The apparent density  is also affected by other solvent molecular properties.  <H5>  3.3 Effect of Drying Condition on Gel Properties and the </H5> PLZT Powder Particle Size    The gel samples made from the isopropanol alcohol as solvent  with pH = 4 are dried separately under the following three  conditions:    (1) dry the sample in an oven at 100C for 8 hours at a  stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel  sample;    (2) dry the sample in an oven at 50C for 12 hours at a  stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the gel  sample. After that, the oven temperature is raised to 100C,  and then the gel is dried again according to process (1);    (3) dry the sample in vacuum at room temperature for 12  hours  at a stretch repeatedly until there is no weight change of the  gel sample. After that, the gel sample is dried according to  process (1).    Table 1 shows the qualities and apparent densities of the  gels dried by the three different methods. It indicates that  drying conditions greatly affect gel quality. The higher the  temperature, the higher the drying speed, and the more inferior  is the gel quality. During high-temperature speed-drying, the  uneven stress from volume contraction of the gel surface and the  gel interior causes gel cracking. At high temperature, the  surface tension of the solvent becomes smaller and produces  larger void volume. Consequently, the gel transparency worsens  and the gel apparent density is reduced.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1. Comparison of Properties of Gel for Different Drying Conditions     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drying condition         |Quality of the gel       |Apparent density/g-cm    |  |                         |                         |[.sup]-3[/]            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |100C (oven)         |Non-transparent and gappy|0.81                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |50C (oven)          |Translucent and massive  |0.90                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Room temperature (vacuum)|Transparent and massive  |0.94                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Each of the gels made by the three different drying methods  is roasted at 550C for 2 hours to produce PLZT powder.  Figure 4 displays the powder particle size cumulative frequency  distribution curves. It shows that the PLZT powder made from  gels dried in the 100C oven has the widest range of  particle size distribution and the largest grain size, with 345  nm as the median particle diameter D[.sub]50[/] (i.e., the  equivalent diameter at 50 percent cumulative frequency). The  PLZT powder made from room-temperature vacuum drying has a  narrow range of particle diameter distribution and the smallest  grain size, with 126 nm as D[.sub]50[/]. High-temperature  rapid-drying increases the agglomeration tendency of gel  particles, and hence produces PLZT powder with large  conglomerations.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 4. Particle Size Distribution Curves for PLZT  Powders With Different Drying Conditions  &lt;annot&gt; 1. 100C; 2. 50C; 3. Room temperature&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  3.4 Thermal Analysis of Dry Gel </H5>   The gel dried in the 50C oven is analyzed by TG and  DTA.  Figure 5 shows the TG and DTA curves. The TG curve indicates  that the gel decomposition is completed at 500C because no  weight loss occurs after this temperature. In the DTA curve, the  endothermic peak around 140C is caused by the evaporation  of water and isopropanol; the exothermic peak around 350C,  by the burning of the organic material; and the exothermic peak  around 520C, by the formation of the PLZT solid solution.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 5. DTA and TG Curves of Gel&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  3.5 Effect of Roasting Temperature on PLZT Powder Properties </H5>   Based on the DTA results, the dry gel samples are divided  into batches. Each sample batch is roasted for 2 hours within  the temperature range 450C to 700C at an increment of  50C or 100C. The X-ray diffraction analysis results of  the samples after roasting are shown in Figure 6. The curves in  Figure 6 shows that the PLZT powder from the 450C roasted  sample has amorphous structure. A small amount of crystals  appears in the powder from the 500C roasted sample. The  powder from the 550C roasted sample completely crystallizes  into a single PLZT crystal phase. The powders from samples  roasted between 600C and 700C show no new phases but  stronger and sharper diffraction peaks. This indicates that in  the 600C to 700C range, the crystal particle size of  samples increases with the increase of roasting temperature, but  the crystal phase remains unchanged.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 6. XRD for PLZT Powder Calcined at Different  Temperatures&lt;/graphic&gt;     Table 2 shows the median diameters D[.sub]50[/], average  volume diameters D[.sub]v[/], and the specific surface areas  of powders roasted at 550C, 600C, and 700C,  respectively. Figure 7 [photographs not reproduced] shows the  SEM photographs of the powders. Table 2 and Figure 7 indicate  that the particle of PLZT powder grows with increase in roasting  temperature -- a result identical with those of the X-ray  diffraction. These test results conclude that low-temperature  roasting is favorable to the production of microfine PLZT  powder. However, at PLZT solid solution does not form at too low  a roasting temperature; hence, the optimum roasting temperature  range is 550-600C.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Conclusions </H5>   (1) The optimum parameters for producing PLZT microfine  powder with metal isopropylates as raw materials are: isopropyl  alcohol as solvent, acetic acid as catalyst, pH = 3-4,  low-temperature and low-speed drying, and roasting temperature  within the range of 550-600C.    (2) Under basic condition, gel particles tend to  agglomerate,  and produce large-diameter PLZT particles.    (3) To produce PLZT microfine powder, the gel drying process  and the gel roasting temperature must be closely controlled.  References    1. Haertling, G.

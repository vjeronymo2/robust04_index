			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPLOYERS, WORKERS ACT TO FIGHT JOB HARASSMENT;  </P> <P> LAW: CLAIMS BY MEN AND WOMEN ARE GROWING RAPIDLY. COMPANIES ARE SETTING FORMAL  POLICIES, HIRING SPECIALISTS.  </P> <P> Cinnamon Renfro, Sheila McCauley, Tammy Wilson and Holly Miller were new on the  job at a sales office in Santa Fe Springs when their supervisor started paying  attention to them. But they say it wasn't the kind of attention they expected.  </P> <P> The women allege in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that before leaving  their jobs as account executives this summer, they endured weeks of harassment  by a company manager.  </P> <P> The women alleged that he made vulgar comments regarding his sexual fantasies  in phone calls to their homes, locked them -- sometimes two at a time -- in his  office, where he tore at their clothes, forced them to watch pornographic  videos, and refused to allow them to leave until he had performed lewd acts in  front of them. He allegedly threatened them with firing, and one said he told  them he could "easily break someone's neck" because he was a martial arts  expert.  </P> <P> "I couldn't concentrate on my job because I was always looking around to make  sure I wasn't left alone with him," said Renfro, who says she had nightmares  and was so fearful she slept with a gun on her night stand before quitting her  job. "I cried all the time. I didn't know where to go for help because he was  the director of the entire office."  </P> <P> Their case is far from unique. Nationwide, thousands of women -- and some men  -- have won millions of dollars in back pay, medical expenses and punitive  damages for complaints ranging from lewd jokes and unwelcomed love letters, to  hugs, kisses and even rape.  </P> <P> Civil rights attorneys say sexual harassment cases, once considered risky, have  become more attractive to litigate as a result of court decisions clarifying  the issue and making employers liable for the action of their employees.  </P> <P> The number of cases is rising in California, where the Department of Fair  Employment and Housing said that sexual harassment complaints now make up 20%  of the caseload, compared to only 3% a decade ago. In 1989, the latest figures  available, there were 1,441 sexual harassment cases filed with the agency.  </P> <P> Nationally, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission handled 5,216  cases of sexual harassment last year.  </P> <P> Attorney Laura Best, whose Palo Alto law firm defends companies, said sexual  harassment suits are now the most popular type of suit filed by employees aside  from age discrimination.  </P> <P> "Its a hot topic legally right now," said Best. "We are seeing a large increase  in the number of cases filed."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, in what is believed to be the largest damage award ever  given in California in a sexual harassment suit, an Alameda County jury awarded  $480,000 to a clerical worker who claimed she had been raped by her supervisor  at an Oakland law firm. The jury found that the law firm was liable for failing  to investigate the incident and taking no disciplinary action against the  supervisor. The firm said it will appeal, noting that the judgment could force  it into bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The complaints have proliferated not only because more women are in the  workplace, but because there are now more women with toeholds on the corporate  ladder.  </P> <P> Women have decided that they "don't have to put up with it anymore," said  Alison Wetherfield, with the New York-based NOW Legal Defense and Education  Fund.  </P> <P> A 1988 study by Working Woman magazine found that 90% of the Fortune 500  companies had received complaints from employees in one year. The National  Organization for Women said that more than 80% of women it surveyed had been  sexually harassed.  </P> <P> A 1989 study found that 50% of the California Bar Assn.'s women members  reported that they had been sexually harassed; a Pentagon survey this year  found that two out of three women in the military report sexual harassment; and  only last week, a U.S. Naval Academy report showed widespread sexual harassment  of its female midshipmen.  </P> <P> In one of the few studies conducted on the issue, the U.S. Merit Systems  Protection Board found in 1981 that although 56% of all government workers --  men and women -- experienced persistent unwelcomed sexual attention on the job,  only 5% filed complaints.  </P> <P> Sexual harassment cuts across social, economic and racial lines, appearing in  all kinds of workplaces.  </P> <P> * In Madera County, an investigation by the Department of Fair Employment and  Housing determined that an appraiser in the county assessor's office had been  sexually harassed by her supervisor. On one occasion, while out in the field,  he tried to kiss her, and when she ducked away he pinned her to the ground. He  contended that the kisses were "given in love, not lust." The man was fired,  but later reinstated because he had no previous disciplinary problems. She  alleged that he continued giving her love letters. She quit her job and last  April won $186,000 in damages. The county is appealing, saying there was no  harassment after he returned to the job.  </P> <P> * A woman receptionist at the Los Angeles accounting firm of Guill,  Blankenbajker &amp; Lawson won $30,000 in damages in October, 1989, after the  California Department of Fair Employment and Housing determined that she had  suffered significant emotional injury because one of the firm's partners had  harassed her over a period of six years. The woman, who worked alone in a  cramped cubicle, testified that the partner told her he had a foot fetish and  got down on his hands and knees and kissed her feet while she was answering  calls. The company said that her witnesses were biased and noted that she  stayed on the job. The firm is appealing.  </P> <P> * The Department of Fair Employment and Housing last July awarded $5,000 in  damages to a saleswoman at TMC Motorsports in Monterey who testified that her  boss suggested that she let men customers look up her dress, called her  "trashy" and "stupid" in front of customers, told false stories about her sex  life, made obscene jokes and threw tennis balls over the partition between  their offices hitting her in the head. He also told her, "You have to be nice  to me. I'm your boss." The supervisor denied that he had engaged in such  conduct. TMC's owner said she had never heard him make harassing remarks. They  claimed the accuser "had an ax to grind" because of a disputed sales  commission.  </P> <P> As more and more companies find themselves caught in the middle of these  disputes, many have instituted formal written policies against sexual  harassment, hired human relations experts to handle and investigate complaints,  and provided special training sessions.  </P> <P> "It's a very delicate area to handle," said Best. "We see growing awareness and  companies much more sensitive to implementing good policies and educating  management."  </P> <P> Sexual harassment has developed as a legal issue relatively recently.  </P> <P> Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act made sexual discrimination illegal, but  sexual harassment did not become a major issue in America's boardrooms and  courtrooms until 1986, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such harassment  was a form of discrimination and that companies were liable for the behavior of  their employees.  </P> <P> Congress recently voted to amend Title VII so that plaintiffs claiming  harassment can obtain jury trials in federal court and seek punitive damages.  Some business groups have lobbied strenuously against the measure, fearing  sky-high damage awards.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, the EEOC identified two types of harassment. The first,  known as "quid pro quo," is unwelcome verbal and physical sexual advances that  are a condition of employment. The second, referred to as "hostile work  environment," involves a workplace where unwelcome sexual conduct creates an  atmosphere that is offensive or intimidating to employees.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that "unwelcome" advances in the workplace  constituted sex discrimination.  </P> <P> In California, the state Supreme Court ruled in January that a company could be  liable for punitive damages if an employee merely witnesses recurring  harassment in the workplace.  </P> <P> The decision was based on a case in which former nurse Julie Fisher sued San  Pedro Peninsula Hospital and a staff gynecologist claiming that she saw him  pull nurses onto his lap, simulate sexual intercourse and make lewd comments  about the breasts of anesthetized female patients. The case has not yet gone to  trial and the doctor and the hospital, which said it conducted a thorough  investigation, have denied the allegations.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court did not determine whether the allegations were true or not in  the Fisher case, but told her she could go ahead with her suit if she were able  to provide more documentation of the allegations. Her attorney has since filed  an amended complaint.  </P> <P> It isn't always companies that are sued or only women who are harassed.  </P> <P> In Minneapolis, a jury awarded a male security guard $12,000 earlier this year.  The guard brought suit against Sears, Roebuck and Co. and a woman cafeteria  manager, who he claimed had grabbed his buttocks and made sexual comments.  </P> <P> The defense argued that the security guard, who was a former Marine and boxer,  should have been tough enough to withstand the touching without an emotional  collapse. The plaintiff's attorney argued the man had been sexually assaulted  as a child and had promised himself he never would be a victim again.  </P> <P> Companies argue that in many cases the incidents never occurred or, if they  did, the workers did not bring it to their attention so they could be dealt  with in a timely fashion.  </P> <P> "It often boils down to credibility, who will be believed -- the supervisor or  the employee," said Alan Berkowitz, a San Francisco attorney. "It becomes a  quagmire trying to determine if there was a voluntary relationship or an  unwelcome act."  </P> <P> Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who is handling the suit the four women  filed against their Santa Fe Springs supervisor and Rohnert Park-based  Transworld Systems Inc., said many companies do not have policies to handle  such complaints when they arise. She noted that employees often do not know  where to go with their complaints within the company. And, she said, "They have  never heard of the government agencies they should file with."  </P> <P> "I had no idea what to do," recalled Renfro, one of the women suing Transworld  Systems.  </P> <P> Bill Carle, Transworld's corporate counsel, said the company plans to  "vigorously defend" the suit.  </P> <P> "We believe we are an improper defendant," he said, noting that the Santa Fe  Springs office in question is an independent contractor and the supervisor in  question is not an employee of Transworld.  </P> <P> Long Beach attorney Lisa Hovden, who represents the supervisor, said her client  would have no comment.  </P> <P> Some large companies have hired human relations directors who investigate such  claims, thus allowing workers to circumvent supervisors who often have a vested  interest in squelching the accusations. But even that approach has had its  problems, Best noted.  </P> <P> "I had a case where the person charged with doing the harassing was the human  relations director," she said.  </P> <P> Researcher Joyce Penney contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE A VICTIM  </P> <P> If you believe you have been sexually harassed on the job, contact your  supervisor or, if the supervisor is doing the harassing, report it to that  person's boss, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission advises.  </P> <P> If the harasser is the head of the company, the EEOC says it is still important  to request that the harassment stop.  </P> <P> The agency recommends that you keep a written record of what happened,  including when, how you responded, whether there were witnesses and the people  you told.  </P> <P> "Talk to other employees if you suspect that they, too, have been harassed,"  the EEOC recommends. "Talking to them lets them know what is happening and that  you are upset about it."  </P> <P> Even if a company takes action, you may file an administrative charge with the  EEOC office in your district.  </P> <P> Such complaints can also be filed with the California Department of Fair  Employment and Housing.  </P> <P> Most charges must be filed within 180 days of the alleged harassment. If the  situation cannot be resolved by these agencies, you may be able to file a  lawsuit.  </P> <P> The EEOC maintains a toll free number to answer questions: 1 800 USA-EEOC.  </P></p>

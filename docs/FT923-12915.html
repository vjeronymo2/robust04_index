			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / EC considers ways to trim UK's rebate THE REFUND Britain gets on its net EC budget contributions could be trimmed under two options put to the European Commission yesterday. But, because of technical complexities involved in the UK budget rebate issue, the Commission decided not to deliver its final report before its next executive board session on July 22. One option is for Britain's payments to the planned 'cohesion' fund for Mediterranean countries to be taken off Brussels' calculation of the UK net contribution to EC financing. This would slightly reduce the contributions, and thus the UK rebate. Another option is further to excuse Germany from paying towards the UK rebate. Because Germany gets no direct rebate on what is the biggest EC contribution, Bonn already gets a third off its share of the UK rebate. That raises the question of whether the other 10 countries would pick up Germany's previous share of the refund.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Replica eggs ruffle feathers BIRD protection officials are concerned that a new range of reproduction wild birds' eggs could prompt more people to steal the real things. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds disputes claims by Emerald Collectables, the company making the replicas, that the collection of about 50 popular and unusual birds' eggs is a 'conservation-friendly' alternative to the illegal practice of nest-raiding. Mr Ron Grover of Emerald's marketing department said: 'We think people won't bother with stealing eggs because the replicas are so exact. Even the people who make them can't tell the difference if you put them next to real eggs.' Mr Chris Harbard of the RSPB said, however: 'We are concerned that by highlighting the attractive nature of birds' eggs this could result in people taking up the collection of real eggs, which are free - if you don't get caught.' The RSPB believes there are at least 300 active egg collectors in Britain. It said: 'Young people are taking this up all the time. It is a kind of collecting mania which is not disappearing and every egg collected means one bird killed.' Mr Grover said that other authorities had welcomed the replicas, which include reproduction golden eagle, jackdaw, kestrel and avocet eggs. One bird sanctuary was substituting reproductions in a golden eagle nest while it tested eggs for for fertility. He added: 'I don't agree with the RSPB at all. They have been extremely rude. We sent them a letter offering them a percentage of turnover for their backing and they haven't even had the courtesy to reply.' Subscribers to the collection receive a selection of four to six eggs a month as well as a wall unit to display them. Each egg comes with a profile of the bird. The RSPB believes the collection, which costs more than Pounds 200 for about 50 eggs and accompanying paraphernalia, will have limited appeal to egg thieves. Mr Harbard said: 'For some of them it is the challenge of evading the authorities or even the physical test of reaching the egg on a dangerous precipice. They meet to compare collections and . . .score brownie points off each other.' The society said it had received a letter of complaint from one member. However, the company said the collection had attracted 'widespread interest'. Some schools believe the reproductions had 'educational potential' and one museum plans to use the eggs for schoolchildren to handle.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Benefits of an insider's view - Richard Gourlay meets a man who has seen deals from both sides It is not clear whether Derek Lewis, who joins Schroder Ventures on January 1, is a poacher turned gamekeeper or gamekeeper turned poacher. Having raised money from private equity providers for two businesses in the last 10 years  - once as a customer of Schroders  - he is crossing the tracks to become a director advising on deals in the electronics industry. Lewis has not always had the smoothest of relations with his new employers. As he was negotiating the last details of the buy-out of parts of computer company MBS Product Sales in 1989, Schroders 'tweaked' the terms, leaving him and his management team with a reduced stake in the business. 'At the end, I was happy,' Lewis says. 'But it felt at the later stages that the screw was being turned and it was not particularly productive.' Though a relatively widespread practice, it is one which Schroders says it is now leaving behind. For management teams seeking capital, dealing with someone who has negotiated from their side of the table may be a welcome development. From Schroders' point of view, Lewis's arrival brings more than just knowledge of the other side of the deal. He also has the kind of industry insider's understanding of a market place which Schroders believes is an essential ingredient for successfully competing with other providers of private equity. Lewis is in the unusual position of having not only led a buy-out but started a company as well. In 1984, after 10 years with IBM, Lewis and a partner bought a small computer broker, Combro, with finance from Citicorp Venture Capital. They intended to build a distributor of mid-range computers. But the company evolved along quite different lines to that laid out in the business plan on which Lewis raised the finance. Combro did sell mid-range computers, but within 18 months it had also become IBM's biggest distributor of PCs in the UK. Its success was based on buying large volumes, supplying dealers at better prices than they would get direct and by providing companies with very fine pricing and swift service. 'The original plan was for a perfectly valid business but it would not have become a dominant force,' Lewis says. 'The innovation was in recognising that the terms of the IBM contract allowed you to sell on to other dealers.' When Lewis sold Combro to MBS in 1987, sales had grown from Pounds 2m to Pounds 40m. Two years later he was buying the business back as part of the deal financed by Schroders after MBS management ran into trouble with its other activities. And by 1992, the business had been sold to ICL for an undisclosed amount. Lewis is joining Schroder Ventures at a time when it and Schroders' affiliates have been raising new capital for a number of its funds. Earlier this year it successfully raised a third UK buy-out fund at Dollars 225m (Pounds 137m). Shortly afterwards it closed a Dollars 100m International Life Science Fund and funds for Italy and Canada. And by Christmas it should have raised Dollars 180m for an Asian development capital fund that is likely to close at Dollars 250m. This fund will make Schroders one of the largest private equity investors in the region behind Prudential Asia. It will mainly provide development capital to businesses taking advantage of growing markets in growing economies, Schroders says. By comparison the UK, where Lewis will focus most of his attention, is relatively mature. Private equity investors are increasingly likely to require infusions of industrial expertise like that provided by Lewis. But does he see himself as poacher or gamekeeper? 'I prefer to look at it as bringing the two sides together,' Lewis says. 'Every now and then the rabbit will jump into the pot of its own accord.'</p>

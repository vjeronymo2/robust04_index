			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> An unwavering fascination with rainbow light effects refracting from  hard-edged, geometric forms has given Larry Bell's sculpture and vapor drawings  a certain predictability. Surprisingly his newest mixed-media works on canvas  remain faithful to his love of light as surface yet are also punchy  explorations of form and space. They put some much needed zip back into Bell's  Minimalist aesthetic, even while they appear to be trying to find a comfortable  formula.  </P> <P> Using ultra thin sheets of metal foil adhered by vacuum and heat to primed  canvas, Bell makes compositions of shimmering opalescent color that  dematerializes into white canvas or solid pastels. The foil bonds perfectly  with the canvas yet impossibly appears deeply rumpled, stretched or rippled.  It's a stunning trompe l'oeil effect.  </P> <P> Unlike his repetitive vapor drawings, each image is unique. "Oriental Gardens,"  one of the most successful, is a huge, dynamic arrangement of jagged foil  fragments and rice papers stuck like wet, wind-blown paper to the infinite  darkness of a matte black canvas. In this work and "Black Sargent" Bell begins  to allow passages of flat color or iridescence to open like mystic portals.  Holes emitting light in the middle of chaos are beguiling enough that we want  to forgive the way they quickly settle into a pat format.  </P> <P> More problematic, yet perhaps ultimately more satisfying, are the  Expressionistic flourishes that whip around paintings like the effervescent  "Ken and Haps." These sweeps of the painter's brush struggle with self control,  occasionally overwhelming the industrial detachment of the heat-tempered metal  ground. Still, their humanity is welcome.

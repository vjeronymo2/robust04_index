			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Indian court orders halt to temple construction THE Indian Supreme Court yesterday ordered the Uttar Pradesh state government to 'unconditionally stop' all construction activity in Ayodhya before the court decides whether a Hindu temple can be built on disputed land. The country's highest court said it expected the state government to talk to the parties concerned and report by today whether there was an agreement to stop all work. In Ayodhya, Hindu militants, joined by saffron-clad priests, continued construction work for the 14th consecutive day, ignoring both the court order and armed paramilitary troops. The Hindus are attempting to build a temple on the site of a 16th Century Babri mosque in the north of India. The Supreme Court has in effect granted the ruling Congress party a temporary reprieve from deciding whether to dismiss the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state government. The BJP had allowed Hindu militants to defy a court order prohibiting construction on the site. Five stock brokers arrested in India's securities scandal, were released yesterday on bail, writes R C Murthy in Bombay. A member of India's Planning Commission resigned yesterday over his reported investments in a company linked to the scandal.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / A new order eludes E Europe THE economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are slipping ever deeper into a 1930s-style depression and, with no respite in sight, enthusiasm for a new economic order has given way to pessimism. In its annual economic survey published today the 40-member United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) urges a much greater commitment to the success of economic reform by western governments. Otherwise, it says, increasing economic strains could lead to disillusion and impatience with both the 'market' and democracy. The ECE estimates that domestic output fell by some 14 per cent in eastern Europe last year, bringing the aggregate drop in output since 1988 to nearly 25 per cent. Many must now be wondering whether 'the invisible hand of the market is really an iron fist', it says, drawing parallels with the inter-war depression which saw a 29 per cent slump in output in North America between 1929 and 1933. In the former Soviet Union/Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), net material product (output excluding services) fell by 15 per cent and GNP by 17 per cent, after falls of 2 and 4 per cent respectively in 1990. Another large fall in CIS output seems probable in 1992, the survey says. In the light of eastern European experience, 'an aggregate decline of 25-30 per cent between 1989 and 1992 would not be implausible'. Further cuts in already low living standards and the prospect of rapidly rising unemployment this year could threaten the fragile political and social consensus for market reforms in the CIS economies unless there is substantial help from abroad, the ECE says. It says the most urgent task facing the CIS is to curb inflation and budget deficits, which means resolving the conflict between fiscally autonomous republics and ineffective central monetary control. The UN agency proposes an open CIS trading area with separate currencies, accompanied by currency reform and stabilisation measures in each republic. It says a payments union, modelled on the European Payments Union for western Europe in 1950-58, would help avoid excessive contraction of trade during the transition towards currency convertibility. The picture in eastern Europe is dark, the ECE says. Output levels continued to fall sharply last year, there has been a sharp rise in joblessness and most people have had to bear large cuts in living standards. Although western aid and assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has increased in the past year, and there have been important improvements in access to western markets for eastern goods, 'the amount of genuine aid (grants and concessionary finance) has been small', the ECE says. The survey notes that western aid for eastern Europe and the CIS countries is far less than the sums implied either in a 'Marshall Plan equivalent' - Dollars 16.7bn (Pounds 9.7bn) a year - or in the suggestion by Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, to provide support equivalent to the Dollars 23bn a year the Community spends on its own depressed regions. The ECE repeats its call for a 'Second European Recovery Programme', parallelling the Marshall Plan for US aid to post-war western Europe.</p>

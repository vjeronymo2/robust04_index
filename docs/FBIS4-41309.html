The meeting took place in the White House behind closed  doors. According to White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers,  the two parties paid most attention to the results of the third  session of the so-called "Gore-Chernomyrdin" commission and to  the agreements which were worked out during the session.    President Clinton expressed satisfaction with the way  Russia's economic reforms develop, and the United States were  concerned about their fate in the end of 1993 and in the  beginning of 1994, she said.    Asked whether Clinton and Chernomyrdin discussed a definite  date for the forthcoming Russo-American summit in Washington  which has been provisionally scheduled for next September, the  press secretary replied in the negative.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed suspension would extend an existing suspension that has been in effect since March 1, 1994. This suspension allows a distributing plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, that is located within the Tennessee Valley marketing area and that meets all of the pooling standards of the Tennessee Valley order to be regulated under that order rather than the Carolina order despite the plant having greater sales in the Carolina marketing area. It also allows a distributing plant located at Somerset, Kentucky, that has been regulated under the Tennessee Valley order to remain regulated there even if it has greater sales in the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville (Order 46) marketing area. In addition, the suspension allows a supply plant at Springfield, Kentucky, that has been supplying the Somerset plant to remain pooled under the Tennessee Valley order without having to make uneconomic shipments of milk that it contends would be necessary to remain pooled if the Southern Belle plant were regulated under Order 46. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The problems prompting the existing suspension of these provisions were thoroughly explained in a suspension order issued on March 28, 1994 (published April 1, 1994 [59 FR 15315]). In that document, it was noted that ``orderly marketing will be best preserved by adopting the proposed suspension, for a 12-month period only, to allow the industry time to develop proposals for a hearing to be held before the suspension period expires.'' [emphasis added] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to significant changes that have occurred in these markets within the past year, the Department was delayed in scheduling the promised proceeding to hear industry proposals for resolving the problems which lead to the suspension order. Although a hearing has now been scheduled for January 4, 1995, to hear these proposals, this will not allow sufficient time to evaluate the record and to extend the suspension, if found to be warranted, by the time the current suspension expires on February 28, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advised of these facts, both Southern Belle Dairy Company and Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc., who were proponents of the existing suspension, submitted requests to extend the current suspension until the amendatory proceeding was concluded. This notice is in response to those requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from March 1, 1995, through February 28, 1996, or until such earlier time as an order amending the aforesaid orders may be issued on the basis of the hearing that has been scheduled for January 4, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 1005, 1007, 1011, and 1046 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for 7 CFR Parts 1005, 1007, 1011, and 1046 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Secs. 1&hyph;19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lon Hatamiya, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29090 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

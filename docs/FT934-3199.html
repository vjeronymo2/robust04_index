			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Paris rules out CFA devaluation France has ruled out any devaluation of the CFA franc of its former African colonies against the French currency, despite World Bank advice that a change in the 1948 parity is necessary to help African exports. Mr Michel Roussin, aid minister, told the Senate there was no question of devaluing the CFA franc because France was 'very attached to the franc zone'. Under this system, some 14 French-speaking countries in central and west Africa share a common currency, whose parity has stayed at FFr0.02 for the past 45 years, despite the rise in the French currency's value. French officials acknowledge the problem this poses for some CFA countries' exports. But they say that because all 14 countries cannot agree on a single devaluation rate, there will be none. Paris has told CFA countries its annual FFr4bn aid (as distinct from development projects) will end after this month unless they sign IMF adjustment pacts.</p>

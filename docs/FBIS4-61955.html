			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Brodskiy report: "A Minister To Be in Charge of </F> Shakhovskoy Rayon"]    [Excerpts] Boris Yeltsin has chosen a form of  encouragement of opposition party leaders that is rather unusual  for Russian political realities. Late on 6 May, the president's  press service circulated a communique on the appointment of  Nikolay Travkin as member of the government. The Democratic  Party leader has become the first minister without portfolio in  the history of modern Russia.    Nikolay Travkin, 48. Leader of the Democratic Party of  Russia; head of Moscow Oblast's Shakhovskoy Rayon administration  since 1992. Received secondary education at the Building  Technical School in Klin, and higher education at the  Pedagogical Institute in Kolomna. A Hero of Socialist Labor.  [passage omitted]    Boris Yeltsin's haste in appointing Travkin to a position  that does not yet exist is quite easily explainable. Travkin,  who usually criticizes the government rather sharply, has  surprisingly easily agreed to accept this figurehead position  for purely juridical reasons. Being a State Duma deputy, he has  no right to combine work in parliament with the duties of head  of administration of Shakhovskoy Rayon. Now that he has the  status of minister, he can do so. As for Boris Yeltsin, this  gave him a fine opportunity to demonstrate his magnanimity  toward leaders of the opposition who, in moment of need, show  loyalty necessary for the president. In other words, Travkin's  appointment as member of the government can be seen as a payment  to the Democratic Party of Russia leader for having signed the  agreement on social accord.    "The odd man out" in the story of the appointment of a new  member of the government is, paradoxically, the head of  government. Rumors of the impending replacement of Yefim Basin,  chairman of the Construction Committee, with Nikolay Travkin  that appeared shortly before the signing of the agreement could  not naturally go past the premier. It is, however, obvious that  he could not consent to the replacement of a politically loyal  and experienced construction general (Basin in the past was in  charge of the Baykal-Amur Railroad project) with a half-teacher,  half-builder. Viktor Chernomyrdin could after all prevent the  negative impact of Travkin's appointment to a more important  position in the government. But he has not yet succeeded in  solving the other problems -- which job in the White House would  correspond with Travkin's present status (in addition to running  Shakhovskoy Rayon), and what to do about potential ministers  without portfolio Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, and  Mikhail Lapshin who have not yet signed the agreement.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'H.E.L.P.': THERE'S LIFE IN THE RESCUE GENRE YET  </P> <P> At first sight, ABC's new "H.E.L.P." appears to be nothing more than  prime-time's umpteenth rescue series -- yet more adventures of an emergency  unit of the police or fire department that bravely faces danger to save lives.  </P> <P> Originating with "Rescue 8" in the late 1950s, the formula has yielded  "Emergency," "240 Robert" and others series in a line leading directly to the  present CBS program "Rescue 911," which enlivens the genre dramatically by  building episodes around footage from actual cases.  </P> <P> Premiering at 8 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, "H.E.L.P." (Harlem  Eastside Lifesaving Program) is indeed another chip off an old and durable  block, one offering the usual assortment of life-threatening emergencies and  humorous predicaments encountered by an eclectic unit of firefighters, police  and paramedics under the command of Battalion Chief Patrick Meacham (John  Mahoney).  </P> <P> What elevates the opener for "H.E.L.P." above the crowd, however, is  atmospheric shooting in New York, good direction by co-executive producer  Christopher Crowe, an interesting plot (again from Crowe) and a fine, sensitive  performance by Mahoney in what is essentially a stock role.  </P> <P> Tonight finds Meacham on the verge of being promoted to a bigger, higher-paying  job "downtown," only to learn that his own future may be decided by the outcome  of an arson investigation that could turn out to be embarrassing for the  department.  </P> <P> Although too much of "H.E.L.P." is trite and telescoped, tonight's blazing  conclusion is deeply affecting despite its predictability. Much more compelling  than the story's fire-fighting aspects, however, are the sooty politics and  inter-department squabbles that at least temporarily take this series to  another level.

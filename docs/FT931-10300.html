			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: The realistic way to offer prospect of jobs Sir, You report that President Bill Clinton is now carrying through his election commitment to introduce a new 'safety net' of welfare programmes, on the basis that there must be 'a certain time beyond which people don't draw a cheque for doing nothing' ('Clinton promises welfare task-force', February 3). In the same edition, a letter from Mr O'Driscoll ('A more realistic view of attitudes among long-term unemployed') argues strongly against such an approach in the UK, asking: 'If there are no jobs out there, what is the point in raising people's hopes?' Of course, our aim should be sufficient jobs for all those who seek employment. But what should our response be if, as now seems likely, registered unemployment in the UK remains above 3m well into the mid-1990s? This is surely the question which urgently needs to be addressed - and it is one which Full Employment UK explores through consultations with randomly selected groups of long-term unemployed people across the UK. While there are a number who support Mr O'Driscoll's view, we have found that a majority favour the idea of a new contract between themselves and society, under which society would guarantee them work in return for them giving up their right to 'a giro for doing nothing'. Long-term unemployed people generally recognise that 'something for nothing welfarism' makes it easiest for those of us lucky enough to be in work to forget our responsibilities towards them - just as it makes it easier for many of them to give up on themselves. Of course, many fear that they could be exploited in a 'workfare' system unless, from the very outset, the government made a proper commitment to developing a high-quality programme. For most, however, the bottom line seems to be that obligatory work is better than obligatory isolation, trapped behind the front door with little prospect of finding regular employment.

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Stamp fraud 'costs millions' STAMP fraudsters are costing the Post Office millions of pounds a year by selling fake stamps and 'washed' stamps - used stamps with the postmark removed - the government said yesterday. In a letter to Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for Linlithgow, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the junior trade and industry minister, said: 'It is difficult to judge the scale . . . but I'm told it could well run into millions of pounds a year.' The biggest single recent case was in 1989, when Post Office investigators found sacks containing Pounds 10m of used stamps. The fraud involved dealers buying used stamps from charities, chemically 'washing' them and selling them - mainly as mint unfranked examples to collectors, although some were believed to have been resold for general use. About 60 people have been arrested since April 1991 for stamp offences. Mr McLoughlin said: 'There is little hope of eradicating this problem entirely,' and the Post Office said there had never been a precise estimate of the level of potential fraud.</p>

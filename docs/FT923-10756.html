			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Privatisation plan not a viable option Sir, It was with a strong feeling of deja vu that I read your article about Companies House which stated that 'supporters of civil service privatisation have long argued that Companies House is an ideal candidate for privatisation . . .' ('Companies House review is ordered', July 25). Nearly 10 years ago the government announced that it planned to privatise the Companies Registration Office Office (as Companies House was then called). The proposal did not succeed because, under the First Companies Directive (EEC Directive 68/151), the information which is held by Companies House has to be made available to inquirers by post 'at a price not exceeding the administrative cost thereof'. Where profit is forbidden by law, whence privatisation? Edwin Fleming, 55 Kylemore Avenue, Mossley Hill, Liverpool L18 4PZ</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY OF VENICE CANAL RESTORATION IS FUNDED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has voted to spend $85,000 for a hydrology study  of the Venice canals, the first step toward a long-awaited restoration of the  decaying waterways.  </P> <P> The five-month study will examine the quality of water in the canals and  analyze ways to improve water flow, said Russ Ruffing, an environmental  associate for the city Department of Public Works.  </P> <P> The study is expected to begin next month.  </P> <P> "It will look at ways to improve the water flow so that the habitat for aquatic  creatures is improved," said Chris Kroll, a staff analyst for the state Coastal  Conservancy, which last March agreed to contribute $66,000 toward the study.  </P> <P> Officials said the study is needed before the city can move forward on various  proposals to restore the canals, which will involve rehabilitating  disintegrating banks.  </P></p>

In a statement today, the movement said it rejects any  dialogue between Hamas and Israel, saying the only language the  Israeli enemy understands will remain the language of force and  struggle, not the language of concessions and capitulation.    The statement said that all the Israeli attempts to open  dialogue with Hamas members detained in Israeli prisons have  failed, and will never be successful.</p>

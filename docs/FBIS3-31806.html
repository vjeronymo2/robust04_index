			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andras Veer, administrative deputy chairman </F> of the Republic Party, by Lilla Rist; place and date not given:  "Before the Elections -- We Represent Economic Rationality --  The Republic Party's Administrative Deputy Chairman Says"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Rist] Can we call the  Republic Party [KP] a pragmatic party?    [Veer] It can certainly be called pragmatic although I did  not want to use this term. In 1992, the KP defined itself as a  pragmatic election party but, after this, many other parties in  Hungary began to use this term. In the KP's case, pragmatism  means that it is only prepared to make decisions in accordance  with economic rationality, regardless of how this fits in with  various people's ideological views. [passage omitted]    [Rist] The KP's program is trying to deal with the problems  of almost all social strata and to make it attractive for  everyone. Are you not worried that this effort will slip into  demagogy?    [Veer] We have often been accused of this. In my view,  demagogy means irresponsible promises. The KP would only be  demagogic if it promised things it cannot fulfill. However, it  is difficult to call it demagogic just because it is sensitive  to social issues, because it emphasizes responsibility in this,  too.    [Rist] The KP's program seems to have a strong economic  policy line that intends mainly to favor the enterprises.    [Veer] Undoubtedly, putting the economy back on its feet is  the most important thought in the KP's program. Its slogan  states the same: Rather than the economy being for politics,  politics must be for the economy. However, this does not mean  that any values can be sacrificed for this. I am thinking of  education, health care, and culture which are openly represented  by the KP. The maintenance of these is an obligation, rather  than generosity. In addition to supporting the entrepreneur,  our enterprise-friendliness wishes to support the enterprising  society by creating workplaces, through the market, abundance of  goods, and by establishing a consumer society. The essence of  our economic program is that, in addition to having to help the  entrepreneurs, we also have to help the system from which an  economy that is good for everyone can develop.    [Rist] Who do you see as your voters?    [Veer] The pensioners, the intelligentsia of the provinces,  and Budapest's citizens. However, this is a very difficult  question because the KP has not yet been tested. We think that  we will also be able to take away provincial votes from the  Hungarian Socialist Party through our agricultural program.  [passage omitted]    [Rist] What are your views on the role and tasks of the  state?    [Veer] The coalition has clearly been following an etatist  policy which resulted in the establishment of a rather  centralized state structure. According to the KP, naturally,  the state must not deny its tasks and responsibilities. It  should only withdraw from the economy to the extent that its  functioning can be ensured. The conditions for this have to be  established through laws and tax policy. The state cannot  withdraw from construction of housing, youth policy, or the  maintenance of sciences, but it need not direct the economy.  However, it will only be possible to see in the future how long  it takes to dismantle the etatist system without damaging the  already established living conditions. Corruption, which is a  result of the centralization, will have to be investigated by  the justice organizations rather than the government. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A customer-friendly bottle - A new trend in restaurant wine pricing that saves diners' money The adage in the restaurant business used to be that 'you never see a good restaurant advertise'. This is no longer true. A number of leading British chefs and restaurateurs have taken part in the recent multi-million pound American Express campaign. And in New York, Alan Stillman has managed to keep his restaurants - The Post House, Smith &amp; Wollensky, Cite and The Manhattan Ocean Club - humming by the use of full-page advertisements in the New York Times. Although such advertising is invariably too expensive for the single restaurant, there is no doubt that the industry is aware that it must promote itself continually to compete for its customers' disposable incomes. Chefs know that writing recipes in a newspaper, giving interviews on how they prepare Sunday lunch, even appearing as a judge on BBC's Masterchef, can keep their bookings' line busy. In today's competitive world no opportunity can be overlooked. And now it appears restaurants are beginning to put their wine lists to work in a way which can bring financial savings to their customers. The process started in New York at the beginning of the year but has now surfaced in the smart Fifth Floor restaurant of Harvey Nichols, the department store, in Knightsbridge, west London. There, on Monday nights, you can buy your wine in their wine shop and take it to your table at no extra cost. The restaurant's mark-up is completely foregone in a brave - and so far seemingly successful - attempt to boost business on what is invariably the quietest night of the week. Dining there recently, we began with a half of Pernard-Vergelesses 1988 from Rollin Pere (Pounds 9.95 in the shop, Pounds 13.50 on the restaurant wine list) and then moved on to a bottle of 1985 Barbaresco from Mascarello (Pounds 18.50 from the shop, Pounds 38.50 on the restaurant wine list) which the sommelier decanted most professionally. Both choices showed how consumer friendly this pricing policy can be. The first wine was slightly disappointing but not excessively so, given the price we were paying. The second was so glorious that we felt we were enjoying a most wonderful bargain. This scheme has been instigated by the restaurant's manager, Edward Hyde, originally to promote the wine shop. 'Obviously when we began the scheme,' he says, 'we were concerned about its impact on profitability. Margins have been affected but there have been two major compensatory factors. 'The first is that we have significantly boosted business on Monday evenings and, secondly, those who are coming on a Monday night are entering into the spirit of things. No one is coming in here to drink a bottle of the house red at Pounds 4.50. 'Instead, our customers are taking the opportunity to trade up and enjoy wines that they could not afford previously. We have also learnt an important lesson: that our customers come in here with a very fixed idea of what they are going to spend on wine. 'If it is Pounds 20 they are still spending that much on Monday nights but they are drinking far more interesting wines.' It is a distinct advantage having your own wine shop next to the restaurant so that at least you can make a retailer's margin. But, taking it a step further, certain American restaurateurs have shown just how aggressive wine pricing can stimulate business. Alan Stillman started the ball rolling at his Cite restaurant in January. Business at lunch and pre-theatre was good but dinner trade needed a boost so he adopted a policy of offering unlimited glasses of wines, such as Moet &amp; Chandon non-vintage champagne, top California chardonnay and classed-growth clarets, to anyone ordering a Dollars 39.50 (Pounds 25.90) prix-fixe menu or three-course dinner. It cost Stillman roughly between Dollars 10 and Dollars 13 per customer, many of whom in turn spent an extra Dollars 8 on dessert and coffee that they would not normally have ordered. But it immediately filled the restaurant through the quietest months of the year and got everyone talking. It also stimulated fellow restaurateur Philip Scotti at the Century Cafe in Times Square, into creating a pricing policy on his wines - for bookings between 8pm and 11pm - that means charges are a mere Dollars 1 per bottle over cost. Russell Ruscigno, at his Clinton Street restaurant in Los Angeles, and Gayle Dierkhising, at the All Season's Cafe, Calistoga, have adopted similar pricing policies with the same beneficial result. Ruscigno charges a fixed Dollars 8 per bottle over wholesale, and Dierkhising Dollars 7.50 per bottle over retail. Both report increased volume and better takings. Such attractive wine pricing will, I hope, become more common in the UK, particularly as we have a national network of enterprising off-licences to provide the wines. In the interim, anyone looking for vinous excitement on a Monday night and with anything to spare from around Pounds 10 for a 1992 Shaw &amp; Smith Reserve Chardonnay from Australia, to Pounds 175 for a 1982 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti La Tache, should head off to Harvey Nichols on a Monday night. The Fifth Floor, Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1. Tel: 071-235 5250. Set three-course menu Pounds 21.50, excluding service and wine.</p>

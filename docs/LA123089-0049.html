The Stanislaus center was guarded loosely by Demeter, who  picked up his fourth foul early in second half but remained in the game for  offensive purposes.  </P> <P> Demeter scored a season-high 27 points, 15 in the first half, and grabbed seven  rebounds.  </P> <P> DeLaveaga, who hit only 10 of 26 shots, made a four-point play in the first  half after a foul on a three-point shot.  </P> <P> PALM DESERT TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Antelope Valley 92, Eastern Utah 80 -- Paul Ernst made 14 of 14 free throws and  scored a game-high 26 points as Antelope Valley won a semifinal game.  </P> <P> Demetrius Phillips scored 22 points off the bench for Antelope Valley (14-4),  which will face Golden West in the final at 8 tonight.  </P> <P> CANYONS TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Compton 99, Canyons 97 -- Nick Sanderson came off the bench to score a  team-high 24 points for Canyons, but Compton's Willie Pittman hit a free throw  in the final seconds to account for the win in a third-place game.  </P> <P> Larry Allbritton scored 23 points for Canyons (7-10), and teammate Aaron Clark  added 20.  </P> <P> Andre Stovall scored a game-high 31 points for Compton (14-5).  </P> <P> PALOMAR TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Glendale 74, Bakersfield 73 -- The Vaqueros, who had a seven-game winning  streak snapped Thursday against San Jacinto, almost blew a second-half lead for  the second consecutive game before a 20-foot Bakersfield shot bounced off the  rim at the buzzer in the third-place game.  </P> <P> Gary Fowler made two free throws with 20 seconds left to provide the final  margin. Teammate Kelley Crosby then rebounded a Bakersfield miss, was fouled,  and missed a one-and-one opportunity to set up the final shot.  </P> <P> Bruce Heicke led Glendale with 20 points and Dave Swanson added 19 points and  10 rebounds.

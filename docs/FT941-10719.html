			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / ICI agrees Pounds 60m sale to BASF BASF has agreed to pay about Pounds 60m for ICI's polypropylene manufacturing operations, more than a year after the sale was proposed. The deal marks the UK chemicals company's exit from European polypropylene manufacture and the German group's elevation from seventh to second biggest producer in Europe. The businesses, scheduled to be transferred on March 1, include plants at Rozenburg, Netherlands, and Wilton, in Teesside in the UK. Some 460 workers will be transferred. For ICI, the sale is part of a strategy to concentrate on businesses in which it has a strong global presence. As only the eighth biggest producer in Europe, with annual losses of about Pounds 20m, polypropylene was ripe for disposal. Nevertheless, the conclusion of the sale is only a partial success. ICI had wanted to swap the operations for BASF's acrylics business. That foundered in November when the two sides could not agree a price. Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, the dominant union at ICI's Teesside plants, welcomed the sale. 'Transition to BASF is the best possible move,' he said.</p>

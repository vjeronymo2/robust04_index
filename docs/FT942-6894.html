			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Warm reception for Spanish utility offer Applications for the domestic retail tranche of the global share offer in Endesa, the big Spanish electrical utility, reached a level of 3 1/4 times the number of shares available, according to initial estimates from advisers to the issue. A total of 22.6m shares in Endesa, representing 8.7 per cent of its total equity, is being sold by Endesa's chief shareholder, Grupo Teneo, which is part of INI, the public-sector corporation. Prior to the offering, about 24 per cent of Endesa's shares were publicly held. The size of the retail tranche had already been increased by 23 per cent earlier this week to 6.1m shares in the light of the strong interest from retail investors. Of the 500,000 retail investors who had pre-registered to buy the shares, 200,000 investors subscribed to the offer, in line with forecasts. The strength of Spanish retail demand fulfilled Endesa's desire to widen its shareholder base, which at present is dominated by New York based institutions. It also fanned speculation that Teneo might exercise the so-called 'claw back option' to bring additional shares from the international and US tranches to the Spanish retail tranche. Currently, 5.4m shares in the form of American depositary shares are earmarked for the US and 7.5m shares for international investors. Endesa's share price closed yesterday at Pta6,630, up Pta30. The subscription period in Spain ended yesterday and pricing of the issue is expected to take place next week with trading starting on the next day.</p>

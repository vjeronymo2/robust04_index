			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unclear outlook after Bass's seasonal cheer BASS, the UK's leading brewer, recorded a general improvement in its beer and pubs businesses during the Christmas trading period, Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said yesterday. 'It is not yet clear whether this improvement will persist through January and beyond', he told shareholders at the annual meeting. Because of the volatility of trading in the October-December quarter, it was also too early to draw conclusions about the outlook for the year as a whole. Over Christmas, Bass recovered most of the beer volume decline of the first two months. Free trade sales volume was running nearly 5 per cent above the same period last year and total volumes were only 0.5 per cent lower. Mr Prosser, who led a Brewers Society delegation to the Treasury earlier this week to demand a cut in beer duty, again expressed concern about the possible impact of increased cross-Channel imports if the government did not make some move towards duty harmonisation. Beer imported by holidaymakers and cross-Channel shoppers last year accounted for about 8 per cent of the UK take-home trade, he said. A new system of duty collection to be introduced in June would cost the company Pounds 10m in a full year, he added. Bass sold another 37 pubs to meet the November 1 deadline on its disposal of 2,740 outlets to comply with the government's beer orders. Total disposal proceeds since July 1989, amounted to nearly Pounds 445m, Mr Prosser said. Liquor sales in the com-pany's managed pubs were 2 per cent ahead of last year on a pub-by-pub basis. Food sales had increased, but beer volumes were 1 per cent down. Holiday Inn occupancies were improving in the US, but room rates had shown little growth. The leisure businesses continued to perform solidly.</p>

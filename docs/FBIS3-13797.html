			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Baudouin Loos </F> in Tunis; date not given: "On the Prospect of the Mideast Peace  Process After the Adoption of the Hebron Massacre Resolution"]    [Text] [Loos] What is your view of Resolution 904 adopted  last Friday [18 March] at the Security Council three weeks after  the Hebron massacre?    ['Arafat] There is no doubt that this resolution is very  important: It reflects the international consensus on this  horrible crime. At the same time it is a major step because it  makes provision for international protection for our people by a  "temporary international presence." In addition, the  responsibility of the two sponsors of the peace process -- the  United States and Russia -- is stipulated with regard to the  implementation of the resolution. Furthermore, we intend to  have discussions with the sponsors, the Europeans and others, on  how to implement it on the ground. The sooner the better!  Having said that, the explanations given by the United States  with regard to their relative abstention from two paragraphs of  the resolution on the occupied Palestinian territories and on  Jerusalem have been received negatively by the Palestinians, the  Arabs, the Muslims, and the Christians. Especially in view of  the fact that a memorandum on policy in the Near East sent by  the U.S. administration to Congress on 1 February specified, and  I quote: "Israeli-occupied lands known as occupied territories:  the West Bank, the Gaza strip, Golan, and...East Jerusalem."  Moreover that was the practical position of all U.S.  administrations.    [Loos] Will you wait for the resolution to be implemented on  the ground before returning to the negotiating table with the  Israelis?    ['Arafat] I have not ended the negotiations with them. I had  a very important telephone conversation with Prime Minister  Rabin on Friday, and before that with Foreign Minister Peres.  This Sunday afternoon Israeli special envoys will have  discussions with us. One of the subjects will be the  implementation of this resolution. I cannot yet say what  specific problems we will encounter.    [Loos] What do you expect on the highly sensitive questions  of the settlers in downtown Hebron?    ['Arafat] There are 43 families and 160 students. They can  be moved.    [Loos] Do you think that that is included in the resolution?    ['Arafat] It is mentioned when the resolution calls for "the  occupying power to continue to adopt and implement measures,  including the confiscation of arms, to prevent illegal acts of  violence by Israeli settlers."    [Loos] The removal of the settlers is not specifically  mentioned...    ['Arafat] Even Rabin has said that installing those settlers  in Hebron was "a stupid plan" and he was opposed to it when he  was prime minister in the seventies. Nine ministers in his  cabinet support their removal. Where to? They can be installed  in Qiryat Arba', the colony situated just outside Hebron. We  must prevent an explosion.    [Loos] What do you expect from the Europeans in the short  term?    ['Arafat] I am in constant contact with them at several  levels, even in the context of the implementation of the  resolution which has all the more support from them because  three of the text's authors are European -- Spain, France, and  Britain.    [Loos] Do they think that the international presence should  be an armed presence?    ['Arafat] The form of the international presence still has  to  be negotiated with the Israelis and the two sponsors of the  peace process. But we stress: Who can imagine unarmed forces  sent to highly tense places being effective in protecting the  Palestinian population and the holy places? We are not asking  for tanks and helicopters, just for light weapons.    [Loos] Should Hebron be the main target of this force?    ['Arafat] We hope so! It is these populations which have  most need of security and peace. Do not forget that part of the  Israeli Army was involved in the Hebron events. Some of their  soldiers fired outside the mosque, according to the Israeli  investigation. And, over the past 22 days, another massacre has  taken place: 41 dead, 470 injured, 1,500 arrested...    [Loos] Do you still think that the Israelis will honor the  13  April deadline (stipulated in the Declaration of Principle  signed in Washington) for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho?    ['Arafat] If the will is there, it is there! When they  withdrew from Gaza in 1956, it took them six hours. And their  own experts now assess the necessary time to be six days.  Moreover, our security forces are ready to replace them. It  will be a crucial test of their goodwill. When Rabin says there  "are no sacrosanct dates," I must contradict: There are  sacrosanct dates otherwise there is no longer a sacrosanct  agreement!    [Loos] What do you say to the Palestinians who think that  the  main mistake was not to deal with the fate of the Jewish  settlements in the Washington agreement?    ['Arafat] It was not a mistake. We know that it is a very  important problem. Any agreement is a compromise, but it takes  goodwill on both sides. That is why we say: Let us discuss it  as soon as possible, let us not necessarily wait for the start  of the third year of the process started in Washington. Nobody  seriously thinks that the Jewish settlers will leave the  occupied territories in a week or a month. We must therefore  start to discuss this question without delay.    [Loos] Do you have any indication of the Israeli intentions  in this connection?    ['Arafat] If they want to implement the (Washington)  agreement with accuracy and honesty, they must put this question  on the agenda. I cannot say any more at this stage.    [Loos] Many Palestinians thought that the agreement which  you  signed on 11 February in Cairo with Mr. Peres on the security  issue is a complete Israeli victory to the extent that you have  made all the concessions unilaterally...    ['Arafat] This idea was put about after Peres, defending the  agreement signed in Cairo in the Knesset, said that it  represented a "great victory." I do not know what victory he  was talking about. Unless he was referring to the fact that the  deadlock had finally been broken in the negotiations. The  victory was therefore on both sides and also on the side of  peace. But, after the Hebron massacre, the whole peace process  lost its credibility.    [Loos] What is your reaction when Palestinian crowds deride  you?    ['Arafat] That is not true. They are deriding the peace  process which has not produced any practical results in seven  months! And they have no confidence in the Israeli authorities'  ability to implement the Washington Declaration of Principles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 28, BNS -- Estonian border authorities  have provided to Russia materials to prove that the group of  Kurds which arrived in Estonia on April 6 had come from Russia.  The Russian side didn't accept the proof, claiming it was  impossible to cross the border illegally from their side, since  they are guarding the border 24 hours a day.    Three students from Afghanistan, currently studying in  Moscow, on Wednesday [27 April] applied for an Estonian visa at  the country's embassy in the Russian capital. The students said  their parents were among the group of Kurds who came to Estonia  illegally.    Estonia refused to issue visas to the Afghan students,  saying  it still insists that Russia would take back the Kurds who  crossed the border illegally.</p>

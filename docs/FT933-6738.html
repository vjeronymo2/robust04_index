			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland aims to force pace AMONG THE first to discuss the trade-related outcome of today's meeting in Bonn between Mr Helmut Kohl, Germany's chancellor, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, will be Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor. He will meet Mr Kohl next Wednesday, and Mr Balladur a week later, as part of what Gatt staff are describing as 'an action oriented' strategy intended to bring the Uruguay Round of trade talks to a successful conclusion by the end of the year. Farm trade reform will be a key concern for both the French and German leaders at today's meeting, with France threatening to veto a Uruguay Round deal unless changes are agreed to a US-EC accord reached in November last year. This issue is expected to move from the back-burner to the the front in Gatt negotiations in the latter part of September, after which rapid settlement of differences will be essential if the timetable for completion of the talks is to be met. Gatt negotiators return to Geneva over the coming weekend, moving straight into a top-level trade negotiations committee on Tuesday. Here, Mr Sutherland will lay down detailed plans for the autumn. These include the week starting September 13 devoted to finalising the text of the agreement on services trade, and three intensive weeks through to the end of the month focused on finalising agreements on market access and liberalisation of trade in services.</p>

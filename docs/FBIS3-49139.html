A total of 3.9 billion crowns  of that have thus far been spent. Administrative costs such as,  for example, those for privatisation commissions, were 240  million crowns, while 450 million crowns was spent on  depreciated property returned to its original owners.    Settlement of liquidation consequences of state-owned  companies have thus far demanded close to 2 billion crowns.  Town councils obtained a one-time payment of 1.2 billion crowns  as compensation for enterprises which represented income for  local budgets and were privatised or restituted. The net  balance from the process is 31.2 billion crowns, of which 20  billion has been deposited long-term, the interest of which is  to be used in the privatisation of health care, Jezek concluded.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / AT&amp;T to pay Russians Dollars 60 a month AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Tele - graph hired 100 fibre optics scientists and technicians from the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow yesterday at the bargain salary of Dollars 60 (Pounds 34) a month per scientist. The one-year renewable contract, which begins next Monday, puts AT&amp;T among the first US companies to have found a way of using the wealth of talent left behind in the break-up of the Soviet Union. Corning, the glass company, also yesterday announced it had signed joint research accords that would employ more than 100 Russian scientists on basic research projects in glass. It is understood to be paying the scientists about the same salary as AT&amp;T. The scientists working with Corning will research silicate, phosphate and fluoride glass, as well as conducting research into optical materials and devices. The AT&amp;T deal calls for the Russian team to work full-time in Moscow, under subcontract, in co-operation with the 100-strong fibre optics team in the US of Bell Laboratories, its research centre. Bell said the deal was worth 'a few hundred thousand dollars', and would include funds for travel by the Russian scientists to the US on brief visits. Bell will provide funds to the Russian Academy's General Physics Institute to buy equipment for the research projects, which are expected to focus on developing high-strength fibres and metallic coatings on optic fibres. Dr Kumar Patel, executive director of Bell Laboratories, said the equipment to be supplied, including some laser systems that are a generation old, would not violate any Cocom restrictions on the export to Russia of sophisticated US technology. 'At present there is no intention of transferring the latest fibre optics technology to Russia,' Dr Patel explained. Fibre optics has become a crucial telecommunications technology, rapidly replacing copper cabling as the medium of choice for high-speed digital transmissions, ranging from telephone to computer systems. The deal includes an unusual intellectual property rights agreement. This will allow the Russian institute to retain patent rights within Russia for any products developed during the research, while Bell Laboratories has the patent rights for the rest of the world. In March, Sun Microsystems of California enlisted a team of 50 former Soviet defence researchers to work on supercomputer applications. They are believed to be getting even lower pay than the AT&amp;T subcontractors. The US administration itself recently finalised a contract with 116 nuclear scientists at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow to help in the development of develop a fusion reactor. These scientists are believed to be receiving around about Dollars 65 a month.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PENA, BOGGS BOOST BOSTON TO 4-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> Tony Pena had three hits and two RBIs, and Wade Boggs was walked intentionally  a record-tying three times today as the Boston Red Sox beat the Detroit Tigers  for the 10th straight time, 4-2.  </P> <P> Boggs' three intentional walks tied a major league record for a nine-inning  game, shared by many.  </P> <P> Roger Maris and Garry Templeton share the record of four in extra innings.  </P> <P> Detroit manager Sparky Anderson's strategy worked as the Red Sox were unable to  capitalize on the intentional walks. The Red Sox left the bases loaded in the  second and third innings and left two runners on in the fifth.  </P> <P> That left Pena to do the damage. Pena lined a single in the first, drove in two  runs with a bases-loaded single in a four-run third and ripped a double in the  fifth.  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker, beaten by Detroit last June 14 before Boston began its winning  streak, allowed two runs and five hits in five innings, then got the victory  with relief help from Dennis Lamp, Rob Murphy and Lee Smith.  </P> <P> Detroit starter Kevin Ritz lasted only 2 1/3 innings, giving way to Dan Petry  after allowing seven hits and four runs.  </P> <P> With one out in the third, Ellis Burks and Dwight Evans singled, and Billy Jo  Robidoux walked, filling the bases.  </P> <P> Pena, signed as a free agent during the off-season, poked a single to right,  scoring Burks and Evans, and Jody Reed followed with a double to left, scoring  Robidoux. Petry replaced Ritz, and Pena scored as Kevin Romine grounded out.  </P> <P> Boddicker blanked Detroit on three hits for four innings. Then he gave up two  runs in the fifth.  </P></p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Brewing The Budget has certainly brought some cheer to the brewing sector. Since Tuesday, Scottish &amp; Newcastle is up by 10 per cent, Bass by 6, Whitbread by 5 and Allied-Lyons by 3. Though part of the reason is the pleasing second-half results from Bass, the main impetus came from the chancellor's decision not to raise the duty on beer. The Treasury seems finally to have realised that higher duty could simply see its revenue fall. The UK beer market is shrinking and, according to Bass, parallel imports from the Continent now account for 3 per cent of total domestic consumption. In that environment, a taxation policy which reverses some of the discrimination in favour of wine and cider - duties on both were increased - can only help. But while the trend is in the right direction, the movement, saving perhaps 1p a pint on beer and adding 2p to the price of a bottle of wine, is minuscule. Factor that into the poor market conditions which wrought the concession out of the Treasury in the first place, and one wonders why the stock market is so excited. The brewers which managed to push through large real increases in the beer price a couple of years ago do not have a particularly strong leg to stand on. But Bass is probably right to claim that in present conditions an actual cut in duties may be required to rekindle growth in demand. That is also an admission of how limited the scope is for the brewers to raise their prices. It has become even more difficult since Tuesday, when they were deprived of even the chance to slip a little into their own pockets when passing on the chancellor's duty demand.</p>

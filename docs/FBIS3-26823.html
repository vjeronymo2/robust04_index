Repeating the same old tune, it  once again made irresponsible remarks about the human rights  conditions in quite a few countries throughout the world and  distorted, criticized, and attacked China's domestic situation.  These allegations have been solemnly refuted by the relevant  countries, and the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman has again  clearly expressed our country's position of resolutely opposing  taking human rights as an excuse to interfere in China's  internal affairs.    With regard to the human rights issue, people may recall the  remarks that Chairman Jiang Zemin made at his official meeting  with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last November. He said:  There are nearly 1,000 nationalities and approximately 200  nations on earth, with a great variety of cultural traditions  and lifestyles, making the world rich and colorful. This fact  is also reflected in human rights concepts. In the developed  countries of Europe and the Americas and in the developing  countries of the East, there are also differences in the concept  of human rights owing to varying cultural traditions, ways of  life, and stages of development. For example, over 2,000 years  ago, China's ancient philosophers had the ideology of treasuring  the people and cherishing universal love such as "the people are  the foundation of an imperial ancestral temple," "it is a virtue  to honor other aged people and look after other children as we  do our own," and so on. China's socialist way of life has  conditioned the extent, fairness, and sincerity of stressing  human rights, which has been obtained by the Chinese people  through hard struggle and sacrifice with bloodshed. When  signboards saying "no admittance to Chinese and dogs" were hung  on the gates of Chinese parks, what human rights did the Chinese  people have? China is a developing country with a large  population, and the right of development is an important right  that has a bearing on the destiny and future of the Chinese  nation. This is China's national situation, and the European  and American countries have a different kind of national  situations. Their cultural traditions cannot be traced to the  same origin, not to mention their life-styles and stages of  development. The concept on human rights in European and  American countries primarily originated from the ideological  trend of humanism formed in the European Renaissance Movement.  At that time, the rising bourgeoisie regarded personal freedom  and the pursuit of personal happiness as natural instincts of  human beings, and took these as their theoretical bases to  oppose religious prerogative, hierarchy, and feudal rule. No  doubt, this ideological trend had tremendous, historic  significance for pushing forward social progress and development  at that time, but it also had notable historical limitations.  Here, we might as well review some famous expositions by the  founders of the theory on human rights in Europe.    First, the personal freedom and happiness that they pursued  was, in essence, the right to possess property. The British  political ideologist Locke, called by Marx and Engels as the  "founding father" of bourgeois liberalism, maintained: In the  "human rights endowed by nature," including life, freedom,  property, and so on, which can neither be given away nor taken,  property rights are the most fundamental of rights. His famous  remark was: The grass that my horses graze and the soil that my  servants plow are all my property. Property alone -- rather than  blood lineage or the will of God -- is the symbol of rights. In  fact, when Locke and other ideologists during the bourgeois  revolution period flaunted the banner of the "natural right" to  oppose religious prerogative and feudal autocracy, they "used  the privilege of money to replace all personal and hereditary  privileges of the past." When the U.S. Constitution--the first  bourgeois constitution written in the world--was formulated in  1787, possession of property and payment of taxes were taken as  a prerequisite for obtaining the right to vote. Incidentally, in  accordance with this constitution, American blacks and women  were deprived of the right to vote for a long time due to their  "natural" color and sex. As a matter of fact, it was not until  the 1960's that universal suffrage was practiced in the United  States, which was stipulated in the first constitution of New  China.    Second, the European humanist concept of human rights  acknowledges that "all men are born equal," but, in defining  this right, it also acknowledges that, owing to the unequal  strength of men, it is reasonable to swallow one another up.  The most typical expression of this idea was made by Spinoza,  the 17th century Dutch political ideologist, who said: "The  greatest natural right of a big fish is to swallow little  fishes." His theory of natural rights maintained that a man's  right endowed by nature is identical with his natural  aspirations and strength. In other words, the extent of a man's  right is decided by the extent of his strength. He openly  advocated the law of the jungle -- the weak are the prey of the  strong. According to this theory, then, in the development  process of old-style capitalist countries, their policies of  colonial expansion, the slave trade, and gunboat diplomacy were  undoubtedly logical. The Yuanming Garden was looted and burned  by the Eight-Power Allied Forces, but China had to pay a large  sum of money as "compensation!" Of course, this is now history,  but hegemonism and power politics have far from disappeared from  international life, as people can still discern from this, the  shadow of the history of that period.    The humanist ideology of the European bourgeois  revolutionary  forerunners has made historical contributions. History has made  giant advances for three centuries, and earth-shaking changes  have taken place throughout the world. We should inherit their  ideology critically -- not to mention the even more ancient and  brilliant civilizations which can be compared and taken as a  reference apart from the ideology that originated in Europe.  Therefore, it is very natural that different countries and  nations have identical or different stands and viewpoints on the  issue of human rights. If they cannot reach a consensus for the  moment, it is definitely possible to seek common ground while  reserving differences. Under no circumstances, however, should  a certain concept of human rights be imposed on others, still  less should the issue of human rights be used to meddle in other  countries' internal affairs, or to exert political pressure on  them. Otherwise, they will not be able achieve their aim and,  more often than not, the result will be opposite to the desired  effect. As a Western saying goes: They will only shoot  themselves in the foot.</p>

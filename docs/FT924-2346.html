			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts (Christmas Entertainment): Seasonal celluloid offerings IN RECENT years the Yuletide film release pattern in Britain seems to have been designed by E. Scrooge. Little for kiddies and not much more for grown-ups: unless they like oddly-timed horror films like last Christmas's The People Under The Stairs. That was all about children being starved and imprisoned under the floorboards: very seasonal. But this year Home Alone 2 comes to town, an altogether more children-friendly proposition as young Macauley Culkin mislays his parents yet again, this time in New York, and fends off the same pair of wacky burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern). Sir Richard Attenborough's Chaplin promises us another of his portraits of small but messianic heroes of the 20th century, to match the director's earlier Gandhi. America's Robert Downey Jr plays our Charlie with rumoured panache and a guaranteed British accent. And before Christmas children of all ages will be able to see The Muppet Christmas Carol, in which Kermit and Miss Piggy, too long absent from our screens, give Dickens a seasonal going-over. For grown-ups there are Kevin Costner's new film The Bodyguard and Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson offering power-casting in the ex-Broadway courtroom drama A Few Good Men. The first I still await; the second woos the box office with a cunning blend of boy-scout heroics - Cruise as a young Navy lawyer defending two murder-accused Marines - and pyrotechnic acting from Nicholson. None of the other major US Christmas releases, like Coppola's Dracula and Disney's Aladdin, are set to open in the UK before the New Year. But never mind. There are still autumn holdovers worth catching. If you were too busy in recent months watching the real-life dramas all around us, you may now make up for lost time. Most festive of all is Beauty And The Beast, Disney's 30th animated feature and as visually dazzling as any since the first (Snow White). And some children might enjoy the tinselled absurdism of Strictly Ballroom, a fleet-footed Australian comedy which my predecessor on this paper, David Robinson, included in his recent all-time Ten Best Films list for Sight And Sound. That is going it a bit. But Orson Welles's Othello, Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, all still viewable, would be worthy company in any pantheon. Welles turns the moor's tragedy into a Shakespearean Ivan The Terrible: white-hot compositions and bold, hieratic performances. Allen's film is a bitter-hilarious picture of self-destruct relationships. You have to go back to Annie Hall and Manhattan for an Allen in livelier form. And Unforgiven, a haunting tale of rough justice in the Old West (where Eastwood himself looks as old and monumental as the landscapes), is the best Western of recent times. Less demanding picture-hunters may settle for one of the gimmick-strewn entertainment machines trundling across the Atlantic. Sneakers, starring Robert Redford, is a merry tale of computer hackers hacking into the political big time. And Death Becomes Her has Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn being picturesquely attacked by special effects and resembling Henry Moore sculptures. As for British film-makers, two have work now on display, though only one of their films is British. Kenneth Branagh's Peter's Friends trips the bright fantastic through a Chekhovian script with a cast of young TV comics (Stephen Fry, Tony Slattery, Hugh Laurie) learning to play straight. And Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Director's Cut shows that you do not have to be an American to create the definitive vision of urban America in the next millennium. See, marvel and come out humming the sets.</p>

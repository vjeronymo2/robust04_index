The story comes from Barclays Commercial Services, the factoring and invoice discounting subsidiary of Barclays Bank, from a list of imaginative excuses offered it in 30 years of collecting payments. Other evasions included 'my managing director is abseiling down our building for charity, can he call back tomorrow?', and 'I'm sorry no one can help you, the accounts department are on a credit control course'. Then there were the calls indicating all was not well: 'I'm sorry, the finance director has taken the cheque book to pay the bail of the sales director.'

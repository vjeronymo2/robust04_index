FGT states that it is filing the above tariff sheets to reflect certain revisions to the permanent release provisions of its capacity relinquishment mechanism which are necessary in order to continue to promote the Commission's desire to allow the maximum amount of participation in the capacity relinquishment program while at the same time not degrading FGT's standing in the financial community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGT notes that in recently issued orders, the Commission has stated that FGT must follow an ``industry standard'' of allowing a party to acquire transportation service upon the tendering of a three-month prepayment regardless of the term of the underlying service agreement. Specifically, pursuant to the Commission's ``Order Granting Clarification'' (``May 31 Order''), FGT states that any party apparently may now acquire relinquished capacity on a permanent basis on the FGT system by providing an escrow account in an amount equal to the charge for only three (3) months' service. Thereafter, the Relinquishing Shipper would not be liable for any further obligations. FGT believes that an unintended result of the May 31 Order is that a creditworthy shipper may now permanently relinquish capacity to an uncreditworthy shipper. Since the creditworthy Relinquishing Shipper would have no further liability, FGT states that its financial standing would be adversely affected because FGT could only look to the uncreditworthy Acquiring Shipper with potentially no assets for payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the potential consequences of the May 31 Order, FGT, by this filing, is responding to the Commission's prior express invitation for FGT to propose an alternative, reasonable means to assure payment. The instant tariff filing proposes a reasonable alternative method to assure payment to FGT with very limited tariff changes. The instant proposal would apply only to permanent relinquishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 3, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOLUCA PACIFIC TOES LINE ON PENNY STOCKS  </P> <P> When it comes to his attire, stockbroker Peter Blowitz flouts convention. On a  typical day, he roams his Toluca Lake office dressed in jeans, tennis shoes and  an open-collar, long-sleeve shirt without tie. No pinstripes here.  </P> <P> But when it comes to trading stocks, Blowitz, president and half-owner of  Toluca Pacific Securities Corp., is a stickler for rules -- not just those set  by regulators, but also his own. His Rule No. 1? Never trade stocks of new  companies that were organized in Newport Beach or in Florida. "If they're from  Florida or Newport Beach, I throw them in the trash," Blowitz said. "It's a  reflex action. There's just too many bad deals down there."  </P> <P> Blowitz, 45, can't afford to take chances. Toluca Pacific specializes in  trading over-the-counter stocks, including high-risk, thinly traded "penny  stocks" that typically sell for $1 or less. The penny-stock market long has  been marked by manipulation, fraud and sorry investors who were hoodwinked by  fast-talking brokers and bought worthless shares.  </P> <P> But with the problem getting worse, the Securities and Exchange Commission,  state authorities and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, or NASD, which  governs the over-the-counter market, have cracked down on penny stocks, and  Newport Beach and Florida are hotbeds of foul play, authorities say.  </P> <P> There are roughly 300 firms that deal in penny stocks nationwide. But in the  last three years, the NASD has disciplined 25 of the firms, filed a total of  182 disciplinary actions against firms and individuals, and handed out  penalties ranging from expulsion from the NASD to $250,000 fines. An additional  135 investigations are in progress, said NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing.  </P> <P> Toluca Pacific itself has a pretty clean record. Since Blowitz founded the  company in 1983, the NASD has cited the firm for only one minor violation: One  day in 1985, the firm left out a stock when it gave the NASD the firm's trading  volume for that day, and it was fined $250. The California attorney general's  office has never taken action against the firm.  </P> <P> It's unknown if any investors have pursued successful complaints against Toluca  Pacific, mainly because most stockholder disputes are settled by an arbitration  panel of either the stock exchanges or the NASD, and those disputes are not  formally made public.  </P> <P> But Blowitz figures that penny stocks account for somewhat less than half his  company's $3.5 million in annual revenue, and with all the turmoil in penny  stocks, he tries to stay out of harm's way by taking the high road with  low-priced stocks. How? Besides avoiding stock promoters from Newport Beach or  Florida, Blowitz insists that he or his assistant personally execute every  trade made by Toluca Pacific -- even though the firm has 90 brokers, five  branch offices and 3,500 to 10,000 customers a year. This way, Blowitz knows  every stock handled by his firm.  </P> <P> "The buck rests here," said Blowitz, pointing a finger at himself. Blowitz,  born and raised in Studio City, started the firm with $250,000 of mostly  borrowed money. Before then, he had spent 14 years trading stocks in Los  Angeles for small- and mid-sized brokerage firms, including Wedbush Corp. and  Morgan Olmstead Kennedy &amp; Gardner Capital, two firms that have since merged  to become Wedbush Morgan Securities.  </P> <P> Even at those firms, Blowitz specialized in small, over-the-counter stocks, so  he maintained that specialty with his own firm. Customers rely on Toluca  Pacific not so much to trade IBM, but to trade such penny stocks as Meditech  Pharmaceuticals (20 cents a share); United Leisure (87.5 cents), a recreation  concern, and Warner Technologies (16 cents), a florescent lighting company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Stocks  </P> <P> Toluca Pacific does not underwrite new stocks; that is, it does not buy all of  the shares from a company and then try to sell them to the public. The firm is  foremost a broker and trader, but its success in generating commissions rides  in large part on finding successful stocks that enrich an investor, so he or  she will come back and do business with Blowitz again.  </P> <P> So Blowitz's brokers hunt for little-known stocks with promise. When a broker  finds a prospect, three or four of Toluca Pacific's brokers will discuss the  stock, perhaps invest in some shares and then decide whether to pitch it to  customers.  </P> <P> One of Toluca Pacific's past winners was Air Cargo Equipment, a Long Beach  maker of conveyor belts and other cargo-handling equipment. Toluca Pacific  began buying the stock for $3 a share in 1986, and then Zero Corp. bought the  company in 1988 for the equivalent of about $18 to $20 per share for those  early investors, Blowitz said.  </P> <P> Toluca Pacific does not advertise -- a brief stint in the Yellow Pages drew a  couple of investors who skipped on their bills -- but rather relies on  recommendations for new clients. Toluca Pacific rarely makes cold calls, and  that is unusual for a penny-stock brokerage firm. Such firms often rely on  salesmen making high-pressured, cold calls to names out of phone books or  various mailing lists.  </P> <P> "Someone who has more money and more investment savvy is not going to look up a  broker in the Yellow Pages," Blowitz said. "They're going to ask somebody who a  good broker is, and then they're going to get our name."  </P> <P> That might depend on whom they ask. Some brokerage executives in Blowitz's back  yard, including the manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton's Burbank branch, said  they had never heard of him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Respected Among Traders  </P> <P> Still, some of Blowitz's competitors said his approach works. "He is  well-respected among the traders in our industry," said Norma Yaeger, president  of Yaeger Securities in Encino. She said Blowitz "does try to associate himself  with a better quality of people" and that he "keeps his integrity above  reproach."  </P> <P> In many ways, Blowitz is only as good as his brokers, since the brokers are the  ones who serve Toluca Pacific's customers. He often urges brokers not to rush  into a new penny stock, even if the company looks solid, because the stock's  initial price is usually inflated relative to the company's prospects.  </P> <P> "I tell them, 'Just wait,' " Blowitz said. Recently, for instance, his brokers  were hot to buy the stock of a new mining company at $1 a share. "Six months  went by, and the stock was a quarter. They wanted to buy it. I said wait. Six  months later, the stock was an eighth," or 12.5 cents a share. "Then we bought  it."  </P> <P> Ironically, the authorities' crackdown has meant that some firms have been shut  down by regulators or have closed shop under pressure -- with both actions  leaving stockholders with worthless shares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Types of Scams  </P> <P> Typically penny stock scams work in two main ways. First, many penny stocks are  issued by "blind pools," shell companies that sell the stocks to raise cash for  some unidentified future purpose. Many blind pools are legitimate, but many  also are simply vehicles for crooks to quickly raise cash and then disappear,  leaving their stockholders with empty promises.  </P> <P> "It's the guys behind the deals, that put these things together, that are  making the real money," Blowitz said. "And they just disappear and show up  somewhere else."  </P> <P> In many cases the pool operators need a brokerage firm to peddle their penny  stocks to the public, and that's where the second major scam occurs. Some penny  stock firms are nothing more than "boiler rooms" where banks of brokers make  100 or more cold calls a day to entice people into buying the stocks.  </P> <P> Because the market for many penny stocks is often controlled by just that one  broker, the broker can rip off investors by marking up the stock by 100% or  more.  </P> <P> If the brokerage is crooked, it might buy thousands of shares of a penny stock  itself when the stock first appears and help bid its price higher over the next  few days. That makes the stock's public buyers happy because they have paper  profits, and it encourages others to buy.  </P> <P> But then the brokerage will sell its shares for an actual profit and refuse to  sell shares for customers so they can profit too. And when the customers try to  insist that their shares be sold, frequently they find that the firm has folded  tent and disconnected its phones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mainstream Stocks  </P> <P> Toluca Pacific, whose other half-owner is Stanley Brooks, its executive vice  president, is no boiler room. The firm also is an active trader of such  mainstream stocks as MCA, Walt Disney and Lockheed, and it handles options and  other traditional brokerage services. Its main office, which is spread over the  11th story of a modern high-rise, resembles any branch of brokerage stalwarts  such as Merrill Lynch or Dean Witter Reynolds.  </P> <P> And even though Blowitz often focuses on small-ticket stocks, he refuses to  take a back seat to those firms.  </P> <P> "I can do anything Merrill Lynch can do, including commodities," he said.  </P> <P> But if a customer walks in Blowitz's door with his child's piggy bank and  cracks it open, Blowitz can do business with him as well.  </P></p>

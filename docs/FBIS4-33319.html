			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish of 10 May  1994 on page 3A reports that Higher Council of Private  Enterprise (Cosep) President Ramiro Gurdian would be "willing"  to be the National Conservative Party's candidate for president  of Nicaragua in 1996. In his appearance on Channel 2's "Buenos  Dias" program, Gurdian criticized the executive branch for being  slow to resolve the property issue. In contrast, he cited  examples of cases being resolved quickly under U.S. pressure.  Gurdian related the accusations he had heard from peasants that  military personnel are carrying out attacks in the north. With  regard to the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), he  explained that Cosep is interested in a dialogue with the FSLN  "in order to seek concrete solutions for Nicaragua," but that  this should "in no way be interpreted as seeking an alliance  with Sandinism."</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNSELING PROGRAM FOR HOMELESS STARTS  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley and county Supervisor Ed Edelman on Friday joined a Skid Row  anti-homeless agency in kicking off a modest but innovative program for  fighting homelessness that they said represents a new weapon in tackling the  seemingly intractable crisis.  </P> <P> The $70,000, five-month pilot program, jointly funded by the city and county,  will pay salaries for social workers who will act as personal counselors to  homeless individuals, matching them with existing specialized programs that can  steer them into jobs, permanent housing, alcohol treatment or other services.  </P> <P> Maxene Johnston, director of the Weingart Center on Skid Row, which will  oversee the program, said that while her agency has fed 21,000 individuals and  housed thousands more, such efforts are not enough to return the homeless to  mainstream life.  </P> <P> Johnston said that while there are no scientific studies on the subject, she  believes that most individuals and families who spend more than a week on the  streets "fall into a downward spiral that makes it almost impossible to prevent  their becoming the long-term homeless."  </P> <P> She said the specialized counselors will be able to get transportation, arrange  appointments, handle phone calls and offer other assistance to link homeless  individuals to a vast array of existing programs that they now find out about  "by accident, if at all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 32 Hours a Week in Line  </P> <P> Johnston cited a San Francisco study that showed that homeless people are  forced to spend about 32 hours a week standing in lines to get food, make phone  calls, talk to a social worker, sign up for job-training, use a bathroom, line  up a bed for the night, get a shower or secure other necessities.  </P> <P> Because homelessness "is practically a full-time job," she said, few of the  homeless are able to pull themselves out of the cycle on the streets without  personal assistance from a knowledgeable social worker. And, Johnston said, as  they stay longer on the streets, the costs of serving them skyrocket because  alcoholism, drug use and mental problems strike "even the most steady of them."  </P> <P> Bradley and Edelman expressed optimism that the pilot program, known as the  Homeless Evaluation and Linkage Program, or HELP, will be successful enough to  warrant more extensive funding from both governmental entities.  </P> <P> "I don't know whether anyone can tell you whether or not we can fully solve the  problem," Bradley said. But, he added, he will seek City Council funding and  county funding to turn the pilot effort into a full-fledged program if it is  successful.  </P> <P> Edelman, who along with Supervisor Kenneth Hahn is funding the program out of  discretionary funds from the supervisors' individual district budgets, said he  is convinced that beds and food for the homeless "are simply not enough."  </P> <P> He said that while the conservative-dominated Board of Supervisors may not go  along with funding a new social program even if the pilot succeeds, he and Hahn  can still find more money, earmarked for their own districts, to turn HELP into  a permanent program.  </P></p>

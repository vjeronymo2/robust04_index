Then, I spent  a month wholeheartedly studying Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping. Together with Volume 2 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping that was published 10  years ago, this book is the foundation for the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics--the Marxism of  contemporary China; are the best teaching material and glorious  banner to educate the people, to seek unity of thought, and to  create a new situation in socialist cause; and are a scientific  guide for us to march triumphantly. These books are rich,  extensive, and profound in contents, are filled with a clear-cut  spirit of our times and spirit of nationalities, and are  illuminated with splendid light. In as short as a month, it is  impossible for us to comprehensively and profoundly understand  this book, the "true scripture" of the Marxist theoretical  literature of our times. Hereafter, I will report to you on how  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was  compiled and relay the superficial understanding and experience  gained from my first reading of this book.  <H3>  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  Inherits and Develops Marxism With New Ideas and Viewpoints </H3>   Proceeding from the reality of China and by upholding the  principle of combining Marxism with China's reality, Comrade  Xiaoping has keenly throbbed with the pulse of our times,  emancipated the mind, pioneered the road, blazed new trials, and  led the party and the people create new and earth-shaking causes  since the commencement of reform and opening up, thus changing  the outlook of China and affecting the world. Just as pointed  out by the report of the 14th CPC Congress: "We have inherited  and developed Marxism with new ideas and viewpoints." The  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  overall understanding of the law of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, while Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping is a representative work of Marxist  theory that enters a new state and attains new heights in  contemporary China. To put it briefly, Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has primarily set  forth the following new ideas, new viewpoints, and new concepts:    1. The essence and fundamental task of socialism. Comrade  Xiaoping said: "The essence of socialism is to liberate  productive forces, develop productive forces, abolish  exploitation, eliminate polarization, and finally achieve common  prosperity." This points out that the fundamental task of  socialism is to develop productive forces and the fundamental  purpose is to eventually achieve common prosperity. This new  viewpoint breaks away from the past fixed mode of thinking in  which the essence of socialism was understood from the angle of  production relations and superstructure, has set up a new mode  of thinking in which the essence of socialism is understood from  the standpoint of combining productive forces with production  relations, thus completely placing the understanding of the  essence of socialism on a scientific foundation of historical  materialism. This new viewpoint has broken with the past  limitations of regarding revolution as the liberation of  productive forces only and has set up the new thinking mode of  liberating and developing productive forces and constantly  changing and perfecting socialism through reform, thus  completely putting the understanding of the essence of socialism  on a scientific foundation of dialectical materialism. This new  viewpoint has set up the new thinking mode of "abolishing  exploitation, eliminating polarization, and finally achieving  common prosperity," thus making a clean break not only with the  traditional socialism of "simultaneous prosperity" but also with  capitalism characterized by exploitation and polarization.  Then, this new viewpoint laid a completely new theoretical  foundation stone for the establishment of socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and this viewpoint can be considered a  programmatic viewpoint commanding the whole book.    2. The criterion with regard to judging the "three  advantages". Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "In the final  analysis, not taking a full step in reform and opening up and  not boldly pioneering a road means the fear of accumulation of  more capitalist things and of taking a capitalist road. The  crucial point in this regard is "being capitalist" or "being  socialist." In following the criterion of judging these  advantages, we should chiefly determine whether they are  favorable for the development of productive forces; for  enhancing the comprehensive strength of socialist countries; and  for upgrading the people's living standard." This is a  fundamental standard of judging all gains and losses in line  with the socialist essence, which has been raised by Comrade  Xiaoping after his several inferences of "practice being a sole  criterion in testing the truth;" of freeing the entire party  from the serious fetter of two whateverism; and of realizing the  shifting of work emphasis. The criterion is also to free the  entire party from the serious fetter of "being capitalist or  socialist" and to orient reform and opening up into the new  historic period of establishing the systems of socialist market  economy.    3. The initial stage of socialism. Comrade Xiaoping pointed  out: "The 13th congress of our party has clarified the initial  stage in which China's socialism is and socialism practiced by  China belongs to the initial stage. Socialism itself is in the  initial stage of communism. However, China is still at the  initial stage of practicing socialism. This means that China is  staying in an undeveloped period. Therefore, we should  formulate plans based on this theory and according to it." The  theory of socialism's initial stage represents an important  conclusion made by Comrade Xiaoping in understanding socialism  over again. It has done away with the traditional socialist  concept of "bigger in size, a more developed socialist nature,  pure socialist essence." The theory has also placed the  changes of the relations between ownership and distribution on  the undeveloped level of productive forces. All of these have  been the theoretical basis and fundamental starting points for  the party to formulate its basic line and all principles or  policies.    4. The economic development strategy with three steps.  Comrade Xiaoping said: "We should take three steps in  developing the economy. By the end of this century, we should  accomplish the work of two steps by having people dress warmly  and eat their fill as well as finally become better-off. We  will spend 30 or 50 years in the next century on reaching the  level of medium-developed countries. This is our strategic  target as well as our lofty aspiration and great ideals."  Realizing the target of modernizations step by step and in line  with the periodical goals has not only reflected the spirit of  respecting the economic law, seeking truth from facts, and  stably making progress; but also drawn up a blueprint for  Chinese nation to join in the strong nationalities in the world  and to make socialism and itself prosperous. It also represents  a grand program of uniting with the entire party and the people  throughout the country to wage arduous struggles, to make  unswerving efforts, and to head for the 21st century.    5. The seizure of opportunity, the acceleration of  development, and efforts to improve the national economy to a  new level every several years. While holding talks with several  central comrades in 1991, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is  right for us to stress stability, however, it is possible for us  to lose the opportunity if we overly stress it." "The large  turn in the world at present just means opportunity." "All  people are saying: What position we will be in the `century of  Asia and Pacific'?" "If we fail to seize the opportunity and to  improve the economy to a new level, other people will surpass us  much faster and we will lag behind."    In his speeches given during his 1992 south China  inspection tour, Comrade Xiaoping also said: "The key to seizing  the opportunity to develop ourselves lies in developing the  economy," "in their process of development, some countries also  have had the period or stage of high-speed development," "in  developing the economy, China should strive to reach a new  height every few years," and "judging from our experiences in  the past few years, it is possible for us to reach a new height  in economic development every few years." The viewpoints  Comrade Xiaoping has put forward not only seize the opportunity  provided to China's economic development by the abrupt changes  in the situation of the world, but they also conform to the  objective law governing the periodic and wave upon wave of  development and set forth an important historical responsibility  for the entire party and people across the country to build a  strong country amid the intense competition in the world.    6. Poverty is not socialism, nor is too sluggish a  development. In his article "Learning From Historical  Experiences and Preventing Erroneous Tendencies," Comrade  Xiaoping said: "Many strange things emerged during the 10 years  (meaning the 10 years of the Great Cultural Revolution). People  were asked to be content with poverty and backwardness and to  have impoverished socialism and communism rather than affluent  capitalism. This was what the gang of four advocated. How can  we have impoverished socialism and impoverished communism!" He  emphasized repeatedly: "Socialism cannot hold its ground if it  is always poverty-stricken," "socialism should eliminate  poverty, and poverty is not socialism, still less communism,"  and "sluggish development is not socialism, either." The  viewpoints Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized have clarified  the long-standing serious chaos created by the "leftist"  ideological trend and conformed to the basic requirements of the  socialist system and the common desires of the millions of  people.    7. Reform is China's second revolution. Comrade Xiaoping  said: "Revolution is meant to liberate productive forces, and so  is reform. It was a revolution to overthrow the reactionary  rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to  liberate the productive forces of the Chinese people.  Therefore, revolution is to liberate the productive forces.  After the establishment of the socialist basic system, we  should still fundamentally change the economic system that  fetters the development of productive fores and establish a  socialist economic system that is full of vigor and vitality to  promote the development of productive forces. This is reform.  Therefore, reform is also to liberate productive forces."  Judging from China's practice, reform has effected and is  effecting profound changes in the economic, political, social,  scientific and technological, and cultural fields and major  changes in people's standard of behavior, lifestyle, mind-set,  concept on value, and criteria for right and wrong. Comrade  Xiaoping's expositions indicate that the nature of the  revolution is not an amendment to the minor details of the  original economic system but a fundamental transformation of the  economic system and a thorough change of the mechanism for  economic operation. This has ideologically and theoretically  mobilized our party to effectively promote reform.    8. China's development cannot be apart from the rest of the  world. Self-blockade and self-isolation must be opposed.  Comrade Xiaoping sets forth: "Now, the world is open.  Following the industrial revolution of the Western countries,  China became backward. One of the important reasons for this  was that China closed itself to the international arena. After  the founding of the PRC, they blockaded us and to a certain  extent we closed ourselves to the international arena even more.  All this has brought us some difficulties. Experience and the  lessons of the past 30 years or so told us that construction  could not be developed if the door is closed." "China's  development cannot be apart from the world." Comrade Xiaoping's  viewpoint deeply sums up China's experience and lessons in being  reduced from a secondary powerful country to a backward one in  the 100 years or so, conforms to the historical trend of  internationalizing the world economy and making the world  economy an organic whole, and sets forth a strategic issue of  rejuvenating the Chinese nation.    9. Science and technology are the first productive forces.  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Marx said that science and  technology are productive forces. This is very accurate. Now,  it seems that this saying is not enough. I think that science  and technology are the first productive forces." This is the  distillation of the theory on the current economic development  and the practical experience in scientific and technological  progress as well as the new development in Marxism.    10. Socialism and the market economy have no fundamental  contradictions. Comrade Xiaoping said on several occasions:  "The difference between capitalism and socialism does not hinge  on planning or the market. Socialism has the market economy and  capitalism has the control by planning." "There is no  fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market  economy." "The market economy can be developed under  socialism." Comrade Xiaoping's inference has laid a theoretical  foundation for setting up the socialist market economic system.  If we say that encircling the cities from the rural areas is  the only way to win the victory in China's first revolution,  building the socialist market economic system is the only way to  win the second victory in China's second revolution.    11. The reform of the political system must suit the reform  of the economic system. Comrade Xiaoping said: "It will be  difficult to reform the economic system if we do not reform the  political system." "Along with the development of reform, we  will inevitably come across obstacles." "What is more important  is that the political system cannot suit the requirements for  the reform of the economic system." "Whenever we make a step to  promote the reform of the economic system, we deeply experience  the necessity for reforming the political system. Without the  political structural reform, there will be no guarantee for  making achievements in reforming the economic system. If we  cannot continuously promote the reform of the economic system,  the development of the productive forces and the realization of  the four modernizations will be obstructed." Comrade Xiaoping's  inference brings to light the obstacles for deepening the reform  of the economic system, develops the basic Marxist principle  that the superstructure should suit the economic foundation, and  clearly points out the orientation of reform.    12. Grasp with two hands and be tough with both hands. This  is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea. In Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping  repeatedly pointed out: "We should grasp with two hands. One  hand is the economic policy on opening to the outside world and  enlivening the domestic economy. The other hand is to  resolutely deal blows to various kinds of economic criminal  activities." "There must be two hands in promoting the four  modernizations. The four modernizations cannot be realized with  only one hand. The two hands indicate that we should grasp  construction with one hand and grasp the legal system with the  other." "We should grasp reform and opening up with one hand  and grasp the struggle against various criminal activities with  the other. These two hands must be tough." This indicates that  "Grasping with two hands has become a key strategic principle  and task for building socialism with Chinese characteristics."    13. One country, two systems. This is an idea put forward  to resolve the Taiwan and Hong Kong issues. Comrade Xiaoping  pointed out: "One country, two systems, specifically means in  the PRC, to implement the socialist system in the mainland with  a population of 1 billion and to implement the capitalist system  in Hong Kong and Taiwan." The idea of "one country, two  systems" is an example of Comrade Xiaoping's creative  development of Marxism and an important development of the  theory of the state--the political and theoretical core of  Marxism. His pioneering work will not only create a new  situation for China's great cause of reunification but also  exert a far-reaching historical influence on the peaceful  undertakings of the entire world.    14. Check turmoil and prevent peaceful evolution. Comrade  Xiaoping pointed out: "China's four modernizations will not  succeed without a stable political environment," "all the things  that oppose and hinder our taking the socialist road and all the  factors leading to chaos and even turmoil in China should be  eliminated," and "a need for stability is an issue above all  other issues in China, and, without a stable environment,  nothing will be accomplished, and the achievements already won  will also be lost." Comrade Xiaoping also pointed out: "The  Western countries are fighting a third world war without the  smoke of gunpowder, meaning the peaceful evolution of socialist  countries," and "therefore, we should educate well our Army, our  organs of dictatorship, Communist party members, the masses, and  youths." As time goes by, the lessons in the disturbance of  some countries, China's political and social stability, and the  development experiences in people's living and working in peace  and contentment have all the more proved Comrade Xiaoping's  viewpoints to be scientific and truthful.    15. Be on the alert against right tendencies, but mainly  guard against left tendencies. Comrade Xiaoping said during the  past 10 years: "We should oppose both `leftism' and rightism  when emancipating the mind," "but the largest danger comes from  `left' tendencies," and "right tendencies may ruin socialism,  and so may `left' tendencies; and China should be on the alert  against right tendencies but should mainly guard against `left'  tendencies." Comrade Xiaoping's theory summarizes the historical  experiences and lessons of China's revolution and construction,  exposes the extremely great danger of the "left" tendencies that  are seemingly revolutionary, and clearly points out the major  tendencies we should guard against in the process of reform,  opening up, and the modernization drive. It pinpoints the  current problems and has a far-reaching guiding significance.    16. Adhere to the party's basic line without wavering for  100  years. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized during the past  10 years: "We should tell the world that no one can change the  principles, policies, and strategies that we have now  formulated," "the basic line, principles, and policies we have  formulated should be continued and unswervingly carried on,"  "not only should the current leaders adhere to them, but also  the leaders to serve the next terms of office should adhere to  them," and "the basic line should take charge for 100 years  without wavering." The party's basic line represents the  precious experience gained by the CPC by summarizing both the  positive and negative experiences and lessons during the decades  of practice in the revolution it led millions of people to  carried out. It is the lifeline of our party and is where the  basic interests of Chinese people lie. Comrade Xiaoping's call  for keeping the party's basic line unchanged for 100 years which  he issued after careful consideration is an immediate need in  China's reform and development and also a need in China's  marching toward the 21st century.    17. Peace and development are two major topics of the  present world. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "One of the really  big issues of the present world which are of global strategic  importance is the issue of peace and the other is the economic  issue or we may call it the development issue. The issue of  peace is one concerning the East and the West and the issue of  development is one concerning the South and the North. We can  summarize them into four words-- East, West, South and North."  This figurative summation of Comrade Xiaoping has great  foresight, scientifically analyzed the development and changes  in the world situation after the war, promptly made theoretical  analysis that conforms with the objective trend of the  development situation, provided a reliable guarantee for our  country to develop foreign relations and to seize the  opportunity to develop itself, and it is becoming a common  understanding of the whole world and the common task facing the  whole world.    18. We should view the international situation soberly, try  to maintain our position, and cope with it calmly. In September  1989, in face of the sudden changes in the world pattern, such  as the great changes in East Europe, the disintegration of the  Soviet Union, and the reunification of East and West Germany,  Comrade Xiaoping said earnestly to several central responsible  comrades: "Regarding the international situation, we can  summarize it into three sentences. The first is to view it  soberly; second, try to maintain our position; and third, cope  with it calmly. We must not be impatient because impatience may  lead to failure. We must be calm, quietly immerse ourselves in  practical work, and accomplish one affair, our own affair."  This is one of the important aspects of the political briefing  which Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave to leaders of the new  generation of our country after he accumulated the experiences  gained during scores of years of domestic and international  struggles, and is a basic stand which our country should uphold  during a considerable long period of external struggle, and has  been proven by practice over recent years that it is a correct  foreign principle.    19. The crucial issue of China is to internationally improve  the Communist party. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "China's  problem will come from inside the Communist party. We must  approach this issue soberly, pay attention to training  personnel, and select people of ability and political integrity  into the leading bodies in line with the criterion of selecting  revolutionary, young, well- educated and vocationally proficient  cadres. We should rely on this point if we want to uphold the  basic line the party has kept for 100 years and maintain a long  period of peace and stability. This is an affair that really  affects the overall situation." "In the final analysis, the  crucial issue is to improve the Communist party inside. If  nothing happens we may sleep at ease." Comrade Xiaoping's  directives have exposed where the key and the vital part of the  problems of China lie, and provided a major task for party  building.    20. We should strengthen the building of politics and fight  corruption. During recent years, Comrade Xiaoping unceasingly  stressed: "We should do several things that satisfy the people.  There are two aspects. One is to boldly conduct reform and  opening up, and the other is to step up efforts to fight  corruption." "To rectify our party and realize our strategic  objective, there will really be the danger of failure if we fail  to fight corruption, in particular, the corrupt phenomena in the  upper layer of the party." "Facts show that the Communist party  is capable of eliminating repulsive things. We should fight  corruption during the whole course of reform and opening up.  As far as cadres and Communist party members are concerned,  they should grasp the building of clean politics as a major  affair." Comrade Xiaoping expounded the major significance of  conducting anticorruption struggle from the perspective of the  party's life and death, which is a new development of the  Marxist theory on party building.    Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  has many new ideas and new viewpoints which I will no longer  list here one by one.  <H3>  In Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, We Should Have a Good Command of and Make Clear  Some Major Issues </H3>   In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, we should give prominence to focal points, grasp  the essentials, and make clear some major issues in line with  realities. What major issues on earth should we center in  conducting study and discussion and how should we combine the  study and discussion with the realities of ideology and work?  For this, Comrade Shan Rongfan will set forth demands on behalf  of the provincial party committee. Here, I will only make a  report on my personal experience in study.    1. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts  constitute the quintessence of all theoretical viewpoints of  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.  When meeting with foreign guests, Comrade Xiaoping appraised  himself as the "group of seeking truth from facts." In the  beginning chapter of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping demanded us for the first  time to "take our own road and to build socialism with China's  own characteristics." From the very beginning of this book, he  expounded the ideological line of "seeking truth from facts and  proceeding from reality in doing everything," that was always  advocated by him. In the concluding chapter, namely, the  world-famous important speeches made during his south China  trip, he repeatedly stressed: "Seeking truth from facts  constitutes the quintessence of Marxism." "I have not read many  books. But, I have always believed what Chairman Mao said is  realistic." "Without a little spirit of being fearless and  without a little spirit of rush advance, we will be unable to  beat a good and new path and to pioneer a new cause." This has  again gone back to the quintessence of "emancipating the mind  and seeking truth from facts," that runs through the whole book.    Comrade Xiaoping is the pioneer of the emancipation of the  mind. He pointed out: "What we are engaged in now is a new  cause. It has not been mentioned by Marx, has not been engaged  in by our ancestors, and has not been engaged in by other  socialist countries. Therefore, there are no ready experiences  for us to learn from." "Marxism should develop, and socialism  should also develop, developing along with the development of  the practice of human society and with the development of  science." In his guidance to the great practice of reform,  opening up, and modernization drive, he stressed: "We should  not only refrain from copying the methods of Western capitalist  countries but also refrain from copying the methods of other  socialist countries;" "many problems cannot be tackled with old  methods;" and "we should boldly try a thing and go ahead."  Otherwise, "daring not to emancipate the mind and daring not to  untie our hands will result in missing opportunity, just like  the saying "a boat sailing against the current must forth ahead  or it will be driven back." When the household output-related  contract system displayed its advantages for the first time,  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Becoming rich is not a sin. It  can be affirmed as a very good policy. When the individual and  private sectors of the economy and the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises met with reproach for competing with  state-owned enterprises, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out:  "Developing a little individual sector of the economy and  attracting foreign enterprises to run plants in China constitute  the complement to the socialist economy." When the economy of  special zones was much debated by the people, Comrade Xiaoping  solemnly answered: "Special zones constitute the window, the  window of technology, the window of management, the window of  knowledge, and the window of opening up policy." "Special zones  are the new thing of socialism. Special zones are of socialism  but not of capitalism." When some people and some localities  became rich ahead of others and some people could not accept  them, Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "We stress on common wealth  but also allow differences." It is impossible to develop  equally. The thing will be easier if we let some localities  become rich first and then make them help the poor." With a  profound understanding of the interest and aspirations of the  people, with a correct command of the law of the development of  things, and with a flexible application of the  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Though, Comrade Xiaoping gave a  clear and correct answer to the major questions concerning the  overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic  construction, and greatly promoted the emancipation of the mind  throughout the party.    Comrade Xiaoping is a model in seeking truth from facts. He  pointed out: To emancipate the mind, we should have our ideas  conform to the objective reality, seek truth from facts, proceed  from reality to do everything, and proceed from the actual  conditions of China and the world. Comrade Xiaoping thoroughly  analyzed the actual conditions of China and the world. He  pointed out that the greatest reality of China is that China is  in the initial stage of socialism where the productive forces  are not well developed and that the great reality of the world  is that peace and development become the main subjects, there  will be no world war in a longer period of time, and we can  strive for a peaceful international environment that is  conducive to the domestic construction. Just in line with these  two greatest realities, Comrade Xiaoping set forth the  "political line of boldly, wholeheartedly, and perfectly  developing the four modernization;" the key policy on grasping  favorable opportunities and making self-development; and the  basic state policy on reform and opening up. In regard to the  unprecedented reform undertaking, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out:  "Our policy is to be bold enough, make stable steps, and take  one step and look around before taking another." "The key is to  be good at summing up experiences and avoid making big  mistakes." Whenever reform has been developed for a period of  time, Comrade Xiaoping constantly exhorts the whole party:  "Now, it is time to look back. We have to see what has been  done right and what has been done wrong so as to decide the  next-step reform work." Here, Comrade Xiaoping organically  combined emancipating the mind and boldly blazing new trails  with seeking truth from facts and respecting the objective law  and fostered a brilliant example for the whole party to persist  in the ideological line of "emancipating the mind and seeking  truth from facts."    Proceeding from the reality of the province and using  Xiaoping's theory to arm our heads, emancipate the mind, and  renew our ideas in the historical turn of setting up the  socialist market economic system is of prominent necessity and  urgency. Our productive force development level lags behind  that of the advanced areas. Therefore, we must eliminate the  fixed ideas of doing everything according to books and  proceeding from the traditional socialist ideas and principles  and foster the new idea that emancipating and developing  productive forces is the essential characteristics, fundamental  purpose, and fundamental standard of socialism. The state-owned  sector of the economy accounts for an excessive large proportion  of the economy in the province. Thus, the existing managerial  forms lack vitality. We must eliminate the traditional public  ownership idea characterized by state ownership and state  management; define various kinds of ownership forms  characterized by state ownership, collective ownership,  cooperative ownership, and various sectors of ownership; define  various kinds of property organizational forms characterized by  independent investment, shareholding system, and shareholding  cooperative system; and define the public ownership idea where  ownership is separated from the property right of legal persons.  Along with the promulgation of the state key reform measures in  1994, we must change the existing forms to regulate and control  the administrative distribution of loans, tax reduction and  exemption, and the readjustment of contract base figures; and  define the regulation and control ideas of separating government  functions from enterprise management, capital, and business  dominated by indirect means. Under the circumstances where  reform measures should be standardized by laws, we must change  the policy idea characterized by a policy for a piece of land  and a policy for a plant and the policy idea of development in  reliance on reducing taxes, conceding profits, and special  preferential policies; and define the policy idea of creating  equal competition conditions to enliven the mainstay of markets.  Under the new situation of carrying out the market economic  system, we must eliminate the inherent ideas that land is not a  commodity, labor forces are not able to enter markets, and  socialism does not have capital category and foster a market  idea that all production factors, such as land, labor forces,  capital, and property rights, can be circulated and exchanged.  Under the new situation of further opening to the outside  world, we must eliminate the managerial form, method, and  traditional idea of totalling excluding capitalism and define  the open idea of handling affairs according to the general  market economic laws and the international practice.    2. What socialism is and how socialism with Chinese  characteristics should be built are the theme of the third  volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." In the  eighties, Comrade Xiaoping took the overall situation, the  reality, and the future into consideration and meditated, in  retrospect, why the Soviet Union's pattern was not desirable,  why there was evolution and disintegration later, and why  Comrade Mao Zedong encountered setbacks one after another during  his later years in his exploration on the practice of the "three  red banners" and the continued revolution under the dictatorship  of the proletariat. In his speeches given when meeting with  foreign guests, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly said: "Even the  Soviet Union failed to completely clarify what socialism is like  after many years' of efforts," "the Soviet Union's pattern later  became ossified," "our past understanding of what socialism and  Marxism are was not totally clear," "it is all right to decide  to take the socialist road, but we should first understand what  socialism is," "a problem in understanding Marxism and socialism  has existed for many years," "we have not clarified how to  understand and develop Marxism in changing conditions," and  "people who do not inherit and develop Marxism with new ideas  and new viewpoints are not true Marxists." When talking with  some central responsible comrades before the 13th party  congress, he once again pointed out: "The report to the 13th  party congress should provide a theoretical exposition on what  socialism is and should clearly explain whether our reform is  socialist." We can see that Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, where the theme of what socialism  is and how socialism with Chinese characteristics should be  built appears repeatedly from the beginning to the end, is  continuously developed in content and deepened in ideology and  shows ever enhanced understanding of laws. According to my  understanding, the reason why Comrade Xiaoping painstakingly  considered and repeatedly emphasized this theme was that the  detours and mistakes we had experienced before reform and  opening up started and the misgivings and doubts we experienced  after reform and opening up started, in the final analysis,  resulted from our failure to thoroughly clarify this question.  After the initial study of the third volume, I feel that, to  clearly understand this theme, we should clarify the following  basic theoretical questions:    Why do we develop socialism? This question concerns the  origin and non-origin of change in the socialist system.  Historical materialism holds that productive forces are the  ultimate decisive force in the development of human society.  The reason the socialist system will unavoidably replace the  capitalist system lies not in its conformity to "eternal truth  and justice." The reason is, just as Marx said, that the  capitalist system has become the "shackles of production forms  that were developed, that the concentration of the means of  production and the socialization of labor have reached an extent  incompatible with their capitalist shell, and that the shell  will soon blow up." (Das Kapital, Vol 3) This is to  say that the development of productive forces is the original,  first, and ultimate decisive factor, and socialism, as a social  system, is the non-original and second factor decided by the  development productive forces. It is just like Engels pointed  out that socialism is an inevitable demand when the development  of productive forces has reached a certain stage. In addition,  "it is possible to develop socialism only when the development  of productive forces has reached a certain stage and when the  practical conditions for realizing it are all ready (from  socialist ideal to scientific development). Comrade Xiaoping  has profoundly understood this historical dialectical  quintessence and pointed out: "Although we have conducted  socialism, actually we are not up to standard. Only when we  enter the middle part of the next century and reach the level of  a moderately developed country can we say that we have really  conducted socialism." When he met with presidents of Tanzania  and Uganda, he said: "According to your own conditions,  perhaps, you should not be too anxious to engage in socialism  right now." He said that we are "actually not up to standard" to  carry out socialism at present, and that we should not be "too  anxious to carry out socialism." This is implied to the fact  that our conditions are not ready for developing the productive  forces. This has clearly told us that our purpose of carrying  out socialism is to develop the productive forces and that we  should not develop the productive forces for the sake of  socialism. In terms of the objective law of the development of  human society, this has strategically and thoroughly solved the  most basic issue of why we engage in socialism.    What is socialism? There is an issue of the essential and  nonessential aspects of socialism. For a long time, the people  have believed that the essence of socialism is public ownership,  planned economy, distribution according to work, and later, the  dictatorship of the proletariat, the party's leadership and  spiritual civilization. From the perspective of the times,  Comrade Xiaoping introduced for the first time the idea of  productive forces to the essence of socialism in the history of  development of Marxism, explicitly proposed that the essence of  socialism is to "emancipate and develop the productive forces,  eliminate exploitation and polarization and finally lead to  common prosperity." This thesis has ended all kinds of  distortion and erroneous understanding of the essence of  socialism, eliminated some principles, forms, and methods that  do not belong to the essence of socialism. Of this, the  principles of public ownership and distribution according to  work are determined and served by the essence of socialism, and  are essential to the essence of socialism, and therefore, they  are correct and must be upheld; there are also some principles,  forms, and methods, such as the planned economy, are not needed  by the essence of socialism, and, therefore, they are not  necessary to be upheld. In addition, some principles, forms and  methods, such as the commodity economy, the market economy, and  the shareholding system, that conform with the demands of the  essence of socialism or cause no harms to the essence of  socialism must be used for reference and be applied. For a long  time, we have been used to regarding some things that are not  the essence of socialism as the essence of socialism and upheld  them, and regarding things that meet the demands of the essence  of socialism, such as the family-based contracting system and  reform of property right system, as "heretical beliefs," and  opposed them. The reason for this is that we have failed to  completely clarify the essence of socialism. The thesis of  Comrade Xiaoping on the essence of socialism has scientifically  answered the basic question of what is socialism. This is a big  emancipation of the ideology of the communist people and a major  breakthrough of the scientific socialist theory.    How should socialism be developed? This question concerns  the purpose and means of socialism. According to Comrade  Xiaoping's thesis on the nature of socialism, the purpose of  socialism is to "ultimately achieve common prosperity," and all  others are the means. This idea of Comrade Xiaoping's took  shape as early as the 1960's. His famous talk on "cat," namely  "regarding the best form of production relation, we should have  an attitude of adopting whatever forms that can fairly easily  and rapidly restore and develop agricultural production in a  locality," and "all cats, white or black, are good cats as long  as they catch mice," profoundly brought to light in extremely  simple language the relations between the purpose and means of  socialism. That is, we may adopt whatever means that helps  develop productive forces and ultimately achieve common  prosperity. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized that the  ultimate purpose of socialism is common prosperity, "poverty is  not socialism, nor is too sluggish a development," "we adopt all  methods that help develop productive forces, including bringing  in capital and advanced technology from abroad," and "many  operating forms are the means and methods for developing  productive forces, which can be adopted by both capitalism and  socialism, and they serve those who use them well." After  studying Comrade Xiaoping's theses, I feel that we should truly  break with the outdated concept of persisting in means by  regarding it as the purpose and sticking to the means at the  expense of the purpose and should never again do such a silly  thing as "pursuing the weed of socialism rather than the  seedlings of capitalism." We should truly take development as  the essential criterion ad proceed from and aim at developing  Heilongjiang and making the people prosper in doing everything.    3. Introducing the market economy system to the socialist  society is a major breakthrough and innovation of the theory of  scientific socialism that Volume 3 of the Selected Works  of Deng Xiaoping has made, and it blazes a road for China's  socialist modernization that conforms to the objective law  governing socialized large-scale production. The traditional  concept on socialism held that the market economy was the basic  characteristic of capitalism and only the planned economy is the  intrinsic attribute of socialism, and, therefore, the market  economy was not for socialism. With the dauntless courage and  insight of a proletarian revolutionary, Comrade Xiaoping  challenged the traditional concept on the relationship between  planning and the market. He pointed out as early as 1979 that  "the market economy may also be developed in socialism." In  Volume 3, he again spoke on the issue of market on seven or  eight occasions: "There is no basic contradictions between  socialism and the market economy," "to have more planning or to  have more market force is not the basic difference between  socialism and capitalism," "planning and the market are all  economic means," and "it is necessary to persistently combine  the planned economy with the market economy." Comrade  Xiaoping's theses have laid a theoretical foundation for the  socialist market economy.    Engaging in the socialist market economy is an essential  demand in socialized mass production. Comrade Xiaoping  maintained: "Marxism stresses development of productive forces  the most." Attempting to "build all state organizations into a  large machine and into an economic organism whereby hundreds of  millions of people work in accordance with a single plan,"  (Lenin) has made enterprises become "dead spare parts" of this  "large machine" and restrained the source of social wealth under  the conditions of modernized and socialized mass production, has  given rise to unwieldy, overstaffed, and low-efficiency  managerial organizations and skewed the proportion in various  economic sectors off balance; and affected by interests of  respective localities and departments, has caused serious  barriers between different regions and different departments,  hampered the rational flow and optimum organization of  production elements, and caused sharp contradictions to the  socialist mass production. After summarizing the experiences  and lessons gained from history, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly  stressed that the planned economy was no longer workable. "In  the past, we copied the modes of other countries, thus hampering  the development of productive forces." "Old methods have been  proven ineffective by practice in the past tens of years."  Then, he pointed out: "Combining the planned economy with the  market economy will be conducive to liberating productive forces  and accelerating the development of productive forces."    Engaging in the socialist market economy conforms to the  aspirations of the people and the demand of the essence of  socialism. Comrade Xiaoping has always combined the people's  aspirations with the essence of socialism. He maintained that  only liberating and developing productive forces and achieving  common prosperity conform to the fundamental interests of the  people. He also maintained that only by fully mobilizing the  initiative of the people could we liberate and develop  productive forces. Therefore, in approaching a thing, Comrade  Xiaoping has always considered "whether the people support it,"  "whether the people agree to it," "whether the people are  happy," and "whether the people favor it." In the past, we  continuously propagated that laborers were masters of the means  of production. However, under the highly centralized planned  system, enterprises were the accessories of party and government  organs, staff and workers were passive executors of the  mandatory targets of production, staff and workers ate from the  "common big pot" of enterprises, and enterprises ate from the  "common big pot" of the state. As a result, enterprises could  not feel that they were the mainstay of management, laborers  also could not feel that they were masters of their enterprises,  and thus their enthusiasm was seriously dampened. In the light  of this situation, Comrade Xiaoping sharply pointed out:  "Refusing to delegate powers to enterprises, enterprises will  have no autonomy and will no responsibilities to assume, and the  state must assume responsibilities for both success and failure.  If the state takes on everything, how can we do our work well  and mobilize initiative? Implementation of the socialist market  economy will give rise to a pattern characterized by diverse  investment mainstays, diverse ownership forms, diverse  distribution forms, and diverse asset management forms. Under  this pattern, laborers are either owners of individual and  private enterprises or shareholders of shareholding enterprises  and shareholding cooperative enterprises, or staff and workers,  who are closely linked with the destiny of their enterprises, of  the wholly state-funded enterprises that enjoy the property  right of legal persons. Under any circumstance, all laborers  will become masters of their enterprises in gaining property  right and in sharing personal interest, and then we will enhance  the labor productive forces to the maximum and accelerate the  speed of marching towards common prosperity. From this, we can  see that only by developing the socialist market economy can we  meet the demand of the essence of socialism.    Developing the socialist market economy is the inexorable  direction of reform and opening up. A basic idea dominating the  third volume is to break with the closed economy and open to the  outside world. When considering the issue of reform, Comrade  Xiaoping also proceeded from the idea of opening up. He said:  "Reform is meant to invigorate the economy, and invigorating  the domestic economy means to open to other localities of the  country, and this is, in reality, called the open policy," and  "the basic content and basic experience of both the rural reform  and the urban reform are to open up." He also repeatedly  emphasized: "Courage is needed to raise the banner of further  opening up." How should we open further? The situation is very  clear -- over 90 percent of the countries and regions in the  world are enforcing the market economy system. If we become an  "isolated island" of planned economy, it will be very difficult  for us to further march toward the world. Only when we develop  the market economy and act according to international practice,  can we "connect" with the market economy which is universally  implemented in the current world and coordinate China's economy  with the economy of the world.    4. Attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent  in both constitute the basic principle repeatedly emphasized in  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "We should pay close attention to  and never, even on a single day, slacken efforts in building the  spiritual civilization and improving party style and social  conduct," and "what is the sense of succeeding in economic  development if social conduct deteriorates? Deterioration in  the other area will lead to the deterioration of the entire  economy." He repeatedly emphasized that in building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to develop reform  and opening up on the one hand and punish corruption on the  other, develop economic construction on the one hand and improve  democracy and the legal system on the other, and build the  material civilization on the one hand and develop the spiritual  civilization on the other; and that "not only should the economy  be developed, but social order and social conduct should also be  improved and the two civilizations should surpass those in the  capitalist countries. Only this is socialism with Chinese  characteristics." Only when we use patriotism and socialism to  unite the Chinese nation, uplift our national spirit, and  enhance all the people's national self-respect, self-confidence,  and self-pride, can we develop our country and our nation.    To understand Comrade Xiaoping's idea of attending to two  tasks simultaneously, we should strengthen party building and  the spiritual civilization in line with reality, bring about a  turn for the better in public security and social conduct, unite  the people throughout the country, raise spirits, work hard, and  develop Heilongjiang.</p>

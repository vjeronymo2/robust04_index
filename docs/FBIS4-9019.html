			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 19 (CTK) -- It is in the interest of  the Czech Republic and the whole international community that  the maximum be done to prevent such situations like the one  which has recently occurred in Bosnia, and to prevent mainly  Serbian politicians from further ignoring UN resolutions,  Alexandr Vondra said today.    "The recent developments are very disturbing," said Vondra,  Czech deputy foreign minister.    As a member of the UN Security Council, which has met to  discuss the situation in the Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, the  Czech Republic has to push for an agreement within this  institution, Vondra said.    The UN should try to do more, and everybody capable of  positively influencing the Bosnian situation should take a more  active part in the settlement of the crisis. "To a certain  extent, it is probably also a failure of the international  community," Vondra stated.    He said he believed that the Czech Republic had made a  considerable effort to help solve the problem. It had taken an  active part in discussions within the UN Security Council, and  assisted in keeping the peace. The number of Czech UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] soldiers stationed in the former Yugoslavia  was now a thousand, many more in comparison with the country's  population than the number of soldiers from most big powers and  other influential European countries. Czech humanitarian aid  was not negligible either, Vondra said.</p>

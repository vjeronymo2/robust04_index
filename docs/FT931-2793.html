			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Car parts factory to close CAMFORD Engineering, the German-owned automotive components group, is closing one of its subsidiary's plants in Cambridgeshire with the loss of up to 328 jobs. The Pre-Star plant at Bourn is due to close by the end of September and activities will be transferred to other UK plants in the group, principally Pre-Star Bedford and Llanelli-based Camford Pressings. Camford, based in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, said it is expected that some employees will agree to move. Mr Peter Paul, group managing director, said the board regretted the effects on the employees and their families at Bourn. But he stressed that the move had not been brought about by falling volumes due to the recession. 'The closure more reflects the competitive nature of our industry, where the surviving and successful companies will be those which can meet the ever-increasing demands of our customers, particularly on costs.' Mr Paul said the group had had surplus capacity for some time. Although new contracts enabled it to predict significant growth in the years ahead, new technology and lean manufacturing techniques meant it could now produce its components in much less space. Camford's sales, he said, had remained remarkably stable over the past three years because its components were fitted to models which had been selling relatively well. Camford is a wholly owned subsidiary of the newly formed Krupp-Hoesch steel group. Short Brothers, the Belfast-based aerospace company, yesterday announced that it is to shed 665 jobs. The move had been expected because of the worldwide downturn in the aircraft industry.</p>

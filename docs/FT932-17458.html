			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Rising Indonesian exports fail to outstrip imports INDONESIA'S non-oil exports rose 21 per cent to an estimated Dollars 23bn (Pounds 16.1bn) in the 1992-93 financial year which ended yesterday, but failed to exceed non-oil imports which climbed 13 per cent to Dollars 27bn. A report by Lazard Freres, Lehman Brothers and S G Warburg, the government's foreign banking advisers, estimates Indonesia ran a current account deficit in 1992-93 of Dollars 3.75bn, down from Dollars 4.35bn a year earlier. The deficit is forecast to fall further, to Dollars 3.2bn, in the new financial year. Economists estimate gross domestic product grew about 5.75 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 123bn. The report provides only partial succour for ministers defending the government's export-driven economic policy, which has led to a doubling of non-oil exports since 1988. The government's economic stance has been in doubt following a recent cabinet reshuffle which saw officials who support an import substitution policy gain ground. The government's external debt has continued to rise, despite its avowal to limit overseas borrowing. Public external debt totalled Dollars 47.8bn at the end of December, against Dollars 43.6bn at the start of the 1992-93 financial year. The report says the cost of servicing public external debt rose by 6 per cent to an estimated Dollars 7.2bn in 1992-93, and is forecast to reach Dollars 7.5bn in 1993-94. Debt servicing easily outstripped new aid from international donors, which amounted to Dollars 4.9bn last year. The report underlined, however, the importance of donor finance which enabled Indonesia to record a balance of payments surplus estimated at Dollars 1.5bn in 1992-93, against Dollars 1.2bn a year earlier. This allowed the central bank to increase foreign reserves which totalled Dollars 11.6bn at the end of December, up from Dollars 10.5bn at the beginning of fiscal 1992-93.</p>

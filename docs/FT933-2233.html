			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Observer: Muscovy movement The anglophile Russian ambassador to London, Boris Pankin, is reluctantly leaving at the behest of president Boris Yeltsin. A youthful 62, Pankin would have relished staying on but he is to return to his pre-diplomatic career as a writer and publicist. A graduate of Moscow State university who in his early 30s edited the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, Pankin became ambassador, first to Sweden and then in Prague. Almost alone among Soviet envoys, he condemned the 1991 putsch before its outcome was clear. His reward was a brief stint as Soviet foreign minister, before moving to London in 1991. But it has been clear for some time that Pankin, seen as an amiable but inactive ambassador, believed he had fallen from grace. Yeltsin is said to want to move Vladimir Lukin, his US ambassador, to another post - and needs an empty embassy. But the ambitious Lukin has so far refused the lesser London posting.</p>

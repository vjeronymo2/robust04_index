			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SINGING AS ELVIS 'NOT SO BAD'  </P> <P> Country singer Ronnie McDowell has made a good living as the voice of Elvis  Presley.  </P> <P> McDowell's latest job is doing the Presley singing on the new ABC series  "Elvis" (Michael St. Gerard actually portrays Presley) and he did three movies  before that. "I don't want to be stereotyped only as the 'Voice of Elvis' or be  accused of cashing in on a dead man," McDowell told TV Guide.  </P> <P> "But I've wound up doing that -- and it's not so bad. I feel I should be more  honored than disgruntled about it and I've decided to embrace it and have fun  with it.  </P></p>

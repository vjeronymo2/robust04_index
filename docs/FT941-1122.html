			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: HK property group rises 31% Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers controlled by the Kwok family, yesterday posted a strong rise in first-half profits and announced a higher dividend. Net profits rose to HKDollars 4.2bn (USDollars 545m) for the six months ended December, an increase of 31 per cent over the HKDollars 3.2bn of a year ago. The company, which derives about 65 per cent of operating profit from property sales, generated HKDollars 8.2bn in sales during the first half. Sales for the first three months of the second half were 'very encouraging,' the group said. Since July the group has acquired four sites with an aggregate developable gross floor area of about 1.4m sq ft. It owns 12.6m sq ft of investment properties throughout the colony. The rental portfolio was almost fully let, the company said. Its total land bank in Hong Kong is 40m sq ft SHK Properties received about HKDollars 4bn cash from the conversion of 1993 warrants in the fourth quarter of that year. Mr Walter Kwok, chief executive, said: 'The outlook for the property market in Hong Kong remains optimistic. Because of continuing strong demand for housing, residential property prices will stay firm. While local interest rates are heading upwards, moderate increase in the prime rate is expected to have only a minimal impact on prices.' Earnings per share for the six months rose 25 per cent to HKDollars 1.94. The directors are recommending a dividend of 53 cents against 45 cents in the first half of last year.</p>

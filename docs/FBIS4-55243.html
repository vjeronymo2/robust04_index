			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] The coordinated attacks by the united aggressors  have continued on the free Bihac territory last night and this  morning. The chetniks have unselectively and sporadically  shelled the defense lines on the Grabez front and the  Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, and in the Buzim area, where they  shelled villages.    Last night the outskirts of Cazin and Bihac were shelled.  This is the fourth day that the traitors from Abdic's  paramilitary have continued their savage attacks on the Cazin  outskirts, on Todorovo, and parts of Buzim.    Last night, and particularly this morning, fierce artillery  and infantry attacks have continued on the areas of (Pecigrad)  and Todorovo. The local secessionists are constantly aided by  the chetniks from the so-called Serbian autonomous region  Krajina, and there are many murderous chetnik mercenaries [word  indistinct] in their ranks. There have been many casualties in  the shelling, and the material damage is considerable.    The civilian authorities in the district, the members of the  5th Corps, and [word indistinct] from this region, in other  words, all the citizens, have again appealed to the Kladusa  people to resist these criminals in order to stop this war here  and [words indistinct].</p>

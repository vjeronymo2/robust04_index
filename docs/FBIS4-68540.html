And this is  despite the fact that the credit noose is forcing many farmers  to abandon the work they started. Since 1 November 1993,  punitive sanctions of up to 420 percent have been introduced for  failure to repay credits issued at the expense of centralized  resources.    At the very beginning of the agrarian reform, one of the key  ideas was the formation of a fundamentally new type of  agricultural enterprise--the peasant farm. A small peasant  farm,, managed by its owners and based on their labor, was to  become an alternative to large-scale production and the  epicenter of reform for the sector.    The Law "On the Peasant Farm" became one of the first acts  of  the agrarian reform. It has been 3 years since the new social  order was established by law, and today there are 270,000  peasant farms in Russia (See Table 1). Over these years, it  appeared that farming's development repeated the dynamics of the  agrarian reform itself. While 1991 may be called the year of the  sudden start and 1992 the year of the rapid growth of the  farming sector, 1993 saw a slowdown in the pace of forming new  peasant farms. Moreover, the number of farms discontinuing their  activity has begun to increase--as many disappeared in the last  3 months of 1993 alone as in all of 1992 (See Table 2).    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

However, the results of its development  over 3 years attests to the fact that the contribution of  peasant farms to overall agricultural production is increasing  (See Table 3). While there is an overall recession in  agriculture, production is expanding in the farming sector. For  example, the production of grain, sugar beets, meat, and milk  was roughly doubled and egg production increased by five times  as much on peasant farms in the past year. Over the past year,  which was extremely difficult for a sensitive sector such as  livestock breeding, the number of basic types of livestock  increased by 1.5 times as much on peasant farms, while it  continued to decrease on collective farms. So it is at least  premature to talk about reserves being exhausted in the farming  sector.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

This is its completely "healthy" reaction to the  extreme conditions in agriculture at present. Maintaining  production, and especially organizing new production, becomes  more like a feat in such a situation.    The sorest point today is financial survival. For the  peasant  farms, this is primarily a problem of the availability and  accessibility of loan capital. In 1993, short-term loans made up  about 56 percent of the peasant farms' production expenditures,  and long-term loans made up 58 percent of their capital  investments. The granting of credit to the farms has depended  almost entirely on state support. Centralized credit resources  were provided for them at favorable interest rates and budget  funds were allocated for credit guarantees.    However, the favorable conditions dwindled from year to  year.  According to data from the AKKOR [Association of Peasant Farms  and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], one peasant farm  received an average of 30,000 rubles [R] of loan capital in real  terms in 1991, R4,500 in 1992, and just R1,000 in 1993. In this  case, the credits simply had to be won back. For example, in  1992 the farmers were able to obtain most of the centralized  credits allocated for the year in December alone. It has become  harder and harder to gain access to long-term loans. Over the  past 3 years, the proportion of them in overall credit resources  being allocated has been reduced, and no loans for construction  were allocated in 1993 at all. The peasant farms' need for  long-term loans in 1994 is estimated at R2.1 trillion. This is  at a time when the government has planned to allocate R2.6  trillion for the entire agroindustrial complex. How much of this  sum will actually be transferred and how much will go to the  peasant farms?    There has also been considerable difficulty in providing  credit on favorable terms. Banks were compensated very late for  the difference between the favorable rate and the Central Bank's  prime rate. As a result, the banks simply refused to grant loans  on favorable terms or made up the difference at the farmers'  expense. The decision was made in September 1993 to discontinue  extending credit at favorable rates. While before this the  peasant farms paid for the credits provided from centralized  resources at the rate of 28 percent, this rate jumped up to 213  percent beginning in November 1993, and penalties of up to 420  percent were introduced for failure to pay back the amount owed.  By this time, the number of newly established peasant farms fell  to its lowest point, where it remained until the end of the  year, and the number of farms falling apart began rising quickly.    After the extension of credit on favorable terms was  abolished, the government promised to introduce alternative  measures of support. In particular, farmers were to be granted  the right to pay interest on loans received in 1992 and 1993  after the sale of their harvest. This deferment was ultimately  granted, but it was extended only to a small proportion of the  loans (about 10 to 20 percent), which could not alleviate the  farmers' financial situation substantially.    Budget appropriations to form the charter capital for  peasant  farm banks and insurance companies were another measure in the  federal program for supporting the peasant farms in 1993. They  were planned in the amount of R6 billion last year, but as a  result these funds were not allocated at all. Moreover, the  peasant farm banks are now in a very difficult situation, since  they have not been compensated from the budget for the  difference in the interest for farmers' loans in 1994.    So the peasant farms find thsmelves in a situation today in  which financing sources for development are simply becoming  inaccessible, the interest on their debts is eating up current  income, and state support is gradually being removed. There is  no reason to believe that the situation will change in the  foreseeable future, and we can expect the recession in the farm  movement to continue.</p>

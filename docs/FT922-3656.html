			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: New image set to revive dejected Turkish stocks - Market reforms It is not unusual these days for authorities at the Istanbul stock market to mount a surprise audit of one of the exchange's 110 brokers. It happened recently and Mr Imre Yigit of Global Securities, one of the brokerages affected, believes that the government is intent on setting an example as part of its new good housekeeping image. A new image is certainly needed. In the first four months of 1992, no emerging market slumped as much as Turkey's, according to the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector lending arm. The index yesterday was down on the day, but 40 per cent below its all time high of 5,749 on August 2 1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. Trading volume at around TL200bn is less than a third of the recent high point in January. Foreigners have all but departed the exchange floor, while local short-term investors are attracted to put their savings into gold or bank deposits. However, the government is now making a concerted effort to revive the market's fortunes. Amendments have been passed to the Capital Markets law, which seek to provide greater investor protection against insider trading and other offences. There are tax changes in place to reduce the attraction of holding treasury bills, and so stimulate equity trading. The reforms, which review the tax breaks enjoyed by holders of government paper, have already been approved by parliament and await the president's signature. A tender is also about to be issued to install a computer system in the markets's new Istinye premises, a convention hall once owned by the tourism ministry. Mr Yigit, head of research at Global, believes that the country is pulling out of recession and he expects share prices to follow. 'The market's cheap, which ever way you look at it,' he says. Inflation figures for May, published last Friday, have given added encouragement to that view and analysts now believe that the annual rate will settle at less than 60 per cent, down on the 70 per cent rate recorded last year. Industrial production in the first quarter was up 10.2 per cent and Global is projecting real profits growth for the market of between 10 and 15 per cent this year. However, most brokers are agreed that if the stock exchange is to take advantage of any pick-up in the economy, it will have to push ahead with its proposed reforms. Poor accounting is only one of the problems, ranging from insider trading and certificate forgery, to technical questions relating to settlement and clearance. Under the new law, it was suggested that shares held by company directors should carry special serial numbers in an effort to deter insider trading. Later, this proved impracticable to implement. Settlement, too, is a problem, particularly for foreign investors. Largely because of the lira's depreciation, the current system requires that brokers clear their trading account either by cash or physical stock delivery within one day. Brokerage houses frequently have to use their own resources to meet the settlement deadline on the behalf of their foreign clients. Forged share certificates, stolen certificates, even the use of shares impounded under court orders: these also remain major problems, despite the vigilance of publishing the serial numbers in the official daily list. A US consultancy has now been contracted to devise new settlement procedures  -the first step of which is to encourage brokers to pool more of their share certificates in a central depository. This would speed up clearance and reduce the incidence of forgery. If all goes well, the aim, once the market moves to its new premises and adopts fully computerised trading, is to have a paperless exchange.</p>

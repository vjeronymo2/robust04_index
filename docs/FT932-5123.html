			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: A poor excuse for an animal Sir, Is the 'pair of elephants made from TV sets and household gadgets' (photo caption, June 2) intended to insult the genuine articles which, thanks to our superiority, have now been driven to near extinction? Or is it part of an art genre that is meant to indict Britain's society for preferring to have poor (if clever) representations of our fellow creatures rather than the real animals?

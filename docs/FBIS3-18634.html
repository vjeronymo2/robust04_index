			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Bastien and Michel de Grandi: "France </F> Makes Aid for Algeria Dependent on Signature of an Agreement  With the IMF"]    [Text] On his way to the IMF, the Algerian economics  minister stopped off in Paris to sound out the intentions of the  French. However, France will wait for multilateral approval  before unblocking its bilateral credits.    Yesterday, on his way to Washington and IMF headquarters,  the  Algerian economics minister, Mourad Benachenhou, stopped off in  Paris, where he met with his French counterpart, Edmond  Alphandery. The meeting was described as "coming under the  rubric of usual consultations," between the two countries, the  Economics Ministry explained yesterday. Consequently, the  Algerian minister had an opportunity to report on the economic  situation in Algeria and, more importantly, on the difficult  discussions currently being conducted between Algiers and the  IMF.    As France has already emphasized since the Balladur  government took office, "France has reaffirmed its support for  Algeria," experts from the Economics Ministry reiterated  yesterday. In 1993, Paris awarded Algeria credits totalling  nearly 6 billion francs [Fr], 5 billion of which were commercial  credits (1 billion covering imports of cereals), and 1 billion  in balance-of- payments aid. However, the French Government  gave its assurance that new French bilateral credits will only  be set up when an agreement has been signed with the IMF.  Moreover, France has assured Algiers of its support among the  industrialized countries of Europe, with a view to mobilizing  "sufficient support from the international community" when an  IMF program has been launched in Algeria, the Economics Ministry  explained yesterday.    The caution displayed by the French Government, in a -- both  politically and economically -- particularly troubled time in  Algeria, is in fact motivated by the imminence of an agreement  between the International Monetary Fund and Algiers, which could  be forthcoming within the coming weeks. So far, the Algerians  have not succeeded in concluding such an agreement, due to the  extremely difficult social consequences of the IMF's demands  (devaluation of the dinar, liberalization of foreign trade,  budgetary rigor, privatization, etc.). However, observers  believe that the recent visit to Algiers by Michel Camdessus  appears to have pushed things along at the political level.  <H5>  Algiers in a Financial Impasse </H5>   Eagerly awaited for several months, this agreement would not  only unblock new IMF credits (Fr500 million in "stand-by" loans,  plus Fr300 million in aid for the balance of payments to offset  Algeria's reduced income from oil, or even an "extended  facility" in the coming months), and credits from the European  Union (worth nearly $1 billion), but would also open up the way  for the Paris Club to reschedule the Algerian national debt  ($13.5 billion out of a total of $26 billion). Both the  Algerian prime minister, Redha Malek, who returned to office one  month ago, and the country's new president, Lamine Zeroual, now  seem ready to accept the restructuring of Algeria's national  debt that their predecessors had always categorically rejected  -- on condition that this be done as "tactfully" as possible,  taking account of domestic policy and the international  financial markets.    Consequently, before it mobilizes new bilateral credits,  Paris -- which is a privileged partner of Algiers, but intent on  seeing some light on the Algerian horizon -- is waiting to see  what the new contributions to multilateral credits will be, and  possibly to see which concessions on the debt are granted by  Western governments.    As in past years, in 1994 Algiers is having to face up to a  new financial impasse. The drop in the price of oil will reduce  its revenue even further this year: revenue of $8 billion for  oil sales would represent a shortfall of $2 to $3 billion  compared with 1993. However, $9 billion -- the cost of servicing  the debt -- will remain exorbitant this year. All of which  comes down to saying that whatever the voluntary restrictions on  imports already decided by the government, the need for external  financing is estimated to reach $4 to $5 billion this year.</p>

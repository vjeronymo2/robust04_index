			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A mayoral task force in San Francisco has endorsed giving clean needles to drug  addicts to slow the spread of AIDS, but police and health officials said that  no such city program was likely without changes in state law. Police Chief  Frank Jordan said he supported such a program, but he added that the city could  not begin one now because state law bans giving needles to anyone without a  doctor's prescription. "We have to experiment with all kinds of creative ways"  to stop acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Jordan said. However, "it is quite  clear that it is a misdemeanor," he added. Public Health Director David  Werdegar said he was trying to determine whether he can get "administrative  permission" for starting a small-scale project that would allow the  distribution of clean needles to addicts.  </P></p>

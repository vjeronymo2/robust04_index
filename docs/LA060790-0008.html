			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> SHOWING THAT INDEPENDENT STREAK  </P> <P> Despite a low turnout, voters in Orange County displayed a fascinating mix of  sentiment on Tuesday. They recognized a shoddy argument, and they seemed more  willing than before to tax themselves for the common good, even as they  retained a fierce tradition of anti-tax feeling. Voters wisely and  overwhelmingly rejected Measure A, which would have required a new county jail  to be built in Santa Ana. It was a thinly veiled attempt to foist the  countywide jail crisis on one city, and voters had no problem seeing its  unfairness.  </P> <P> Proposition 111, which will raise the gasoline tax by nine cents in the next  five years, won statewide approval despite losing in Orange County by 52% to  47%. But that was a small enough margin to at least raise hopes that county  voters may be ready to approve a half-cent sales tax increase for urgently  needed transportation and transit projects. Another optimistic note was sounded  when voters approved Proposition 111's companion measure, 108, which will  provide bonds for passenger-rail and clean-air projects.  </P> <P> Last fall, a county sales tax measure went down by 53% to 47% -- a narrower  edge than ever before. If voters understand that local matches are required to  qualify for many projects that could be funded by Proposition 111, they will at  last follow in the footsteps of every other urban county in California in  approving a sales tax for transportation.  </P> <P> In some ways, Orange County was true to its conservative image -- with a  notable exception. It voted against every other bond measure --  homeless/housing, school facilities and earthquake rehabilitation (all were  approved statewide). But it voted for prison construction bonds, proving once  again it is tough on crime. Oddly, it joined voters statewide to defeat two  measures backed by the GOP as a way to wrest power from Democrats when new  district lines are redrawn in 1991. Local voters are at least showing  independence.  </P> <P> In local races, voters surprised three incumbents, who now face November  runoffs, and Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was defeated by Councilwoman Sally Anne  Sheridan.  </P> <P> What lies ahead? In Irvine, big changes. At the county level, Supervisor  Harriett M. Wieder and Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi deserve to retain their  offices in November. But the strong showing of John F. Dean in the race for  county schools superintendent showed that 24-year incumbent county Schools  Supt. Robert D. Peterson is out of step with needs of schools today.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- The new Slovak Government  which will emerge from early parliamentary elections in the  autumn will not be formed without the left coalition, Petr  Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), said in an  exclusive interview with CTK on Sunday [1 May]. "The left has  won in Poland, socialists in Hungary have excellent prospects  and it will apparently not be possible to rule without a  social-democratic bloc also in Slovakia," Weiss added.    Leftist tendencies in Central Europe have one indisputably  positive characteristic -- these parties are not nationalistic  and are capable of coming to an agreement and cooperate and thus  turn Central Europe into a region of stability and not of  potential conflict, Weiss said.    He admitted, however, that the prospects of the Slovak left  would also depend on the success of the current Slovak  Government of Jozef Moravcik. The new government will have  first of all to convince people that a businessperson has a  chance in this country and that it can be ruled without  conflicts and looking for an enemy, he said.    Weiss admitted that SDL's participation in ousting  ex-premier  Vladimir Meciar and mainly that party's coalition with the  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), its political antipole, had  caused some left supporters to ask questions, although, for  example in Austria, such a coalition has been functioning  successfully for a long time, he said.    However, people have already come to realise that it is  necessary and in the interest of the common good, to come to an  agreement also with a partner with whom we thought it impossible  to come to terms several months ago, said Weiss, referring to  the SDL's union with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH).  "Either both sides would again and again return to reproaching  each other or we would adopt a different philosophy. We should  not hate each other because we uphold different political values  and have different political programmes, competing for voters'  support," said Weiss, adding that he did not rule out that the  current coalition (of the SDL, the KDH and the Centrist Bloc  made up of politicians who separated from the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS] would continue also after the autumn  elections.    "However, we exclude the possibility of union with  politicians who base their policies on confrontation and harm  Slovakia's good image abroad and thus prevent foreign capital  from entering Slovakia. It is impossible to cooperate with  politicians who are not willing to observe a long-term  compromise with their political partners but who seek to impose  their will on them from a position of strength," Weiss said when  asked about the possibility of a coalition with Meciar.</p>

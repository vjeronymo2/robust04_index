			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 29 April </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] The cabinet will be weakened and its ability to  implement policies will decrease. The budget bill for fiscal  1994 will somehow pass the Diet, but it will be difficult to get  Diet approval for politically important policies. It is also  inevitable that the government's ability to deal with  negotiations with foreign nations will drastically decrease, and  consequently it will be more difficult for Japan to restore  relations with the United States.    It can be said the Hata government is short-lived, but the  situation wherein Japanese politics becomes effete will last for  some time. It is a matter of course that a decrease in the  politicians' ability to handle leadership leads to the  deterioration of the bureaucrats' ability. The bureaucrats do  their utmost when given tasks to carry out, but now they are  uncertain about what to do and cannot come up with clear  answers. In this situation, wherein the cabinet and the  administration loses their credibility, the role of the private  sector will become more important.    So far, the private sector has relied on the government to  take measures protecting certain business areas and assisting  the private sector as well as adopting an economic stimulus  package. From now on, they can no longer depend on the  government; in this sense, the private sector will have to take  the initiative in settling economic friction. Some analysts say  the bureaucrats oppose deregulation. But there is a voice within  the private sector which calls for maintaining current  regulations, thus hampering the bureaucrats' efforts to promote  deregulation. There are many problems the private sector can  settle, including an expansion of imports and the narrowing of  the gap between domestic and foreign prices. In a sense, the  private sector should lead the government in carrying out  policies, otherwise Japan's economy will stall.    Japanese politics is becoming ill; the present situation is  also troublesome to the United States. If the Japanese  Government is stable, the United States can make requests. On  the other hand, under the current situation wherein the  government is unstable, the U.S. Government will be in doubt  over what sort of calls it should make. Even if the Clinton  government wants to apply further pressure to Tokyo in order to  win the off-year election, Japan would not be able to come up  with any measures that could satisfy the United States, and  consequently the U.S. dissatisfaction with Japan will increase.  Meanwhile, Japan will be increasingly irritated by the U.S.  Government. Thus, bilateral relations could worsen even further.    If Japan should delay in taking action when certain  situations worsen--such as the unpredictable problem of North  Korea's suspected nuclear program--the United States may  possibly question Japan's attitude, asking: "Is Japan really an  ally?" In this way, while Japan will lose its international  status, its diplomacy will involve it in a serious situation.</p>

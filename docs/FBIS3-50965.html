It will also take the necessary surveillance measures  to protect utility installations.    Meanwhile, the Federal District Attorney General's Office  has  reported that dynamite was used in the car bomb explosion in  Mexico City Plaza Universidad Shopping Center on early Saturday  morning [8 January]. Specialized personnel collected samples at  the explosion site that consisted of metal fragments and  synthetic materials of the vehicle used in the explosion. The  study led authorities to rule out the possibility that a device  made up of powder only was used; residues of this material were  not found. Authorities also ruled out the use of a material  called anfo, which is composed of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil,  because residues of this product were not found either.    Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez spoke this Sunday  about security in Mexico City. Authorities from the capital met  on Sunday with residents of the capital's 16 political districts  to talk about security matters in Mexico City. In an auditorium  in Benito Juarez District, Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez spoke to  Mexico City residents and said surveillance operations in public  buildings, schools, and other areas have been intensified by the  different police corps.    [Begin Aguilera recording] The city is in peace. The city is  continuing to conduct normal activity.

Diego Balades, federal district attorney general, also spoke  during the event.    [Begin Balades recording] The mayor has said there is no  cause for alarm, and this is so. There is no reason to be  alarmed. We must simply remain in a state of alert. We are in  a state of alert, both society and authorities. The  authorities' cooperation is permanent and constant in Mexico  City, as well as in the entire country. [end recording]    Representatives of the various Mexico City districts also  participated in the meeting. Meanwhile, Mr. Sergio Fuentes, a  resident of Istapalapa, said the following:    [Begin Fuentes recording] We want to make it clear that we,  Mexicans, are used to living in peace. All of our differences  have always been resolved within the framework of the law.

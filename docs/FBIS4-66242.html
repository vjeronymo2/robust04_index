			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by You Huoqing (3266 3499 3237): "Fixed Quota </F> Purchasing of Cotton Will Certainly be Smoothly  Completed--Sichuan Province Prescribes Preferential Measures for  the Promotion of Cotton Production"]    [Text] The Sichuan party committee and the Sichuan  government have recently decided on a preferential policy to  promote cotton production. The particulars are:    1. In the case of cotton farmers, the system of fixed quota  purchases by contract shall be continued. Uniform purchases of  the cotton designated in the contracts shall still be effected  by the supply and marketing cooperatives (in districts with  fertile land and abundant harvests purchases may be entrusted to  the processing plants for improved varieties of cotton) and  there would be no harm in actually opening cotton markets. This  year's plan provides for 2.2 million mu of cotton acreage for  the entire province, with a the responsibility to buy a fixed  quota of 2.2 million dan.    2. According to a decision by the state council, Sichuan  province will again raise the purchasing price for cotton,  namely for each 50 kg of standard grade (grade 3, 27  millimeters) ginned cotton, last year's price of 330 yuan is  raised to 400 yuan. Price differentials for different grades are  also adjusted and raised by 6 yuan.    3. Redemption of [above-norm production] bonus sales of  chemical fertilizer and diesel oil shall be effected according  to the differential between parity prices and negotiated prices,  that is, with each purchase of 50 kg of ginned cotton an  allowance of 14 yuan shall be paid as differential between  parity prices and negotiated prices of chemical fertilizer and  diesel oil.    4. The provincial government has decided to continue to  uphold the cotton support policy; for each 50 kg of grade 1 to 4  ginned cotton purchased, a subsidy of 15 yuan shall be paid by  the provincial treasury.    5. Cotton that was grown without having been included in the  plan shall be fixed up within the provincial plan and shall be  treated equally without discrimination with regard to  applicability of policies.    6. The provincial finance administration's cotton support  policy for cotton farmers with regard to plastic mulch film  shall remain unchanged.    The Sichuan provincial party committee and the provincial  government also asked the banks, supply marketing cooperatives,  and other such agencies to ensure availability of funds needed  for cotton production and to ensure supply of agricultural means  of production. The official agricultural agencies must  conscientiously and effectively survey and report plant diseases  and insect pests and undertake preventive and curative action.  They must perfect the establishment of bases for the growing of  high-quality cotton. The provincial party committee and the  provincial government ask all localities to exert efforts to  fulfill and overfulfill the cotton quota procurement tasks of  the province, so as to raise Sichuan's cotton production from  out of its low state and to make increased production and  increased income a reality.</p>

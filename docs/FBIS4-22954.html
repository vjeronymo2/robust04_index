			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. A. Samchenko, Shimkent City Leasing First Aid </F> Hospital; UDC 368.06]    [Text] Health insurance is presently evoking not only  elevated interest but also serious debate among health care  workers, separating them into distinct ``pro'' and ``con''  camps. To some executives of the public health system, it is  first of all a source of additional financial resources needed  to improve health protection and to raise the effectiveness of  health care provided to the population. Others feel it to be the  logical culmination of the sector's transition to the new  economic mechanism. As I see it, both points of view have a  right to life.    Analysis of the numerous opinions, sometimes diametrically  opposed, shows that it would not be acceptable to duplicate  foreign health insurance experience in our republic.    According to WHO data, different insured health care schemes  are found in almost 30 countries, covering a total of over 800  million persons. In this case insured health care is not  developing in any one of them as an antipode to national public  health systems.    Our public health system, which evolved over the course of  many decades, doubtlessly has its positive sides. But at the  same time it is obvious not only that the firmly established  principle of residual financing, the extremely conservative  economic relations and the obsolete administrative structure are  totally inconsistent with the new laws of the marketplace, but  also that these factors are an obstacle to implementing the new  legislative acts adopted by the parliament.    The law ``On Protection of the Health of the People of the  Republic of Kazakhstan'' includes for the first time a section  presenting the fundamental principles of forming and developing  health insurance. However, the law ``On Health Insurance''  currently being examined at a session of the republic's Supreme  Soviet requires serious reform of the entire system of social  insurance, radical change of tax policy, and abandonment of the  practice of financing public health on the basis of the residual  principle; if these things are not done, it would be impossible  to make it effective.    Public health developed for a long time out of touch with  economic realities. As a consequence it lost all understanding  of the expense mechanism of its activity, of contemporary  quality standards, and of the real demand for resources.    The draft health insurance law foresees financing public  health through a balanced combination of budget and nonbudget  financing sources.    The very idea of attracting the resources of enterprises,  institutions and organizations, including to create insurance  funds, is not new. However, its implementation is encountering  certain difficulties today: There's the transition to market  relations, the need for added investments into production, and  the tendency for wages to rise.    Mandatory contributions by enterprises, institutions and  organizations to territorial health insurance funds will become  a nonbudget source of public health financing. The new tax is to  be computed as a percentage of the wage fund, which will  naturally have the effect of raising product cost. The magnitude  of this percentage that would satisfy all sides is a matter of  heated debate today. I propose a simple formula for determining  the mandatory insurance premium:    P = SR(100+n)/F,    where: P--the amount of the mandatory insurance premium (a  percentage of the wage fund);    S--mean annual cost of an optimum volume of health care  services rendered to one employee;    R--mean annual number of employees;    n--percent of overhead that would ensure profitable  operation  of the health insurance system;    F--annual wage fund.    In this case the mean cost of the optimum volume of health  care services rendered to a single employee over the course of a  year may be differentiated depending on presence of occupational  hazards and on the nature of the working conditions.    The proposed method makes it possible to carry out the  necessary computations both at the regional level and in  application to individual enterprises, institutions and  organizations, regardless of forms of ownership. Given  legislative establishment of a fixed percent of contributions to  the health insurance fund, the business entity could use the  procedure I propose to determine the adequacy of the means at  its disposal and the magnitude of the percent contributions to  the indicated fund.    Transition to a market economy and the accompanying  inflationary processes prevent any discussion of the specific  amounts that have to be appropriated today for the development  insurance programs. According to my calculations the amount of  the insurance premium for mandatory health insurance in South  Kazakhstan Oblast would have to be 14 percent.    Obviously when we implement the concepts of health insurance  we will have to determine the amounts of the insurance premiums  concretely on the basis of local conditions, and the  mathematical model I propose here will be an aid in doing so.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Italians redraw political map THE irreversible process of political change in Italy has been underlined by the results of municipal elections held on Sunday and Monday. Italian municipal elections mirror general election voting patterns and, with over 1m voters involved, this was a fair test of electoral opinion. The outcome has confirmed the decline of the traditional parties in favour of forces gathering a powerful protest vote, notably the populist Lombard League. The League, headed by Mr Umberto Bossi with his federalist anti-Rome platform, has become the largest party in northern Italy. If the municipal vote were translated on to a national scale in a general election, it would be the second largest party with close to 15 per cent of the vote. The once powerful Christian Democrats have seen their national vote fall from the general election level of 29 per cent, a historic low, to below 24 per cent. The Socialists have fared even worse with their share of the vote at 9 per cent, and half this percentage in the North. The political geography after the April general election showed Italy moving towards a broad division into three areas - the north with the League struggling for dominance; the centre, broadly controlled by the former Communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS); and Rome and the south in the hands of the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. The map is now far more complex. The League has consolidated its position on a larger scale in the north. In the key industrial cities of Monza and Varese, it has 32 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of the municipal vote, compared with 20 per and 27 per cent in April. Mr Bossi has also shown the League is a force in the centre, doing well in La Spezia and Viareggio. The PDS is under threat from its breakaway communist rival, Reconstructed Communism which is attracting a mix of the young and Marxist nostalgics. Equally significant, The Network (La Rete), the year-old clean government movement has proved it can win votes up and down the country. Although it has under 5 per cent of the vote, it has more than doubled its general election performance. The Network has stolen votes from Christian Democrats and Socialists as well as the Republican Party which had hoped to profit by distancing itself from the government. The Republicans' failure is part of a generalised voter disenchantment with all the old parties. The exception here is the neo-fascist, MSI, which has lifted its national vote by 2 per cent to over 7 per cent. Italy's political parties are more fragmented than ever. This will be emphasised as municipalities try to form viable alliances to run local administrations. The results have added urgency to the work of the 60 person joint parliamentary commission studying electoral reform and constitutional change. Without such proposals, it is hard to envisage early elections - even if the coalition government looks fragile. Prof Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, can argue with some justification that electoral disenchantment is with the parties in his coalition - not the government itself. Public opinion polls continue to show him increasing his popularity despite unpopular measures. Indeed, the disarray among the main government parties could be used to his advantage since the old guard, hostile to his privatisation proposals, will find it more difficult as a result of the municipal elections to sabotage him on this key issue.

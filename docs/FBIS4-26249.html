			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Adam Lee in Macao and Shirley Kwok] </F>   [Text] The remains of a six-storey factory in Zhuhai which  collapsed last week were blown up yesterday, despite fears 20  people were trapped in an adjacent pile of rubble. Zhuhai  authorities said the demolition was to prevent further accidents.    The official death toll from the collapse rose to 38 when  another 14 bodies were plucked from the three-storey debris.  The number of injured in Zhuhai's worst industrial accident  stood at "more than 160". A government spokesman said the  rescue would continue but was getting more difficult".    Fire swept through the Yu Xin Textile Factory in Qianshan on  Thursday and the front half of the building caved in the  following day after torrential rain.    Two hundred workers were inside, having been ordered back by  their joint venture Hong Kong bosses to retrieve the cotton  stock.    After nearly four days of digging, Zhuhai authorities  decided  yesterday to use explosives to demolish the remaining half,  fearing it could collapse.    The explosion was set off at 5.20 pm, 75 hours after workers  were buried. The walls cracked and the building folded in the  centre and disappeared in a cloud of dust.    Public Security Bureau officers and the People's Liberation  Army sealed off a 500-metre area and city authorities declared a  news blackout on the operation.    A group of 20 Hong Kong and Macao journalists and  photographers hid behind bushes about 300 metres from the scene  for more than two hours, but were discovered by a soldier and  expelled minutes before the explosion. Their film was  confiscated.    Hong Kong unionists last night criticised the authorities  for  ending hopes of survivors. Winnie Tam Pik-yan, executive  secretary of the 130,000-strong Hong Kong Confederation of Trade  Unions, said: "My God, how come the Government did that? How  about those still trapped?"    "There may be people waiting for help. Although the chance  of their survival gets smaller as time goes by, no one can deny  them the chance."    The Government should have waited at least a week before  blowing up the part of the factory still standing, she said.    Zhuhai officials said the explosion was "directional" and  would not affect the rubble where the missing workers were. An  official said bulldozers and heavy machinery would be brought in  today to remove debris.    Earlier, Zhuhai Municipal Government spokesman Yang  Shuisheng  said "about 20" workers were missing, but the chances of anyone  being alive were slim. The Government allowed relatives of the  dead mainly migrant workers from rural areas -- to identify  remains at the crematorium. Fourteen bodies were identified.    Most of the relatives were angry that the management had  sent  workers back into the damaged factory. Some shouted abuse and  gestured at management staff.    Relatives discussed compensation with the management but no  announcement was made.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Christopher cautions EC over Gatt: Europe seen as greatest obstacle to successful trade deal MR Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, reminded western Europe yesterday that the US attaches as much importance to economic co-operation as it does to improving the security partnership. In a speech prior to leaving on a trip to Hungary, Russia, the Baltics and three other former Soviet republics he identified the European Community rather than Japan and Asia as presenting the greatest obstacle to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations by the December 15 deadline. He acknowledged that none of the necessary trade-offs, especially in agriculture, would be easy but added: 'To our friends in Europe, let me restate that preserving common security across the Atlantic requires us to focus not only on Nato' but on the trade round, where the global economic consequences of failure would be 'very severe and dangerous'. Mr Christopher, under attack at home for his stewardship of US foreign policy in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, caused consternation in Europe at the weekend when he said Washington had for too long been too 'Eurocentric' and that western Europe should realise it was no longer 'the dominant area of the world'. While clearly nettled by recent European criticism, the secretary of state may also have been sending a call to the EC that he expected support from the continent to help sustain the US global role. At a dinner in Washington on Tuesday night, Mr Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, agreed that Europe needed to demonstrate such support. Mr Christopher also warned China that it might be difficult to justify extension of most-favoured-nation trading status next summer unless Beijing improved its human rights record, trade practices and co-operation on nuclear non-proliferation. Pressure from the US Congress was such, he said, that it was vital China demonstrated such progress in the coming months rather than next spring, 'so that there's not a huge build-up of pressure for us to lift the MFN'. However, attempts by Congress to impose more immediate controls over foreign policy appeared yesterday to be abating. The Senate easily defeated one Republican amendment that would have prohibited US troops from serving under the command of other nations in UN peacekeeping operations. It also appeared that Senator Bob Dole's proposed limits on any military intervention in Haiti was no longer a threat. The Republican leader, who has admitted that if he were president he would oppose his own amendment, was trying yesterday to modify his proposal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Chi Chae-won] </F>   [Excerpts] "... I have had inseparable ties with Korea  since my first visit in 1947." [passage omitted]    This is part of the address--delivered in Korean--by James  T.  Laney, 66, the new U.S. ambassador to Korea, at a "welcome  reception" held in his honor at Hyatt Hotel on 5 November. His  Korean was impeccable except that he pronounced "Hanguk" [Korea]  like "Hank'uk" and "yeoro kaji" [various or many] like "yoro  kaji." [passage omitted]    About 20 days later, on 2 July, the White House officially  announced the appointment of Laney. After the Senate  confirmation process, the new ambassador presented his  credentials to President Kim Yong-sam on 2 November. Thus, he  embarked on his ambassadorial activity 4 months after the White  House announcement. That day, President Kim asked him "when we  met in the past, did you think that someday I would be the  president and you would be the ambassador to Korea?" Ambassador  Laney responded, "I thought that you would someday be the  president but I never thought of myself to be the ambassador."  The president laughed.    The 5 November reception, held under the auspices of the  Methodist Church Headquarters of Korea, was attended by some 350  guests invited from political, business, Christian and academic  communities. [passage omitted] It was unusually quick that a  private-level reception in honor of a new U.S. ambassador was  held 15 days after his arrival and only 3 days after he  presented his credentials, and that it was attended by so many  "private" guests as well as public officials. [passage omitted]    Addressing the reception, Pyo Yong-un [Methodist Church  Headquarters Superintendent] said that "It was exciting when we  heard the news about Dr Laney--whom we love and respect--coming  as the ambassador." Expressing his hopes, Pyo stated that "Dr  Laney loves Korea and his relationship with us has a long  history. His arrival as U.S. ambassador to Korea means a  tremendous contribution to furthering friendship between the two  nations and to their attaining the common goal."    Among the guests that day were, from the Administration, Kim  Chol-su, minister of trade, industry and resources; Yi Min-sop,  minister of culture and sports; Hwang San-song, minister of  environment; Song Yong- tae, vice minister of the Unification  Board, and Yi Hong-ku, vice chairman of the Advisory Council for  Democratic Peaceful Unification, and from the political circles,  Assemblymen Yi Se-ki, Yi Chae-hwan, Son Hak-kyu and Pak Hui-pu  of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], Yi U- chong, Cho  Sun-sung, Pak Sil of the Democratic Party [DP], and Kim  Chong-kil, chairman of the United People's Party [UPP], Yun  Yong-tak and Yim Chun-won, independents. The guests also  included Yi Chol-sung and Min Kwan-sik, senior politicians; Yi  Tae-yong, director of the Family Legal Information Center; Cho  Kyong-hui, chief director of the Palace of Arts; Cho Sang-ho,  former minister of sports; Kim Yong-nae, former Seoul mayor; Yi  Yong-tok, chairman of the government's Public Officials Ethics  Committee, and Yi Se-chung, chairman of the Korea Bar  Association. The Rev. Mun Ik-wan and the Rev. Pak Hyong-kyu,  both chaeya [reformist camp] veterans, were also  present, drawing attention. Mun Ik-hwan has known Laney since  the 1960's when the latter was a missionary in Korea. "I am very  happy to have as the U.S. ambassador a person who knows about  Korea better than any other Americans," Mun said. [passage  omitted]    Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-sang, who some newspapers  reported was the prime mover for the gathering, was not present.  Explaining, he said that "for reasons involving the strained  North-South relations, I could not attend the reception. I  expressed my regret to the office of superintendent of the  Methodist Church Headquarters. I am sure that for our deep  friendship, Ambassador Laney would understand it."    Han drew most attention from media when the Laney  appointment  was announced. The relationship of the two dates back to the  early 1970's when Han was a chaeya activist and the  general manager of the Christian Professors Conference, a group  of critical intellectuals. He read a declaration on the state of  the country at a gathering held on 1 March 1975 to welcome Kim  Tong-kil and Kim Chan-kuk of the group who were just released  form prison. As he actively participated in pro- democracy  movements, the relationship deepened, Han says.    "It was my days of sufferings. I was arrested and detained  several times. With humane concerns for me in that situation, Mr  Laney did many things to help me. When I was taken into custody  again in 1980, he, then president of Emory U., led an effort for  arranging my U.S. visit. On my release in November that year, I  was invited to Emory U. as an exchange professor. I stayed on  until I returned to my position in Seoul National University  [SNU] in September 1984. During the years, Mr Laney looked after  my family, too, with the greatest possible care."    Deputy Prime Minister Han describes Ambassador Laney as a  "man of the oriental sense of love and humanity." In addition,  as his tremendous accomplishments for Emory U. show, Han says,  he is known for his outstanding administrative ability. As  ambassador, he will "play a great role in furthering Korea-U.S.  relations," he adds, "because he loves our country and has his  unique experience in contributing to its democracy."    Han saw Laney in July during his U.S. visit to attend an  information exchange meeting. At the time, Laney, then the  ambassador designate, reportedly said to Han that "From now on,  I will be working for the national interests of the United  States and you are in the position to work for the national  interests of Korea. But let's cooperate, relying on God's will."  Han, who is also a faithful Presbyterian, denied the reported  references to "national interests." They only shared  conversations on "cooperating for the peace, well-being and  unification of the Korean Peninsula," he said.    Pak Pong-pae, 62, president of Mogwon U., is known to have  done the actual work of arranging the Laney reception. A  graduate of MTC, Pak studied at Boston U., and later at  Vanderbilt U., taking his master's and doctor's degrees there.    Pak says: "I first met the Rev. Laney in 1959, when I was  living in a missionary's home to learn about American life to  prepare for my study in the United States. One day the  missionary told me that `a new missionary has come from the  United States. Let's go and see him.' That was Rev. Laney. I saw  him in the missionary's quarters called "Guest House" in West  Gate. We felt close friendship with each other the minute we  met. We have since been like real brothers."    On his return to Korea, Pak found a position as an MTC  professor. After serving as its rector, he became the president  of Mogwon U. He continued to invite Laney to Korea all these  years. [passage omitted]    On the relationship between President Kim Yong-sam and  Ambassador Laney, Pak Pong-pae says:    "President Kim visited Emory U., in 1984 or 85 in my memory.  I was then working there as an exchange professor. It was the  first time they met each other. Mr Laney invited President Kim,  then leader of an opposition party, to a dinner at his  residence. Also, under arrangements made by him, President Kim  made a speech to students under the title "Democratization of  Korea." When Mr Laney visited Korea in early 1990, he was  scheduled to see Kim Yong-sam, then chairman of the DLP but the  meeting did not materialize because the later was in Masan in  the aftermath of a political upheaval touched off by a  memorandum concerning the controversial cabinet system plan. I  understand that Ambassador Laney is deeply impressed by  President Kim's leadership and reform program."    Pak also said that he understands that Laney's relationship  with former DP President Kim Tae-chung has become increasingly  closer since the Kim Tae-chung kidnapping incident. Laney was  particularly concerned over the incident. Emory conferred an  honorary doctorate in law on Kim in June 1983. It also gave his  son, Hong-kol, an opportunity to study at the university. Deputy  Prime Minister Han Wan-sang's two daughters and former Rep. Mun  Tong-hwan's son also studied at Emory through the good offices  of Ambassador Laney. [passage omitted]    In terms of school ties alone, Yi Hong-ku [First Vice  Chairman of the Advisory Council for Democratic Peaceful  Unification] is closest to Laney. He was once Emory professor  and even received an honorary doctorate in literature. Moreover,  Yi served as chairman of the Yale alumni association in Korea  for 10 years. Yale is Laney's alma mater. [passage omitted]    According to him, Laney is "a liberal who has long been  showing a great deal of concern about democratization and human  rights." His arrival as U.S. ambassador, he says, should be  viewed as meaning the opening of a new era in Korea-U.S.  relations.    He continued: "Democratization, human rights, the Cold  War--all these things are over now. U.S. ambassadors to Korea in  the past were all specialists in security. The fact itself that  a scholar, not a career diplomat, was appointed to that post  shattered the tradition. As in the case of Mondale, the  ambassador to Japan, the Laney appointment suggests that the  U.S. Government attaches greater importance to Korea. Korea-  U.S. relations have entered a 'new era,' I believe."    Meanwhile, among Laney's circles of acquaintances in Korea,  there is a group almost unknown to the public but very  deep-rooted and thriving in every way. It is Club VV--VV stands  for veneratio vitae in Latin meaning "reverence for life." It is  a group of Christian students assembled to uphold the great  spirit of Dr Albert Schweitzer, who was a physician, missionary,  philosopher, musician and writer. Currently, its graduate  members alone number more than 900. In particular, all the  80-odd members from the early days are still meeting regularly,  they say. The representative of the graduate chapter is Prof.  Chon Se-il of Yonsei U., who is the director of the  rehabilitation clinic of the university hospital. [passage  omitted]    Laney, seeing the club as a kind of "spiritual movement,"  has  continued to show great interest in it since his arrival this  time. Chairman Chon Se-il explains that he is doing so because  the club's activities conform to his thought and philosophy.    Club VV has its office in Miju Plaza Building in Kuro-tong,  Seoul. They are said to be planning to start a new group led by  graduate members before the year-end.    The Laney network also includes the Korean Student Christian  Council (KSCC). Among its leading figures are O Chae-sik, former  director of the WCC [World Council of Churches] Third Bureau;  Kang Mun-kyu, YMCA secretary general; Pak Sang-chung, director  of the Korea Institute of Christian Social Affairs. [passage  omitted]    O Chae-sik, graduate of the SNU religious department, left  Korea together with the Rev. Laney in 1964, the latter's  sabbatical year. Then, they both studied in Yale U. graduate  school of theology, Laney in the doctor's course and O Chae-sik  in the master's. O continues:    "At the time, the Rev. Laney told me that he would not  return  to Korea at the end of his sabbatical leave. His judgement was  that churches in Korea had grown and no longer needed the help  of missionaries. He said that he would help Korea working in the  United States. And he kept his word."    On his return home 2 years later, O Chae-sik joined YMCA and  took part in the effort for the merger of KSCM and the YMCA and  YWCA college chapters. The three groups were finally merged and  KSCF (Korea Student Christian Federation) was born in 1968. O  Chae-sik became the head of its secretariat. Laney was greatly  helpful in this process, O recalled.    Subsequently, O Chae-sik served as director of the training  center of the Korea National Council of Churches (NCC-K) and  director of the international department of the Asian Council of  Churches. Then, after serving successively as the director of  the WCC Development Bureau and its Third Bureau in Geneva since  1988, he returned to Korea in June.    According to O, it is true that Laney greatly contributed to  the founding of KSCF but had no particular relationship with  WCC. He says:    "Even after he left Korea 30 years ago, the Rev. Laney has  always been with us. And he has shown more concern and affection  for the young people rather than the older generation. He always  inspired them with courage, helping them with all he had  whenever they needed help while expecting nothing in return. In  the past, he had close friends among Korean politicians and  chaeya personages, sometimes giving them a helping  hand. I believe that it was a natural thing for him coming from  his faith. As an ambassador now, he is assigned a political  role. I am hoping wholeheartedly that he will be able to fully  display his strength in that capacity, too." [passage omitted]    There is a joke in diplomatic quarters: "An ambassador would  not even tee off on a golf course without first getting an  instruction from his home government." The message is that all  ambassadors are expected to act as instructed by their home  governments and work in the interests of their respective  countries. As public attention is concentrated on the new U.S.  ambassador, Mr "L," a diplomat in active service, warns that  there is a need for people to view things in a more cool-headed  manner. A Korean worker at the U.S. Embassy also says that "the  arrival of a pro-Korean personality as the ambassador does not  mean a change in the basic U.S. policy or position." [passage  omitted]    The well known Laney network in Korea is apparently  dominated  by Christians. His acquaintances in political and business  circles are mostly Christians. Considering that he had been a  minister--he retired from clergy prior to taking his  ambassadorial post--and that he had worked as a missionary, it  is a natural outcome. But how he will cope with the fact will  also be noteworthy.    On the day he presented his credentials, there was an  anti-U.S., Molotov cocktail-throwing demonstration in Kwangju,  the first since the launching of the Kim Yong-sam government.  The unresolved nuclear issue and the remaining anti-U.S.  sentiment are the major tasks confronting Ambassador Laney.  [passage omitted]    As for the successive U.S. ambassadors to Korea in the past,  Koreans have a negative image of them all. The biggest reason is  that they behaved as if they were the "governor general" sent to  this country. The rulers of the military dictatorial regimes in  the past--which the people never recognized as truly  legitimate--were compelled to depend heavily on the United  States to keep their regimes in power, no matter whether they  liked it or not. Consequently, one cannot deny that they were  more or less responsible for the role of the U.S. ambassador  that "departed from its normal path." Any U.S. ambassador coming  to Korea--even if he was not an ex-CIA official--perhaps could  not but involve himself in interference with Korea's domestic  affairs and covert operations.    A known political figure says that the U.S. foreign policy  toward Korea has been "blank." What he means is that Washington  was barred from the normal conduct of foreign policy toward a  dictatorial regime and, as a result, Korea remained nothing more  than a military strategic region more under the sway of the  Pentagon rather than that of the State Department--and a void as  far as foreign policy was concerned.    The launching of the civilian government has, in effect,  paved the way for the office of U.S. ambassador to recover its  "normal" role. It means that Ambassador Laney's role will  inevitably be different from the one his predecessors played.  Therefore, it can be said that ratings on Ambassador Laney are  linked directly with the question of how much Korea will improve  its status as a U.S. foreign policy partner.</p>

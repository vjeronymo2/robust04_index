			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (9): Watch this (pricy) space - It's seconds out as Richard Garnier takes time to visit watchmakers GONE IS Lady Doodah's wristwatch, the one given to her by her doting husband years ago and carried off by the burglar last month. So, she who thought that little gold number would do for life, is forced to seek a new watch, or even two: one for evening; and one for day wear. And gone, too, is the notion of the watch for life, be it in steel, gilt-metal or gold. Many of us these days sport different models to suit our mood, pretentions and aspirations. Gone, too, is the 1950s complicated calendar watch to the dealer at the back of the room - who will, of course, sell it to a vintage watch collector. But not gone, very much thriving, is the desire for the latest models. We could all and, at some stage probably do, wear a classless Swatch - be it plain, chronograph or automatic type - but let us look at luxury watches as it is these personal statements that reveal so much. As with much luxury buying there are cult forces at work and so let us try and establish who buys . . . and for whom. 9am. Lady Doodah, making an early start, is through the shop door within minutes of opening time. Her quest for a replacement gold watch, small and neat, traditional yet beautiful, is answered by a Baume &amp; Mercier's gold quartz bracelet watch at Pounds 2,990. 9.30. Almost as early is Camilla, swept in by her mother 'never be able to park otherwise, darling', to find a watch of suitable elan to carry her through the vicissitudes of the Season. They are instinctively drawn to Cartier and the tank watch - in vermeil (silver gilt) at Pounds 700. The origins of this design go back to the tanks of the First World War, although Camilla may not realise this, whereas her brother, Max, a graduate trainee in the City has already been attracted by the conscious revivalism of the Bill centenary watch, resurrecting original Bill designs of the 1930s - priced in a range of six designs from Pounds 1,900-Pounds 2,500 in gold - but he went for the steel range at Pounds 445-Pounds 795. 10. On his way to opening his own shop, Miles a successful antiquarian book dealer, is guided towards a marque with style and history. Breguet, founded in 1775 by the greatest watchmaker ever, fits the bill with its recreation of 19th century pocket watch models as modern wristwatches. He plumps for a gold automatic moonphase, calendar strap watch at Pounds 15,450, with the indicators placed eccentrically on the finely engine-turned silver dial. 10.30. Brad, the north-American yachtsman, hoves to but needs no steering towards his choice of a Corum Admiral's Cup bi-colour automatic strap watch with tidal indication for Pounds 3,905. 11. Just as unmissable in a camel coat and slick suit is Winston, on the up and needing a watch to complement his gold jewellery. He decides to pass on a Rolex Oyster day-date watch with a diamond-studded dial at Pounds 10,545, in favour of a Cartier Panther diamond bezel black-dialled quartz bracelet watch at Pounds 12,500. 11.15. Avuncular Archibald has arrived by appointment with only 10 minutes to spare in his busy schedule. He is choosing the watch that he will be given on his imminent retirement as chairman of the board. He is seeking the equivalent of his father's gold half-hunter and settles on a Patek Philippe plain Calatrava with its craftsmanship, quality and unsurpassed performance  -an heirloom for the future at Pounds 4,325. 11.30. But in no hurry to decide is His Excellency the Chief from Nigeria. His choice narrows eventually between a gold Rolex with diamond bezel and diamond pave bracelet at Pounds 35,385 and a white gold and diamond set, black opal dialled, bracelet watch at Pounds 73,710 by DeLaneau. Midday. On his way to lunch, Freddie an ebullient 18-year-old from Chelsea, is here to scout out what's what after passing his A-levels. He selects a Rolex Oyster Automatic steel bracelet strap watch at Pounds 1,430. 12.30pm. Norman and Patsy, both keen golfers, are in to buy his 'n' hers watches to celebrate their improving handicaps. They are naturally attracted by the sportif Ebel range, but choose the Senior Sport quartz bi-colour watches at Pounds 1,200 (his) and the similar ladies sports watch at Pounds 1,050 (hers). 1.15. Arriving in a taxi is the Brigadier to get a new battery quartz for his 18 carat Omega Deville quartz watch on a strap (price Pounds 875) which had attracted him originally because of its clear dial with sweep secondhand and date. 1.30. Marc, the young City dealer, is in to get a Tag Heuer GMT professional watch, waterproof to 200 metres and advertised as for those who 'Don't crack under pressure' in gold plate on a leather strap at Pounds 475. 2. Monty, on his way back to Harley Street, has been consulting at the hospital all morning. He appreciates IWC's quality and understated design linked with total functional reliability but in the brief time he has available cannot yet decide between two perpetual calendar strap watches: a Novecento yellow gold rectangular watch at Pounds 10,800 and a circular white gold Da Vinci chronograph stop watch at Pounds 12,000. 2.30. Chris, on his way back to his City desk from lunch, fancies himself as an outdoor type. His peers will appreciate his choice of a Breitling Chronomat, tachometer chronograph, blue faced and blue sharkskin strapped in steel and gold at Pounds 1715. 3. Helen is being treated to a sumptuous 25th wedding anniversary present and is immediately ravished by Blancpain's classic mechanical strap watch in combinations of precious gems at Pounds 57,450 because it will complement her existing jewellery so well but decides to contain herself to a Pounds 17,900 'Bagnoire' automatic bracelet watch by Cartier with triple-row diamond brilliant bezel. 3.30. Norma, who has rather more immediate needs, having just won the pools in a big way, loses her heart to a fantastic gem-set watch by Piaget at Pounds 208,875; the diamond pave dial surrounded by marquise diamond petals extending into the flexible emerald bracelet. 4. Sapphire, recently flown in from LA to appear on a television chat show, just loves Rene Boivin's range of 'Chrysallis' watches on coloured crocodile straps which transform from day watches into jewelled cocktail watches by means of a sliding movable segment round the bezel. She goes, of course, for a sapphire-set example at Pounds 12,345. 4.30. The shop is full of shortish dark men in dark suits. From their midst emerges Sheik Mehmed, just returned from his success in the Breeders' Cup in California to buy a present for his trainer. His choice falls on the timelessly elegant, fashionably revivalist, yet understated rose gold automatic power reserve strap watch by Vacheron Constantin at Pounds 6,550. 5. Risking parking on the double yellow lines outside the door, Simon rushes in to choose a watch for his wife, Jane, who has just given birth to their third child. His attention is caught by an Asprey gold watch with diamond bezel and diamond dots for the numerals, on a black crocodile strap at Pounds 3,395. 5.15. With an eye for lasting quality, Paris, a fine art publisher, makes his aesthetic choice a second-hand quality watch - a Patek Philippe yellow gold watch from the late 1940s at Pounds 5,800. 6.30. The guests for the Christmas customer evening are arriving. Jonathan, now married to someone richer than himself, is being cajoled into upgrading his old Rolex for a Patek Philippe Calatrava with hobnail bezel at Pounds 4,935. Aimee, perhaps not so permanently attached, is being pressed by her ardent companion to accept a Happy Diamond quartz strap watch by Chopard at Pounds 1,920. Three freely spinning diamonds can move about in the glazed zone between the diamond-edged dial and outer bezel. Kevin, aglow with the success of his latest deal, originally had in mind an image-conscious gold Rolex Oyster day-date bracelet watch (Pounds 9,335), but was seduced by the class of the uniquely styled Garrard 150th watch, limited to 150 pieces and presented in a sterling silver box, celebrating the royal appointment as Crown Jewellers 150 years ago, for Pounds 10,550 in gold. Jo, media personality, single and 30-something, carries off a Jaeger-LeCoultre smaller man's sized bi-colour mechanical Reverso strap watch. Launched in 1931 it epitomises trends in watchmaking, giving homage to the past, proving that good design is enduring and that luxury was never transient.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Almost a month after the appointment of a prime  minister, Togo is still without a government. Prime Minister  Edem Kodjo, who has been snubbed by his opposition friends, has  still not been able to form his government. This situation is a  source of concern for Togo's donors, especially, the World Bank,  which would like the new institutions to be set up quickly  before reviving negotiations with international institutions.  Olabire da Cruz reports from Lome:    [Begin da Cruz recording] After two separate meetings with  Prime Minister Edem Kodjo and President Eyadema on 18 and 19  May, the World Bank executive director for Togo, Mr. Jean-Pierre  Noboude, said that he would like to see the institutions  established quickly in order to have specific officials to talk  to before new agreements are signed. According to Mr. Noboude,  this should be done by the end of this month or at the beginning  of June at the latest so that the country can benefit from some  20 billion CFA francs to be allocated, essentially for urban  development and the procurement of drugs by the Health Ministry.    For the people, Mr. Noboude's statement seems to be an  answer  to its SOS call to politicians to help them deal with the  numerous problems resulting from the protracted sociopolitical  crisis and the recent devaluation of the CFA franc. When is the  government going to be formed? This is the question on the lips  of Togolese, who are increasingly worried that possible aid  might pass them by because of the institutional void which some  people hope will be filled within the next few days or even  hours.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US producers seek big CIS aluminium cut THE US ALUMINIUM industry yesterday urged its government to negotiate an immediate cut of 1.1m tonnes in Commonwealth of Independent States' aluminium production and for CIS exports of the metal next year to be held at a maximum of 500,000 tonnes. This request was delivered ahead of multilateral negotiations in Washington next month between some of the major aluminium-producing countries. The US Aluminium Association said that during the past 16 months 700,000 tonnes of annual capacity had been curtailed in the US and 5,000 workers laid off because of problems caused by a surge in CIS exports from 250,000 tonnes in 1989 to a projected 1.6m tonnes this year. Mr Richard Holder, the chairman of the association, said that, because CIS domestic demand was so weak, production cuts were 'the only feasible means' of achieving export targets. Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World Metals, said to be the largest trader in CIS aluminium, claimed, however, that 'Russian production has not increased, it has just been switched from domestic military applications to export'.</p>

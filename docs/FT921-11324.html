			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Garden festival may raise Pounds 50m MORE THAN Pounds 50m of investment in private housing, offices and small industrial plants is expected to be created on the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival site after the event closes in October. The Prince of Wales, who is to open the festival on May 5, will be associated with the development through the creation of an urban village. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that the project should create 1,100 jobs in the south Wales valley, an unemployment blackspot since steelmaking ended in the 1980s. Ebbw Vale will be the last festival, following those held at Liverpool's docklands, Stoke-on-Trent, Glasgow and Gateshead.</p>

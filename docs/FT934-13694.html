			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong pauses after 20.9 per cent surge SHARE prices remained almost flat after a volatile session dominated by public fund and arbitrage buying and profit-taking by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 2.30 at 20,069.91 after a low of 20,042.40 in the morning and a high of 20,204.02 in the afternoon session. The index firmed immediately after the opening on public fund buying, and declined thereafter before rising again on purchases by arbitrageurs. After peaking in the afternoon, dealers, who built up long positions together with buying by public funds, liquidated positions as other institutional investors were reluctant to follow suit. Volume was 208.7m shares, against 218m. Losers led gainers by 595 to 323, with 244 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.23 to 1,644.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.71 to 1,280.94. Traders said that while investors were unwilling to take short positions by sell-ing stock, many were still reluctant to buy shares due to the prolonged recovery of the economy. Financials, telecommunications and non-life insurance stocks were the leading losers of the day. Profit-taking left Daiwa Securities down Y40 at Y1,400 after having been recently bought on its upward revision of interim earnings. Other brokers also weakened, with Nomura Securities receding Y40 to Y1,990 and Nikko Securities Y10 to Y1,200. The telecom sector, which had risen on the merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc in the US, lost ground. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y16,000 to Y894,000 after three consecutive days of gains, and DDI slipping Y50,000 to Y6.73m on the second section. Other telecom linked issues were also easier, with Oki Electric, the day's most active issue, down Y1 to Y562 and Fujitsu losing Y4 to Y863. Entertainment related stocks retreated on reports that police were investigating Heiwa, a pachinko (Japanese pinball) machine maker listed on the second section, for illegally modifying its game machines. Heiwa fell Y140 to Y4,100 and Sega Enterprises, which supplies electronic games to Heiwa, lost Y30 to Y9,870. Konami, another video machine maker, declined Y130 to Y3,870. JR East linked stocks gained ground. Nippon Signal rose Y30 to Y1,510 and Kyosan Electric, another railway signal maker, firmed Y10 to Y1,280. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 45.84 to 22,199.95 in volume of 17.5m shares. Roundup MANY Pacific Rim markets took a pause after the record-breaking runs of recent days. HONG KONG gave up 1.9 per cent after the bull run that has seen a cumulative rise since September 28 of 20.9 per cent. The Hang Seng index relinquished 169.72 to 8,861.41 in turnover that dipped to HKDollars 9.04bn from Monday's record HKDollars 10.20bn. Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel commented that the market had begun to look vulnerable to a short-term consolidation when the index breached the 9,000 level. However, he believed that US and Japanese investors remained enthusiastic and would continue to provide liquidity for a further advance. MANILA declined for the first time in eight days, the composite index shedding 28.96 to 2,158.99 as PLDT lost 30 pesos to 1,820 pesos. TAIPEI fell 2.3 per cent in reaction to news that the Finance Ministry and ruling party legislators had agreed to delay consideration of a stock transaction tax cut until January. The weighted index ended 91.92 off at 3,970.18. AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by industrial stocks and a weaker futures market. The All Ordinaries index slipped 10.0 to 2,075.5. SINGAPORE saw an end of the record-setting run of the previous six sessions after heavy selling of Malaysian stocks traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 7.88 at 2,108.26. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded strongly during the afternoon as investors returned to seek bargains after Monday's falls. The composite index closed 11.63 ahead at 926.16. BOMBAY traded higher in a special trading session after the resolution of the brokers' strike which had kept the market closed for the previous four trading days. The BSE 30-share index added 9.37 at 2,720.29. KARACHI rose sharply in response to Ms Benazir Bhutto's return as prime minister, writes Farhan Bokhari. The KSE-100 index advanced 16.58 to 1,450.33. Ms Bhutto is expected to continue with a recent package of economic reforms which was introduced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim premier.</p>

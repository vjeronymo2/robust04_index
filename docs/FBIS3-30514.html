			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar; place </F> and date not given: "The Prime Minister About Relations with the  President" -- reprinted from an undated issue of EXTRA SLOVENSKO  weekly in the "Who, What, Where -- Said, Wrote" column]    [Text] On the whole, I can say that we, with Mr. President  [Michal Kovac], have working relations, and I do not believe  that we have different political objectives. I am afraid that  the president is not the only person responsible for the tense  atmosphere. Do you want an example? We used to share a box in  the Slovak National Theater and it did not bother anyone.  Suddenly, however, some people came from the Chancellery of the  President of the Slovak Republic maintaining that the prime  minister and the parliament chairman [Ivan Gasparovic] have no  place in the box. (By the way, I used it only on the occasion of  the funeral of Roman Zelenay because I simply do not have time  for such perfunctory actions). Eventually, they came up with  the idea that the box would have three doors. It was not  technically feasible. Thus, they arrived at the idea that the  president must have a higher chair. I replied with a  recommendation that they do not raise the president's chair, but  rather saw off the legs of the chairs for Gasparovic and  myself.... The staff of the Chancellery of the President  determines the flow and content of information reaching his  person. The later the president realizes this, the worse for  him. A more fortunate solution for the president would be the  employment of nonpartisan, neutral experts. I will not give any  details regarding the reason for the current state of the  president-prime-ministerial relations at this time, although  they are obvious not only to me, but also to the president and  the parliament chairman. We are in complete agreement with Mr.  Gasparovic.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NUNN FOR THE MONEY;  </P> <P> IBF MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION WITH CELEBRITY FOLLOWING TO BATTLE ITALY'S KALAMBAY  FOR $1.1 MILLION PURSE  </P> <P> In distance, Johnny Tocco's gym is just two miles off the Las Vegas Strip. But  in mood, it might as well be two light years away.  </P> <P> No gaudy lights here. No clanging of slot machines.  </P> <P> Just the dull thud of fist on punching bag in a softly lit room dominated by a  ring.  </P> <P> The smell of sweat fills the air and fight posters fill the walls, mute  testimony to the many past greats who have toiled here.  </P> <P> One of the greats of the present, International Boxing Federation middleweight  champion Michael Nunn, has been working here this week, moving around the ring  under the admiring gaze of his Ten Goose Boxing Club handlers -- his manager,  trainer, adviser and publicist -- and a seemingly unassuming middle-aged man,  casually dressed in shirt, slacks and tennis shoes, who looks excited merely to  be here.  </P> <P> Just another fan?  </P> <P> Well, yes and no. A fan he is, but Gene Hackman is not just another anything.  Already an Academy Award winner, Hackman is facing another Oscar showdown for  Best Actor on Wednesday with Dustin Hoffman, a battle of Hollywood  heavyweights, but that seems to be the last thing on his mind.  </P> <P> He has chosen to spend all of pre-Oscar week by the side of his favorite  fighter as Nunn prepares to defend his title at the Las Vegas Hilton tonight  against Sumbu Kalambay of Italy.  </P> <P> Hackman isn't the first actor to sit ringside for a fight, but when you see him  sitting ringside while Nunn jumps rope, does stretching exercises and shadow  boxes, you realize we're talking hard-core fan here.  </P> <P> "I saw Muhammad Ali, then Cassius Clay, as an amateur," said Hackman, his arms  leaning on the ropes, his eyes on Nunn, "and this guy reminds me of him. He  moves so well. He's a great athlete, but also a real dancer. A phenomenon.  </P> <P> "I can relate to what he does because there are similarities to what I do for a  living. The real champions have a sense of performance. They can rise to the  moment, get the adrenaline flowing and perform. The difference is, they do it  out of instinct. Actors have to be taught to do it."  </P> <P> Hackman seemed almost embarrassed about his fascination with Nunn in particular  and boxing in general.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I'm appalled at how much I like boxing," he said. "I guess we all  are."  </P> <P> Hackman is only one of the actors in Nunn's corner. Mr. T is a fan. So are  Michael J. Fox, James Caan and Victor French, the first of Nunn's celebrity  supporters.  </P> <P> Nunn's image has become irreparably linked with these stars. He lives in North  Hollywood, but the prefight ads call him Hollywood's Michael Nunn. He lives in  a new condominium, drives a Mercedes recently given to him by promoter Bob Arum  and will receive his first seven-figure purse tonight, earning $1.1 million for  the Kalambay fight.  </P> <P> A national boxing magazine made Nunn its cover boy this month and called him  "pound for pound the best fighter in the world," a description reserved for  years for Sugar Ray Robinson.  </P> <P> Michael Nunn, you've come a long way, baby.  </P> <P> A journey of a thousand miles, Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu said, must begin  with a single step.  </P> <P> But in Nunn's case, his journey to fame and fortune began with a couple of  missteps.  </P> <P> The product of a poor neighborhood in Davenport, Iowa, Nunn found solace in the  ring, away from the rough crowd he ran with.  </P> <P> He concluded a brilliant amateur career (168-8 with 75 knockouts, two Junior  Olympic titles and a second-place finish in the national Golden Gloves) in the  1984 Olympic Trials.  </P> <P> Nunn failed to make the U. S. team, winding up as an alternate when he lost to  Virgil Hill.  </P> <P> So where did that leave him? The next logical step would be to turn pro.  </P> <P> But Nunn thought that it might be a misstep.  </P> <P> He returned home and met with Bob Surkein, a former head of the Amateur Boxing  Federation, a longtime amateur referee, and, as a Davenport resident, the man  who had seen the potential in Nunn back when he started boxing at 13.  </P> <P> "When I first spotted him," Surkein said, "I saw the new Cassius Clay-the  speed, the reflexes, the infectious grin. He moved beautifully and he just  looked like an athlete."  </P> <P> After Nunn lost in the Olympic Trials, he came to see Surkein.  </P> <P> "What are you going to do now?" Surkein asked.  </P> <P> "Well," Nunn replied, "I'm going to hang around Davenport and get a job."  </P> <P> Surkein just shook his head.  </P> <P> "What do you mean, 'Get a job?' " he said. "Doing what? Selling drugs? Robbing  banks? Mugging old ladies? Look, when you're ready to turn pro, I'll put you in  with the right people and they'll look out for you."  </P> <P> Nunn wasn't convinced.  </P> <P> "As a kid," he said, "I fought because I was good. I never did it looking to a  professional career. I just did it to pass the time and keep out of trouble.  </P> <P> "After the Trials, I had a lot of people telling me, 'Why don't you box as a  pro?' I said, 'I don't want to do that.' They said, 'Man, you just going to sit  around here and do nothing?' I said, 'I guess so.' "  </P> <P> And he did. But not for long.  </P> <P> "Well, Mike," Surkein once said when Nunn dropped by for a visit, "there are no  jobs here in the community. The only thing you can do is get into trouble. You  have got two options: Stay around here and take a chance on going to the  penitentiary. Or pursue a boxing career."  </P> <P> Surkein made an offer. "Look, Mike, what's three years? Give me your best for  three years," he said. "By that time, we'll know where you're going."  </P> <P> Which was more, Nunn conceded to himself, than he knew at the time.  </P> <P> "I got to thinking," he said. "What the hell. What's three years? I'm still  young. I wasn't but 21 at the time. . . . Why not go for it?"  </P> <P> Having decided on a course, Nunn needed a starting point.  </P> <P> Surkein had met Dan Goossen at the Trials and was impressed. The North  Hollywood salesman was struggling to start a boxing operation in North  Hollywood with the help of some of his nine brothers and sisters.  </P> <P> "I was looking for more than just a business arrangement for Mike," Surkein  said. "I wanted people who would make him the star of their stable. I saw  closeness in the Goossen family and I saw evidence of people willing to try."  </P> <P> Surkein and Nunn flew out to the Valley, checked out the Goossens' makeshift  gym on a North Hollywood cul-de-sac, and decided to go for it.  </P> <P> At least Surkein did.  </P> <P> Returning to Davenport to pack, Nunn still had doubts about leaping into this  strange new world.  </P> <P> "Michael didn't have confidence in himself," Surkein said. "He was afraid to  move out on his own to an area he had never been to in his life. It was a big  change and he was scared.  </P> <P> "But he couldn't stay in Davenport and train. There were not enough sparring  partners. And he didn't train hard enough there. I used to say he was the best  two-round amateur I'd ever seen. Besides, it wasn't good for him to stay in  Davenport because he had the wrong kind of friends there."  </P> <P> Three times Surkein made plane reservations for Nunn to return to California  and three times Nunn failed to show.  </P> <P> The third time, Surkein blew up.  </P> <P> "You've missed your flight again, Mike," Surkein said by phone. "We're through.  I can't go through this anymore.  </P> <P> "Goodby."  </P> <P> Click.  </P> <P> Nunn called back. He'd go.  </P> <P> That was nearly five years ago. Nunn has since won all 32 of his pro fights, 22  by knockout, along with the IBF title.  </P> <P> He has gone from prelim fighter to marquee name, from $1,500 a fight to  tonight's big payday.  </P> <P> "But with all his success," Surkein said, "he's kept his feet right on the  ground. He hasn't changed."  </P> <P> Indeed, Nunn may wear a better cut of cloth these days, but he hasn't forgotten  the cloth he was cut from, his roots.  </P> <P> No army of followers for him, no fleet of cars, no ton of gold trinkets around  his neck, no Robin Givens.  </P> <P> In July, Nunn will marry Loretha Boyce, his Davenport sweetheart of a decade.  </P> <P> "We've been together for a long time," Nunn said. "She's been with me since the  time when I didn't have nothing, when I just thought about being champ."  </P> <P> After every fight, Nunn returns home to Davenport to visit his mother Madies,  his brother Willie, and boyhood friends like Danny Don and John Haines. He even  stays with Don and Haines on occasion.  </P> <P> "They idolize me," Nunn said, "but when I get together with them, I don't have  to put on a show. In some ways, they look at me now like I'm from another  planet. But because I respect them and they respect me, we have remained close  friends."  </P> <P> Only once has Nunn strayed from his new life. Last year, he got involved in a  fight in a Valley restaurant that allegedly was started by a friend of his. The  case was settled out of court and no charges were pressed.  </P> <P> It was a sharp reminder of the life he could have had.  </P> <P> "I thank God that Bob Surkein existed," Nunn said. "I thank God that I listened  to him. Otherwise, who knows what I would be now. There are so many temptations  out there -- selling drugs, robbing banks. Thank God I got away from so many  things in my community."  </P> <P> Nor, insists Nunn, is there much danger he'll slip back or be attracted by the  new temptations fame and fortune have brought his way.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to be somebody I'm not," he said. "I'm not really into material  things. I'm going to buy my mother a big house after this fight, but that's  about it. I can do without the rest of it. I just don't get caught up in it.  </P> <P> "I can handle all this stuff as long as I keep positive people around me.  </P> <P> "Besides, if I changed, my mother would kill me. All this stuff is future shock  for my family -- seeing me on TV, people coming up and asking for autographs,  businessmen trying to get close to me. You don't find too many celebrities in  our background. My Mom says, 'It's only my son. What's everybody tripping out  on.' If she ever saw me change, she'd grab me by the neck and yank me back to  reality."  </P></p>

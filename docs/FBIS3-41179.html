Our readers have read about  them here, and we have been informing them about the activities  of these enemies of humanity. We have been receiving letters  from inside and outside the country complaining that we were not  writing enough against these elements. One of these letters is  from Mr. Manzoor who has written us from Norway. While  governments and officials now and then proclaim their strength,  the fact remains that these elements [drug dealers] have set up  shadow governments in almost every part of the world, and it is  quite easy for them to wipe out humanity from the face of the  earth. Even today, there are individuals including members of  legislative bodies who are engaged in drug dealing, but the  government is powerless to bring them to justice. A former  minister and major drug dealer, Amanullah Kandi, was convicted  in a Karachi court, but to this day it is not clear how he was  transferred from Karachi jail to the central jail of Dera Ismail  Khan, his native town, and who had a hand in helping him escape  from that prison. Recently, a journalist went to interview him,  but the journalist's camera and the tape of the interview were  confiscated by government officials. In spite of strong  reassurances by the government, Kandi has eluded capture.    Meanwhile, Peshawar high court's full bench has thrown out  the appeal entered against the disqualification of Rahnuma Nadir  Khan Zaka Kheel running against National Assembly Speaker Gauhar  Ayub Khan from Haripur precinct NA13, and the disqualification  of Mehmand Agency's Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand (former MNA) accused  of drug dealing, and of Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan. These  individuals had been barred from participating in the elections  by the returning officials and later by the election appellate  tribunal. Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand and Haji Ibrahim Khan were  arrested by the local police on charge of selling drugs and  these two individuals are still in jail. The full bench  consisted of justice Abdul Karim Kandi; justice Sayed Ibni Ali;  justice Abdul Rahman Khan; justice Khiar Khan and justice Mian  Mohammad Ajmal. The candidacy papers filed by petitioner Sayed  Sultan Shah were rejected because he did not pay the money owed.    The [candidacy] papers of Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel who was a  candidate for the national assembly from Khyber Agency were  rejected on grounds that he had fought against government  officials during construction of Qamar road in Tirah and had  harmed national security; he was barred from running in the  elections. National Assembly hopeful from Mehmand Agency, Haji  Qadar Gul Mehmand and Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan, who  were charged with drug dealing, had their papers rejected and  were barred from participation in the elections. The two men  were arrested by the local police, and they are still in jail.    Following the rejection of their election petitions, these  two individuals appealed to the election tribunal, but their  appeal was also rejected. They entered four separate writs in  the Peshawar high court against the tribunal's decision barring  them from election participation. On Thursday, the high court's  full bench rejected their writs. These candidates cannot take  part in the elections. The attorney general of Pakistan, who  prosecuted the case for the government, took the position that  elections did not merely imply voting on a certain date but were  a gradual process in which it was necessary to file candidacy  papers, assign election symbols, qualify or disqualified  candidates to run. The attorney general said that the election  tribunal had decided as to whether these individuals were  qualified or not. After elections took place under article 225  of the constitution, these individuals could challenge their  disqualification in the next election tribunal. Consequently, it  was not within the jurisdiction of the court to hear the  petitions of these individuals.    Referring to the 1989 Javid Hashemi case in the Pakistan  Supreme Court, the attorney general said that the Supreme Court  had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal and instructed him to take  his case to the election tribunal after elections were over.  Lawyers for petitioners Haji Ibrahim Khan and Nadir Khan Zakha  Kheel raised the point that at that time Supreme Court Justice  Naseem Hasan Shah's decision was contrary to the decisions of  the rest of the justices. At this juncture, the chief justice  said that the majority of the Supreme Court justices had  rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal. Justice Nasim Hasan Shah said  if the majority agreed on a decision, he would go along with it.  The attorney general pointed out that the Sindh High Court had  made a similar decision in the Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi case and  ruled that the high court did not have the jurisdiction to hear  Jatoi's appeal and that the decision could be challenged in the  election tribunal to be set up after the elections. Haji Qadar  Gul's lawyer said that his client's langi had been revoked.  Langi is an honor awarded to certain prominent individuals in  the agencies and is usually given to those favored by the  government.</p>

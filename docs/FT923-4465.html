			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Tunnel's cash deadline may be missed EUROTUNNEL and contractors building the Channel tunnel appeared unlikely last night to beat a deadline of tonight for resolving their latest financial crisis. Contractors said there were no plans for the two sides to meet, although that could change following talks in Paris yesterday between bankers and Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive. The banks have said they may prevent Eurotunnel drawing further funds for the project unless agreement is reached quickly over contractors' claims for more than Pounds 1bn in extra payments. The next Pounds 100m of loans is due to be drawn on September 30. Although banks have urged both sides to settle by tonight, Eurotunnel and contractors believe talks could continue for several days. Transmanche-Link, a consortium of five British and five French contractors, says extra cash is needed to meet the increased costs of the project which, including finance charges, have risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn. The dispute could lead to another intervention by the Bank of England, which has previously acted as a referee in cost disputes between contractors and Eurotunnel. Leading banks in the consortium of 206 banks which have agreed to provide Pounds 6.8bn to Eurotunnel have informed Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, of their latest ultimatum. They stressed yesterday that the Bank was not actively involved in attempts to find a solution but did not rule out the possibility that Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, might eventually arbitrate. The latest dispute is over contractors' claims for additional payments of Pounds 1.2bn at 1985 prices. This includes Pounds 800m to cover the increased cost of fitting out rail tunnels and building passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent, and Sangatte, northern France. The other Pounds 400m has been claimed to cover higher costs in other parts of the project, some of which Eurotunnel has already agreed to pay. In total, Eurotunnel is thought to have offered the equivalent in 1985 prices of an extra Pounds 550m to Pounds 600m in cash and Pounds 200m in equity, likely to be a convertible debenture. This would make the package worth Pounds 750m to Pounds 800m. The deal is thought to be about Pounds 150m less than the contractors have indicated they might accept.</p>

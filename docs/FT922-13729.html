			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / World Trade News: Unfinished business over EC bananas - The quota deal could cause some problems with Gatt THIS week's apparent resolution of the EC's banana conundrum has the look of unfinished business about it. The European Commission's decision to set a quota on banana imports from Latin America may begin to resolve the long-standing problem of how to protect traditional, high-cost banana producers within the single market. But lobbyists acting in their interests are not yet convinced. At the same time, opting for quotas rather than tariffs is likely to cause collateral problems within the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation negotiations, which will probably see their last chance of conclusion this year on April 22, at an EC-US summit in the US. It would be surprising, given the current state of EC-US trade relations, if Washington were not to demand concessions for a Brussels waiver on bananas, which, as one EC official put it, 'our farmers will have to pay for.' The Commission has still to bring forward detailed regulations, but officials say the quota system should work like this. The predominantly Caribbean and African producers linked to the EC by the Lome Convention on trade and development, plus the outlying territories like France's Martinique and Spain's Canary Islands, will have the fifth of the west European market they each have safeguarded. The first group has 19 per cent, the second 21 per cent of what was 3.34m tonnes consumption in 1990. The rest of this market, over 2m tonnes, is supplied by Central American, so-called dollar zone exporters, who produce at around a half to a third of the price of the EC's protected suppliers. Their share will be consolidated, subject to the existing 20 per cent tariff which will now extend to Germany too, and be allowed to 'evolve', officials say, at a growth rate of about 3 per cent a year. This the banana market, and protected suppliers are now more or less at the limit of their capacity to produce. But there is still uncertainty. Until Brussels produces de-tails, it will remain unclear whether the dollar quota will be fixed at the 1.4m tonnes originally envisaged - average imports in 1986-88 - or actual imports of over 2m tonnes. Equally, lobbyists for the Caribbean producers and companies marketing their produce maintain that with no increase in protection but a rising quota, Eurobananas would face growing price pressure. One British analyst maintained that Windward Island fruit - supplying two out of every three bananas eaten in the UK - could lose 30 per cent of their price, erasing Eurobanana profitability. Ms Clare Wenner, of GJW which represents the Caribbean Banana Exporters' Association, advocates tradeable licences for dollar zone quota, so that Eurobanana suppliers with access to them could average out their profitability through cross-subsidy. UK banana importers such as Geest get most produce from the Windward Islands. Like some of their competitors, they signed contracts with dollar zone producers, as a hedge against the more free circulation of bananas once the EC single market comes into effect. Their prospects of selling dollar fruit depend now on access to the new quota. There is almost certain to be a cost for this arrangement within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is hoping to conclude the Uruguay Round this month. The five-year old Round requires all farm products to have tariffs, which would be gradually lowered over the next six years. Hopes are rising moderately that the US and EC can agree on farm subsidy cuts - the main obstacles to a deal, along with services and market access. Senior officials from both sides meet in London on Tuesday, before Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, meets President Bush in Washington on April 22. If there is a farm trade deal, the US will agree to allow subsidies to farmers as compensation for price cuts, so long as the EC furnishes proof they will restrict production, and they become degressive after six years. The EC will agree to restrain the volume of its subsidised exports as long as the US restrains exports of corn gluten, a cheap cereals feedstock. The EC would also like export subsidy cuts to be on sectors like dairy produce as a whole, rather than each product, hitting, say, high added value products like cheese as much as skimmed milk powder. But within this outline, the EC may now have to pay an additional price for protecting the banana producers of Dominica and Guadeloupe.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIX STEERS SHOT AND KILLED AFTER ESCAPE FROM MEATPACKING PLANT  </P> <P> Six steers that escaped from a National City meatpacking house were shot and  killed by slaughterhouse employees Friday while trapped in a parking lot.  </P> <P> The animals escaped from the Cuyamaca Meat Co. in the 2500 block of Cleveland  Avenue at 9:15 a.m. and wandered two blocks before being herded into a fenced  parking lot, said Bill Grove, manager of the slaughterhouse.  </P> <P> After catching up with the cattle, employees shot and killed five of the six  animals before officials from animal control arrived and shot and killed the  last one, police said.  </P> <P> "When (cattle) get out, and when they get excited, and people start chasing  them and yelling at them, it makes them a little wild," Grove said. "We could  have taken the same animals and herded them back, but, with the cars and people  on the street, it could have been dangerous."  </P> <P> Witnesses complained that the shooting of the cattle took about an hour and a  half and was cruel.  </P> <P> "I'm still upset about it," said Valerie King, an employee of Motivational  Systems, where the cattle were fenced in. "They killed them slowly. They didn't  use enough power, and it took a long time for the cows to die."  </P> <P> "It was really cruel," King said. "There was one that refused to die, and it  walked around with a bullet between his eyes."  </P> <P> Jerry Landes, operations manager at Motivational Systems, said nobody asked for  permission to fire into the parking lot and that "there didn't appear to be  much concern for safety."  </P> <P> Landes said employees of his firm were working in the building behind the  cattle while the animals were being shot. No bullets penetrated the building  walls, Landes said.  </P> <P> Police said the incident did not violate any codes on the firing of weapons in  public, and that the case is closed.  </P> <P> Grove said the animals escaped while being inspected by an officer of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture through a gate that had not been properly secured.  </P></p>

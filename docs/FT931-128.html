			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brake Bros edges ahead to Pounds 16m BRAKE BROS, a supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the catering trade, increased pre-tax profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 16m last year - helped by steady margins in its core businesses and a sharp rise in sales. Mr Frank Brake, managing director, attributed the group's success in supplying a generally depressed catering trade to the investment in training and service. 'We continue to invest heavily in people,' Mr Brake said. 'That is probably why we have outperformed others in the recession.' The group reported a 26 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 280.5m. However, excluding acquisitions and the newly developed fine foods divi- sion, sales were ahead 10 per cent. Mr Brake said the company's main frozen foods business - which claims some 19 per cent of the Pounds 1.3bn UK mar-ket - had maintained its margins. Further benefits were expected in this operation from the integration of acquisitions made in 1991 and investments in distribution facilities completed in 1992. The acquisition of a small chilled foods group in the UK and two food distributors in France was behind the one percentage point drop in overall margins. Mr Brake said London Larder, the UK company, had incurred a Pounds 1m loss and was not expected to contribute to profits until 1994. Since the year-end, Brake Bros had paid Pounds 3m to add two companies to the two French businesses acquired last year for Pounds 4m. The business was expected to come into profit next year. A second interim dividend of 4.35p in lieu of a final, to beat Budget changes on ACT, makes a 6.2p (5.75p) total.</p>

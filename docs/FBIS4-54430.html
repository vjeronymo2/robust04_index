			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 28 -- The first quarter of 1994 saw  the consolidation of production growth trend which started  almost two years ago, according to the central Statistical  Office GUS. Its Vice-President Roman Sawinski told reporters  Thursday that a growing economic activity in the first quarter  was accompanied by lower inflation and stabilization in the  labour market.    Moreover, the financial situation of enterprises improved  which contributed to higher tax revenues of the state budget.    On the other hand, long-term unemployment increased, as did  the number of people who lost their right to unemployment  benefits, and the scale of joblessness among young adults  widened, the GUS reports indicate.    After a relatively moderate wage growth recorded in January  and February, March saw an increase of 14.8 percent on February.    The main trends in the Polish foreign trade in 1993 were a  bigger deficit, growing imports, higher turnover with the  European Union [EU] countries, and low level of trade with the  East and Central European states.    Presenting the picture of Polish trade with foreign  countries  in 1993, Malgorzata Fronk of GUS said that exports reached over  14 bn dollars, and imports -- over 19 bn dollars, leaving a  trade gap of some 5 bn dollars, a twofold increase on 1992.    Much of the higher imports resulted from increased purchases  of capital goods and production inputs. Compared to 1992,  imports of chemicals increased by 46 percent, of machinery - by  44 percent, of wood and paper products - by 42 percent, said  Fronk. The share in overall imports of fuels and energy and of  foodstuffs fell.    The share of the EU in Polish exports reached 63 percent,  and  in imports - 57 percent. Germany remained the largest trade  partner for Poland. The largest trade deficit Poland had with  Italy (728 m dollars) and Britain (475 m dollars). Trade with  the East-Central European countries grew by 20 percent in  exports and 25 percent in imports. Russia remained the largest  trade partner in this area.</p>

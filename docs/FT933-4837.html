			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Marx the musical If you find an ancient Labour party song sheet, price tuppence, in your attic, cherish it. Mine came down the loft ladder during the summer. It is enjoyable, yet it carries a sting. It makes you weep as you laugh. It is a musical history of the century of collectivism that has now reached its end. What I could do with this material] Andrew Lloyd Webber, eat your heart out: The people's flag is deepest red: it left the Labour movement dead. Too cruel? Try arise, ye starvelings from your slumbers - and please join up in larger numbers. Enough tampering. This ancient hymnal contains many popular ditties, the property of no political party. Yet it should be preserved in a museum of the 20th century, if only for its red numbers. The exhortation in the Italian 'Bandiera Rosa' is clumsily translated as raise then the scarlet flag triumphantly. Triumph? Phooey. The little-known 'Dump the Bosses off your Back' promises that all the agonies you suffer/you can end with one good whack. We'll pass that by. The song ascribed to the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which I bet you cannot even whistle, has a chorus beginning strong as the steel which we shape with precision . . . It is impossible not to mock, yet it is uncomfortable to do so. Millions of good people sang such tunes, and believed the promises in their seductive rhymes. The suffering they record was genuine; many who sought to improve the condition of the poor, or of badly treated employees, were, every now and then, just for a moment, heroes. Shall we only hope for heaven when we're dead? asks Ralph Chaplin's 'The Commonwealth of Toil'. Shall we stagger on beneath their heavy load? Such rhetoric got nowhere. It rescued nobody. I do not think the lyricist of the Internationale (the one about ye starvelings arising) meant what you and I will read into the following lines: for reason in revolt now thunders/and at last ends the age of cant. Reason certainly has thundered, and ended the age of socialist cant. In Britain it has also put the kibosh on trade unions and made it difficult for Labour to win a general election. The people's party continues to be branded by the sentiments ex-pressed in its old hymns. It has not adapted itself to the new political marketplace. In spite of everything done since 1983 to shed voter-repelling policies, its image remains as it was, that of an organisation run by collectivists who will hold you back. This observation is supported by qualitative survey research published by the Fabians a year ago. A follow-up study, whose full results will be available next week, rams the point home. One reason why Labour is still regarded as a loser by a majority of the electorate is the association of the party with the trade unions. This hurts both sides. In another recent Fabian pamphlet*, Philip Bassett and Alan Cave quote survey evidence to the effect that 'even among members of a highly Labour-loyal union, trade union support for Labour is the single-largest deterrent for employees considering union membership'. Labour did pick up 1 1/2 m more votes in last year's general election than it did in 1987, but that still left it 1 1/2 m behind its winning performance in 1966. The Conservative popular vote last year was the highest in its history, and 2 1/2 m ahead of Labour. The unions are mortally afflicted. During the 1980s they lost members at twice the rate of the decline in employment. Union membership is down from a peak of 13m to around 8 1/2 m now, and falling rapidly. In a fresh analysis of their prospects, Mr Graham Mather of the European Policy Forum suggests that Britain's unions are 'retreating into a ghetto of white-collar, public ser-vice workers'. Barely a quarter of their members are in manufacturing; just over half have full-time white-collar jobs. 'Alarmingly for the unions, these are precisely the areas likely to see the next wave of job shedding,' notes Mr Mather. This closes a new trap around Labour. If the party stands for anything it is for more government activity. It clearly feels obliged to oppose every cut in this or that public programme put forward by the government. It will obstruct privatisation, competitive tendering, hiving off to agencies, and the other devices used by the Conservatives for the unstated purpose of breaking the public sector unions. Whatever Labour's leaders say, that approach is translated by most people into a plan to offer further protected jobs for the unions' boys and girls, and thus more collective spending. Prominent among Labour's perceived masters are some of the public sector unions, the potential beneficiaries of its administrative approach. It is a deadly circle. The response of the party and possibly a majority of the unions to this dire emergency is that of non-swimmers clinging to one another in choppy seas. They are unable to part, unable to tread water, incapable of any movements save those which make their predicament worse. No, they say, even those who see the light, we do not want to break the links between unions and party; we want to tighten them. It is a noose that they are tightening. Mr Bill Jordan of the engineering union has observed that voters will reason that, if trade union leaders can dictate the way John Smith runs his party, then they would surely dictate the way he runs his government. Mr Smith will address the Trades Union Congress at its meeting in Brighton today. If he does not reiterate his support for selection of Labour's parliamentary candidates by paid-up party members alone, the explanation will be that the TUC is the wrong place to do that, since it includes unions not affiliated to the party. Yet the Labour leader's highest aim is to cut away the collective trade union vote in the constituencies. He has already abandoned plans to exclude trade unions from the procedure for electing the leader of the party. The union bloc vote at Labour's conference will be slowly circumscribed, but it will remain overwhelming for the rest of this century. It is not good enough. No matter how badly the Tories flounder, the principal opposition party is not modernising itself as extensively or rapidly as it needs to. For Labour and the unions the song is ended, but the melody lingers on. Do you hear it? It is a dirge. *Available from 11 Dartmouth St, London SW1H 9BN</p>

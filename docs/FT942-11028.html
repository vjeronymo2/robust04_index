			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Speculation in Westminster Sir, 'The clock starts to tick for Major' (April 30). Can it really be true that: '. . .fatalistic speculation permeates every (my italics) conversation among the journalists, ministers, and Tory backbenchers who daily fill the restaurants around Westminster'. And then again: 'Back in the restaurant, the minister wants first to know. . .' Are ministers really such washerwomen - or is this just a case of over-enthusiastic reporting?

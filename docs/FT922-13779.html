			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes gets German sweet foothold CADBURY SCHWEPPES is to acquire a foothold in the German confectionery market with the cash purchase of 70 per cent of Piasten Schokoladenfabrik Hoffmann, a privately-owned Bavarian chocolate and sweets manufacturer. No price was disclosed. Cadbury said its planned holding had a net book value of DM3.5m (Pounds 1.23m) and would contribute 2p per share to its earnings next year. The balance sheet impact of the deal was negligible. Piasten, which has 439 employees and its own sales force, had sales of DM126.1m in the year to June and is said to be profitable. It is a leader in the German boxed chocolate assortment market and also sells chocolate liqueurs and bars, chocolate covered sweets and sugar confectionery. Cadbury said the deal would allow it to introduce some of its confectionery products in Germany and provided low-risk access to central and eastern European markets, particularly Poland. Piasten products might also be sold through Cadbury's operations in other parts of Europe. The deal, which is subject to approval by the Federal Cartel Office, gives Cadbury an option to buy the remaining shares in Piasten at a price based on the partial acquisition terms.</p>

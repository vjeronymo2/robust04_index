			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cape Town Feb 16 SAPA -- An internal Eskom  [Electricity Supply Commission] report has criticised  maintenance staff at the Koeberg Nuclear Power station for lack  of attention to detail in their work, and said they felt they  were under too much production pressure at times. A copy of the  report was obtained by SAPA during a conference on nuclear  policy at the weekend, where several speakers expressed concern  over "human error" as a factor in the safety of nuclear power  stations -- and some called for the immediate closure of Koeberg.    However, Koeberg's station manager, Peter Prozesky, has  stressed that incidents referred to in the internal report at no  time presented any nuclear danger.    And John Henderson, Koeberg's generation nuclear manager,  commented that while he supported the need for the public to be  informed about the operational performance of Koeberg, he felt  it was misleading that judgments should be formed on isolated  internal incident reports. These were honest attempts to be  extremely critical of all incidents, no matter how trivial, and  to learn from experience.    Explaining the circumstances of the report given to SAPA, Mr  Prozesky said Eskom was trying to cut down the length of its  "outage" time -- deactivation of a reactor for routine  maintenance and refuelling. But, he said, it also recognised  that the human being was the "weak link in the chain", and  compensated for this with stringent quality checks.    The report dealt with an incident towards the end of last  year, when one of the two units at Koeberg was being  recommissioned after an outage. A maintenance technician failed  to replace computer cards that would allow "make-up" pumps to  activate automatically when water in a steam generator loop  dropped below a certain level.    This was missed in a check before the unit was  recommissioned, and was only discovered more than a month later.    An internal investigation into the incident found that staff  felt they were under too much pressure during outages. It  concluded that there was poor control of recommissioning of the  plant, and a lack of attention to detail. "Yielding to pressure  of work is also felt to be a contributory factor."    Mr Prozesky confirmed another incident during an outage at  Koeberg last year, when a misunderstanding between staff  resulted in a valve between the reactor building and the spent  fuel storage building not closing fully. Some of the  boron-enriched water that covered and shielded the spent fuel  drained away.    "But I want to stress that in neither incident and at no  time  was there any nuclear danger or nuclear risk," he told SAPA. In  the valve incident, the design of the spent fuel pool made it  physically impossible for it to drain to the point where the  fuel was endangered.    The response of operators, who noticed the drop in the water  level, had been swift and according to plan. The water had been  topped up, and the valve problem diagnosed. The radiation  monitors in the area had not even been activated.    Asked what would have happened had the spent fuel been  completely exposed, Mr Prozesky said that was "just not  possible" and "not worth speculating about". "In terms of its  implications for us, it was a minor incident."    In the other incident, either of two backup systems would  have replenished the water in the generator loop. Had the loop  not been replenished -- which he also said was not worth  speculation -- it would merely have boiled dry, with no other  consequences.    Mr Prozesky said there was no doubt that staff were under  increased workload during outage, an intensive period in which  more than 6,000 tasks had to be performed. Koeberg had extremely  long outage periods -- 120 days had been the norm up to now --  and was trying to bring them closer to the 35 days targeted by  the station's sister plants in France.    There were very good economic reasons for doing so, as every  day of outage represented electricity un-generated and unsold.  Speakers at the conference at the weekend had criticised the  relatively high cost of Koeberg's electricity and one way to  bring this down was to operate more efficiently.    Mr Prozesky said the human being was the "weak link in the  chain", and during outages there were always things that would  go wrong.    "What it important is that one recognises that the human  being is fallible and you put in place appropriate quality  control mechanisms, and that you have a very sound  recommissioning programme at the end of outages to pick up  problems."    Commenting on claims that some Koeberg workers felt they  were  not fully informed about incidents such as these, Mr Prozesky  said the valve problem had been fully described in an internal  staff newsletter. This and other feedback mechanisms had been  set up specifically to keep staff at all levels fully informed.    Discussions were under way to include union representatives  in all aspects of Koeberg business, including the committees  that investigated incidents.    Mr Henderson commented: "I support the need for the public  to  be informed about the operational performance of Koeberg, but I  feel it is totally wrong and misleading that judgments should be  formed on isolated internal incident reports.    "These reports represent an open and honest attempt to be  extremely critical of all incidents that occur, no matter how  trivial. The aim is to learn from our experience. This  experience is shared with other nuclear plants so that we can  all learn from each other.    "Public judgment should be formed on a more holistic view.  To  that end we would welcome public and press interest and an  opportunity to explain our nuclear safety assurance programme  and put isolated incidents in perspective.    "We are currently, along with the Council for Nuclear  Safety,  looking at a communication mechanism which has been adopted by  the international community to address this specific problem.  This system is known as ines (international nuclear event  scale). We would be happy to discuss this system with the press."</p>

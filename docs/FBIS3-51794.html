			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Cuban newspaper TRABAJADORES today said in an  editorial that the key goal of our economy is to be as efficient  as possible and that the most reasonable way to achieve this is  by reducing costs, increasing productivity, and making the best  use of the raw materials available to us.    In touching on the process of debates now under way in Cuba,  TRABAJADORES said the basic objective is assessing the economic  and financial conditions at each working center to evaluate the  country's economic situation and the effects of financial  imbalance in the economy.    The editorial stressed that with the authority they have  earned by staying in their jobs, workers, today more than ever,  are demanding high standards of labor discipline, because what  is at stake is the defense of the genuine interests of workers,  peasants, and students.    The editorial said that Cuban workers are concerned and  reject the intolerable presence of crime, its ties to the black  market, and its incidence in social and labor discipline, and  the editorial demanded from the authorities the implementation  of drastic and exemplary measures at all levels. It added that  reality has forced us to make economic adjustments, which we  will model after a socialist and Cuban pattern, using democratic  formulas that are really unthinkable within other societies.</p>

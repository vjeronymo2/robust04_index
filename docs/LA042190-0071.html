			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KINGS SHOULD DO IT FOR THEMSELVES  </P> <P> The Kings' double-overtime victory over Calgary was more than the Midnight  Miracle on Manchester.  </P> <P> It was a victory of good over evil, of a class act over bush-league tactics, of  pure hockey over the ruthless, goon-style play made famous by Terry Crisp's  Philadelphia teammates in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Throughout the series, the Flyers, I mean Flames, took cheap shots at the Kings  (some the referees called; most went unpenalized). Not once did the Kings  retaliate.  </P> <P> When hockey is played with skill and finesse, as the Kings played, it is a  beautiful game. When the sport is played with reckless, brute force, with more  emphasis on injuring and intimidating the opponents than outscoring them, the  game becomes ugly.  </P> <P> ROBERT KRIER, Escondido  </P></p>

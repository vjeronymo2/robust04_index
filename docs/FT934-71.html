			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Economic model accuracy Sir, Professor Kenneth Wallis is quite right to point out (Letters, December 23) that the full effects of tax changes, once multiplier effects are taken into account, are even greater than the first round effects on consumers' expenditure. But he is wrong to conclude that this vindicates conventional models of the economy from the criticism I have made about the way in which they incorporate taxation. Indeed, the existence of multiplier effects increases the importance of accurately estimating the 'first round' impact of tax changes on consumers' expenditure. The study carried out by the CEBR to which Professor Wallis refers points out that conventional models such as those used by the Treasury and Bank of England typically understate first round effects by half.

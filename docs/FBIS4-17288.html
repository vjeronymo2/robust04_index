			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Reform From Above Not Being </F> Carried Out in Russia, Aleksandr Livshits, Leader of the Russian  Federation President's Group of Experts, Claims"]    [Text] The author of Russia's first handbook on the market  economy, Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr Livshits, is  already familiar to IZVESTIYA readers, since he has many times  appeared in this newspaper as a writer. Two months have passed  since Professor Livshits moved to the Kremlin, taking up the  post of leader of the Russian Federation president's group of  experts.    "You encounter many absolutely gripping topics here," he  says: "There are dramas, tragedies, joys -- in a word,  everything a man needs." From this we may conclude that my  interlocutor has taken up his new job with characteristic  enthusiasm. Nevertheless, summing up his one-month incumbency  in his new post, he noted that so far he has only been laboring  to "reduce the negative, not to create the positive."    February-March saw an unforeseen substantial fall in  production. One reason is well known -- the mass defaulting  which caused enterprises to shut down.    No economic mechanism can regulate the problem of debt  defaulting smoothly, without destroying production: No coercive  measures were drawn up, and a reversion to the past was feared.  A virtually spontaneous, very expensive, mutual absorption of  debts (apart from the recovery of debts by the Ministry of  Finance) is taking place.    You often hear directors say that, on the whole, many people  have adapted: Defaulting will go away miraculously, they say,  and things are OK. But there will be no miracle. This is a  crisis of incomplete reform. And trying to solve the problem  once again by the methods of 1992, i.e. through credit  injections, would mean ending up this time with inflation not of  15-20 percent, as before, but all of 40 percent. Fortunately,  the government understands this perfectly.    The payments crisis induces Prof. Livshits to observe that  there is no controlled mechanism of economic reform in Russia.  Reform is a change in the design of a mechanism, be it a clock  or an economy. In this sense reform is not being carried out in  terms of a controlled process of redesigning the economic  mechanism from above. Nor has this been the case, in the  estimation of the expert group leader, for at least 18 months to  two years (reform is being carried out spontaneously from below,  but that is another story). Even though governments and  ministers have changed in this time -- some called reformers,  others the reverse.    We are accustomed to judging how reformist a government is  by  what sort of monetary and credit policy it implements. In  reality, this is no more than an illusion: Monetary policy, in  Livshits' opinion, can create better or worse conditions for  reforms, but it does not change the design. The number of  monopolies is not thereby reduced, nor do civilized markets  emerge, or changes in the forms of ownership occur. So that  there is just one sign of a reformist government, Aleksandr  Yakovlevich insists: whether or not it engages in reform,  whether or not it controls the process.    We have contrived to lose all control over state  enterprises,  although we have considerable experience in this area. The  state sector is being not just privatized but sold off  chaotically, without premeditation, without any kind of decrees  or laws. Therefore virtually no reform can be seen in this area.    Unfortunately the returns on privatization are so far  small. Check privatization was necessary, but it brings  virtually nothing in to the budget. With such meager investment  resources we must seriously consider how to sell the most  efficient property to major investors. World experience shows  that a country which carries out mass privatization as a rule  obtains healthy resources and does not suffer inflation.    Taxation. Reform in precisely this area is capable of  influencing the design mentioned above, to wit, by stimulating  investment activity. Instead of this, as my interlocutor puts  it, the only result of the taxation system currently operating  is "a Russia-wide groan from below."    One further argument to prove the absence of reform -- the  wholesale markets. There are changes in this area, but they are  fairly untypical. The painfully familiar former state supply  bodies have now been transformed into joint-stock companies, but  in no way ceding their monopoly status in the wholesale markets.  In actual fact the situation has even worsened, since a state  monopoly was hardly worse than is a private one.    In recent months, and even years, it has been fashionable to  talk about the allocation of structural priorities, the points  of growth where resources should be invested, about selective  policy. Has this policy been elaborated in reality? You can see  in the federal budget how resources are distributed for federal  special-purpose programs. But here only the projects that are  finalized earliest and best can receive priority, and these  projects will be funded accordingly. Does this mean that a  given project and a given sector are really accorded priority?  Certainly not.    And what is the structure of priorities in our country  today?  There is really nothing especially clever here: It is nothing  but the result of the real correlation of forces in the Duma and  between the representatives of certain sector blocs. Who would  be so bold as to claim that these are indeed Russia's structural  priorities?    All the above might prompt someone to ask the legitimate  question: But why, in point of fact, complicate life for  ourselves? Why is all this necessary, if all over the world the  process of forming market mechanisms has proceeded as naturally  as the grass grows?    Yes, the Kremlin's chief expert suggests, this is absolutely  true: Only the American grass was not concreted over for 70  years. On the other hand, we made up our minds to smash the  concrete and wait for grass to appear. It did indeed spring up,  but through the cracks and overlying pieces of concrete. Hence  all this grass takes on wild, distorted forms. Such are the  outlines of our market economy today. What we really need to do  is dismantle this concrete seriously, genuinely, but this is not  yet being done. There is only one solution: to complete  reform, as clearly stated in the president's message to the  Federal Assembly.    Today inflation has been comparatively stabilized; however,  this is the result not of last year's policy, but of the policy  of the first few months of this year. And a further rapid fall  in inflation should be viewed as a great danger. The value of  such achievements is only significant when what is really  important is not thereby lost. Today we are losing part of our  high-tech industry, as my interlocutor wrote in IZVESTIYA in  December, and this process has not been stopped.    In an economy like ours inflation can be beaten only  gradually, through positional warfare. But the factor of its  relative stabilization must be used to achieve at least, for  example, a small reduction in centralized interest rates. That  is to say that investors should be given some kind of signal for  action. Of course they need guarantees and economic freedom,  but this is again nothing less than controlled reform.    The systemic crisis, the incompleteness of reform -- all  this  cannot, unfortunately, be solved overnight. Livshits assures us  that, whatever we do now, by the fall all the same, familiar  problems will come our way again. But since we know in advance  that reform will progress slowly, we must try at least to  minimize the difficulties as much as possible. There are  elementary ways and means connected with the elementary  introduction of order. Why is this not being done? I think,  because of the weakness of the state and many other factors.    Incidentally, there is no problem of defaulting on payments  in the private sector. Where there is no state sector, debts  are always extracted, albeit by primitive methods. This is  another weed growing through the concrete. But for a state to  be unable to cope with state enterprises -- who ever heard  anything like it?    All the same, do they know behind the Kremlin walls what to  do about defaulting?    Above all, there are no plans there to change the  government;  no direct coercive measures are being prepared, although certain  recommendations are being made to the president. There is no  question of hitting the kopek in anyone's pocket; but the time  has come to compel enterprises to settle their debts, activating  their hard currency resources if necessary.    Aleksandr Livshits himself believes that a clear timetable  should be established for the elimination of budget debt not  only for 1993, but also in terms of the resources being  distributed now. We must find the strength to establish rigid  controls over the passage of budgetary funds through the whole  system. If necessary, laws should be amended. We should worry  especially about Russian enterprises which deliver products to  the CIS republics and are not receiving payment on time.    All this, of course, will not provide a radical solution to  the default problem -- there is no avoiding bankruptcies and the  circulation of promissory notes. But the scale of these things  can be markedly reduced.    The government's strategy was made public at the beginning  of  March. Descriptions of it as inflationary have not been borne  out. If it manages to adopt a series of measures to counter  defaulting on payments, improve the situation in the consumer  market, and seriously tackle the redesign of the economic  mechanism, paths to survival will be opened.</p>

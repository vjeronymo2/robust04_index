			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cascades back in profit at nine months Cascades, the Canadian-based international packaging group returned to profitability at the nine-month stage with strengthening markets and completion of a restructuring of its Cascades Paperboard business in North America and Europe, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Net profit was CDollars 15m (USDollars 11.08m), or 17 cents a share, against a net loss of CDollars 4.3m, or 17 cents, a year earlier on sales of CDollars 1.2bn, down slightly because of the sale of Paperboard assets and shutdown of the Duffel mill in Belgium. Third-quarter profit was CDollars 7.3m, or 10 cents, against a loss of CDollars 3.2m, or 9 cents, on sales of CDollars 422m against CDollars 400m.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd's trust seeks funds from HK Investors in Hong Kong are being targetted by the backers of a new corporate capital scheme for the Lloyd's insurance market. Venton Underwriting Agencies said on Friday that it was aiming to persuade both wealthy individuals and institutions in Hong Kong, as well as investors from Bermuda and the UK, to provide some Pounds 25m in capital for a new Lloyd's investment company, originally announced last month. Meanwhile, a planned venture involving JIB Group, an insurance broker in which the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Jardine Mattheson owns a majority stake, could also look to east Asia for support. JIB and Swiss Bank Corporation, have jointly formed Jardine Lloyd's Advisers, which will advise Lloyd's members. Its founders are understood to be looking to raise between Pounds 25m and Pounds 50m for the investment trust, which would support a range of syndicates at Lloyd's. The market raised some Pounds 800m for a range of corporate capital vehicles last year, with UK institutions providing the bulk of the money. This year interest in the UK has declined. Some agencies are looking further afield. Venton, which is working with Bermuda's Butterfield Securities on its deal, is offering investors 100p shares in the new company for only 20p, the balance of capital required being supplied in the form of a letter of credit or other collateral. 'The capital structure . . . offers an exceptionally advantageous gearing ratio on the actual cash amount subscribed whilst retaining the benefits of limited liability,' said the group. The venture, still subject to Lloyd's approval, aims to supply capital only to Venton's three syndicates and is one of a number of so-called 'dedicated' funds being developed at the market. Most of the money raised last year supports a series of stock market listed investment trusts, which support a range of agencies and syndicates. Venton said it had no immediate plans to seek a stock market listing for Venton Underwriting Group, and would raise the money through a private placement. Prior to any listing Butterfield Securities, will provide a matched bargain facility for the shares. Mr Jeremy Venton, senior underwriter, said he saw corporate capital as a more reliable long-term source of funds than the individual Names. Venton plans to increase capacity - the amount of premiums its syndicates can underwrite - from Pounds 127m in 1994 to Pounds 185m in 1995.</p>

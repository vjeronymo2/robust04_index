			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Rivers watchdog criticised on cash MPs HAVE strongly condemned the National Rivers Authority for weaknesses in financial management that led to wasted expenditure of Pounds 1m and the resignation of its first chief executive. A report from the Public Accounts Committee published yesterday criticises the Environment Department, Lord Crickhowell, chairman of the NRA, and his board for failing to keep a sufficiently close eye on the water pollution organisation's expenditure. The primary reason for the outspoken criticism was evidence that rules for spending large sums of money had been ignored in fitting out the NRA's new head office in Bristol. The project resulted in the wasting of about Pounds 1m out of a total cost of Pounds 2.65m, and the resignation last June of Mr John Bowman, chief executive, with a pay-off of Pounds 125,000. Two other senior executives received written warnings for ignoring the financial procedures laid down for the NRA. In July, 1990, the NRA engaged Corporate Design Interiors (CDI) to advise on relocating and to help choose contractors. It was also one of three firms asked to tender for the Pounds 12,000 contract to design the layout of the new offices. The NRA then decided to combine the design contract with a much bigger one for fitting out the building. Instead of asking several firms to tender, it considered only two that had bid for the much smaller design job. The Pounds 2.65m contract went to CDC, a sister company of CDI, without Lord Crickhowell, Mr Bowman or the NRA board being told. An internal inquiry found that had the job been properly managed it would have cost only Pounds 1.6m. The NRA said last night there had been 'serious shortcomings' in the management of fitting out the Bristol head office, which resulted in poor value for money.

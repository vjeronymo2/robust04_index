			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Unions may sponsor Lib Dems Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidates may one day accept sponsorship from trade unions, Mr Alex Carlile, the party's employment spokesman, said yesterday. The party and the Trades Union Congress are to hold their first official meeting today. 'I would not want candidates to be beholden to a union but sponsorship by unions is certainly on the agenda,' he said. The meeting between the two organisations follows an invitation from Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, but builds on several months of informal contact. The meeting is important to both organisations more for the signals it sends to others, rather than for the substance of the discussion. The TUC has shifted in the direction of the Liberal Democrats on many industrial relations issues during the past five to 10 years. 'Ten years ago we would still have opposed strike ballots, works council-type bodies for representing workers' views, and the European Community - now we join the Liberal Democrats in embracing them all,' said a TUC official. The Liberal Democrats have won TUC approval for strongly supporting the social dimension of the European Union and the restoration of union rights at GCHQ, the government's communications monitoring base at Cheltenham. Some TUC officials have even suggested that the party has better policies on full employment and employee involvement than Labour. But some union leaders - in particular Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe of Unison, the public services union - have expressed reservations about an official meeting so close to the local elections. The TUC has impressed Liberal Democrats in its attempt to distance itself from the Labour party. 'The organisation has been trying to de-politicise itself and has made some progress,' Mr Carlile said. The meeting helps the TUC's attempt to become a more politically neutral lobby organisation for those at work. Its links with Labour have won it little influence in the past 15 years. The TUC is also aware that about 25 per cent of its members voted Liberal Democrat at the last election. Differences remain over such issues as the minimum wage policy and union recognition rights, but it is in the interests of both organisations to maintain friendly relations. A new Liberal Democrat employment policy paper, due soon, will be closely scrutinised in Congress House.</p>

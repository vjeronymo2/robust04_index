			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Six criminals who have  plundered rails, electrical wires, communications facilities and  materials from oilfields have been sentenced to death by local  Chinese courts and were executed today.    Vice-President of China's Supreme Court Liu Jiachen said at  a  press conference here this afternoon that the crimes of stealing  and damaging facilities for railways, oilfields, power and  communications have become very rampant recently, which has done  great harm to public security, social stability and the national  economy.    Liu Xiaoguang, a 27-year-old jobless man, and his accomplice  Zhang Guobin, 26, had plundered types of valves, seamless steel,  tires and other materials valued at 520,000 yuan from the Daqing  oilfield on 20 occasions from January to September 1992. The  two were sentenced to death by the Daqing Intermediate Court of  Heilongjiang Province in northeast China.    Chen Guiluo, a 35-year-old railway worker, together with six  other accomplices, had committed six burglaries at five railway  stations and along the railway lines from April to June 1993.  He had plundered more than 140 tons of rails and 111 wooden  ties valued at 400,000 yuan.    While being held at the police bureau, Chen tried to flee  with other detainees. He was sentenced to death by the Special  Intermediate Court for Railway Transportation of Liuzhou city in  southwest China.    Two peasants, Zang Wenli and Zang Genzhu, stole 60,000  meters  of telephone line worth 90,000 yuan in one year's time. Direct  loss from the crime was 100,000 yuan and indirect loss was more  than 2.45 million yuan. They were sentenced to death by the  Intermediate Court of Zhumadian city of Henan Province in  central China.    Hu Xinqi, a 22-year-old peasant, together with four other  accomplices, had plundered or damaged 11 working electrical  transformers from February to June 1993, and had brought about  45,000 yuan in direct economic losses as well as bringing about  great disruptions in people's lives and local rural production.  He was sentenced to death by the Huanggang Intermediate Court  of Hubei Province.    The six convicts appealed to higher courts after the  sentences. All appeals were rejected, with original sentences  maintained.    The Vice-President Li Jiachen said that what the convicts  had  stolen were large and heavy facilities of high value. The  crimes were also perpetrated on a fairly large scale with  multiple accomplices.    "Such criminals, who pay no attention to the public security  and law of the state, must be punished severely according to  law," he stressed.</p>

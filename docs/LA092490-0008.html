			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR JUDGE SOUTER  </P> <P> I was distressed to find that you buried the story about women's and civil  rights groups' opposition to Judge Souter.  </P> <P> I thought surely that the impassioned and well-stated fears from such people as  Faye Wattleton of Planned Parenthood and those from other prominent civil  rights groups would merit front-page news coverage. Instead, it is buried  inside ("Reject Souter, Backers of Abortion Rights Say," Part A, Sept. 19).  </P> <P> To top it off, I read an uninspired "endorsement" of him (editorial, "The Price  of Independence") with a plea to not see him as a "single-issue" person. Would  you feel the same if the issue were the First Amendment?  </P> <P> VALERIE DUFRESNE  </P> <P> Corona  </P></p>

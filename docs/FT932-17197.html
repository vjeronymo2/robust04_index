			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (16): On stream, on time - There's nothing else like the Oso condensate field THIRTY-FIVE kilometres off the coast of Nigeria, towards the border with Cameroon, waves lap a gleaming structure of pipes, walkways and funnels. To the uninitiated, the edifice - which resembles an aquatic Pompidou centre - might look like any other oil platform. But to those in the know, the Oso field is something special. First, Oso produces not oil, but condensate. Unlike oil, condensate exists in the ground as a gas. As it is forced to the surface, it cools and takes on the qualities of a light crude. Much of the platform's paraphernalia is needed to separate and stabilise the condensate and to re-inject associated gas. Second, Oso represents that rare thing in Nigeria - a mega-project, worth Dollars 900m, that has come on stream. According to Mobil's Mr Jim Massey, executive director for exploration and producing, Oso has successfully left the drawing board because it is 'simply a very good project, both for Nigeria and for Mobil. The drives were there for all sides to make it work.' Mobil discovered the Oso field, which contains 500m barrels of recoverable condensate, as long ago as 1967. But it was not until 1988, when Opec excluded condensate from its quota system, that exploitation became economically attractive. After several hiccups, the project - a 60:40 joint venture between state-owned NNPC and Mobil - won 65 per cent loan financing from the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and export credit agencies of Japan and the US. The remaining 35 per cent was provided in the form of equity by NNPC and Mobil. In June 1990, contracts were awarded to a consortium of McDermott of the US, Bouygues of France and Japan's JGC Corporation. Oso came on stream, on schedule and under budget, last December. The first 600,000 barrels of condensate were piped on to the Olympic Symphony tanker on Christmas Eve and delivered to Mobil's refinery in Beaumont, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Condensate, which trades for about the same price as North Sea crude, is refined into petroleum fuel, kerosine and naphtha feedstock for petrochemicals. After nearly four months, Oso was producing 50,000 barrels a day (b/d). On-site engineers were confident that, once 'teething problems' were ironed out, production would reach the planned 100,000 b/d by mid-April. Oso is expected to generate Dollars 12bn during its 20-year lifespan and should recoup its investment within two years. Looking to the future, Mobil has begun engineering work on Oso II, an Dollars 800m project to extract natural gas liquids (NGL) from Oso gas and gas gathered from nearby fields. The NGL would be separated into propane, butane and pentane-plus for export. Oso II has a tentative start-up date of late 1996. But Mobil has so far failed to discover other condensate fields. For the moment at least, Mr Massey says, 'we don't have anything else quite like Oso'.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BOXING NOTES;  </P> <P> HOLYFIELD HEATS UP WAR OF WORDS WITH TYSON  </P> <P> Evander Holyfield may not be able to beat Mike Tyson, but he is certainly  learning to talk a better fight.  </P> <P> Holyfield, who faced his sternest test in comebacking former champion Michael  Dokes Saturday night at Caesars Palace, said his most vivid memory of Tyson was  seeing him get knocked out as an amateur by Al "Chico" Evans in 1983.  </P> <P> "I saw him get hit on the chin and fall on his face," Holyfield said. "He was  beating the guy from pillar to post and jumped in with a left hook. He got  clocked. That's my biggest fear regarding Tyson, that somebody will do that to  him before I get the chance."  </P> <P> Holyfield had his chance in a sparring session at the 1984 U.S. Olympic Team  training camp. Holyfield, then a 178-pounder, went two rounds with Tyson, then  201.  </P> <P> "They told him, 'Use your left hand only,' but I said, 'No way, use both  hands,' " Holyfield recalled. "He hit me with one right hand on the arm and  near knocked me across the ring, but every time he stopped punching I'd get my  combinations off on him. I know I threw more punches at him than anybody else  who sparred with him."  </P> <P> Holyfield said the session was cut short by U.S. team coach Pat Nappi, who  said, "This guy's got an ego, he'll try to hurt you."  </P> <P> Someday soon, Holyfield will get another chance, without Pat Nappi there to  protect him.  </P> <P> Promoter Dan Duva went on a harangue aimed at Tyson and Hector Camacho at  Wednesday's Holyfield-Dokes news conference, saying he was offended that "two  great fighters" shouldn't be fighting "bums."  </P> <P> "I have more respect for Mike Tyson than for any other fighter in the world,"  Duva said. "But I'm disgusted that he wants to fight Jose Ribalta next. And now  I hear Camacho wants to fight Harry Arroyo next. Forget about the Ribaltas and  the Carl Williamses. Mike Tyson should only be talking about fighting the  winner of this fight. The public deserves to see good fights between good  fighters."  </P> <P> There was a sense of urgency to Duva's tirade, for good reason. The Dokes fight  ends the Duva-Holyfield promotional contract, and the Titans of Totowa  desperately want a piece of the potentially huge Holyfield-Tyson pie.  </P> <P> They also would like to get Camacho in the ring with Meldrick Taylor, who was  to have fought mandatory challenger Jong-Jong Pacquing of the Philippines on  the undercard. Taylor tore knee cartilage while jumping rope Wednesday, forcing  postponement of the fight.  </P> <P> Duva was rebuffed on Saturday when he tried to talk Taylor-Camacho with Patrick  Flannery even before Camacho's poor effort against Ray Mancini. And with the  expiration of the Holyfield contract, the Duvas have an agreement with  Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, that gives them five months to make a Tyson  fight -- probably not enough time. And Sanders has several other offers to  consider.  </P> <P> "If Tyson doesn't fight for five more months, the clock runs out on (the  Duvas), not us," Sanders said. "But they've been good to us so we might still  do it with them anyway."  </P> <P> Then again, they might not.  </P> <P> Could be fireworks at this year's Boxing Writers Association of America awards  dinner. Winner of this year's Edward J. Neil fighter of the year award,  predictably enough, is Tyson. Winner of the Al Buck manager-trainer of the year  award is Kevin Rooney, recently banished from Tyson's corner. Some mischievous  type is sure to seat them together on the dais. Then again, maybe it will  precipitate a reconciliation.  </P> <P> The other winners: veteran referee Arthur Mercante, the James J. Walker Award  for long and meritorious service to boxing; unbeaten light-heavyweight Michael  Moorer, the Cus D'Amato prospect of the year award; and Al Bernstein, the Sam  Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting.  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Canada imposes steel duties CANADA yesterday imposed duties on imports from six countries it says have dumped steel, including the US, in a move that raises the stakes in a growing world trade dispute over steel, Reuter reports from Ottawa. Canada imposed the duties on steel exports from the US, Germany, France, Italy, New Zealand and Britain just two days after the US imposed duties on steel imports from Canada and several other countries. Canada said the six countries were dumping hot-rolled carbon steel sheet products into Canada. The largest user of the steel products is the motor industry. Analysts say a downturn in demand for steel and a restructuring of the global industry have caused greater competitive pressures and greater industry pressure on governments to protect them. Canada has pushed for a trade pact with the US to allow for greater integration of the two markets, but US officials have said they would prefer a multilateral approach.</p>

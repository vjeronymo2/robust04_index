			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Lawmaking" rubric: </F> "Combat Against Corruption To Continue 22 June. Law Has Not  Been Passed"]    [Text] The State Duma's second reading of the draft law on  combating corruption opened with a report by Security Committee  Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin. He reported that the committee  examined 145 amendments and that the final text of the document  had been toned down.    The approach to bribe-takers has been made differentiated:  An official holding an especially senior position shall be  liable for any bribe, an average-ranking official shall be  liable beginning with a major bribe, while a non-official person  (director of a commercial store) shall be liable for a  considerable bribe. One may suppose that a rank-and-file  non-official (a cleaning woman, for example) shall be liable  only for receiving a bribe on an especially big scale.    Earlier, the deputies could not receive money for creative  or  teaching work; now they can. Because the country's system of  payment is poorly developed, the ban on paying for big  transactions through the bank or by credit cards has been  lifted. Finally, only officials shall be obliged to declare  their incomes.    In additions to those amendments that the Security Committee  has approved, it has begun discussing those to which it  objected. Deputy Pokhmelkin of the "Russia's Choice," for  example, proposed several amendments aimed at excluding from  among those designated as "officials" those unrelated to public  service, that is to say, at excluding one of the main goals of  the draft law (government control over private businesses).  Deputy Tarasov suggested that categories of liability should be  strictly defined so that the head of a commercial organization  would be liable under the proposed law only to the extent of the  powers delegated to him by the authorities. Even Deputy Baburin  agreed with the opinion of his fellow deputies, noting that one  cannot infinitely expand the notion of corruption.    To the joy of Mr. Ilyukhin, not a single amendment proposed  from the various flanks of the political spectrum was approved.  The discussion itself was extremely incomprehensive,  disorderly, and wild because of both the deputies' extreme,  disparate postures, and because Valentin Kovalev, a less  experienced deputy speaker, was sitting in for Speaker Ivan  Rybkin. As a result, Mr. Baburin's call -- "the best answer by  the Duma to the Edict on Combating Banditry is a law on  combating corruption" -- so far remains unheeded by his fellow  deputies, and the discussion will continue on 22 June.</p>

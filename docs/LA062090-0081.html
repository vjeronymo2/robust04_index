			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH BUDGET PLAN EXPECTED BY DEMOCRATS;  </P> <P> DEFICIT: NEGOTIATORS SAY A MOVE TODAY BY THE ADMINISTRATION COULD MAKE OR BREAK  THE EFFORT TO REDUCE RED INK.  </P> <P> Democratic participants in budget talks said Tuesday that they expect the Bush  Administration to make a new proposal today that could make or break the  5-week-old effort to reach bipartisan agreement on a deficit reduction package.  </P> <P> It then should be possible to tell whether an accord can be reached by the end  of the month, several participants said.  </P> <P> Until now, the meetings between White House and congressional leaders have  amounted to on-the-job training in budget-making and possible ways to cut as  much as $50 billion from the deficit expected for the year starting Oct. 1.  </P> <P> With the negotiating phase at hand, however, Democratic lawmakers said they  assumed that the next step would be for Budget Director Richard G. Darman to  put forward an offer to get the bargaining process moving.  </P> <P> "We understand and hope we'll have a proposal from the President," said Sen.  Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) after Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) predicted that  serious negotiations would begin this afternoon.  </P> <P> Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), chairman of the House Budget Committee  and a key participant in the meetings, said a Darman proposal would have to  reflect the serious nature of the fiscal crisis facing the country.  </P> <P> Today will mark "a critical moment -- what happens in that session will tell us  an awful lot about whether we engage in frank negotiations or there is going to  be a breakdown," Panetta told reporters.  </P> <P> "It's very important for the Administration to provide a starting point," he  said.  </P> <P> In a related development, House advocates of a balanced budget amendment to the  Constitution claimed success in their drive to force a House vote on the  proposal to bar deficit spending unless it is approved by 60% majorities in the  House and Senate.  </P> <P> The legislation, bottled up for years in the House Judiciary Committee, was  pried loose with the aid of a rarely used procedure known as a discharge  petition. It requires the signatures of 218 members -- a bare majority of the  House.  </P> <P> "This is the most significant event in Congress this year," said Rep. C.  Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a leader in the effort to collect the  signatures.  </P> <P> A showdown on the Bush-backed constitutional change is expected sometime in  July. A similar amendment was approved last week by the Senate Judiciary  Committee on an 11-3 vote, and both sides said they expect a close vote when it  comes to the Senate floor later this year.  </P> <P> Proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds majority approval in both  chambers and must be ratified by 38 states before they take effect.  </P> <P> Although this is a stringent requirement, proponents of the balanced budget  amendment said chances of approval this year are better than ever.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Approximately 30 days after the Constitutional Court  [CC] legalized personal drug use, yesterday, the government  issued a decree aimed at strengthening essential prevention  programs and restricting drug consumption and possession in the  country.    Workers will immediately be fired upon proof of drug  consumption, and professionals will lose their practicing  licenses. Likewise, yesterday, the government yesterday minors  and pregnant and nursing women from consuming and possessing  drugs. It also forbad the use of psychotropic substances at  elementary and high schools, malls, restaurants, bars, night  clubs, taverns, recreation centers, and all public places in  general.    All education centers nationwide were granted a 30-day  period  to adopt the necessary measures to curb drug consumption in any  of its forms as part of their internal statutes. The government  also banned drug consumption in all sports activities in the  country. The same measure applies to prisons, businesses, and  other workplaces.    According to the decree, those who violate restrictions on  drug consumption could be admonished, fined, and even expelled  from where they are, whether a school or a public place. In  addition, the government decided those who are caught driving a  vehicle while under the influence of drugs could be detained by  authorities for a period of up to 24 hours and sentenced to pay  a minimum of up to 20 salaries. In addition, their driver  licenses could even be suspended.    Last night, Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez said: "Drug  consumption is not a basic right, but we are warning the  objective of the decree is merely to establish certain  restrictions to the CC ruling rather than challenging it." Those  laws that penalize drug sales, trafficking, production, and  distribution within the country are in effect, and the  government will not hesitate to enforce them against those who  violate them.    Meanwhile, Drug Director Gabriel de Vega Pinzon has said  strategies of integral production against drug addiction will be  reinforced to protect the people's basic rights, which could be  affected by drug problems. He added that within the framework  of antidrug strategies, we are progressing in tangible  prevention and rehabilitation programs in Medellin, Atlantico,  Caldas, Cali, Huila, and Santander.  <H5>  Restrictions </H5>   The decree prohibits drug possession, trafficking, and  consumption in the country's public and private schools. School  officials will be in charge of reporting cases of drug  possession and consumption. In case minors are caught with  drugs, school officials will notify their parents. Student  penalties could range from admonition to expulsion, including  suspension. Moreover, all schools will include drug prevention  subjects in their curriculum.    Governors and mayors, with the coordination of the Education  Ministry, will verify the development of prevention programs at  schools and impose pertinent disciplinary measures.</p>

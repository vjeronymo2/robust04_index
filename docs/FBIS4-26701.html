			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police  Administration, yesterday [25 June] said: The Chinese Communists  executed four Taiwan nationals on charges of drug smuggling, but  the Chinese Communists have not informed Taiwan's police of the  arrests, investigations, trials, or executions of the four  persons. The National Police Administration currently has no  way of knowing how many, if any, Taiwan nationals are still  being detained by the Chinese Communists for involvement in drug  cases. Lu Yu-chun added: Because talks concerning criminals  between the two sides have not yielded practical results, and  because of the lack of established procedures, the two sides  currently still follow precedents in repatriating criminals.  Because no felony criminals from the mainland are currently in  Taiwan or are being detained by Taiwan's police, the Chinese  Communists are not likely to inform us of the number of Taiwan  nationals currently detained by them. The Chinese Communists  did not inform us before executing the four Taiwan nationals on  drug smuggling charges, and we do not know if there are any  Taiwan nationals currently being detained by them on drug  smuggling charges.    Responding to a report by Chinese Communist official media  about the execution of four Taiwan nationals yesterday in Xiamen  for drug trafficking, Lin Kui-mei, head of the legal service  department of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], said: There  has been more than one case in which Taiwan residents were  executed on the mainland for committing crimes but we have never  been officially informed. We learned of those cases through  media reports or after people asked us for assistance. The  Chinese Communists have judicial rights to punish Taiwan  residents committing offenses on the mainland. The SEF has been  told that some Taiwan residents were executed on the mainland  for drug trafficking or for counterfeiting renminbi. An  official of the Mainland Affairs Committee said the Chinese  Communists should inform us through the SEF of any Taiwan  residents executed on the mainland, for courtesy and respect  purposes. He said this matter can be discussed at future  general affairs consultations between the two sides.</p>

Luan Shaholli, chairman of the PS  Management Committee for Tirana, commenting on the police's  negative response to the rally planned for today, hoped that the  Constitutional Court will now issue a pronouncement on the  "repeated violations of the law by the police." Thus, on the  day before the trial of Fatos Nano, a day that the PS Management  Committee has declared "a day of nationwide protest against  violations of basic human rights and freedom," the party's  leaders are obliged to issue an appeal not to organize "illegal  activities." Nonetheless, "we will continue to demand permits  for rallies, even though we have hitherto been given arbitrary  refusals," PS Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi said. Meanwhile,  the Public Order Ministry issued a statement the day before  yesterday laying particular stress on incitements to illegal  assemblies just before the Nano trial and warning that it "will  use the force of the law against anyone who attempts to exert  pressure against Albanian justice."    The public announcement of today's gathering in Skenderbeg  Square first appeared in the pages of the Socialist newspaper  ZERI I POPPULIT. However, the PS leaders say that the replies  from the Public Order Ministry and from the capital city's First  and Second Police Commissariats refusing permission for this  rally came on Tuesday [2 March]. "Concerning the 4 March rally,  we will act according to the law," Luan Shahollari told GAZETA  SHQIPTARE, "but we will also denounce these negative replies in  our press." According to Shahollari, the publication of the  negative replies from the police would be more than enough to  contact the people who had earlier been informed about the rally  to be held in Skenderbeg Square. Meanwhile, PS Deputy Chairman  Servet Pellumbi said that people interested in the rally would  in the normal course of events realize that permission for it  had been refused because "the rally can only take place if the  people organizing it appear and make their speeches." Pellumbi  said that requests to hold this rally will be repeated every  day, regardless of refusals, but he again appealed, "Our  guideline is to always behave in accordance with the law, thus  avoiding all kinds of confrontation.    While the police have now refused permission for the rally  in  Tirana, PS management comittees in many other districts have  asked for identical rallies in their respective towns. "As the  PS Management Committee decided," Pellumbi said, "almost all  districts have made requests to hold peaceful assemblies, but we  still have not been informed in which towns they have been  approved." Meanwhile, the Public Order Ministry spokesman has  denounced the PS and its newspaper for "continually issuing  calls for and inciting illegal assemblies on the threshold of  the trials of Fatos Nano, Ramiz Alia, and the other blockmen  [former Albanian Workers Party leadership]."    The Public Order Ministry had meanwhile guaranteed order,  calm, and stability to the judiciary in its work, also warning  that "All those breaking the law will answer to the law, whoever  they may be."</p>

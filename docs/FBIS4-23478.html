			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier Raul Dique from the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] has denied reports that he was detained and  assaulted by his troops in the Mocubela assembly area in  Zambezia Province. He denied the report in a telephone  interview with Radio Mozambique on his return to Maputo from  Zambezia.    [Begin recording] [Dique] It is true that I was in Mocubela.  On my return to Maputo via Beira I was surprised by reports  appearing in the media. In Beira, there are reports that I am  dead, and here in Maputo, there are reports that I was beaten  and so on. That is not true. It is true that I left for Beira  aboard a UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] plane on 1 June.  From Beira, I left for Mocubela by helicopter. There was a  small agitation by Renamo troops there. The reason for this was  that a Unomoz monitor stationed at the assembly area told the  troops waiting to be demobilized that they would receive a  subsidy of 75,000 meticals for six months instead of 35,000  meticals for three months.    When the demobilization team went to Mocubela and began  paying 35,000 meticals for three months for a simple soldier,  the troops were infuriated because the Unomoz monitor had always  told them that they would receive 75,000 meticals for six  months. They asked for clarification and they rioted against  the demobilization team.    When I received the information, I went there and clarified  the matter. I told them that the monitor was wrong and that the  truth was that they should receive 35,000 meticals for three  months.    [Unidentified correspondent] But we received information  that  you were assaulted. Is that true?    [Dique] I was not assaulted. I am in very good shape. I  wish the people in the media could see me physically. I was not  beaten. The truth is that when the troops became infuriated they  surrounded their commander and people thought that he was being  assaulted. That is not true. I can present myself to the media  at any time and you will see that I am in good shape, without  any wounds or bruises. [end recording]</p>

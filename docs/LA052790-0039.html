			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REELING FROM INVASION BY HOLLYWOOD CREWS  </P> <P> In Patt Morrison's article "Mad About the Movies" (May 18), a major point is  missed. It is not the occasional film crew that disturbs residents, but the  tendency to pick a specific location and then use it ad nauseam.  </P> <P> Such was the case in our neighborhood, where we have had a constant invasion of  nighttime shoots that are noisy and disruptive.  </P> <P> With the cost of property and the tax base we pay, I certainly think residents  are entitled to some rest.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, words mean nothing to the movie crews, and the city is totally  insensitive to the issuance of permits. Only by asking for outrageous amounts  of money can neighbors prevail and make certain locations "undesirable." I  assure you that in many cases it is not greed but desire to be left alone.  </P> <P> DR. LESLEY Z. BLUMBERG, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

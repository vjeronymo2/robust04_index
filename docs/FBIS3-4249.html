			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Police were out in force as thousands of investors  flocked to Beijing's first public share issue yesterday morning,  aiming to avert a repeat of the stock riots which rocked  Shenzhen in August 1992.    More than 300 specially designated banks and credit  co-operatives were open yesterday, each selling lottery tickets  for one of four stocks on offer in the one billion yuan (about  HK$885 million) [Hong Kong dollars] issue.    The four companies offering shares are Beijing Department  Store, Beijing Town and Country Trade Centre, Beiren Co, and  Beijing Light Bus Co.    Eager investors started queuing for tickets about 6 am and  while some pushing and shoving was reported when the doors  opened at 9 am, the sale went ahead without serious incidents.    Public security officers and municipal officials were  stationed at each of the issuing locations to maintain order  following a massive government propaganda campaign last week  designed to convince residents that everyone had an equal chance  to buy shares.    "We have done everything in our power to make sure this  event  goes off smoothly," a city government official said yesterday.    "We have certainly learned from the experience of Shenzhen  and are confident this issue will be a success."    Prospectuses for the four state-run enterprises issuing  shares were printed in the BEIJING DAILY newspaper, with  detailed explanations of the lottery system and warnings that  stock prices could go down as well as up.    Sale of lottery tickets will take three days, after which  drawing of the winning tickets will be shown on television and  the results published in newspapers.    Most potential investors interviewed yesterday were happy  with the lottery system which requires buyers to place a 200  yuan, six-month deposit at the bank for each ticket, but some  felt the system still could be open to abuse.    The Beijing Department Store, located in the city's premier  Wangfujing shopping district, will issue 50 million shares, but  analysts said it was doubtful if the stock would prove popular.  Although the store, built in 1955, had a sales volume of 1.1  billion yuan last year analysts say it suffers from poor  management and the building needs renovation.    The Beijing Town and Country Trade Centre, on the other  hand,  is likely to attract considerable investor interest.    The massive department store located at Gongzhufen serves  the  rapidly growing residential area of western Beijing and last  year recorded profits of 52 million yuan.    Town and Country also plans to issue 50 million shares and  analysts expect the issue to be oversubscribed.    Another sought-after stock will be Beiren Co. China's  largest  printing machinery producer, which successfully listed 100  million shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange last July.    The fourth stock is Beijing Light Bus Co. which produces 17  percent of all China's mini-buses and last year made profits of  22.3 million yuan.    Beijing Light Bus plans to issue 40 million shares and  invest  the capital raised in renovation of its ageing plant.</p>

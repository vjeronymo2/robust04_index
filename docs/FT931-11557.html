			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: China condemns Nafta as threat to global trade THE North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is a threat to the global trading system and could shrink the amount of capital and technology flowing into China, a leading Chinese newspaper warned yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing. The economic grouping of the US, Canada and Mexico is a blow to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to the Guangming Daily. China should counter the threat by gaining a foothold in the North American market before Nafta formally takes effect next year. The paper said trade with North America accounted for 12.26 per cent of China's total, excluding a huge volume of trade that passed through Hong Kong. The US is a key source of capital and technology. China and Mexico produce many similar goods for export. The newspaper argued that Mexican manufacturers would enjoy a competitive advantage within Nafta. China is pressing hard to be allowed back into Gatt, which it quit after the Communists took power. It has adopted a series of market-opening measures over the past year and is strengthening copyright protection laws.</p>

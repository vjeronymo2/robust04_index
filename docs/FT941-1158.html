			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statutory interest is no answer to late payments Sir, In the November budget the chancellor announced the publication of a paper discussing the merits of statutory interest on the late payment of accounts. Replies are requested by March 31 1994. Late payment of accounts is a serious handicap to the speed of the recovery. In particular it hits at the viability of small businesses. At first sight the idea might appear to have merits. However, on closer examination legislation would perform a disservice to small enterprises. The reasoning behind this is as follows. All businesses already have the ability to charge for late payment through their terms and conditions. Any statutory rate is likely to be at 8 per cent (the rate of interest used by the courts) whereas businesses are free to charge a far higher figure. Enforcement of a statutory charge would have to be through the courts which is the present position. A statutory rate is likely to lead to demands from larger customers for extended credit terms. SMEs would be caught between pressures for earlier payment by suppliers and later payment from customers. Many SMEs are reluctant to press for payment and are unlikely to change their ways. Statutory interest might be seen to sanction late payment. Statutory interest could provide a further excuse for inadequate credit control. Legislation would erode freedom of contract. There is already far too much government interference in commerce without inviting further regulation. Despite the apparently harsh economic climate few SMEs admit to, or suffer from, slow payment, amazing as this may sound. It is in the interest of all companies to say no to statutory interest.

He also suggested a concerted move by the petroleum  exporting  countries to reverse the downward trend of the oil price.    The emir of Qatar welcomed the proposal saying he would do  everything possible, including a production cut, to ensure that  oil prices would rise.    Besharati conveyed to Al Thani the greetings of Iranian  President Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, and said  that the ties between the two countries are based on mutual  respect and non-interference in each other's affairs.    He said that the recent setting up of the Bushehr-Doha  shipping line between the two countries should speed up trade  and related ties between the two countries.    The Qatari ruler welcomed the idea of Iranian exports to his  country and extended an invitation from Hojjat ol-Eslam  Rafsanjani to visit his emirate.    Later today, the Iranian minister met the Qatari heir  apparent Shaykh Bin-Hamad Khalifah Al Thani and discussed  promotion of economic and political ties between the two  countries.    In the meeting which was also attended by the Qatari  interior  minister, Shaykh Hamad called for promotion of Tehran-Doha ties  in accordance with international laws, and appreciated Iran's  support for Qatar's principled stands.    He also referred to Iran's relations with the United Arab  Emirates, saying Qatar was making efforts to prevent  exploitation of the issue of the three Persian Gulf islands,  although it appreciates iran's sincere stand in this regard.    Regional countries should cooperate with each other and  should realize that economic development depends on security in  the region, said the Qatari heir apparent.    In the evening, Besharati accompanied by his Qatari  counterpart visted the police headquarters.</p>

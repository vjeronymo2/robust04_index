			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, 16 Mar (AFP) -- Some 300 foreign students of  the University of Lagos, including women, have been in the  streets of Lagos today because they have nowhere to go following  the closure of their university indefinitely, some of the  students told AFP.    The university was closed by the authorities on 12 March  following violent clashes at the university between students and  members of secret cults on the campus, leaving several dozen  students seriously wounded.    "We thought foreign students would be exempt, but to our  great surprise we were led out of the campus by the security  forces," Albert Aboudem Atemkeng (Gambia), stated the secretary  general of the Association of Foreign Students at the University  of Lagos.    Among the students are Liberians, Egyptians, Mauritanians,  Indians, Palestinians, Ghanaians, Gambians, Cameroonians,  Sudanese, Ugandans, Nigerois, Zambians, Kenyans, Beninese,  Pakistanis, Tanzanians, South Africans, and Equatorial Guineans.    Last night, they were all forced to sleep in front of the  offices of the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR], a French  language student reported. A UNHCR source told AFP that the  humanitarian organization may probably not be able to help the  students since its mission is limited to refugees.    Most of these students now in the streets have modest  incomes  and cannot meet the demands of such an unexpected situation with  their own resources, Joseph Chefu (Cameroon), a law student  stated. He expressed the view that the university must grant  them some favor as is done by universities for foreign students  throughout the world.    This is the second time foreign students at the University  of  Lagos were expelled at the same time as the nationals following  the closure of the university. The first time was in May 1992  during student demonstrations against the government.</p>

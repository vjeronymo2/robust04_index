			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Technology: Strength in numbers - Charles Arthur describes why British academics are working to unleash the power of parallel software If you wanted a wall built, would you hire a team of bricklayers, or would you hire a sprinter like Carl Lewis and teach him to lay bricks? The answer may seem obvious, but in computing, most companies with increasingly complex problems - such as mapping air-flow over surfaces, determining what happens in an engine cylinder or controlling large networks of computers - opt for the latter approach, buying ever-faster machines which solve huge equations a piece at a time. The alternative, splitting up the problem and parcelling it out in parallel, is both cheaper and in many cases quicker. However, conventional computing has gone for the Carl Lewis (or serial) approach because parallel machines are much more difficult to build and program. Also, users have so much invested in their existing methods that they find it hard to justify investigating an alternative. Now, though, some of the UK's brightest academic computing brains have come together in four new university centres around the country - in Southampton, Edinburgh, Oxford and London - with the aim of finding industrial partners for collaborative projects, and giving the UK a lead in developing parallel software. It is not a trivial pursuit; many believe parallel systems will eventually supersede conventional large-scale computers, as the amount of data being processed outstrips the growth in conventional computer power. The academics' first task is to persuade industry that they are serious. 'This is not a bunch of airy-fairy academics with Einstein haircuts,' says Colin Upstill, director of Southampton University's parallel applications centre, the first of the four to open in Britain last October. 'When I was an undergraduate in the 1970s, some of the professors couldn't boil an egg. But these are the new generation who are very sharp wheeler-dealers. The economic climate of the 1970s and 1980s has driven them this way.' In line with those climate changes, the centres' Pounds 13m of public funding (Pounds 9m from the Department of Trade and Industry, and Pounds 4m from the Science and Engineering Research Council) only lasts four years, after which they must become self-financing. In the meantime, the industrial partners are expected to spend Pounds 21m collaborating on the projects. Upstill describes the scheme, and the collaborations it creates, as offering an 'electronic wind tunnel' with 'extended test drives for industry'. The universities benefit by gaining expertise, sharing intellectual property rights and publishing some of their results. Meanwhile, companies lacking the resources or expertise can try out parallel computing. 'Anybody with the right money could buy the same equipment as we have,' he says. 'But on its own that doesn't get results.' However, persuading industry of that is still difficult. Bob McLatchie, executive director of Oxford University's Parallel Centre (which opened for business last month), says: 'Going to companies and saying: 'It's a coding thing, we're good for you,' doesn't work. The ones that have joined us recognise that they're in a fix. You have to identify a key, critical problem.' That has worked at companies including BP, Shell, BT, British Gas, Lucas Aerospace, Sharp, British Aerospace and Unilever. The centres aim to add more names to the list in the coming months. Parallel computing does offer great opportunities. To return to the wall-building analogy, if you wanted the wall built faster, you would hire more bricklayers; in computing terms, this is a 'scaleable' problem. Most computer-intensive tasks, such as weather forecasting, molecular modelling and even database analysis are scaleable, and applying parallel processing achieves impressive results. Though there are an increasing number of parallel machines (often dubbed 'minisupercomputers') on offer, usually from US suppliers, skills in parallel programming are still in desperately short supply. 'It's not like programming a PC,' comments Kevin Collins, commercial manager at Edinburgh Parallel. 'It's not a commodity industry at the software level.' While the centres can boast an array of parallel machines - including the Meiko 'computing surface' running the Oracle database, the Intel iPSC/860 parallel supercomputer and systems centred around the British-built (and now French-Italian owned) Inmos transputer - the loyalty is to software and ideas. The news that Inmos plans to close its factory in Wales and shift production elsewhere provokes little response. 'If you told me Inmos would move to France but the T9000 (the improved version of the transputer) would appear tomorrow, I would say 'Great, go',' says one centre's manager. Possibly the most interesting collaboration at Southampton is the one which sounds most mundane; its ordinary nature disguises its wide applicability. Few companies will have to carry out analysis of geosensory data like BP; few will worry about combustion in a jet engine like Lucas Aerospace. But all will have to handle growing amounts of data about customers and suppliers. British Gas is performing analysis and extraction trials on two dummy databases, one of around 1 Gigabyte (1,000 Mbytes) which mirrors its database on buying and selling gas from North Sea suppliers, and another of about 5 Gbyte, which reflects the size of the one on nationwide sales of gas to commercial premises. Currently they run on IBM mainframes and minicomputers from Digital Equipment. 'We're intrigued by the claims that parallel machines can outperform conventional mainframes by a factor of 50,' says Tony Fincham, consultant to British Gas's maths and computing division. 'The benefits are that we could do what we now do faster, and do more complex database operations. People are always thinking of more elaborate ways to look at data, for example for management information. And the applications are always eating up more computer power.' If these trials work, the eventual target is the corporation's customer service and billing database - which takes up a mighty 12 Gbyte. 'By 2000, with advances in computer technology and optoelectronic and telecoms technology, the hardware will be able to do anything. But the problem will be programming, which is where we come in,' says Upstill. To that end, all of the centres have brought in people from industry, often at a high level. Collins worked for Parsys, which makes parallel machines. Upstill, previously with Plessey, has hired programmers with commercial and defence experience able to program and document code to BS 5750 (the British Standards Institution quality assurance standard). 'That means they know about commercial confidence and security. We are not amateurs,' he emphasises. The four-year deadline gives each centre an interest in being, or appearing to be, pre-eminent. 'There are blue-chip customers and blue-chip applications at stake,' Jackson says. From 1996, the centres will be allowed to produce commercial software, and might even be spun off as separate companies. 'We're not competing with business or trying to put people out of work,' says Upstill. 'We want to push this technology that the UK is good at.'</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Chechens say border crossed Leaders of the Chechen republic yesterday claimed that more than 30 Russian armoured vehicles had entered their territory. Speaking on the telephone from Grozny, the Chechen capital, Mr Ayub Satuev, the minister of the interior, claimed that the vehicles were operated by Russian soldiers. Mr Satuev said the equipment would be given to the Russian-backed opposition forces, which control some Chechen territory and are trying to oust President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Over the past month Moscow has waged a fierce rhetorical battle against the breakaway Chechen state, whose ability to maintain effective independence for nearly three years is seen as an affront. Opposition leaders, who have been handing out cash provided by the Russian government to their supporters, have said that they plan to hold a demonstration in Grozny, Mr Dudayev's stronghold, on Thursday. Observers believe that the demonstration could develop into an armed showdown. The situation has been complicated by the recent return of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former chairman of the Russian parliament. A sworn enemy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and a native of Chechnya, Mr Khasbulatov is trying to make a political comeback.</p>

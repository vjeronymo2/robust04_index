			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / India's exports up 3.6% India's exports grew by just 3.61 per cent to Dollars 18.4bn (Pounds 11.9bn) in the year to March, far short of the government's target of 15 per cent, according to figures published by the Commerce Ministry, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. The reformist government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, sees export expansion as a key motor for India's economic growth. However, export growth was held back in the year to March by a slump in sales to the countries of the former Communist bloc and by inter-religious violence in Bombay and elsewhere. Imports in the year grew 12.05 per cent to Dollars 21.7bn, leaving an overall trade deficit of Dollars 3.3bn.</p>

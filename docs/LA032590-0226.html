			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / SEAL BEACH CITY COUNCIL;  </P> <P> HOUSING PLAN DIVIDES CANDIDATES IN QUIET RACE;  </P> <P> EIGHT ARE VYING FOR TWO OPEN SEATS. THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN NOTICEABLY FREE OF  THE CITY'S OFTEN-DIVISIVE POLITICS OF THE LAST 20 YEARS.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon to hear residents here refer to their seaside community as  an island, but when it comes to politics, few would describe the city as a  paradise.  </P> <P> Tuesday's City Council election, however, is shaping up to be different from  many others in recent years. Eight candidates are vying for two open seats and  are evenly split on the hottest election issue, a huge proposed housing  development.  </P> <P> Still, the campaign has been noticeably free of the often-divisive politics of  the last 20 years -- two decades that included a recall of three council  members and a bitter 1988 fight over a slow-growth initiative.  </P> <P> "This election is a lot more quiet than some people thought it would be. People  were all geared up for more mudslinging," said candidate Douglas Hoxeng, who  has lived in Seal Beach for 31 years and runs a downtown tavern. "It's nice to  have the candidates get along."  </P> <P> The seats up for grabs represent two of the most diverse council districts in  Seal Beach, a city of distinctive neighborhoods that is an island surrounded by  the Naval Weapons Station, the San Gabriel River and the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> In District 1, which covers downtown and Surfside, the candidates are Orange  County planner Charles Antos, firefighter James Cook, property management  specialist Marilyn Bruce Hastings, tavern operator Hoxeng and engineering  contractor Joe Rullo.  </P> <P> In District 3, which covers part of the Leisure World retirement community and  the area just between Pacific Coast Highway and Gum Grove Park known locally as  the Hill, the candidates are financial controller Galen F. Ambrose, Planning  Commissioner Gwen Forsythe and insurance executive Dennis K. Pollman.  </P> <P> The current council members from the districts -- Victor S. Grgas and Joyce  Risner -- are prohibited from running again because of a two-term limit.  </P> <P> The mild tone of this election can be explained in part by a common campaign  theme: Keeping Seal Beach basically the way it is now.  </P> <P> Quality of life -- or what a recent newspaper real estate advertisement  described as the "charisma of Seal Beach living" -- has been the central issue  in much of the city's political battling.  </P> <P> All the candidates say they fear anything -- especially development -- that  might make the city an undesirable place.  </P> <P> "Seal Beach has been the same for the last 15 years and will essentially stay  that way," said Grgas, noting that there has been deep-seated opposition by  residents to major changes in the city.  </P> <P> The issue that divides the candidates is what to do with a 149-acre piece of  picturesque land in the heart of town. The Hellman Ranch property, one of the  few remaining chunks of developable land in the city, offers sweeping views of  downtown Long Beach and the surrounding beaches and is centrally located off  Seal Beach Boulevard, one of just two roads that directly connect Seal Beach  with the rest of the world.  </P> <P> In October, the City Council voted, 4-1, after months of hearings and debate,  to approve a 329-home project that sets aside 41 acres for wetlands  restoration.  </P> <P> Half the candidates are dissatisfied with that Mola Development Corp. plan. And  an Orange County Superior Court decision delivered March 16 may require the  incoming City Council to vote on the project, thrusting the Hellman plan on  center stage in the election.  </P> <P> Proponents of the development hail the project as far better than the original  773-unit plan and say it represents a fair balance of environmental and  commercial concerns.  </P> <P> "This is a good compromise. It's important to be open and receptive to all  sides," said Forsythe, who helped work out an agreement between Mola and the  city and believes it represents the best deal the city can get.  </P> <P> Other supporters of the compromise are Cook, Rullo and Pollman, all of whom  stressed that they are for controlled slow growth but believe that some  development is needed to provide more city revenue.  </P> <P> Most supporters of the plan say the Mola project will not harm the city and  fear what other kind of development could be built on the private land. "My  main concern is that if it isn't Mola, what is going to go in there?" Rullo  said.  </P> <P> For critics of the project, however, the compromise does not go far enough in  addressing environmental and traffic concerns. Ambrose, Antos, Hastings and  Hoxeng oppose the project, saying they would like a plan that offers more  wetlands and fewer homes.  </P> <P> "Although property owners have rights, any development must be acceptable to  the community, because the (residents) inherit any problems," Antos said.  </P> <P> The staunchest development foe is Ambrose, who has made the evils of  development the centerpiece in his campaign.  </P> <P> As vice president of the Seal Beach-based Wetlands Restoration Society, he  helped prepare the lawsuit that resulted in the Superior Court ruling that is  forcing the city to revise its outdated General Plan and review the Mola  development for a second time.  </P> <P> "Seal Beach is in a crisis . . . as massive developments go through that will  change our city," Ambrose said at an election forum. "Is the city of Seal Beach  going to sell itself like a whore to the first person who comes along with a  checkbook?"  </P> <P> Mola foes say they believe that the project will cause traffic, pollution and  even crime in the city of 26,000 people and that the diplomatic attitude taken  by project backers will lead to overdevelopment.  </P> <P> "People are concerned about traffic on Seal Beach Boulevard once this thing is  in," Hastings said. "When they're done, I don't know if anyone is going to get  through if there's an emergency. The traffic will be terrible."  </P> <P> Grgas, who supports Rullo, described some of the statements made by anti-growth  candidates as "hysteria" and said the city could be vulnerable legally if it  tries to violate people's property rights.  </P> <P> Because of the General Plan revisions, it is uncertain whether the vote on the  Hellman Ranch plan will come before the current council or the newly elected  council, which will take office May 15. Both supporters and opponents of the  Mola development agree that the project faces an uncertain future if  anti-growth forces win at the polls.  </P> <P> Grgas and Risner were part of the 4-1 majority that supports the project. Their  open seats could make possible a shift to a 3-2 majority against the plan.  </P> <P> Growth has traditionally been a hot issue in Seal Beach. A 1988 initiative that  would have restricted the City Council's power to vote on certain development  issues prompted a furious and divisive campaign. The measure ultimately failed  at the polls.  </P> <P> However, the current debate over development is tame in comparison with the  politics of the mid-1970s, when pro- and anti-growth candidates repeatedly  clashed over the General Plan.  </P> <P> Earlier that decade, three city councilmen were recalled and two city managers  were ousted in power struggles over control of the council.  </P> <P> In this year's election, other issues have been discussed in the race besides  development, but there seems to be more agreement on them. Most candidates have  called for better communications between the council and the citizens, and many  support repairing old sidewalks and maintaining strong police and fire  departments.  </P> <P> "The infrastructure is a less-than-glamorous thing, but it still must be taken  care of," Cook said.  </P> <P> Hastings, Antos and Cook have focused attention on the loss of sand on several  city beaches, calling for sand replacement and other measures. Hoxeng and  Pollman have stressed their ties to the Seal Beach business community and say  they would best represent all the elements of the city.  </P> <P> Pollman wants the city to sponsor athletics programs for teen-agers as a  deterrent to drugs.  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES  </P> <P> On Tuesday, voters in Seal Beach's District 1 and District 3 go to the polls to  elect two new members to the City Council.  </P> <P> District 1 covers the downtown and Surfside areas and has 3,052 registered  voters.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both of the California agencies recommended that proposed 23 CFR 658.23(b)(5), which would allow tow trucks and vehicles in tow to operate on the NN without regard to the freeze on length, be amended to require a State permit to operate overlength. This is unnecessary since 23 CFR 658.23(b)(5) merely means that they are not limited to whatever length was allowed and in use on June 1, 1991. Since they also are not STAA vehicles, the State may regulate their length in any manner it sees fit, including the requirement for a permit, if it wishes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington DOT asked if tow truck operations are restricted to the length and weight in effect on June 1, 1991. As stated in the SNPRM, emergency towing operations are excluded from any of the freeze provisions in appendix C. However, the proposed provisions in paragraph (b) of 23 CFR 658.23 only excluded tow trucks from the length provisions of appendix C. In order to fully exclude emergency towing operations from any of the provisions contained in new 23 CFR 658.23, the underlined phrase in paragraph (a)(1) has been added: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> except for tow trucks with vehicles in tow <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also, in paragraph (b)(5) ``with'' has been substituted for ``and.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Pole Trailers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the SNPRM the FHWA proposed to list, as the authorized length for expandable trailers used for carrying poles, logs or pipe, etc. (pole trailers), the lengths allowed by State law, even if these limits refer to the cargo rather than the vehicle itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only five sets of comments were received which specifically addressed the issue of pole trailers. The South Dakota DOT supported the position that the State-allowed length of the cargo should be considered the cargo-carrying length of the unit. The State added that the FHWA should establish a national cargo overhang policy similar to that in effect for automobile and boat transporters; that is, 3 feet in front and 4 feet to the rear of the vehicle. The Pennsylvania DOT commented that its special length limitation (70 feet) for any combination transporting nondivisible articles has been in place for over 20 years, and that it should be listed as Pennsylvania's length for these vehicles. The California Highway Patrol provided that State's applicable length limits for pole or log trailers. Taking a different tack, both the ATA and the WTA stated in their comments that pole trailers should not be considered or regulated as LCV's. The ATA stated that the ``FHWA is incorrect in believing that establishing length limits for pole trailers is consistent with the purpose of section 4006 of ISTEA.'' In addition to echoing the ATA's comment, the WTA went on to state that the FHWA's proposal with regard to regulating pole trailers as an LCV, ``does not recognize that timber harvesters do not cut logs in the same lengths all the time. Utility poles transported by telephone and power companies are not the same length and neither are the joints of pipe used in oil well drilling, pipe line construction and water and sewer line repair and construction.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA has re-examined this issue. In the SNPRM, the FHWA admitted that the statutory language concerning the freeze is not readily applicable to such vehicles. The discussion of pole trailers and the inclusion of these vehicles in the SNPRM was based on an interpretation that the two cross-members on which the cargo rests constitute individual cargo-carrying units for purposes of section 4006 of the ISTEA. That argument is difficult to maintain. In fact, the hitch, the load, and rear dolly combine to create a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> semitrailer. The FHWA has decided not to include these vehicles in appendix C, as truck tractor-semitrailers are not subject to the requirements of the freeze. Two separate pole trailers pulled by a tractor, however, must comply with section 4006.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Further Restrictions on ISTEA Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ISTEA provides that States may further restrict, or even prohibit, the operation of LCV's or CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units after June 1, 1991. Such restrictions, however, must be consistent with sections 411, 412, and 416(a) of the STAA. This means that States may not prohibit twin trailer combinations with trailers not over 28 feet long (28.5 feet if grandfathered) from operating on the NN or reasonable access routes. States may not restrict the width of vehicles on the NN or reasonable access routes to less than 102 inches or the metric equivalent, 102.36 inches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State must notify the Secretary within 30 days after the imposition of further restrictions or prohibitions on the operation of LCV's or CMV's with two or more cargo-carrying units. The FHWA does not have approval authority over any additional restrictions a State may impose, but is required to publish such restrictions in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FHWA may require further information or clarification before publishing the restrictions in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No additional comments were received on this issue in response to the SNPRM. The proposed regulatory language in the SNPRM directly reflected congressional intent as expressed in the ISTEA. That language has been adopted unchanged by this final rule in &sect;658.23(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Minor Adjustments to Listed Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA allow States to make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature which will relax route designations and vehicle operating restrictions in effect on June 1, 1991. They also direct the Secretary to issue regulations establishing criteria for the States to follow in making such adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minor adjustments must be both temporary and caused by an emergency. According to the Conference Report on the ISTEA (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 314 (1991)), such adjustments are intended to be temporary and limited, e.g., a bridge failure that would require the rerouting of ISTEA vehicles to highways where they would otherwise be prohibited. Since it is impossible to foresee all types of emergencies that might necessitate a minor adjustment, and it is not the intent of the FHWA to establish a burdensome reporting requirement, the proposed regulation would require a State to report the details of an adjustment only if the duration was expected to exceed 30 days. Emergency adjustments with a duration of 30 days or less would not be reported to the FHWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

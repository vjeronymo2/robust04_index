			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / British Steel plans legal action to stop subsidies British Steel yesterday raised the stakes in its battle against state subsidies to its continental European rivals by announcing it plans to begin legal action later this week against the European Commission. The company will ask the European Court to annul the Commission's authorisation of further state subsidies to two steelmakers, Ilva of Italy and CSI of Spain. The two companies received the lion's share of Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.4bn) of aid approved by European Union industry ministers in December and authorised by the Commission in April. The move by British Steel steps up the pressure on the Commission, which has been widely criticised by unsubsidised producers for allowing subsidies that do not adhere to the strict rules of the steel aid code, part of the European Coal and Steel Community treaty. Earlier this month, the European Independent Steel Works Association, which represents privately owned, independent steel producers, said it was also taking the Commission to the court over subsidies to state-owned companies in Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal. The association has asked the court to rule that the aid be suspended immediately until the court has reached a final judgment on the legality of the subsidies, a process that could take two to three years. British Steel said it was acting because it had no other means remaining to express its dissatisfaction about European steel subsidies. 'We cannot get the politicians to address the problem, so we are forced to go to the court,' Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday. The company's assault appears to be a high-risk strategy, as it cannot be guaranteed victory even if, as Mr Moffat said, 'the arguments are basically with us'. But British Steel made clear its aim was to stop any further aid by using the Italian and Spanish subsidy approvals as test cases. If British Steel wins, Commission officials would have a precedent to help them turn down future requests for state aid. But Mr Moffat hopes the case will cause member states 'at least to look more than once' at using Article 95 of the treaty, which allows state subsidies to be paid to companies but only after unanimous consent from the Council of Ministers. The Commission insisted yesterday it had acted legally under Article 95 of the treaty. British Steel made its own decision to begin the action, but it is understood that the UK government was consulted. British Steel's move coincided with its announcement of pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m for the year ended April 2, compared with a Pounds 149m loss a year earlier. The news helped the company's shares buck the trend in a falling stock market, rising 5 3/4 p to 139p.

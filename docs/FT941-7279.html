			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Observer: Major's Willies Lord Whitelaw, grand old man of Tory politics, appears to be enjoying his return to the political limelight. Just two weeks ago, he forced Michael Howard into a humiliating retreat on his plans to shake up the police. Now Observer learns that Willie, as Lady Thatcher always called him, is determined to have a say in the cabinet reshuffle which will follow the inevitable Tory defeats in the local and European elections. He is preparing to tell John Major that, however much the prime minister admires Lord Archer's campaigning skills, the extrovert novelist and former MP must not be given the party chairmanship. With his own position so precarious, Major will ignore such advice at his peril. Downing Street insiders say that makes David Hunt a racing certainty for the Central Office hot seat - unless Michael Heseltine can be persuaded to change his mind.</p>

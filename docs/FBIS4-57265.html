			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All names and titles as received] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 May (EFE) -- Argentine Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella today proposed to his Russian colleague, Andrey  Kozyrev, the reactivation of a mechanism for payment  compensation that the two countries signed but are not  implementing. He granted Russia a $30-million line of credit for  Argentine exports.    Di Tella told EFE that this mechanism ensures that credit  and  debt columns are closed and the difference is paid.    Argentina currently owes Russia about $150 million and  therefore wants to resume exports to Moscow.    The foreign minister added that the $30-million line of  credit is not included in the compensation mechanism that  Argentina wants to implement.    Di Tella stated that during today's political talks with  Kozyrev, on the first day of his three-day official visit to  Moscow, that he indicated the time has come to maintain complete  and fruitful relations because Russia has a greater trade  "focus."    The foreign minister stated earlier that Russia and  Argentina  are a part of the new world process in which rapprochement  between nations is made on the basis of peace, cooperation, and  mutual respect.    The Argentine foreign minister expressed surprise over the  situation in Russia which is much better than what one reads and  hears from afar--especially the remarks of the ultranationalist  Vladimir Yirinovsky, whose Liberal Democratic Party won the most  recent parliamentary elections.    "One can see that this country is moving and it will have a  lot of influence" when it overcomes its crisis in less time than  most people believe, Di Tella said.    The foreign minister stated that Russia is "a great power  with problems," but when it overcomes them "there is no doubt"  it will be one of the world's great powers.    Di Tella will meet with Vice Premier Alexandr Shojin on 17  May. During the meeting he will again discuss the economic  agreement and the viability of increasing Argentine exports to  Russia.    "I am discovering that no one is against reform," Di Tella  said, although they differ over time spans and tactics.    During his meeting today with the architects of these  reforms--Yegor Gaidar and economist Grigori Yablinski, who is  the leader of the moderate opposition--Di Tella plans to find  out "the depth of the dangers facing the reform."    Following his 14 May meetings with the progressive mayor of  Saint Petersburg and with his Russian colleague, Di Tella said  that "when one speaks with (Anatoly) Sobchak and Kozyrev, one  can see that they are sensible people."</p>

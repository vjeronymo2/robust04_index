			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Volatility continues There were wild swings in the exchange rates for the dollar, sterling and the Italian lira against the D-Mark last week and there may be further volatility in forthcoming days, writes James Blitz. Attention will focus on the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, with a strong expectation that the German central bank will cut its official rates after recent easing in its money market operations. However, many analysts believe that the the next figure for German M3 money supply will be in double figures and that an easing in rates is unlikely until Christmas. The uncertainty over the differential between German and US rates hangs over the dollar, sterling and the lira. The US did not ease interest rates last week, as had been expected, and the dollar rallied 8 pfennigs to a close of DM1.4880 in New York on Friday. Uncertainty over the November 3 Presidential election probably gives the dollar a limited upside. On Friday, the Italian lira closed at L874.4 to the D-Mark, 12 per cent higher than its low on Monday afternoon. But the near term outlook for the currency depends on the passing of the 1993 budget, which involves deficit cuts of 93 trillion lire. There will doubtless be periods of currency weakness until credibility is re-established. Sterling, which is also floating freely outside the European exchange rate mechanism, will be affected by the UK chancellor's appearance before a select committee of the House of Commons today, in which he could further outline the UK government's economic policy. Wednesday's industrial production number for August and Thursday's figure for September unemployment will illustrate the scale of the UK recession.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- The agreement to bury nuclear  waste on the territory of Russia, signed by Premier Chernomyrdin  in Hungary, is in line with the commitments which Russia, as the  Soviet Union's successor, has to fulfill. Vyacheslav Kostikov,  presidential press secretary, told a Kremlin briefing today at  the request of the Russian president and prime minister.    He said that the agreement, signed in Hungary, envisaged the  processing and utilisation of nuclear wastes from atomic power  plants built to Soviet blueprints in the Hungarian Republic.  ``Russia will avoid concluding such agreements as soon as the  terms of the existing international contracts expire,'' Kostikov  noted.</p>

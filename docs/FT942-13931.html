			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Pitman's long hand Suddenly the anxiety melted away. Lloyds Bank has not only found a sensible home for its surplus capital; it is buying a building society which is a sound strategic fit and offers the prospect of organic growth, so conspicuously lacking in recent years. As an added bonus, the field of candidates to succeed Mr Brian Pitman on his eventual retirement has been strengthened with the arrival of Mr Andrew Long-hurst, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's chief executive. Small wonder Lloyds' shares rose 9 per cent on the day. Since C&amp;G is willing to be bought, Lloyds is spared the need to pay a heavy bid premium. Moreover C&amp;G's mutual structure makes its market value difficult to ascertain. Lloyds has to offer enough to convince its members to vote in favour of the deal. It has been splashing its money around in a way that must seem impressive to individual savers. It appears to have struck a good deal just the same. The historic multiple of 13.6 which Lloyds is paying is hardly expensive when set against that of 15 on which Abbey National trades, even though C&amp;G's narrower focus makes it more exposed to mortgage margin pressure than Abbey. By the time C&amp;G's future retained earnings are factored in, Lloyds will be paying well under twice book value for an acquisition that should immediately enhance earnings. The combination of C&amp;G's low processing costs with cheap funding from Lloyds promises to create a formidable force in the mortgage market. The chances are that this will speed up the process of rationalisation of the building society sector. But that may not make life easier for banks like Abbey National and TSB which have been wondering about wading in. C&amp;G wanted to be bought, its management is being allowed to retain control of the business and no branch closures are planned. Such a fortunate combination of circumstances is rare and hostile bids for building societies remain as difficult as ever.</p>

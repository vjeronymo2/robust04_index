			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Break-ins at MPs' offices fuel conspiracy theories CLAIMS that the security services may have been involved in stealing computer data from Labour MPs' offices, yesterday fuelled pre-election hostility and distrust at Westminster. Labour MPs' fears that the party has been subjected to a surveillance operation were not eased by Liberal Democrat and Conservative revelations of burgled constituency offices. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, demanded that ministers launch an inquiry into why six Labour MPs' offices at Westminster were broken into and computer disks or other equipment tampered with. The MPs included Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, and Mr John Prescott, the party's transport spokesman. 'Who could have been interested in the Labour party's plans and strategy in the run-up to the general election? I think the answer can only be either the intelligence services supplying the Government or the Conservative party,' Mr Hain said on BBC radio. Mr Cunningham said there was 'no evidence' pointing to any particular organisation being responsible for the break-ins. 'I have made no political accusations and I am not responsible for the story emerging in the first place.' In spite of the Labour leadership's refusal to become involved and the scorn ministers poured on conspiracy theories, the allegations added to a frenzy of smear and counter-smear, sometimes bordering on the farcical. The allegations come at the start of what could become Britain's dirtiest general election campaign, with Labour and the Tories neck and neck in the opinion polls. At the weekend there were Labour claims of a Tory-inspired smear over opposition party links with the Kremlin in the early 1980s. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, dismissed suggestions of a political intelligence operation as 'nonsense' and 'symptomatic of the kind of hysteria that seems to have built up on the Labour side.' Only one break-in at Westminster had been reported to the Commons' authorities, he said. Conservative Central Office officials, however, confirmed last night that constituency offices in some marginal seats had been burgled in the past year.  Computer equipment and a microwave oven were stolen from the office of Bath MP, Mr Chris Patten, party chairman. The Liberal Democrats' election strategist, Mr Des Wilson, called for a tri-party pact to concentrate on issues, not smears. Asked about the burglaries, he said: 'I don't know and I don't care'. Party officials later said that constituency offices at Littleborough and Saddleworth had been broken into at the weekend and computer equipment stolen. Membership lists had also been stolen over the past year from the constituency offices of Mr Richard Livsey, MP for Brecon and Radnor, and Mr Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro. Last September, the membership list of the Liberal Democrats' councillors' association, stored on a hard computer disk in offices in Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, was also stolen.

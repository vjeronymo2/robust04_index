			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOJO MADNESS;  </P> <P> COURT JESTER OF ROCK TARGETS STARS FROM HENLEY TO ELVIS  </P> <P> The urge to kill Don Henley first hit Mojo Nixon as he watched the pony-tailed  former Eagle accept a Grammy for "Record of the Year."  </P> <P> The end of the innocence? How about the end of Don Henley?  </P> <P> "The Grammys really put me over the top. I didn't want to watch, but my wife  insisted," singer-songwriter Nixon recalled. "The whole thing just made me  furious. . . . Don Henley and Phil Collins and now George Michael -- they want  to be taken seriously."  </P> <P> The same can't be said of Nixon, who was inspired to write "Don Henley Must  Die" for his current album, "Otis." The song is a hysterical, screaming  indictment of "big, bloated Henley-esque rock stars," Mojo said.  </P> <P> "I haven't talked to Don directly, but he should be honored. Maybe we could get  together, have a couple of drinks, I don't know," said the 33-year-old Nixon  about Henley, whose "The End of the Innocence" took one of the top honors at  this year's Grammys.  </P> <P> It's not the first time Mojo, the self-described court jester of rock 'n' roll,  has taken aim at a well-known target.  </P> <P> His last album included "Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant With My Two-Headed Love  Child"; in "Elvis Is Everywhere," he branded Michael J. Fox "the anti-Elvis";  and he once suggested in song a drug-testing method for Nancy Reagan that is  too tasteless to print in a family newspaper.  </P> <P> Nixon said the surviving victims of his songs are generally good-natured. But a  few Elvis fans became irate over his homage to the King, which credited Presley  with creating Stonehenge, the pyramids and the Bermuda Triangle.  </P> <P> "Elvis and his fans are a little nutty, but that's what makes it great," said  Nixon, who last year set up a phone line for Elvis-spotters to call in their  sightings.  </P> <P> "We got 500 calls a day -- people with Elvis and Liberace at their house,  worshipping Jackie's hair. People with Elvis out front mowing the lawn. It's  great," Nixon said.  </P> <P> Nixon's experiences are not limited to music; he played the role of Jerry Lee  Lewis' drummer in "Great Balls of Fire," an experience that allowed him to hang  out with "The Killer."  </P> <P> "With Jerry Lee alive, you can't make the movie you want to see, because Jerry  Lee would kill you, and that wouldn't be good," Nixon explained.  </P> <P> "Jerry Lee was awfully good to me, but then I wasn't married to him."  </P> <P> Finally, there is Mojo's greatest fantasy: to become the target of the  record-stickering movement, to write the lyrics that drive Florida Gov. Bob  Martinez crazy.  </P> <P> "I've been striving for that," Nixon said. "I'm sending my records to Tipper  Gore and this idiot down in Florida, but it doesn't seem to be working."  </P></p>

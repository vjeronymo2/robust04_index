			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Franco-Spanish summit opens President Francois Mitterrand of France and Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, met yesterday to discuss European unity and stability in the Mediterranean. The talks between the two long-serving Socialist leaders in the south-western French town of Foix are their last bilateral summit before Mr Mitterrand steps down next May. The two opened the 4.8km-long Puymorens mountain tunnel in the Pyrenees as a symbol of co-operation between their two states. In interviews published to coincide with their two-day talks, both men repeated their disagreement with a proposal floated in Bonn to build the European Union on a 'hard core' group comprising Germany, France and Benelux. Mr Mitterrand's spokesman said Paris was also keen to co-ordinate with Madrid their forthcoming successive EU presidencies to ensure smooth preparations for the 1996 intergovernmental conference to reform Union institutions. Another issue at the summit will be security and co-operation in the Mediterranean, as both France and Spain fear they would take the brunt of massive emigration if strife in Algeria continued to worsen.</p>

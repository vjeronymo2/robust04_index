			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / SPD says Frankfurt caused jobs crisis LEADERS of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday stepped up their criticism of the monetary policy of the Bundesbank, accusing it of causing 'hundreds of thousands' of job losses in German industry. At the annual conference of the SPD, they called for a 'more appropriate external value' of the D-Mark to promote jobs, but denied that they were seeking an outright devaluation of the national currency. At the same time they warned of the need for 'massive cuts' in public sector consumption in the medium term, in order to bring the country's ballooning national debt under control. And they gave strong support to plans for a Europe-wide strategy on economic growth and job creation, calling for the proposals drawn up by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, to be strengthened and extended. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD and party spokesman on the economy, rounded on the Bundesbank in a statement of party strategy on job creation, intended as the basis of the next year's election platform. He said the high interest rates imposed by the central bank had made the D-Mark too strong. 'We should not always believe in the absolute wisdom of the Bundesbank,' he told the party conference in the spa town of Wiesbaden. 'It was a great mistake to have raised interest rates once again, at the beginning of the recession. That has cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs, because exports have collapsed.' He said that the effective revaluation of the D-Mark against other European currencies by some 10 per cent had the same effect on German export prices as a wage increase of 33 per cent. His extraordinary attack, in a country where the actions of the central bank are usually regarded as beyond criticism, was immediately backed by Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD party leader. 'It hits the nail on the head, especially in the European context,' he said. 'When I see how we have damaged the French economy with our high interest rates, I must say that was not clever. That was a policy focused on our own national navel, paying attention only to our own domestic conditions.' Mr Scharping denied that the party was calling for a devaluation of the D-Mark, in a resolution seeking 'lower interest rates and a more appropriate external value of the D-Mark. Mr Lafontaine warned the party that it would have to take drastic action to control public expenditure if it wins the elections next October, by seeking to shift spending from consumption to job-creating investment. He stressed that the party intends to keep the growth in public spending below the nominal growth of the gross domestic product, in a long-term strategy to cut the national debt.</p>

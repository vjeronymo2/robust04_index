			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Exco Exco's management must be hoping that its second coming as a quoted company will be less hair-raising than the first. Having been swallowed up by British &amp; Commonwealth in 1986, the money broker was left in limbo when B&amp;C collapsed. While the question of ownership was partially resolved by a placing of shares with institutions two years ago, B&amp;C's administrators are keen to cash in their remaining chips. Since Exco increased earnings by more than half last year, the timing for a flotation looks auspicious. Investors will have to decide whether the company is being offered at a cyclical profits peak or near the start of a prolonged recovery. Exco delivered steady growth through the 1980s, but that was an era of expansion. Growth opportunities are now less obvious. While money market turnover should continue to grow, commissions are being squeezed. Yet Exco's spread across time zones and financial markets should help iron out the worst of the volatility in earnings. If management can keep a grip on costs, there must be a fair chance that profits will rise from here. Without much segmental information or an idea of what dividend Exco will pay, valuation is difficult. Assuming the company will use its strong cash flow to support a decent yield, though, a multiple of at least 10 times last year's earnings or a market value a shade more than Pounds 200m would look fair value. Caledonia Investments, the Cayzer family vehicle which sold out of B&amp;C while the going was good, would then again have shown impeccable timing. The 27 per cent stake it bought from the administrators two years ago would have trebled in value.</p>

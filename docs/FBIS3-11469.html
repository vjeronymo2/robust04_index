Energy,  Telecommunications, and Posts Minister Datuk Sri Samy Vellu said  Intelsat has applied to the International Telecommunications  Union [ITU] to position its satellite at the 91.5 degree east  orbital slot just as Malaysia had done for its Malaysia East  Asia Satellite [Measat] 1. He said this when addressing the  world telecommunications development conference in Buenos Aires,  Argentina today. The nine-day conference is organized by the  ITU. The text of his speech was faxed to the national news  agency BERNAMA. Datuk Sri Samy Vellu said Malaysia had objected  to Intelsat's bid to place its satellite in the same orbital  slot to the Radio Communications Bureau as it would cause  harmful interference to Measat.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Former KGB arm to cut back agents: Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency to close down parts of global network THE Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency, formerly the foreign intelligence arm of the KGB, is to cut back its agents at home and abroad by one-third, according to Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, its deputy director. The FIA would no longer attempt to maintain a global network and would withdraw completely from some - unspecified - areas of the world. He conceded that the agency, which once enjoyed unlimited access to funds, was at times strapped for cash. His appearance at a press conference yesterday was the most recent step in the efforts being made by the FIA to present itself as user friendly and little more than a modern consultancy company. Gen Trubnikov said he also wanted to clear up misunderstandings following statements by Mr Robert Gates, the CIA director, that the Russian FIA had continued many of the same operations as the KGB. He said that it was now 're-orienting itself according to the orders of the Russian government', and was paying close attention to economic issues. In particular, he said, the FIA was checking on the suitability of foreign companies seeking to do business in the former Soviet Union. It was also carrying out analysis of the Dollars 24bn-worth of aid being offered by the Group of Seven industrial countries to Russia to determine whether it was the best form of assistance. General Trubnikov said that in his personal view, debt relief would be a better form of support. The general did not specifically refute other charges by Mr Gates that the FIA was now oriented more towards industrial and technical espionage. Nor did he address the charge that the US remained the main target of this activity. The FIA is now giving information to all member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States - a membership which excludes the three Baltic republics and Georgia. He said that while Azerbaijan, the least committed of the members, had not signed a joint security agreement, he expected it to be a customer for Russian intelligence. Gen Trubnikov claimed that there were, by agreement, no FIA agents operating within the CIS member states - though he conceded that it was of primary importance that Russia should know what decisions were being made in these republics. He said that relations with other intelligence agencies had 'radically increased' - even with the historic enemy, the CIA, though he said that there was a slow response from the US agency to FIA overtures. 'We lack a climate of confidence,' he said. 'The CIA must start thinking about the new rules of the game, and they have suggestions from the FIA on this'.</p>

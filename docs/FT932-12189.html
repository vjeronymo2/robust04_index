			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: MAM disposes of Jupiter stake MERCURY Asset Management has disposed of its controversial 8m share stake in fund manager Jupiter Tyndall, Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said yesterday. MAM wrote off nearly Pounds 3m in its 1992 accounts for the stake, which represents just under 25 per cent of Jupiter Tyndall's total share capital. 'The Jupiter results have come out, the share price has risen and we felt we could dispose of the stake profitably,' Mr Stevenson said. The current year's accounts will include a gain of more than Pounds 1m, reflecting the profit. The stake was placed with several clients of MAM's brokers, Smith NewCourt. Last year, Jupiter Tyndall recruited MAM's star fund manager, Mr Leonard Licht, as its deputy chairman and chief investment officer. His recruitment package included a signing on fee and other costs totalling Pounds 1.8m. Mr Licht will receive an annual salary of Pounds 600,000 and stock options said to be linked to the amount of business he brings in.</p>

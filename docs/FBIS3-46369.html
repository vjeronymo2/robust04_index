He pointed  out: Foreign economic and trade work affects the overall  situation and plays an extremely important role in accelerating  Tianjin's economic development. Last year, the municipality  made great achievements in its foreign economic and trade work,  and this year its tasks will be more arduous. Foreign economic  and trade departments should emancipate the mind, expand the  degree of reform, make earnest efforts to do practical work,  grasp the work firmly, and enable foreign economic and trade  work to enter a new and big stage.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: To fulfill this year's foreign  economic and trade work, we must proceed from deepening the  internal reform of enterprises; unceasingly improve the  investment environment, and turn the foreign economic and trade  departments into examples in improving Tianjin's investment  environment; mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors, do a good  job in building the party, leading bodies, and contingents, and  raise the entire quality of foreign economic and trade  departments to meet the needs of the new period and new  situation.    In his speech, Vice Mayor Ye Disheng called on foreign  economic and trade departments to do their work in line with the  objective of attaining a higher level. He said: This year the  targets of all items of work must not be lower than last year's  level, and in general, should surpass last year's level, and  enter a new stage. In carrying out foreign economic and trade  work, we should stand on the van of Tianjin's big decisive  battle and big change, seize the opportunity to accelerate  development, and produce a satisfactory answer to the 9.1  million people of Tianjin at the end of the year.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Sweden and Hungary offerings draw attention Two unusual eurobond offerings by sovereign borrowers dominated dealers' attention yesterday. Sweden launched its Y100bn eurobond offering, after rumours of pre-marketing in Tokyo reached London dealers earlier this week, while the National Bank of Hungary, which borrows on behalf of the Hungarian government, launched a Dollars 250m issue of floating-rate notes, just before announcing an 8 per cent devaluation of the forint. As expected, Sweden's euroyen offering maturing in December 1996, arranged by Nomura, was aggressively priced. Nomura said it is the first euroyen bond to be targeted at a wide range of retail investors in Japan. To market the deal, 100,000 prospectuses are being distributed, and the denominations are relatively small, at Y100,000 and Y1m. Under current regulations, eurobonds can normally be placed in Japan with a limited number of investors. However, Nomura has applied for a Securities Registration Statement which allows unlimited placement. The deal will be marketed through the retail network of Nomura and other securities houses, in the same way as Samurai and domestic corporate bonds. However, the fees for eurobonds are lower than for Samurai bonds (foreign bonds issued in the domestic market). Although the deal appeared very tightly priced to London-based traders, Nomura said that retail investors would compare the rate to fixed-term savings rates, currently around 2.1 per cent over two years. In the dollar sector, the National Bank of Hungary's Dollars 250m issue of floating-rate notes was considered rather aggressively priced, compared with its outstanding fixed-rate paper. The deal offers a discounted margin of 1 7/8 point over the London interbank offered rate. Lead manager Salomon Brothers said it still has a mandate from Hungary for a Dollars 500m-Dollars 750m global offering of 10-year bonds, which was shelved earlier this year, but there are no plans to bring the deal in the near future. Elsewhere, several retail-targeted offerings were well received. A Dollars 200m three-year deal for BNG, the Dutch bank, was the first eurobond to be priced at a yield spread relative to the when-issued three-year Treasury. The spread of 10 basis points over the new Treasury equates to 19 basis points over the old three-year benchmark, dealers said. The one reservation expressed by dealers was that BNG has been tapping the market very frequently since it gained a triple-A rating in June, with rumours of a large yen transaction still to come.</p>

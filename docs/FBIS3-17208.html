William Perry received this present  from a representative of the Belarussian Optical Mechanical  Association (BELOMO) which is now mastering peace-time  production.    The BELOMO together with the "Integral" association and the  Association of Computing machinery, will cooperate with American  firms in the field of conversion of the defense industry to  peace-time production.    According to William Perry, the United States is prepared to  earmark 10 million U.S. dollars to Belarus for the  implementation of the conversion program. A special tender was  carried out in the United States whose winners will cooperate  with the three Belarussian production associations.    Now the United States is getting down to business, the U.S.  defense minister said commenting on the signing of the  conversion documents and the establishment of the joint  American-Belarussian committee which will control conversion  issues.    "We have been coming to this for almost two years," Defense  Minister of Belarus Pavel Kozlovskiy noted.    The process of conversion will include three stages: The  delivery of the latest equipment to Belarussian enterprises, the  organization of production of modern products and the creation  of an export market," representatives of the U.S. Defense  Ministry told BELINFORM.    The fact that the United States have set aside 30 million  U.S. dollars to Belarus, confirmed the words by Pavel Kozlovskiy  that the "geographic remoteness and a different level of the  economic development are not an obstacle to cooperation."    According to information received from high ranking  officials  of the Belarussian Defense Ministry, 10 million U.S. dollars  will be spent on conversion, another 10 millions U.S. dollars --  on construction of houses for servicemen, 5 million U.S. dollars  -- on the destruction of conventional weapons and the remaining  5 million U.S. dollars -- on re-training of officer cadres of  the Belarussian Army.</p>

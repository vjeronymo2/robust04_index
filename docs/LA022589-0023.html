			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHIPS FALL FOR GLASSON; HE LEADS DORAL BY ONE  </P> <P> Billy Glasson chipped in twice in a round of seven-under-par 65 that gave him  to a one-stroke lead Friday at the halfway point of the $1.3-million Doral Open  golf tournament at Miami, Fla.  </P> <P> The first of those chip-ins, from about 40 feet, "was pivotal for me," said  Glasson, who chipped in for par on the third hole following a 3-wood shot into  the water.  </P> <P> "When I made it, well, that kind of let me be more aggressive the rest of the  way," he said.  </P> <P> He also chipped in from 35 feet for an eagle on the eighth hole and completed  two rounds over the windswept Blue Monster course at the Doral Country Club in  136.  </P> <P> Wayne Levi was next at 137 after a 69, and Mark Calcavecchia, the first-round  leader; Buddy Gardner; John Huston, and Fred Couples were at 138. Calcavecchia  had a 73 that included a one-putt double bogey. Gardner shot a 68, and Huston  and Couples had 69s.  </P> <P> Harold Henning made a 50-foot chip shot on the 18th hole to join four other  golfers in a tie for the first-round lead in the Senior Challenge at Naples,  Fla.  </P> <P> Henning's chip-in, his second of the day, gave him a birdie and a two-under-par  70, tying him with Miller Barber, Chick Evans, Gene Littler and Bruce Crampton.  </P> <P> At Princeville, Hawaii, Betsy King and Jody Rosenthal slogged to two-under-par  63s on a 16-hole course to take the first-round lead in the rain-plagued  Women's Kemper Open.  </P> <P> The heavy rains that washed away Thursday's first round and forced tournament  organizers to shorten the $400,000 event from 72 to 54 holes also compelled  officials to shorten the course from 18 to 16 holes Friday.  </P> <P> The par-3, 130-yard third hole and the par-4, 316-yard fourth hole both were  covered with water following more than 12 inches of rain this week.  </P> <P> A group of 11 golfers were one stroke behind the leaders.  </P></p>

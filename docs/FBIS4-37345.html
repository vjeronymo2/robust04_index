			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, Eytan Rabin, 'Aqiva Eldar, Yerah Tal, </F> and Sharon Sade]    [Excerpt] In his reply to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat,  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel has significantly  eased the closure on the territories but will not lift it  totally. 'Arafat was given data showing that 45,000 permits for  work in Israel have already been given to residents of the  territories and that the entry of women and of youths up to the  age of 15 is no longer restricted.    'Arafat had called on Rabin to ease the plight of the  residents of the territories, lift the closure and the  restrictions on work in Israel, open the roadblocks at the  entrances to Jerusalem, and immediately transfer to the  Palestinian Authority funds from taxes and customs Israel has  imposed on the Palestinians. This amount comes to approximately  6 million shekels, and Israel is holding on to the funds until  accounts are settled with the Palestinian Authority.    Rabin informed 'Arafat that Israel will meet its commitments  but will not be able to go beyond that. Israel will also not  lift the roadblocks at the entrances to Jerusalem. [passage  omitted]</p>

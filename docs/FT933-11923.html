			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Stronger franc hits Moulinex exports MOULINEX, one of France's largest manufacturers of kitchen appliances, stayed in the red during the first quarter of this year with a pro forma net loss of FFr16m (Dollars 2.7m), against FFr90m in the same period of last year. The group, which has been burdened by heavy debts since the takeover two years ago of Krups, its German competitor, has been badly affected by the slowdown in the European electrical appliances market, where it faces fierce competition from the multinational electronics groups. The first-quarter loss, which follows the announcement earlier this year that Moulinex fell into a net loss of FFr115m in 1992 from net profits of FFr171m in 1991, reflects both competitive market conditions and the impact on exports of the French franc's strength since the September currency crisis. Turnover rose by 4 per cent in the first quarter, but fell by 10 per cent to FFr1.83bn in the second quarter, producing a fall in sales of nearly 4 per cent to FFr3.69bn for the first half of 1993. The deterioration in Moulinex's performance was mainly due to the economic instability, and adverse exchange rates in Italy, Spain and the UK, which account for one-fifth of total sales. However, Moulinex fared well in other markets. The group, which has changed its year-end from December 31 to March 31, managed to increase sales in France, Germany, the US (for the Krups brand) and eastern Europe. Credit Agricole and Banque Sofinco, a subsidiary of Suez, have agreed to collaborate in the area of consumer credit, Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

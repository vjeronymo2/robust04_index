			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has said  that Yemeni unity is an existent reality that was not imposed by  force, adding that the separatist elements in the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP] leadership are resorting to fighting to  impose secession by force. He noted that Yemen is one state in  terms of land and people and that the Yemeni people adhere to  their unity which is an expression of their will.    In a statement to the Qatari radio broadcast yesterday  evening, Basindwah noted that the secessionist gang violated the  cease-fire announced by the Yemeni Government before the arrival  in Sanaa of brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary  general. He added that this gang intensified naval and aerial  bombardment of the forces of unity and legitimacy to call in  international observers, something which is unacceptable. He  said the military confrontation is not between sides, but  between the legislative government and a gang rebelling against  legitimacy and seeking secession.</p>

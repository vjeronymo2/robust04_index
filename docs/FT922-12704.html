			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Technology: The smart trolley goes shopping First there was the smart house, then the smart car. Now comes the smart trolley. It's called the videocart and it could change the way we shop. The computerised trolley features a small liquid crystal display screen attached to the handle. As the shopper moves round the store, infra-red sensors located in the ceiling trigger radio signals which activate the display, passing information to the consumer. The first information to flash on to the screen is a floorplan of the store. This is replaced by information specific to each aisle, such as special offers. By pressing a button on the LCD the discount will automatically be sent to the checkout. It can also offer nutrition tips and even suggest possible menus. For shoppers in a hurry, or those who are not familiar with the store, there is an item locator which works by a simple push-button system. Narrow down the choice until the required item is listed, and the screen will indicate which aisle to head for. This can be done generically or by brand name. In addition to store information, the LCD shows 10-second commercials. Research indicates that 80 per cent of brand choices are made at the point of purchase. The trolley's manufacturers see this form of advertising as a rival to TV. The trolley is the brainchild of Videocart Inc, a Chicago-based company which developed it with IBM. Ten supermarket chains throughout the US, including many Kroger stores, are using the trolleys. The company predicts that 2,000 stores will be stocking videocarts by the end of 1993. 'Retail demand for the videocart has been incredible,' says Bill Dupre, Videocart's vice president of retail relations. 'Retailers like the way it personalises shopping and delivers customer service benefits without increasing labour costs.'</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Arts: A deserved promotion - London Concert When it is promoted from pit to concert platform the Orchestra of Covent Garden's Royal Opera House can more than give the London orchestras a run for their money. Last year it made its South Bank debut in a concert of Richard Strauss; on Sunday it returned to London's Royal Festival Hall, again conducted by Bernard Haitink and with Felicity Lott as soloist. Haitink first introduced the ROH Orchestra to the orchestral repertory in the series of 'Garden Concerts', which took place on the ROH stage. Those programmes made a point of including new commissions from British composers, but on the South Bank so far the choice of works has been much more conservative. There was not much sense of enterprise about this latest selection of Berlioz, Ravel and Shostakovich, but the performances transformed it into a memorable occasion. Haitink's account of the Overture to Benvenuto Cellini was unexpectedly rich-toned and muscular; although not especially French in timbre or rhythm it was still convincingly powerful, Berlioz as viewed from an uncluttered Beethovenian perspective. Ravel's Sheherazade, though, caught all the appropriate French inflections. The refinement of the orchestra's pianissimo playing and the poise of its woodwind principals provided Lott's performance with a beautifully shaded halo. Her tone was not as radiantly full as one might have hoped, but the attention to verbal detail and the expressive nudges projected each song intelligently. There is a refreshing lack of self-regard in the ROH Orchestra's playing; a couple of times, as in the scherzo to Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, a band used to showing itself off might have turned on a more extravert display. Haitink's view of the symphony, in any case, does not lend itself to anything so meritricious. It continues to develop its depth and power, pivoted about remorseless unfoldings of the first movement and the Largo which made full use of the orchestra's prodigious dynamic range and plunging into the finale with heedless abandon, yet braking to a pained slowness for that final exploration of its empty rhetorical themes. This was the precise antidote to Solti's inert performance of the Fifth with the Vienna Philharmonic in the same hall earlier this year, and as disturbing as any imaginable account could be.</p>

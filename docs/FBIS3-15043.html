			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Khasbulatov by Vitaliy Shestopalov on </F> 27 February, place not specified: "Ruslan Khasbulatov: There  Is No Torture Worse Than Lies"]    [Text] Ruslan Khasbulatov, former chairman of the Russian  Supreme Soviet, met with your SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA correspondent  on Sunday and gave him an interview specially for our newspaper.    [Shestopalov] Ruslan Khasbulatov, readers of SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA congratulate you on your return home.    [Khasbulatov] Thank you!    [Shestopalov] How did you spend your first day?    [Khasbulatov] The first thing that I did was familiarize  myself with the place again and I hope this will not seem  strange but I was sort of trying to get used to it...    [Shestopalov note] The telephone did not stop ringing in the  apartment with people offering congratulations. Khasbulatov  began receiving his first telegrams in Lefortovo on 23 February.    [Shestopalov] Was there nothing from President Dudayev of  Chechnya? You are fellow countrymen after all!    [Khasbulatov] There was nothing from Dudayev (Khasbulatov  smiles). To the best of my knowledge he helped the present  regime in the struggle against the parliament. It is rumored  that apart from large sums of money he intended to send a  detachment of volunteers to Moscow to help the OMON special  purpose militia and "Beytar." But the volunteers did not come,  of course.... Otherwise they would have gone over to our side.    [Shestopalov] Were you able to read SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA in  Lefortovo?    [Khasbulatov] I asked for it as soon as the authorities  "liberated" the newspaper. I felt a need for objective  information.    You know what is the strangest thing to have to endure in  jail?.. The "Mayak" radio station and radio "Rossiya." From  morning till night you get nothing but streams of primitive  lies. It is amazing where they get so much nonsense from, what  kind of think tank they must have to produce those lies every  hour? Lies are the most terrible form of torture!    Primitive propaganda is based on elementary human  forgetfulness. Take, for example, the Bosnian problem, which  Yeltsin's press presents to us as an "outstanding diplomatic  triumph." But where were Messrs. Kozyrev and Yeltsin 18 months  ago? Remember how many sessions of the Supreme Soviet were  dedicated to this most important question of Russian foreign  policy. What didn't they accuse the Supreme Soviet of then --  pan-Slavism and flirting with the patriots!    They have no other way out today! Can air strikes against  Serbia, NATO maneuvers, and blind support for U.S. initiatives  really bring the regime success? That is why they were forced  to adopt the option once proposed by the Supreme Soviet....    There is much to be amazed at....    I closely studied Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly  and the State Duma. I was very surprised! The message is 90  percent made up of things that I said at congresses of people's  deputies beginning with the sixth congress. Thus the  president's team, which prepared this material, has accepted the  Supreme Soviet's assessments. There is something else that  amazes me, too! These people are incapable of performing the  present task because they are bent on the destruction of Russia  and on waging war against their own people. Yeltsin's team has  more interpreters in it than professionals...    [Shestopalov] In your view, what mistakes did the Supreme  Soviet leadership make in the tragic weeks of September-October?    [Khasbulatov] That is hardly the way to put the question.  The constitution which Yeltsin so fiercely rejected was a whole  magnitude better and more democratic than his brainchild. I do  not know how the present "creation" is legitimate. What is its  basis? The will of the people? I doubt it very much! It was  thrown at the people without discussion. And then they began  insinuating: if you do not accept it there will be civil war!  You can hardly suspect MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS of antipathy  toward Yeltsin although even that newspaper wrote about  "trickery" when the votes were counted.    Remember, the president carried out a coup d'etat. What  should the Supreme Soviet do? It should act in full accordance  with the existing Constitution! Which is what the leadership  did! We proceeded first and foremost from that very  Constitution on which Yeltsin himself took the oath. We  proceeded in particular from Article 121 of Point 10 ratified by  Yeltsin when he was chairman of the Supreme Soviet.    I was blamed for calling the Armed Forces into action. In  accordance with the law on defense, the Armed Forces are  subordinate to "the Supreme Soviet of Russia, the President of  Russia" under Article 10. Note that the word "president" here  comes second. Something else is enshrined in the  Constitution... The Armed Forces are the guarantor of the  Constitution, hence the call for their protection. After all,  the appeal was not to use their tanks to fire on the Russian  parliament but to protect it!.. We acted in full accordance with  the law. We managed to convene a Congress of People's Deputies  which retained the full range of power.    [Shestopalov] How justified was the appointment of the new  power ministers?    [Khasbulatov] I make no secret of the fact that there was a  different viewpoint in existence. I wanted to create a kind of  Military Council using old and new ministers. But the figures  of Yerin and Grachev did not have sufficient standing. In  addition, there was the crisis situation in the Security  Ministry at that time. There were lots of persistent voices  calling for the replacement of the ministers. There were also  those demanding the replacement of the government in its  entirety.    But it cannot be said that we acted correctly all the time!  The extreme situation caused mistakes. I must mention one  fact. The leaders of many of the major plants, using the threat  of dismissal, banned thousands of workers from coming to the aid  of those who were defending people's power at the House of the  Soviets. Historians will have the task of examining all this  honestly.    [Shestopalov] What are your plans for the immediate future!    [Khasbulatov] I am not afraid of the courts! But I do not  intend going back into politics. I do not see any worthy  individuals to cooperate with. I shall work at science, I shall  write a book. That will mean getting involved in dozens of  problems... Jail is jail. The radio station "Mayak" alone is  enough to "beat" your brains out (he laughs).    Khasbulatov lit a pipe.    [Shestopalov] Ruslan Imranovich, where is the pipe which, it  is rumored, Boris Nikolayevich broke in a rage?    [Khasbulatov] I do not know which pipe he broke. I still  have mine with me.    As I was leaving I asked him the fundamental question -- to  whom will history give the final word?    [Khasbulatov] Not Yeltsin... That is for sure. He is  doomed. It is he who will have to answer for Grachev for the  tanks, for Yerin for the OMON, and for Luzhkov for the  Beytarovtsy. Their judgment day is still to come.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] "Not only has corruption become widespread in the  country in recent decades, but it has also become  institutionalized, and, although only informally, it is  regulated." This statement was made by the Andean Center for  Popular Action (CAAP) in the course of an investigation that  brings us closer to an understanding of the scope of this  worrisome phenomenon.    According to the CAAP, "commissions" absorb about 6.9  percent  of the state budget -- almost 7 percent -- and the regulation  process has reached a point at which "both those involved and  careful observers know exactly what amount or what percentage of  `commission' must be paid out or received by a bureaucrat for  any given type of procedure." At the same time, there are  "bureaucratic rings" -- veritable bribe  approval-payment-acceptance chains -- without which the system  could not function.    The CAAP says it is interesting to note that as of December  1993, there were in the nation's prisons only 42 inmates  convicted of crimes against the public administration and 38  convicted for embezzlement. But corruption is not found among  government employees alone. The percentages of taxes evaded by  private businesses are also "regulated."    As the CAAP sees it, the impoverishment of broad sectors of  the population of Ecuador is expressed and can be measured by  three new parameters. They are crime (which we analyzed  yesterday), corruption, and the growing lack of respect for  human rights. The challenge involves finding a way to combat  corruption on both the public and private levels.    On the initiative of the vice president of the Republic, the  government has contracted for the services of a business called  "International Honesty," with a view to the launching of a plan  to combat corruption. However, whenever an effort is made to  resolve a structural crisis by means of a morality campaign,  limitations appear, according to analysts who deal with the  dramatic subject of corruption in Ecuador.    Can the monetary sum being absorbed by corruption in our  country be calculated? The CAAP has decided that it can. It has,  therefore, using the incipient institutionalization of this  phenomenon seen in recent decades as a basis, made a study of  the magnitude of the sums involved in corruption on the public  and private levels.    Starting with the clear "rules of the game" governing the  processes of corruption today, the CAAP study considered the  state budget figures for 1993. The expenditure categories were  used to measure the corruption in the state apparatus, while the  income categories made it possible to calculate the extent of  corruption on the private level.  <H5>  Government Corruption </H5>   According to the CAAP study, 6.9 percent of the general  budget of the Republic "drains" through the hands of  unscrupulous bureaucrats within the state institutional  apparatus and/or the private sector. In order to reach this  figure, the investigators established first of all what would be  called a "useful base for corruption" made up of the various  expenditure categories (salaries, services, supplies, etc.) in  the codified budget, which was taken to be the total volume  vulnerable to corruption. Secondly, the national average for the  "commissions" absorbed by government employees and officials out  of the national budget, by category and ministry, was determined.    According to the CAAP, three conclusions can be derived from  the above.     -  The simple average of the commissions that must  be paid to the bureaucracy for various purposes, or in other  words the "diversion rate," is estimated to amount to about 15  percent of the budget.    -  Where the commission percentages by  expenditure category are concerned, that for "services" proved  to be the largest (33 centavos for every sucre of expenditure  vulnerable to diversion), followed by "supplies" (20.6 percent),  "construction" (16.2 percent), purchases of "goods and chattels"  (15.5 percent), "purchases of furnishings" (13.3 percent),  "transfers" (9.8 percent), "remuneration" (one percent), and  public debt (2.3 percent, for the foreign debt).    -  Provisionally,  the ministries believed to have the highest average commission  rates are Education and Agriculture, with averages exceeding 18  percent.     Once these aspects have been reviewed, it is possible to  calculate the amounts diverted to the personal accounts of a  myriad of bureaucrats. To this end, the amount in each  expenditure category is multiplied by the "commission rate," and  by the percentage that in practice is vulnerable to diversion.    By means of this procedure, the investigators came to the  conclusion that 291.3368 billion sucres (about $155 million)  were drained off in this way from the expenditures originally  planned and approved in 1993. In relative terms, this amount is  equivalent to 6.9 percent of the total budget, and to 1.1  percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 1993.    "Up to the present, obviously, public corruption has taken  into account only the monies incorporated in the state budget  proper. Thus the sums derived from the private sector that go to  fill bureaucrats' pockets have not been included. It is, as yet,  impossible to make a quantitative determination of this total,  since it involves commissions ranging from payments to a  policeman in order to avoid a fine, through the corruption of  judges, all the way up to Christmas gifts," the CAAP  investigators have explained.  <H5>  The Private Sector </H5>   Although it is generally believed that the greater part of  the existing corruption is to be found in the public sector in  our Latin American countries, there is no doubt that this  practice, and immorality in general, play a major role in the  private sector of our economies.    The CAAP investigation in this sector was limited to the  issue of tax evasion, and the figures provided by high-ranking  government officials themselves (in public statements) were  used. The researchers began with the tax income collected  throughout 1993, and this was compared with the income that  would have been collected by the government had this mass tax  evasion not occurred.    According to the CAAP, if the values that were not taken  into  account, but which can be estimated roughly, were added in the  course of this operation, the result would be an approximate  total for corruption equal to 9.5 percent of the GDP, including  the estimates that were not realized.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vickers ahead but shares fall on recovery warning Shares in Vickers fell 7p to 188p yesterday after the engineering group, which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, said it was seeing only a patchy recovery. Pre-tax profits nearly doubled, from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 15.9m, but were still slightly below market expectations. Sales were flat at Pounds 330m (Pounds 331m). Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said the recovery in results which started last year had continued, but this was more to do with plant rationalisation and efficiency measures than improvements in markets. Sales of Rolls-Royce cars rose slightly, from 683 to to 701, and higher sales in the UK and east Asia (excluding Japan) offset poor sales in North America. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said he hoped by the end of the year to reveal the outcome of talks the group has been having with other manufacturers over collaboration on new model programmes. Vickers will not say who it has been talking to, but is known to have been discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Cosworth, the high-performance engine subsidiary, is still suffering from declining demand for special Ford Escorts and Scorpios, but is investing in a new factory for its castings business and an emission centre. The group's defence systems business now has a total order book of Pounds 1.5bn, following the government's recent confirmation of the follow-on order for 259 Challenger 2 tanks, in addition to the 127 tanks ordered in 1991. Sir Colin said the strength of this order book made the defence business a much stronger and more attractive partner when considering collaborative projects. The medical division's contribution fell, partly because of continued uncertainty over the proposed Clinton healthcare reforms and tough trading conditions for distributors in continental Europe. The propulsion technology division continued to suffer from the depressed state of the aerospace business, but on the marine side the Swedish-based KaMeWa company had an 'outstanding' six months. Earnings per share improved to 3.6p (1.9p). The interim dividend rose to 1.75p (1.25p). COMMENT The trading statement was deliberately downbeat, to lower expectations about the speed of likely recovery. But Vickers still looks in a strong position, following last year's Pounds 60m rights issue and the recent award of the crucial Challenger order. Capital investment is being increased - particularly at Cosworth - and there is some scope for margin improvement at the tank factories. On a prospective multiple of 19, the shares cannot be called cheap, but a modest upturn in demand for cars will sharply improve the bottom line. The shares are unlikely to move decisively until the group reveals its decision over collaboration on the next generation of luxury cars.</p>

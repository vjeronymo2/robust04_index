			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents in Zagreb --live]    [Text] [Tudjman] On return from our visit to the United  States and the United Nations, I can say that Croatia--and I,  personally--can be more than satisfied with the results of the  talks that I had with the most senior statesmen of the United  States -- President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Secretary  of State Christopher. Members of the Croatian delegation--[Mate]  Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, [Defense]  Minister [Gojko] Susak, Minister (Jeren), Minister Jasic, and  Vice Governor Rogic--also had talks with their counterparts and,  as a whole, the talks with the highest-ranking representatives  of the U.S. Government were fruitful and signified the creation  of a basis for lasting, friendly cooperation between Croatia and  the United States and for a partnership with the United States.    I believe that you must know a great deal by now about the  agreements that we have signed, the agreements on a  Croat-Bosnian Muslim federation and the confederation of a  federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. This event was  described not only by our hosts but also by international  diplomatic circles and the United Nations as an event of  historical significance, as a watershed in the efforts to  resolve the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and as a resolute  step toward peace.    The talks I had at the United Nations with Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali and all his aides and, in particular, my  speech in the Security Council--which met with Madame Albright,  the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations in the  chair--were for us of great significance. During the course of  these talks with both the UN secretary general and his aides  and, in particular, in the Security Council, it became evident  that Croatia's stands were enjoying support from almost all the  Security Council members -- Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand,  Great Britain, Russia, the Czech Republic, and so forth. Like  U.S. statesmen and all those we talked to, they also paid  tribute to Croatia and its steadfast, determined, and sensible  policy and reiterated their support for Croatia's territorial  integrity. Both President Clinton and the Security Council  members stated emphatically that, for their part, they would do  their utmost to ensure that the UN Security Council resolutions  were implemented and that the Croatian territories under the  control of the peace forces and under Serb occupation--and it  was the first time that U.S. representatives and the Security  Council spoke in those terms--were reintegrated in Croatia's  constitutional and legal system as soon as possible.    Understandably, during the course of this, everyone was  appealing for this to be done peacefully while, on their part,  they will bring pressure to bear--by way of sanctions and in  other ways--on Serbia and Yugoslavia so that they renounce  occupation and accept a solution. During the course of these  talks on the new mandate, I presented Croatia's views that we  could accept, that we accepted, the extension of the UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] mandate on the condition that some  guidelines for the implementation of the Vance plan and UN  Security Council resolutions were laid down.    In this context, I drew attention to the importance of the  implementation of Resolution 769 on border controls between  Croatia and Serbia and between Croatia and those areas in Bosnia  that are under the control of Serb forces and to the disarmament  of Serb paramilitary formations. Without this, there can be no  peace. I also drew attention to the beginning of the return of  refugees and, lastly, the gradual restoration of infrastructure  facilities, communications, oil pipelines, and power lines.    In this context, we were met with understanding, so we can  expect the UN Security Council to pass resolutions to this  effect. They understandably may be gradual. Perhaps they may  not include everything at once. It is essential, though, that  we have a political climate today in which there is full  understanding for Croatia's views. All in all, this visit has  consolidated and reinforced Croatia's international  position--both by way of our alliance, our partnership with the  United States in its capacity as the superpower that plays the  main role in modern international developments, and within the  framework of the United Nations.    I would like to stress, in particular, another important  event-- the opening of the Croatian Embassy in Washington and my  meeting with Croatian emigres--those emigres who made it  possible with their hands, their financial contributions, and  also with their work--for us to have one of the most beautiful  buildings, one of the most beautiful embassies you can find  there. Many people worked there. They came from distant parts  of the United States--from New York, Cleveland, from other  parts. They travelled for long hours and worked all day  throughout their weekends so we would get a building that can  make us proud indeed--we as the Croatian state, the Croatian  people in the United States.    This was a touching meeting with our people, both in our  embassy and particularly later on at the opening ceremony at the  embassy, which was attended by about 1,000 people. Some of our  ministers could not get in because they arrived late.    All in all, this is yet further proof of the unity of the  homeland with emigrants from Croatia. The embassy was purchased  by us in the homeland, but both money and work have been  contributed by our emigrants. This is evidence both of the  unity of the homeland and of emigrants from Croatia and of the  pride of our Croatian people in being able to do something for  their free, democratic Croatia.    It was really nice to be in Washington and New York and  return to the homeland with the feeling that we have  strengthened the international position of Croatia and that the  problems facing us can now be resolved more successfully, with  fewer difficulties, and in a more resolute and rapid way.    That is enough by way of an introduction.    [Unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] of Deutsche  Welle. Mr. President, every time the UNPROFOR mandate expires,  local rebel Serbs are ready for talks and agreements. It has  been demonstrated that nothing has come of these agreements so  far, and this time their representatives will come to Zagreb  when the UNPROFOR mandate expires. Do you bring with you--after  your trip to Washington and meeting with Butrus-Ghali--any  guarantees that things will be different this time? What would  be the very latest deadline for refugees to return to their  homes?    [Tudjman] Clearly, the current talks are taking place in  different circumstances, in altered conditions with regard to  the efforts to resolve the crisis in former Yugoslavia as a  whole, in Bosnia, and--by implication--in Croatia. The  guarantees you mentioned lie in the fact that top U.S. statesmen  and--as I said before--those in the United Nations, have stated  emphatically that they will support efforts to reintegrate the  Croatian territories now under Serb occupation into our  constitutional and legal system as soon as possible.    Just like us, the world also wants this problem to be  resolved in a peaceful way. That it would be better to resolve  it in a peaceful way was made clear to us in Washington during a  meeting with a group of Croatian people. There I met a man, a  young man, with no arms -- I shall do everything to make sure  that there are fewer of these victims. But, understandably, the  opponent will soon realize that we are prepared to use all means  available if we fail [to reduce the number of victims]."    As for the return of the refugees, we would like this to  happen instantly. I told the Security Council that we could not  accept the proposal to extend the mandate for another year,  another 12 months, but that we could accept it only for another  six months--provided that the refugees be allowed to start  returning to their homes during that time.    This, of course, is a complicated process; however, with the  support that we have in the world currently, I think we will be  able to initiate and finalize it in a way that suits our people.  This is not just an issue of Croatia's sovereignty and its  territorial integrity, but it also reflects the justified desire  of our refugees. They must begin preparing for it. Although we  will try and avoid unwise steps, it is justified to expect the  refugees to begin preparations to return and to let the world  know that this is what they insist on and that it cannot be  denied them--that it is a justified demand that must be met soon.    [al-Isa] Mr. President. Nada al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina  Radio and TV and the state agency Bosnia Press. When are you  going to visit Sarajevo? Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency  President Izetbegovic said at a news conference yesterday that  he had invited you. I would like to know whether you intend to  accept the invitation and visit Sarajevo? Has world  diplomacy--or Croatian and Bosnian diplomacy--performed a  miracle? Rumor has it that Parliament Speaker Mesic was advised  roughly two months ago not to pay a return visit to  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly President Miro Lazovic.    [Tudjman] First of all, who did advise him? One should not  enshroud this question in any kind of politicking. I have  accepted Mr. Alija Izetbegovic's invitation, and I would like to  visit Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina very soon.    [Perasovic] Zeljko Perasovic, GLAS SLAVONIJE. Mr.  President, when will the normalization of relations with the  so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia take place? Or in  other words, why has Veljko Knezevic [Serbian ambassador to  Zagreb] not come to Zagreb yet? Do you have any information  about this?    [Tudjman] Yugoslavia's representative, Knezevic, has already  been in Zagreb. Whether or not he has come back, I do not know.  The process of normalization was initiated by the opening of  representative offices. It will probably continue despite those  who would like to thwart this normalization. There are,  understandably, unreasonable people everywhere. I believe that  the Croatian- Bosniak-Muslim agreement on creating a  Croatian-Bosniak-Muslim federation and a confederation of a  federal Bosnia with Croatia must have a positive influence on  the Serbs, to the effect that they accept normalization, that  they realize that if they do not accept it, that would be even  more detrimental to them.    Consequently, despite everything that stands in the way of  this normalization, I believe that normalization will  nevertheless take place. There will, of course, be difficulties.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you  anticipate the possibility of a peace agreement in the talks  today with local Serbs in the Russian Embassy?    [Tudjman] I do not understand. An agreement?    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you anticipate the  possibility of an agreement with local Serbs in the negotiations  in the Russian Embassy today? Is there the possibility of an  agreement with the local Serbs in the negotiations?    [Tudjman] I have already answered that question. Regardless  of the fact that there will be haggling and difficulties, I  believe that neither the local Serbs nor Belgrade have any  option but to accept the road to normalization.    [Saracevic] Saracevic, German radio. Mr. President,  according to the Croatian press, you said in an interview you  gave to Reuters TV that Bosnian Serbs would be given the  possibility of forming a confederation with Serbia if they were  to enter the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation--if they join it.  Were you given any indications to make this assumption? Does  this mean that the state, or rather the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation, would be part of two confederations--of the  Croat-Bosnian confederation with Croatia and Bosnian-Serb  confederation with Serbia--if this does happen? Is this not  slightly illogical, or does this mean the division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state?    I am asking if this--and this is connected with the  so-called  Krajinas here in Croatia--would this mean changes in the  borders? If this is the case, it would, in my view, threaten  Croatia's borders as well. Can you elaborate? Thank you.    [Tudjman] First, the two issues--the resolution of the  Bosnian issue and of the Croatian territories under the control  of the peace forces and under Serb occupation--have nothing in  common in that the question of whether Bosnia-Herzegovina is  resolved on a confederal or federal basis has no effect on how  the issue of the Croatian territories is resolved.    Three constituent nations are at issue in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  while the Serb ethnic community in Croatia is a minority that is  not entitled to the right to self-determination under any  international conventions, regulations, or common law. These  areas have always been part of Croatia and never part of  Yugoslavia or Serbia. In other words, there is no need to link  this issue, except in that it will also be affected by the  military and political resolution of the crisis in former  Yugoslavia. It will not, however, be affected in the sense that  any potential changes in Bosnia-Herzegovina will inevitably  imply similar changes in Croatia.    I do not know what it is that you read and Reuters wrote  but,  in any case, I did not say that the situation could develop in  such a way that the Serbs would be allowed to join a Bosniak  Muslim-Croat federation and to set up a confederation with  Serbia--or rather Yugoslavia--at the same time. On the  contrary, I said that something of that kind was inconceivable,  but that at some stage it could happen that the events unfold in  the future in such a way that the part of the territory declared  a so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina--in other  words, the part of the territory under Serb control--will be  allowed to set up a confederation with Serbia, or rather  Yugoslavia, and the Bosniak Muslim-Croat part with Croatia. In  other words, this is not the case of a double or simultaneous  confederation.    Then there are speculations that, in some way, all this is  an  attempt to restore Yugoslavia. This is out of the question.  There can be no solutions that are unacceptable to either the  Croatian people in Bosnia or to the Croatian state.    [Unidentified correspondent] Even well-intentioned friends  abroad have been harboring suspicions regarding the  implementation of this agreement signed in Washington,  particularly because no time frame has been laid down for this  transitional period. What is your view of the possibility of  problems arising during the course of implementing this  agreement? Do you know, or can you tell us in more detail, how  long this transitional period will be?    [Tudjman] Please tell us on whose behalf you are asking.  Please always say who you represent.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a representative of the  KUNA news agency of Kuwait.    [Tudjman] I do not know what kind of speculation you are  talking about. A transitional period is inevitable at any rate.  How long it will be depends, understandably, on all kinds of  things, so it is hard to predict anything. By all means, both  our Western allies and ourselves will strive to make this period  as short as possible.    [Curic] Jozo Curic, Croatian TV. Mr. President, we have  started talking about what follows next in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Can you tell us now about the military agreements that have  been signed and about your reports on the situation on the  ground? What is your view of further developments on the  ground? Are we waiting for the Serbs to decide or not, or else  can the Croats and Muslims already do something by themselves?    [Tudjman] As you can see, the Croats and Muslims are  already working on their own. The world finds it surprising  that the cease-fire between the Muslims and Croats has taken  effect, that there is no longer any warfare, that they are  exchanging prisoners. Even we ourselves can be satisfied in a  positive sense and accept these developments. Consequently, the  consolidation of Croat-Muslim relations is underway. What lies  ahead for them as well as for international factors is to  persuade the Serbs to accept a solution that would also bring  about an end to the war and a political solution.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, Beic, Croatian  Radio. As far as your visit to the UN headquarters, and  particularly your presence at the session of the UN Security  Council, is concerned, you pointed out on behalf of Croatia  several essential elements for the continuation of UNPROFOR's  mandate. One of these essential elements is the deployment of  UNPROFOR troops along Croatia's internationally recognized  borders. I would like to know what the UN Security Council's  answer is, particularly regarding the future mandate and the  next term. How does the UN Security Council view this  proposition of yours? Thank you.    [Tudjman] I first made this demand in talks with the UN  secretary general and his aides; they showed understanding and  promised to review this demand, likewise the Security Council.  Naturally, this demand includes authorizations to UNPROFOR in  order for them to implement it. On my part, I voiced the  opinion that there was no need to boost UNPROFOR's numerical  strength but that its activities should be redirected towards  controlling points that can be controlled, that is, the border  between Croatia and Serbia on the Danube and in eastern  Slavonia, in Srijem and along the border with Bosnia. I also  pointed out that NATO's air support ought to be forthcoming if  these forces are threatened or prevented from controlling these  borders. This will be examined and the Security Council will  decide on the new mandate.    As we now have a favorable political climate, this is of  great importance for resolving not only the UN-protected areas  but the crisis in former Yugoslavia as a whole, and we expect  the Security Council to be responsive in determining the new  mandate and to take steps that would empower UNPROFOR to  implement the Vance plan and all Security Council resolutions,  especially resolution 769 concerning border control, and 871  which is all-encompassing.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, Mate [name  indistinct] of VECERNJI LIST. Reporting on the meeting at the  Russian Embassy in Zagreb, Belgrade Radio said this morning that  the Western powers have agreed in principle that Baranja should  be given to Serbia in exchange for Krajina and peace. What  could you tell us about this?    [Tudjman, laughing] Agreement in principle, whose agreement  in principle? Well, you know that people sometimes tend to make  plans without consulting those concerned, in any case, even  dreaming that we might agree to such negotiations is out of the  question. As far as the talks at the Russian Embassy go, in  addition to Russian representatives I believe that U.S.  representatives will also be taking part, at my proposal.    [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] of VJESNIK.  Mr. President, has there been any mention in the Pentagon about  Croatia's joining NATO, and will Croatia be granting NATO  certain locations -- Vis and Lastovo, for instance -- for use as  military bases?    [Tudjman] Good God, would you like to discuss military  secrets here? [laughs] Understandably, the talks centered on  all issues of interest to Croatia and of interest to our  collocutors. Croatia will receive support for access to the  Partnership for Peace, while all the rest is a question of  mutual interest and, as I said -- military secrets -- but what  is important is this: Croatia needs allies and we have found  them, we have them. And Croatia, as it is, is of interest to  the most important international factors, including the United  States. This is what we are basing our policy on. This is  exactly what we have achieved with our consistent policy -- we  now have allies and these allies need Croatia, they count on it.  They count on it not only in the quest for peace but also in  the establishment of the new international order in the region  of former Yugoslavia and in southeast Europe.    [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. At the beginning  you mentioned unity between the Croatian homeland and the  diaspora. In the meantime, while the agreements were being  signed in Washington, the media reported on demands from the top  state and party level for the resignation of Defense Minister  Gojko Susak because he allegedly disagrees with this policy, or  else because there is suspicion that he will not implement it  correctly. Today, we have a civil initiative, a public protest  following the arrival of Serb negotiators in Zagreb, under the  slogan: We do not want to negotiate with war criminals. What  is your comment on these cases in view of your statement that we  will now be resolving our problems quicker and more resolutely?    [Tudjman] We have thus seized opportunities to resolve them  quicker and more resolutely [as heard]. The demands that  Minister Susak should be sacked did not come from the top state  level but from individuals, from politicking schemers. These  demands will be subject to political assessments and,  understandably, they will not change the state policy. Being at  the helm of such an important ministry, Minister Susak had my  full trust. Not only did he enjoy trust in his leadership of  the Defense Ministry but also amid Croatia's precarious position  when we had to extend our support to the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, first against the Serb aggressor so we could  secure the survival of people there [sentence as heard].    Consequently, these demands can be raised by those who  disagreed with this policy or those who are doing this for  personal reasons. Not only are there always politicking schemers  in politics but there are also people who have different views  on some individual issues or different demands. Everything,  however, eventually fits in its place.    As regards the protest you mentioned, I do not know about  it.  I can imagine there are such people. One should not talk to  war criminals provided they were not there, or if we could bring  them to justice or send them to the moon, so they would not  exist [as heard]. Even representatives of the European Union  [EU], official representatives of the EU and official  representatives of the largest European powers, and even the  main superpower, the United States, negotiate with them.    Mr. Redman, President Clinton's personal special envoy,  visited not only Zagreb but Belgrade too. It is not only  representatives of Russia who talk to them but those of the  United States and Europe, too. Consequently, we too are forced  to talk. Moreover, we are willing to talk so as not to suffer  further casualties. It is easy to be bellicose and say -- no  talks. Let those people identify themselves so they can see,  even before I started my journey there were 11 fatalities and  some 30 wounded in one of Croatia's battlefields. We are not  going to play either with human lives or with Croatia's  interests because of someone's insanity.    I understand the rage of our people, as I share it too. But  policies are governed by reason as well as by heart.  Understandably, this is always the case, in history and at the  end of all wars and during wars, one talks to one's opponents.  We are in conflict with them and we should get out of this.  Consequently, this is not simply some kind of will of ours or  our weakness but, if you will, our strength as well, as a result  or consequence of the overall international circumstances in the  period from the collapse of Yugoslavia to this crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and, understandably, the problem of Croatia's  areas under Serb occupation and UNPROFOR protection [sentence as  heard].    So, we will continue talking for as long as there is any  chance. We have stressed and continue to stress that we have  not given up the ultimate means if the talks fail. But then we  have to have the support, to secure the support of the  international circles and forces which are active in  international organizations and have a decisive role in creating  current international order.    [Skugor-Hrncevic] Smiljana Skugor-Hrncevic, HINA. Mr.  President, during your visit to Washington another agreement was  signed which was overshadowed by the political agreements. This  is an agreement between Croatia and the United States on  scientific and technical cooperation. Can you tell us a bit  more about this agreement? Are there any concrete indications  regarding aid and cooperation?    [Tudjman] The agreement on scientific and technical  cooperation is one of the most important agreements. The amount  available for Fulbright scholarships has already been doubled.  Work is being done to extend cooperation into other fields.  This is one of the agreements to be signed in various other  fields [as heard].    [Unidentified correspondent] [name indistinct] DANAS. Mr.  President, it is being rumored that some government ministers  will be replaced. Is it only a government reshuffle or is  Premier Valentic to leave? Can you say something about this?    [Tudjman] There will be no government reshuffle.</p>

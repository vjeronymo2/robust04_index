			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Serious safety shortfalls reported A survey of London employers has found serious shortfalls in health and safety provisions for their employees. The survey of 350 workplaces, carried out by the Industrial Society, found that employers were failing to make changes to comply with new health and safety legislation. The report found that only 43 per cent of employers had held a fire drill in the past six months. While nearly three-quarters of the respondents regularly employed contractors, only half included health and safety in the contract or checked the contractor's record on health and safety. Fewer than half monitored contractors' safety performance or imposed penalties for safety lapses. Employers are also reacting slowly to new health and safety regulations which require a written workplace policy on risk assessment, the report says. A year after the regulations came into force only half the organisations questioned had introduced a policy. In contrast almost three-quarters of the respondents had developed new safety policies for visual display units and 60 per cent of those were giving staff training. Mr David Wood, the Industrial Society safety specialist who carried out the survey, said a lack of enforcement officers was allowing many organisations to escape prosecution.</p>

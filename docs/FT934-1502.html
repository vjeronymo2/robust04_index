			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Populism at war with political correctness: Simon Holberton says Chris Patten's confrontation with Beijing is about to heat up but investors seem unconcerned The stage is now set in Hong Kong for a battle between populist politics and the might of the Chinese Communist party. When Governor Chris Patten tabled the first part of his democracy legislation this week he almost certainly brought to an end Anglo-Chinese co-operation on the colony's political development. The contest, which promises to exacerbate already deep divisions, will accelerate the decline of British power in Hong Kong in favour of the mainland Chinese. It is in China's gift to make this contest as benign or bloody as it chooses. But it is clear that international and domestic investors regard the row over democracy as little more than a sideshow. Continuing the gains it has made in recent weeks, Hong Kong stock market's Hang Seng index ended yesterday at a record of 10,568.86, up more than 2 per cent on Thursday's close. With mainland Chinese politics in a relatively stable period, Beijing's push for economic liberalisation, together with the colony's pre-eminent position as the gateway to China, has made Mr Patten's agenda for democratic reform a secondary issue. Since 1984, when Britain and China signed the joint declaration ceding sovereignty of the colony to Beijing in 1997, the Hong Kong and Chinese economies have become increasingly dependent on each other: as close as 'lips and teeth', say mainland officials. As the chart shows, China's dependence on the port of Hong Kong for its international trade has grown considerably. Hong Kong (and Macao) account for the largest share of 'foreign' investment in China. In addition, mainland interests have shareholdings on Hong Kong's stock market worth a minimum of HKDollars 120bn; many observers believe the figure is much higher. For the colony, economic conditions across the border on the mainland are crucial: about a quarter of its Gross Domestic Product is dependent on activities derived from links with China. All this serves to underline what has become apparent as the talks between the UK and China have soured: increasing economic interdependence means that much influence has already transferred to Beijing and that, whatever political measures China plans to take against Britain, Hong Kong's economy will be spared retribution. Yet because the UK will not give China what it wants - a compliant legislature - and because China still likes to vest all political control in the Communist party, Hong Kong has to pass through one last rite of passage before its formal return to Chinese sovereignty. Beijing signaled the beginning of conflict on Wednesday evening when the Xinhua News Agency called on the people of Hong Kong to work with the mainland's representatives in the colony for a 'smooth transition' to Chinese sovereignty. This was a reference to the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), set up in Beijing in the summer. It consists of mainland officials and several prominent Hong Kong citizens, including Mr Li Ka-shing, the businessman, Mrs Rita Fan, a former member of Mr Patten's executive council (colonial cabinet), and Mr Tsang Yok Sing, a spokesman for the left wing in the colony's politics. The job of the PWC is to prepare the ground for a 'preparatory committee', which will be created under Beijing's auspices in 1996 to prepare for the takeover. As Anglo-Chinese relations have deteriorated, the PWC's remit has changed. It will now engage in 'practical work', including devising, by July next year, a method of electing the Legislative Council after 1997. The timing is significant: July is when the Hong Kong government wants LegCo to finish discussing Mr Patten's democracy legis-lation. Already the pro-Beijing press has begun to question the 'Chineseness' of some leading pro-democracy advocates in the colony. One recently said Ms Christine Loh and Ms Anna Wu - two liberal-minded Patten appointees to LegCo  -were 'women with striking western values and little feel for China and its ancient ways'. As Beijing has begun to prepare its tactics for the months ahead, so to has Mr Patten. Earlier this month he told LegCo that he would 'employ all the rhetorical talents at our command' to put into place arrangements that the UK and Hong Kong governments think are in the best interests of the colony. This week the campaign got off to a low-key start, with Mr Patten soliciting individual legislators' support for the bill introduced on Wednesday. The measure will lower Hong Kong's voting age to 18 from 21 and abolish appointments to local government councils. It will also create single seat constituencies for local government and 20 of LegCo's 60 seats. The government is confident that about 50 LegCo members will support this so-called 'first-stage' bill. There are signs, however, that support could be weakening. The Liberal (conservative) party, which has 14 votes, is split. The majority feel the party's credibility will be fatally damaged if it fails to support the bill but a vociferous minority feel the party should side with China. The outcome of this internal conflict is unclear, but in the unlikely event that the Liberal party votes against the government, Mr Patten would still command a majority. 'I think we are home and dry' on the first-stage bill, one senior government official noted. The second phase of Mr Patten's campaign will coincide with the tabling  - around the beginning of March - of his second bill. This will seek to broaden democratic participation in the election of LegCo's remaining 40 seats. His campaign is expected to include public meetings, walkabouts across the colony, and more intensive lobbying of LegCo members. China has yet to respond to Mr Patten's plans. It may treat the legislative process with the contempt it thinks it deserves. It may respond in kind by organising 'patriotic' demonstrations against British rule. Whatever the outcome of the Legco debates, China has promised fresh elections after the 1997 takeover along lines to be determined partly by the PWC's deliberations, but mainly by Beijing's requirement that LegCo be quiescent. As Mr Patten has discovered, China's concept of 'one country, two systems' always meant a capitalist Hong Kong operating within the overarching sovereignty and political control of Beijing. The omens are reasonable that Hong Kong's capitalist system will survive the political rows of the coming six months. But as economic influence drifts into Beijing's hands, Mr Patten will find that his strength in the battle will also diminish. By 1997, the best he may be able to say is that, however belatedly, he at least tried to introduce the kind of democratic structures the UK believed were right.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    As close as lips and teeth  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         1984      1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong exports to China (HKdollarsm)               39,347   274,064 % of Hong Kong's total exports                          17.8      29.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Re-exports from China (HKdollarsm)                    28,107   403,782 % of Hong Kong's total re-exports                       33.7      58.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- China's exports through Hong Kong (% of total)          26.5      44.1 China's imports through Hong Kong (% of total)          12.0      25.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong &amp; Macao direct investment in China (USdollarsm)                                             748     7,909 % of total foreign investment in China                  52.7      70.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Employment by Hong Kong manufacturers in China         minor        3m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HKdollars circulating on the mainland (HKdollarsm)     3,071   *14,537 % of total HKdollars in issue                           19.7      29.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- International telephone traffic to China through HK ('000 minutes)                                      5,839   534,225 % of total                                                 9        47  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- International telephone traffic from China to/through HK ('000 minutes)                                              418,610 % of total to/through Hong Kong                                     41  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong visitors to China (m)                            8      21.5 % of total visitors to China                            63.3      74.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chinese visitors to Hong Kong                         44,000     1.14m % of total visitors to Hong Kong                         1.4      14.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Peregrine Securities                             * 1991 figure  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

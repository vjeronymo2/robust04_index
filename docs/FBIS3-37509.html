			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Vladimir Malyshev and </F> Georgiy Shmelev]    [Text] Athens, 17 Feb -- Since the Russian Federation is a  permanent member of the Security Council, Russia and the United  Nations have nothing in common with NATO's ultimatum to the  Bosnian Serbs, since they took no part in the adoption of that  decision. This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev to an ITAR-TASS correspondent upon his arrival today in  Athens. Russia, A. Kozyrev confirmed, is a permanent member of  the Security Council, and the United Nations cannot make such a  decision without us.    According to the minister, he has the impression that "we  were not, at any rate, fully informed about the content of the  NATO decision." "But we will not allow ourselves, no matter how  much anyone might try, to be deflected from our chosen course  toward a strategic partnership, about which there was a  conversation quite recently between the presidents of Russia and  the United States in Moscow, or to be deterred from the efforts  that Russia has been making for the past 2-3 weeks in order to  promote its initiative in Bosnia. The initiative, A. Kozyrev  indicated, is aimed at strengthening the security zones,  including, above all, the security zone in Sarajevo, and the  withdrawal of the sides' armed formations and heavy weapons.    Vitaliy Churkin, who is now the Russian President's special  representative, the Russian minister continued, is personally in  the conflict zone and is conducting intricate talks. In the  minister's opinion, it is necessary to follow most attentively  the course of these talks and to listen to the news coming from  there, since it is precisely at these talks that the question of  lifting the siege of Sarajevo and removing armaments is really  being tackled.    Speaking about relations between Russia and the Republic of  Macedonia, the minister declared that Russia was ready, in  principle, to make its good offices available to both states --  Greece and the Republic of Macedonia -- so as to help them find  mutually acceptable solutions to the problems of relations  between them.</p>

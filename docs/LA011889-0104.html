			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. said its first-quarter earnings were down 17% to  $160 million from the year-ago period, when profits were boosted by a  $50-million tax gain related to production of the B-1B bomber. The El Segundo  aerospace, electronics and industrial company added that sales for the quarter  were $2.87 billion, up 7%. The results include gains by electronics, automotive  and graphics, although aerospace earnings were off because of the completion in  1988 of B-1B production.  </P></p>

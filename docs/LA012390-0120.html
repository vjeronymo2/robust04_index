			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION;  </P> <P> WESTMONT A PLEASANT SURPRISE  </P> <P> This was not supposed to be the big year for the men's basketball team at  Westmont College in Montecito.  </P> <P> With no seniors on his team's roster, longtime Coach Chet Kammerer and his  staff figured that the best season for the Warriors was still another year down  the line.  </P> <P> But success at Westmont appears to be a year ahead of schedule.  </P> <P> The Warriors are off to their best start at 17-1 and are No. 11 in the National  Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics rankings.  </P> <P> Westmont has won 16 consecutive games and would tie the school record of 18,  set in 1983-84, with victories over Point Loma Nazarene and Fresno Pacific this  week.  </P> <P> Not that any of this should come as a major surprise, however.  </P> <P> After all, Kammerer began the season seventh among active NAIA coaches in  victories with a 475-230 record, and his winning percentage of .674 was tied  for 25th among active coaches.  </P> <P> The Warriors also have won four NAIA District 3 titles under Kammerer, most  recently two seasons ago, when the team lost to Wisconsin Eau Claire in the  first round of the NAIA national tournament in Kansas City.  </P> <P> Still, after going 18-13 last season, this had the appearance of a rebuilding  year for Westmont. Only two starters returned.  </P> <P> "Its been unexpected because we graduated five seniors from last season," he  said. "In no way did we expect to be 17-1 at this point.  </P> <P> "I'm still sort of amazed to see the success we're having every time we go out.  I know they've surprised the coach, they've surprised their fans and I think  they've surprised themselves."  </P> <P> The seeds of success might have been planted last summer, when Kammerer and  three of his starters visited Czechoslovakia for 17 days with a touring team  and played 10 games and conducted clinics. The players were forward Chris Hahs,  guard Peter Partain and guard Chad Kammerer, the coach's son.  </P> <P> "That probably helped Chris the most because he got a chance to play a lot of  basketball against big players," the coach said. "We played the best teams in  that country."  </P> <P> Kammerer said another factor this season has been the improvement of Partain,  who had difficulty adjusting last season after having knee surgery two years  ago.  </P> <P> "Peter came off major knee surgery and last year was just a season of total  adjustment for him," Kammerer said. "This season he's playing at just a  completely different level."  </P> <P> Partain, a 6-foot-3 junior, averages 17.2 points and six rebounds. Junior  forward Noel Matthews leads the team with averages of 19.2 points and six  rebounds.  </P> <P> In fact, Westmont has five players averaging double figures in scoring.  Kammerer averages 14.1 points, Hahs 13 and guard Chris Brown 12.8.  </P> <P> "We have a good balance, yet on the other hand it's a good blend, too," the  coach said. "What makes a team is not only that they like each other but that  they blend together well and this team does.  </P> <P> "People that watch us are not going to be impressed just by looking at us, but  we play very well together. I think individually they wouldn't stick out, but  as a group they do."  </P> <P> Kammerer said his team has a goal of going undefeated at home, winning the  district title and returning to the NAIA national tournament. So far the  Warriors are 9-0 at home and another district title appears within reach.  </P> <P> Kammerer says that, so far, Westmont has managed to keep its early success in  perspective. At the moment he is more concerned about the race for first place  in the Golden State Athletic Conference, where the Warriors are tied for the  lead with Fresno Pacific at 3-0.  </P> <P> "We've hardly said one word about the streak," he said. "Right now we're tied  with Fresno Pacific and we haven't won anything yet. We're still focusing on  our next game. It seems like there's always another challenge down the line for  us."  </P> <P> After two weeks of the conference season, the Cal State Northridge men's  basketball team is still the biggest surprise in the California Collegiate  Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> The Matadors, the only undefeated team in conference play, improved to 4-0 in  the CCAA and 9-8 overall with victories over Cal State Dominguez Hills and  Chapman.  </P> <P> The Northridge women's team has also been a big surprise after a 3-12  nonconference season. The Matadors are tied for first with Cal Poly Pomona at  3-0. But Pomona, which has won or shared the CCAA title the last eight seasons,  is still the heavy favorite to win the title.  </P> <P> In the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, the  Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men are off to the best start at 4-0 in the conference  and 14-3 overall.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> Goalkeeper Steve Goodson of Claremont-Mudd-Scripps has become the school's  first first-team All-American selection in men's NCAA Division III soccer.  Goodson, a senior, posted 33 shutouts in his career and 12 last season to lead  the Stags to a 17-2-1 record and their seventh playoff appearance in the last  eight years. Sophomore forward Mahntie Reeves, who had 13 goals and five  assists last season, was selected to the second team.  </P> <P> Steve deLaveaga, former Cal Lutheran basketball star and the school's all-time  leading scorer with 2,549 points, has signed to play pro basketball with  Nadawani of the Southeast Basketball League in Australia. He was the NCAA  Division II scoring champion last season with a 28.1-point average. . . .  DeLaveaga's younger brother, Jeff, is following in his footsteps at Cal  Lutheran. A sophomore, he is among the NAIA leaders with a 26.8-point average.  </P> <P> The Cal State San Bernardino women's basketball team extended its winning  streak to 12 with an 86-79 victory over UC San Diego last week. Leading the way  was sophomore guard Laura Beeman, who set a school record with 13 assists. The  Coyotes are 13-3 and ranked No. 5 in the NCAA Division III West Region. . . .  Kathy Goggin, former Cal State Dominguez Hills women's basketball star, has won  the 1989 Woody Hayes National Scholarship Athlete Award presented by the  University Sertoma Club of Columbus, Ohio. Goggin was one of six winners of the  award that is presented to NCAA Division I, II and III athletes.  </P> <P> Michael Bell, starting guard at Dominguez Hills, has left the men's basketball  team to concentrate on his studies. Bell, a defensive specialist, was averaging  4.3 points and 2.7 rebounds.  </P></p>

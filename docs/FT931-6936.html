			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Big turnround in shipbuilding boosts Daewoo DAEWOO, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, yesterday reported a 10-fold increase in net profits for 1992, mainly due to improvements in its securities and shipbuilding operations. Net earnings for Daewoo, which consists of 22 subsidiaries, rose to Won298.2bn (Dollars 370m) from Won28.4bn in 1991. Sales increased by 25 per cent to Won20,000bn. The results were encouraging for Daewoo, which has had slim profit margins in the last few years due to losses in its key industries. Profitability had also suffered from a mounting debt burden, with high-interest short-term loans accounting for about one-third of outstanding borrowings in 1991. Daewoo Securities reported a sharp increase in earnings, which climbed to Won55bn from Won1.3bn. This reflected increased brokerage activity as the Seoul bourse posted its first annual gain in three years. Turnover for the firm rose by 68 per cent to Won380bn. Daewoo Shipbuilding, which is unlisted, posted the biggest profits among the group companies with earnings of Won211bn, a 167 per cent increase over the year before. Sales rose by 43 per cent to Won1,550bn. The sharp profit increase at the shipbuilding unit was due to rationalisation and a rise in orders. The company also diversified into vehicle production last year and reported good sales for its range of mini-cars and vans. The results represent a dramatic turnround for Daewoo Shipbuilding, which suffered huge losses in the late 1980s and had to be rescued from possible bankruptcy in 1989 with a Won400bn government loan. As part of the rescue package, the government ordered Daewoo Shipbuilding to merge with Daewoo Heavy Industries, traditionally one of the group's strongest units, by the end of 1994 to improve its financial stability. Sales and earnings at Daewoo Heavy Industries, a machinery manufacturer, declined in 1992 after three years of growth. Earnings fell by 44 per cent to Won10.5bn, while sales dropped by 10 per cent to Won904.7bn. The decrease was blamed on sluggish domestic industrial investment and a downturn in construction.</p>

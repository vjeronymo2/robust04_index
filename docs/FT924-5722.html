			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Racing cars of little help when Dwyer is on the line - The career of Desmond Bloom THE RESIGNATION from Dwyer of Mr Desmond Bloom, one of the more colourful property entrepreneurs of the 1980s, closes a chapter in a remarkable career. Dwyer, a former shell company, briefly became the best performing share on the UK stock market before its value plummeted as the property market collapsed. It announced on Monday that Mr Bloom is being replaced as chief executive by Mr Joey Esfandi, who is one of Dwyer's largest - and most critical - shareholders. Mr Peter Andrews, who like Mr Esfandi is a director of Winglaw, a private property company, will also join the Dwyer board. Mr Anthony Kirwan, a Dwyer director will become the new non-executive chairman. While the board changes were of little interest to the stock market, which left Dwyer's share price unchanged, Mr Bloom's departure is illustrative of a broader trend in the market. Small, financially-stretched property companies such as Dwyer, which has a market value of less than Pounds 5m, are under increasing pressure from investors to cut costs. Property deal-makers, such as Mr Bloom, who prospered in the frothy property market of a few years ago are struggling to justify their salaries. Mr Bloom, who resigned at a board meeting on Saturday, was born in Whitechapel, east London. His early history included stints as a guitarist in a rock band, a boxer and a minder to Screaming Lord Sutch, leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party. He became involved in the property industry in the early 1970s and entered the public arena in the mid-1980s when he took over Dwyer, a troubled Irish textile group, and turned it into a property company. Dwyer expanded rapidly on the back of a rising property market and its share price rose sharply in the first half of 1987. Since then, however, its fortunes have deteriorated rapidly. Its share price has fallen from a peak of 400p in 1987 to 19p. It is on course for a pre-tax loss of some Pounds 1.4m for the year to September 30. Its gearing stands at an estimated 200 per cent. In an effort to secure survival, the convertible preference shares have been converted to ordinary shares. Dwyer's change of fortune was not accompanied by a conspicuous scaling-down of its expenses. The company continued to run a racing car, the chairman took delivery of a new Bentley and although the directors cut their salaries by 10 per cent, Mr Bloom's salary exceeded Pounds 250,000. Mr Bloom is happy to defend this expenditure. The racing car paid its way and earned goodwill at race meetings, he says. If the order for the Bentley, which had been ordered in better times, had been cancelled, a Pounds 50,000 deposit would be forfeited. His salary was, in part, making up for his forbearance in his early years in the company when he took no salary. But in recent weeks, as the figures for the last financial year were collated, he recognised that his salary and associated expenses - including a Mayfair office - could no longer be justified while Dwyer had no prospect of trading profits. For this reason, Mr Bloom agreed to step down and invited Mr Esfandi to replace him. Mr Bloom, who says he has no regrets about leaving, says he will either try to build up a property portfolio on his own account, take over a shell company or take up an offer to become the chief executive of another quoted company. Meanwhile, Mr Esfandi promised stringent cost cutting and active management of the portfolio. 'We have achieved board representation in order to protect and enhance our investment in the company.' 'Our goal is to return the company to profitability and to restore the dividend.'</p>

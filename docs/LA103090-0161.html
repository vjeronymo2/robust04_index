			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISTRIAL IS REJECTED IN MANISCALCO CASE  </P> <P> Intent on averting a mistrial in the longest criminal trial in county history,  a judge refused to dismiss 12 jurors Monday without a verdict in the  triple-murder case of former Hessian motorcycle-gang leader Thomas F.  Maniscalco.  </P> <P> And so, as relatives of the defendant, lawyers, reporters and photographers  waited anxiously in the courthouse, deliberations continued for a record 23rd  day.  </P> <P> And for a 23rd day, the jury went home without a verdict.  </P> <P> A verdict is not likely to come soon, lawyers acknowledged. After being  instructed to continue discussions in hopes of overcoming their apparent  deadlock, jurors on Monday asked that a court reporter read them the testimony  of two witnesses. That could take three days to complete.  </P> <P> The panel reported last Thursday that they had "exhausted all reasonable  avenues for agreement." Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary made the  deadlock public on Friday.  </P> <P> She could have declared a mistrial then. But that would have probably meant  that the case -- which has already cost millions and kept the 45-year-old  Maniscalco in jail for 6 1/2 years without bail -- would have been retried.  </P> <P> Monday morning, for the first time in the drawn-out deliberations, defense  attorney Andrew Roth asked for a mistrial because of the deadlock.  </P> <P> Maniscalco faces the death penalty if convicted on three counts of murder. He  allegedly orchestrated the killings of three people in Westminster on Memorial  Day weekend, 1980, in a feud over drugs and counterfeit money. ERIC LICHTLBLAU  </P></p>

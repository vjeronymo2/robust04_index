			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Interim cut to 1p at Higgs &amp; Hill PRE-TAX profits of Higgs &amp; Hill, the construction, housebuilding and property group, slid from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 673,000 in the first half of 1992, writes Andrew Taylor. The fall would have been less but for an increase in exceptional items from Pounds 592,000 to Pounds 872,000 to finance redundancy payments. Reflecting the difficult trading conditions, the interim dividend is cut from 6p to 1p. Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said the workforce had been reduced by 45 per cent over two years reflecting the decline in core markets of contracting, housing and commercial property development. He warned that the outlook for next year for contracting and commercial property looked little better, although there were some hopes that the housing market might start to pick up Turnover dropped from Pounds 190.9m to Pounds 149.6m. Earnings per share after exceptional items fell from 1.7p to 1p. Contracting incurred a small loss, reflecting lower margins on contracts as the construction market had shrunk and competition had increased. Forward order book stood at just Pounds 145m at end-September. The loss was offset by the sale of an office development west of Paris, while UK housing profits were boosted by the disposal of a site at Stevenage Mr Theakston said the housing market continued to deteriorate despite a rise in the number of homes sold COMMENT Higgs &amp; Hill in terms of its balance sheet has done well to limit the damage in the worst downturn construction and property markets have seen for at least half a century. Gearing is less than 10 per cent, which many contractors will envy. The group, also, is making all the right noises about running its businesses for cash, reducing capital employed in housing and curtailing further property developments in France, Spain and the UK. Contracting traditionally weighted toward private sector commercial development, looks vulnerable, however. Commercial development is expected to be one of the last sectors to recover. Margins currently are paper thin to non-existent. The housebuilding operations, which can expect to benefit first from any recovery, are small by comparison. The shares until prospects improve are unlikely to attract many buyers.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Shipping shares crest the wave of expectations - A return to favour Shipping shares are so often out of fashion with investors that their advance seems all the more spectacular when they return to favour. Rarely can the trend have been as apparent as in the last few months, when the share prices of many European shipping groups have soared from the deeply depressed levels of last year. The change owes more to the strengthening dollar and expectations of a strong recovery in freight rates and ship values than to clear evidence that such a revival is already underway. Freight rates have recovered modestly this year, more in the dry bulk sector than in the tanker sector, but are still well below the peaks of 1990 and 1991. At the same time high operating costs and financing charges continue to squeeze corporate earnings. Many shipping companies are expected to publish disappointing results again this year. Mr Lau Svensen, analyst at Copenhagen-based Fibroco, comments: 'The recovery is underway but profits this year will not be much better than last. It is expectations which are driving share prices higher.' This view is shared by Mr Mark McVicar, analyst with London-based NatWest Securities, who says investors are looking beyond 1993 results to 1994 and beyond. The Nordic region, which boasts Europe's highest concentration of quoted shipping groups, shows the effect of the recent recovery clearly. The Oslo Shipping Index this week reached 587, up 80 per cent since the start of the year, and more than double last summer's 250 level. The Stockholm shipping index is now 55 per cent up on the start of the year. At these levels shipping shares no longer trade at a substantial discount to net asset value; some are even trading at a premium. The shipping rally has been fuelled by generally improved stock market conditions thanks to falling interest rates. There has also been a preference for some of the quality stocks - companies with blue chip status and relatively modern fleets. In Denmark, for example, shares in AP Moller's DS 1912 have risen more than 40 per cent in 1993 from DKr79,000 to DKr111,500, compared to an 18.5 per cent rise for the Danish market as a whole. Bergesen, the leading Norwegian bulk shipping group, has seen its shares climb from NKr91.50 to NKr152.50. However, not all sectors of the market have been able to match the rally put in by the bulk shipping groups. Companies exposed to the product tanker or refrigerated cargo markets have not fared nearly as well, because freight rates in these segments are depressed. The picture for the major liner shipping companies, such as Dutch group Nedlloyd and Germany's Hapag-Lloyd, is also much less bright because of continuing overcapacity on many major routes and worries about the state of the German and Japanese economies. Hapag-Lloyd, for example, warned last month that it expected its core liner shipping operations to make a substantial loss this year, with cargo volumes forecast 8 per cent. Many analysts believe shipping stocks have further to rise. Many company share prices are still well below the levels of two years ago, and the Oslo shipping index has still much ground to make up before it gets back to its 1000 peak in early 1990. Tanker market fundamentals look better than they have done for some time with low oil prices, high Opec production and a rising level of US oil imports. On the supply side too, a slowdown in new building contracting and an anticipated increase in the scrapping of elderly tanker tonnage suggest freight rates should rise substantially in the mid-1990s, provided the world economy does not slow down. With increased environmental and quality concerns, it may be the operators of modern tanker tonnage who benefit most. But there is reason for caution too; there have been too many false dawns in the shipping markets in the last few years, with those expecting major scrapping activity frequently frustrated by owners' vessel life extension programmes. Evidence that rates are rising strongly is bound to make owners reluctant to commit ships to the scrapyard. While most commentators do not expect a major downward correction, they believe further gains will require evidence of rising freight rates and ship values soon. 'A further appreciation in shipping shares must either be based on an actual rise in ship values or a presumption in the stock market that this will happen in the not-too-distant future,' says Harald Moraeus Hanssen, managing director of Oslo-based Fearnley Fonds. If such evidence is not forthcoming by the end of the year, the market could slip into reverse.</p>

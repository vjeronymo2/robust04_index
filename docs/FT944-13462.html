			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Statoil rises on currency gains Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a sharp rise in nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr12.85bn (Dollars 2bn) from NKr10.42bn in the same period last year. The rise followed unrealised currency gains as a result of the weak dollar and came in spite of lower crude oil prices. While there are uncertainties over future currency and oil price developments, Statoil expects to achieve a substantial improvement in 1994 profits over 1993 when they hit NKr12bn before tax. Group revenue rose NKr1.7bn to NKr61.42bn as operating profit increased NKr700m to NKr10.7bn. Net profits shot up NKr900m to NKr3.8bn. Net financial revenue rose steeply to NKr2.1bn from NKr374m as operating costs increased NKr1.1bn to NKr45.7bn. However, record crude oil production - 442,000 barrels a day versus 406,000  -failed to offset the effect of low prices and cut the exploration and production division's operating profit by NKr800m to NKr6.4bn. Statoil said the E&amp;P division was likely to trim NKr2.3bn from planned annual operational costs by the end of 1995. In addition, the Mongstad refinery is well on the way to achieving planned efficiency improvements of NKr375m annually. But the refining and marketing division suffered weak margins with operating profit cut NKr52m to NKr288m. Natural gas lifted operating profit NKr750m to NKr3.2bn, reflecting increased gas volumes and firmer prices. Oil trading and shipping lifted operating profit NKr121m to NKr553m, because of crude oil contracts secured during favourable times in a fluctuating market.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: TONE UP AND STRIP DOWN, FOR THIS SUNNY OASIS IS ESSENTIALLY BOD  SOD  </P> <P> My friend Janet goes through stages where she cancels social plans at the last  minute. Her excuses vary and are always complex. She talks to my answering  machine, never to me.  </P> <P> The former local beauty pageant contestant is obsessed with numbers; the ones  on a scale, her age, her dress size. She buys designer clothes, but they are  cut bigger so she can boast that she wears a size 4.  </P> <P> Janet, 36, is convinced that an extra 15 pounds separates her from finding love  and happiness. She has lost those same 15 pounds over and over in the last five  years, and each time she does she looks gaunt.  </P> <P> Weight is not her only obsession. "Do you think I should have my eyes done?"  she asked me.  </P> <P> Her "saddlebag thighs" were liposuctioned a year ago, and before that, she had  her nose straightened. She is about six sutures away from becoming a plastic  surgery junkie.  </P> <P> "Men expect women to look like they do in Playboy," Janet said. Really? Should  we all look airbrushed?  </P> <P> My friend Buzz -- who lives in New York -- believes that Californians are  obsessed with looks. "People here don't have the preoccupation with beauty that  Californians do," he said.  </P> <P> Our conversation caused me to wonder whether people in other parts of the  country judge looks differently, and that maybe New York -- compared with  California -- is not such a jungle after all.  </P> <P> My friend Colleen is sure we are obsessed. She has lived all over the United  States, most recently in Chicago. "I never, ever heard the expression 'hard  bodies' until I came back to Orange County after 14 years in Chicago," she  grumbled.  </P> <P> "And here, when people talk about hard bodies, you don't know whether they're  referring to a physique or Ferrari. Both, I suppose."  </P> <P> If you don't have one, you better have the other, she said with a laugh: "Here,  if you're five pounds overweight, the fat police issue a warning citation."  </P> <P> "I hate it that women feel driven to strive for this kind of superficial  perfection," said John, a 30-year-old bachelor with looks that compare to Tom  Selleck's. "People here are skin deep."  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach contractor said he has dated women from other parts of the  country and has noticed some differences: "Women back East are far more  intellectual and more sincere. You can even discuss politics with them. You  can't find a woman in Orange County who will talk politics; even the men here  aren't well versed politically."  </P> <P> He said women from the South and Midwest are more down to earth: "They don't  shun you if you don't happen to drive the right car or have a body like  Stallone."  </P> <P> But some, he said, try too hard to be glamorous. "I've noticed that women from  other parts of the country, especially the South and Midwest, get ideas about  what they should look like based on watching TV or going to the movies. But  they always seem to be about a year behind the times."  </P> <P> Charles, who moved here from Missouri 12 years ago, believes that the reason so  many people are obsessed with physical beauty in California is related to  climate and the outdoor life-style.  </P> <P> "Remember too," he said, "that Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the  world; it attracts a lot of young, beautiful and ambitious people."  </P> <P> He suspects that as they age (not always gracefully), the pressure to compete  in a youth-oriented culture results in insecurity, paranoia -- and more wealth  for plastic surgeons.  </P> <P> It seems unarguably true that men are judged by different standards than women.  Take Buzz, for example. He is handsome, sexy, erudite. He is also an  accomplished writer. He took the big five-oh if not in stride, at least in  earnest; he began lifting weights and running.  </P> <P> And now Buzz is buff. His grayish hair is beginning to thin? No matter. He's  still sexy. And those crinkled lines in his face? They serve to heighten his  smoldering masculinity. Mom was right: Life is not fair.  </P> <P> Sean Connery was recently voted "Sexiest Man Alive" by a People magazine  reader's poll. He is as bald as a billiard ball, sixty-something, and he  admitted twice on national TV that if a woman behaves poorly it's not such a  bad idea to give her a whack now and then. Gee, what a guy.  </P> <P> When was the last time a 60ish woman was voted anything, much less sexy?  </P> <P> John Goodman, Roseanne Barr's hefty TV sidekick, was voted "Sexiest Big Guy" in  the same poll. Where was the "Sexiest Big Gal" category? The fat jokes are  reserved for women such as Barr.  </P> <P> Society is not one-sided. Women can be as hypercritical as men when selecting a  date. Tiffany, a 23-year-old beach beauty, tossed her flaxen mane in that  special California way and proudly proclaimed: "A guy I date has to take me out  to nice places, be a sharp dresser and give me a lot of attention. He can't  smoke, and he has to have great hair."  </P> <P> Let us hope that in 25 years we don't find Tiffany going steady with some guy  she found lying face down in the gene pool.  </P> <P> But Brenda, a recent Boston transplant, said: "Maybe it's true that single  people here hold each other up to a higher physical standard; maybe they feel  entitled. I've traveled all over the world, and everywhere you go people say  that Southern Californians are the healthiest and most attractive of all.  </P> <P> "Everybody wants to come here to be with all the pretty people."  </P> <P> Maybe she's right. After all, the Beach Boys did not sing "I wish they all  could be North Dakotan."  </P></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Property: Where white is wrong - A look at Mediterranean developments that blend into the environment THE PICTURE of the Mediterranean leisure estate is changing. Fewer stark-white colonies of second homes are appearing on coastlines and a look at the latest developments on two Mediterranean islands, the French Corsica and the Spanish Majorca, is instructive. On Corsica, you find timber homes merging into the maquis - the scented, grey-green undergrowth that covers much of the island - but designs are sophisticated and the wood well-crafted. On Majorca, deep shades of ochre take the place of the dazzling white walls now out of favour environmentally. Unusual shapes take over from the 'boxes' of the past. And standard designs are altering, with larger properties being included to accommodate European families whose different generations like to holiday together. Another change is that the British no longer predominate as buyers - often, it is the Germans. The Domaine de Sperone is a rare new development on Corsica. It is a 350-acre private estate on the southern tip of the island where all properties are clad in Canadian red cedar and stone to blend with the rugged moorland. There is an 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course (to which a further nine holes may be added) and a sizeable clubhouse with restaurant and bar. Work is concentrating on Le Hameau de Piantarella, the village that will be the centre of the estate. It will have 80 apartments and 11 villas. The apartments, in low blocks, range from studios to five-room duplexes and are priced between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 400,000. About half will be ready for occupation this spring and will have communal swimming pools. The villas, from Pounds 320,000 to Pounds 450,000, will have up to five rooms, linked gardens and private pools. Interiors are light and spacious, with high ceilings of exposed timber. Floors may be of wood or tiles (but not the chilling marble of many Mediterranean holiday homes). With ownership comes a share in the Golf de Sperone company and membership of the club. And from the hilltop site of the village, there are views down to the beach and sea and across to neighbouring islands; Sardinia, eight miles distant, is visible on clear days. When the village is finished, there may be a few large individual houses available above a lake. The properties will offer possibilities for renting, too. Jacques Dewez - who heads the Paris-based developer, the Societe Anonyme du Domaine de Sperone - says: 'We have a strong demand for this.' Below the village, a 105-bedroom, four-star hotel with a sea-water therapy centre is being built. Tennis and wind-surfing are available and there is unlimited walking in the maquis, while an hour's drive takes keener walkers into the mountains. For the less adventurous, the little tourist port of Bonifacio, with its cliff-top walled town, is only 10 minutes away. While the estate is geared to all-round sportsmen, sailing will be the attraction for many residents. Bonifacio harbour has 300 deep-water moorings and there will be facilities for small boats at Sperone. Those with homes at Sperone already include two French government ministers; an assortment of French bankers, company chairmen and people in advertising; a number of Italians; and a few British. Their properties range from broad-leaved, shingle-roofed, low colonial styles with wide terraces to tall, rectangular buildings that seem to owe more to commercial than residential design. With land, pools and other amenities, they will have cost their owners between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1.5m. Dewez, who has a Russian wife and a son who breeds horses in Wales, is a former pilot who created an international charter company. When this was bought out by Air France. he moved into property development. In the south-west corner of Majorca, meanwhile, a partly pine-clad 3,000-acre estate, Santa Ponsa Nova, is being developed for leisure with a strong emphasis on integrating architecture with landscape. It is being promoted by IMISA, a subsidiary of Banco de Credito Balear. There are two 18-hole golf courses, with others planned; three marinas, with another to be built; a 21-court international tennis centre; a riding centre, and hotels. Work begins shortly on a beach club and flats. Two housing developments at Santa Ponsa Nova are offering property on the British market. They make strong claims for harmony with the environment, although they approach this in contrasting ways. One is Los Pampanos (young vine branches), 15 minutes from Palma, Majorca's principal town. The first phase will comprise 57 apartments in 10 blocks and the first should be completed by May. It has two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartments from Pounds 158,300 with larger types from Pounds 213,800. Interiors are equipped expensively. The properties have broad, room-like terraces, sometimes L-shaped, looking across to the sea and some have roof-top pools. All come with a family golf share. While interiors follow today's up-market pattern, Spanish architect Melvin Villarroel has allowed his interest in garden architecture a free hand with the outer scene. All buildings are to be the same terracotta colour: he believes surrounding greenery will give sufficient variation. And his pitched roofs are of different heights. Efforts are made with plastering to avoid sharp angles and even soften the straight lines of outer walls, while balconies and terraces are of differing shapes; some walls look as though buttressed. The blocks will be set around swimming pool areas, with fountains and pathways. and hundreds of palms are being brought in to create a sub-tropical setting. There will also be a few four-bedroom villas, from Pounds 498,800. In total, there may be 180 properties on the 25-acre site, but the developer is playing it by ear and will keep step with demand. So far, most purchasers have been German, followed by the Swedish, Spanish and British. The development partnership comprises IMISA, a German bank and construction company, and the architect. Still at Santa Ponsa Nova, Las Abubillas is a development of more conventional style, although even this estate has abandoned dazzling white walls for shades of ochre and cream. Detached villas with tiled roofs echo the typical Spanish holiday home. The properties have one or two storeys with two to five bedrooms. They are in low-walled gardens with terraces, pergolas, sometimes plunge pools - all the trimmings for summer living - plus salons with fireplaces for winter evenings. Each has a parking space in its garden and there is a communal pool, while a village street winds through the estate. Prices range from Pounds 220,000 to Pounds 280,000. Las Abubillas takes its name from the hoopoes that fly around the golf course it overlooks. Eventually, there may be 116 homes on its 17 acres. And typical of the mingling nationalities involved in Mediterranean leisure homes, the developer here is a British company, Ryde Properties, while the designer is the Russian-born Pedro Otzoup.

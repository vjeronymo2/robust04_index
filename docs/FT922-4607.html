			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Judge dismisses market-rigging case ANOTHER City prosecution collapsed yesterday when Mr Peter Marks, a director of stockbrokers Branston &amp; Gothard, was cleared of attempted market rigging on the directions of a judge. Judge Hordern told the jury at Knightsbridge Crown Court that the Department of Trade and Industry had not proved that Mr Marks made the statement which was at the root of the prosecution case. He made his direction without calling on the defence and awarded Mr Marks his costs out of central funds. Mr Marks had denied a charge under section 47 of the Financial Services Act of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement to induce share dealing. The prosecution alleged that on October 12, 1990, as part of an attempted 'bear raid', Mr Marks told Mr Timothy Medland, then head of UK equity trading at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, that Maxwell Communications Corporation would be filing for bankruptcy that day - knowing it was untrue. The conversation took place between two others in which Mr Marks agreed to sell two blocks of 100,000 MCC shares to Goldman Sachs. The court heard that Mr Marks had told Stock Exchange investigators that he had merely passed on a story he had heard was 'going the rounds' to Goldman Sachs because the bank was known to be a big buyer of Maxwell shares. Judge Hordern said the charge alleged that Mr Marks told Mr Medland that Maxwell would be filing for bankruptcy that day. 'But Mr Medland's evidence was that what was said to him was either 'I' or 'We believe that Maxwell will be filing for bankruptcy today.' 'That is an entirely different statement. It does not mean the same thing as 'Maxwell will be filing for bankruptcy today,' which is a statement of something which Maxwell is going to do. To say 'I believe Maxwell will be filing for bankruptcy' is a statement of what is in your own head.' After the acquittal Mr Marks' solicitor, Mr Nicholas Munday, of Clifford Chance, said everyone in the Stock Exchange would be relieved to know that 'a conversation of this kind is not a criminal offence'. He added: 'Perhaps the DTI will now get on and investigate the creation of an artificial market in Maxwell shares. The evidence which has emerged during this case should assist the authorities to get on with that task at long last.' During the trial there was evidence that Goldman Sachs had 'a special relationship' with the Maxwell organisation and that Mr Eric Sheinberg, the bank's managing director in New York, had been the only person with authority over a special Maxwell share account. Witnesses said that in September and October 1990, when there had been sustained bouts of selling of Maxwell shares amid rumours about MCC's financial viability, Goldman Sachs had been buying. On October 12 it had held 23,433,708 MCC shares and dealing records showed that on that day 1m MCC shares had been sold by Goldman Sachs in London to Goldman Sachs New York. A Goldman Sachs marketmaker said that as the MCC price had gone down he had bought the stock on the instructions of a Goldman Sachs partner in New York. The Marks case is believed to be only the third prosecution under section 47 of the Financial Services Act - and the second to have failed.</p>

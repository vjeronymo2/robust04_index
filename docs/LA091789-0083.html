			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSKIES GET BIG PLAYS AND A BIG WIN, 38-9  </P> <P> It's not too late to teach an old Husky new tricks.  </P> <P> Washington Coach Don James, a long-time proponent of a conservative,  grind-it-out offense, has switched to a one-back, short passing formation,  looking for the big play.  </P> <P> On Saturday, he got what he wanted.  </P> <P> "We finally hit a couple of big plays," James said after the 15th-ranked  Huskies pounded Purdue, 38-9, for their ninth victory in a row over a Big Ten  opponent.  </P> <P> Washington, which beat Texas A&amp;M, 19-6, in its opener, recorded the two  longest non-scoring plays in its 100-year football history -- a 78-yard run by  Greg Lewis and 76-yard pass play in which Cary Conklin threw to Andre Riley.  </P> <P> The Huskies (2-0) shut out the Boilermakers (1-1) for the first three quarters.  Purdue scored a touchdown and a safety against Washington's reserves in the  fourth quarter and gained only 39 yards rushing for the game.  </P> <P> Purdue quarterback Steve Letnich said: "We wanted to put something on the  scoreboard. Washington did some great things on defense. They're a solid,  legitimate top 10 team. They're going to beat a lot of people this year."  </P> <P> Conklin passed for three touchdowns and ran for a fourth, completing 14 of 27  for 215 yards and no interceptions. Riley caught four passes for 137 yards  while Lewis carried 20 times for 165 yards.  </P> <P> Lewis' 78-yard run came in the third quarter on a quick opener over left guard.  He was caught from behind by strong safety Terry Johnson at the four and  Washington scored its fifth touchdown of the game three plays later on  Conklin's five-yard pass to tight end Aaron Pierce.  </P> <P> Conklin teamed with Riley on a corner pattern on the left side of the field for  their 76-yard completion in the second quarter. Riley got behind the Purdue  defense, but was caught from behind by cornerback Derrick Kelson on the four.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Conklin threw a two-yard scoring pass to Lewis for a 24-0  halftime lead.  </P> <P> Purdue's fourth-quarter touchdown came on a 25-yard pass play from Letnich to  Calvin Williams.  </P></p>

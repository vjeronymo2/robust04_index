			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev said  that, by September 1, 1994 Russia would have withdrawn all its  troops from other countries, both within and outside former  Soviet territory, except for those states with which it has  agreements to set up military bases on their territory.    Altogether 32,000 troops would return to Russia, Grachev  told  a news conference in Moscow on Friday.    The Black Sea Fleet, however, would stay in Crimea, and,  unless proper social security was provided for retired Russian  military officers living in Estonia, Russia would keep a  military contingent there too, he said.    The general said additional allocations were needed to  resettle officers and their families coming back to Russia. He  said his ministry was spending more than half of its funds for  those purposes.    Grachev said military reforms could not be successful  without  state support. Only at that level could the stable financing of  the armed forces be ensured and could they be brought up to full  strength, he said.    The minister slammed the Pacific Fleet for its training  standards, which, he qualified as the lowest in the country's  armed forces. He said there would be replacements in the fleet  command.    Grachev said Russia would keep all its five arms of defense  (the strategic missile forces, the land forces, the air force,  the air defense forces and the navy) till the year 2000. He  said the Defense Ministry would be paying priority attention to  the strategic missile forces, "which are the guarantor of  national security both today and in future."</p>

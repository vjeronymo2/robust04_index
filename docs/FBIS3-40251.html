			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain (Second Rank) Vasil Danov and Major </F> (Eng.) Iliycho Iliev of the Rakovski Bulgarian Officer Legion:  "How Did You Sin, Officer? In the Past and Now the Armed  Defender of Bulgaria Continues To Be Economically Enslaved,  Politically Deprived of Rights, Socially Degraded, and Morally  Crippled"]    [Text] Who was the officer in 1989? For a very large part  of the population, he was the uniformed novice, a prop of the  totalitarian regime, a submissive executor of absurd commands  and decisions of the semi-illiterate superior leaders, who were  sometimes shepherds, tailors, and cobblers, quickly graduated  from the ShZO [Reserve Officers School], or from three- or  six-month courses for officers.    Exploiting the halo created above the head of the officer  throughout history, the totalitarian machine employed hirelings  who were to embody and support the mechanism of its power. For  this bargain, it paid them a little more than the average  salary, maintaining the myth in the society at large that the  officer is a privileged person, that he is part of the nation's  economic and political elite.    For the recalcitrant, there were political sections and  party  commissions, military counterintelligence, and State Security.  There was also the "freedom" to leave the military with a wolf's  ticket [an undesirable discharge] given to those disciplinarily  dismissed for political reasons, or for "unreliability" and to  be doomed to misery and moral harassment along with his family.    For two or three decades of loyal service to the nation and  the fatherland, the officers received the indulgence of buying  one panelboard apartment (after age 45), of living in  humiliating anticipation of a paltry pension, to be looked at  with disparagement, and to endure spiritual judgment under  socialism, before smiling at death.    Called in the name of the most shining ideals, the officer  was economically enslaved, politically deprived of rights,  socially degraded, and morally crippled.  <H5>  Today We Draw the "Dividends" From This Inheritance </H5>   Of the 500 officers released this year [1993], almost 80  percent of them have no right to a pension. These are the young  officers who preferred to drive taxis, to lay tiles, or to  become painters instead of waiting for inadequate salaries,  which are sometimes delayed.  <H3>  Unemployment Among Officers' Wives Is Disproportionately  High; 65-70 Percent Do Not Work </H3>   These women are among the first to fall victim to layoffs  since "the husband is an officer."    The meager military budget does not allow for periodic  issuing of uniforms. There are not sufficient means for  repairing garrison buildings, for feeding personnel, and for  basic human needs, let alone for full military preparedness. The  army owes hundreds of millions of levs to state and private  companies, which are already refusing to supply us with even the  most essential goods. In the press, cases have been described in  which officers have used their own funds to feed their troops.  In a number of outfits, it has become a tradition to give passes  for Saturday and Sunday to almost all the soldiers because it is  impossible to feed them in the mess halls.    The paltry social funds which the army has today do not  permit housing to be built and condemn young officers to remain  homeless for many years.    For that reason, during the coming years in some military  schools, it will reach such a point that 0.66 percent of young  people will apply for admission. Thus, anyone who is willing and  can read and write will be admitted.    Legally, the officer continues to be in a much more  disadvantageous position than civilians. Deprived of the right  to participate in political life, we are denied representation  in parliament and are without even the most modest lobby with  the deputies.    Two parliaments and three governments have delayed the Law  on  Defense and the Armed Forces (ZOVS), the package of laws on the  MVR [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the law on pensions, state  employees, and so forth. And that is no accident. The interests  of not a single one of the parliamentary political forces  coincide with the nation's need for a strong military and  police. The solidarity of an officer corps possessing good  morale would raise a cry against the corruption, lawlessness,  and passivity of the institutions and those in power. It would  be asked why the criminals who are ruining the army and driving  the country to yet another national catastrophe are not being  brought to justice.  <H5>  In the Puppet Show, the Fate of Bulgaria Is Being Trifled... </H5>   ...but the episode, "Creation of a Stable Army, Police, and  Specialized Service," is missing.    Officers who are highly qualified and concerned about their  futures, led by charming generals, did not permit people with  dubious (agent [state security informer]) antecedents or with  current legal entanglements to lecture to us from parliamentary  microphones about what is national security, military doctrine,  the armed forces, and military reform. As if no one knew that 11  billion dollars and eight levs (in 1992 prices) would be  required for the reform.    At the same time, the gentlemen-populists are ready to vote  to limit the period of active military service by three or more  months. They are ready to obstruct the army just to let graft  operate for themselves. What else could a person think, after a  group of deputies presented a motion to adjourn a parliamentary  meeting at which the disasterous financial condition of the army  would be examined and the defense minister and the chief of the  general staff would be heard? But this motion was dismissed  because there were no more urgent problems than those of the  military.    The current plight of the military servicemen is the result  of a staged ineptitude and of a deliberate attempt to reduce the  defensive capabilities of the nation, in order to have that  posttotalitarian model adopted, a model determined by the  puppeteers. That is why our defense industry has also been  wrecked; we have lost longstanding arms markets into which  companies from "brotherly" states have quickly stepped.    For this reason, we continue to be mired, without rights,  still doomed by the Law on General Military Service of 1958 and  by the statutes and regulations copied from the former USSR's  statutes on the armed forces by neo-Stalinists. The Regulations  on the Acceptance of Officers for Active Military Duty, which is  still in effect (and still secret), contains numerous flagrant  violations of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the  Constitution, and of recently passed laws. The obsolete  normative order ties the hands of the just, hardworking  commanders who are willing to take the initiative and creates  excellent conditions for schemers, string-pullers, and  opportunists to exercise selective leadership methods.  <H3>  Society Has the Kind of Military That It Deserves, That It  Creates for Itself </H3>   At times, ill-fed and reduced to rags, our army has been  invincible because among the people there has seethed a volcano  of vital patriotic enthusiasm. Today, their faith shaken and  deeply rent by division, we can hardly expect that we will soon  again have the reviving luster from that generation of officers  who have written the most glorious pages of our recent history.  They did not lose a single battle or a single operation in the  Serbo-Bulgarian War, the first Balkan War, the second Balkan  War, World War I, or World War II, but, as a result of the  shortsighted policies of their "leaders," they have been  relegated to the camp of the vanquished.    After 10 November 1989, the defense bureaucracy opened its  doors to hundreds of civilian specialists. But with the  exception of indisputable professionals, along with the three  civilian defense ministers, there have come not just a few prima  donnas, men who left their country to work abroad, and  intriguers, who have robbed the military materially and morally,  deepening its contradictions, and going all over the world,  leaving the problems to the next batch of experimenters. We  believe that it is impermissible for officers and sargeants to  wait 10-15 years for military housing while civilians receive a  key to the military housing stock with their appointment papers  just because they are on someone's team. After months, the team  left the MO [Ministry of Defense], but they kept the housing  they acquired, those forever happy former servicemen.    Lacking a national security concept, official ratification  of  the Bulgarian military doctrine, and laws, our army has been on  autopilot for four years, and the officer corps has wandered  about in a professional, legal, and moral wilderness. Taking  turns, the almost seasonal management team in the MO comes in.  With the understanding that they are short-timers, they work in  piecemeal fashion, without even trying to set forth the  principles of a modern, stable military.    Under these circumstances, those who thrive are generals,  senior commanders, and the leading pawns from the Dzhurov  [Minister of Defense Dobri Dzhurov 1962-90] era, the embryos of  the neophytes, suckers from a more energetic plant, pretenders  to the former military glory. Today, already as depoliticized  leaders, they graduate discretely from language courses, receive  specialized training at U.S., French, and German academies, lead  newly established administrations and departments, profit from  rigged competitions, and deliver testimonials about their common  colleagues.    After the defeat in Vietnam, the prestige of the U.S. armed  forces fell abruptly. This was followed by an unsparing analysis  of the reasons for the ignominious defeat. Legal, structural,  and financial measures were taken. In a few years, the  government and the society at large restored the ranking of the  Army, Air Force, and Navy to first place in the sociological  ratings, next to the Supreme Court, and ahead of the president,  television stars, and sports heroes. But to achieve this,  intellectual courage and determination were necessary; these  qualities were displayed by the leadership of the armed forces.    This same intellectual courage is needed in Bulgaria.</p>

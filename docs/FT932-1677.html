			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Rosyth in cut-price Trident bid: Fife yard offers submarine refit deal Pounds 70m lower than previous estimate THE ROSYTH naval dockyard in Fife yesterday made an unexpected 11th-hour bid to swing the government decision on Trident refit work with a radical new cut-price scheme. Its new plan, designed to stop the crucial nuclear submarine refit business going to Plymouth's Devonport yard, would require Ministry of Defence investment of just Pounds 60m - half the cost of Devonport's latest bid and Pounds 70m less than Rosyth's previous bid of Pounds 130m. Rosyth's managers, Babcock Thorn, announced the proposal just two days before the cabinet was expected to make its long-delayed decision on which yard should become the sole UK site for refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered submarines. Thousands of jobs hang on the verdict. Although the loser is expected to receive guarantees of other naval work, its long-term survival will be in doubt. Rosyth's latest proposal produced an explosive reaction at Devonport, which dismissed it as 'a special last-minute one-day-sale offer'. Devonport Management Limited (DML) said it believed it had come ahead in all four stages of bidding over the past 11 months. 'What credibility can an offer of this kind at this stage possibly have?' Mr Peter Whitehouse, DML's business development manager, said. 'What do they think this is, a blasted supermarket sale of toilet rolls?' The MoD said last night it was not clear whether the latest bid would be considered admissible. A decision was postponed last December after Babcock Thorn offered a project similar to Devonport's, adapting existing docks. Its bid was previously based on completing a more expensive purpose-built dock complex, on which more than Pounds 120m has been spent. The new proposal submitted to the MoD involves using a dock recently upgraded at a cost of Pounds 20m as an emergency facility for Trident. Radioactive fuel would be removed at this dock early in the refit, allowing most of the work to be done in existing docks, which would not need to be upgraded. The emergency dock would then be used for fuel loading at the end of the refit. Rosyth said the scheme would enable it to accommodate all refits and decommissioning of nuclear submarines from July 1994 and to take the first Trident submarine for refit in September 1999. Mr Allan Smith, Babcock Thorn's managing director, said he was confident the savings offered by the scheme 'must be taken into consideration'. Together with proposals to use the original Trident project site for disposal of old submarines, the scheme would allow the MoD to make use of all the capital investment it had undertaken at Rosyth, he added.</p>

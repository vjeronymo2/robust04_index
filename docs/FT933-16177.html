			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Kanemaru fires up New Party THE man who has pledged to clean up Japanese politics yesterday kicked off his election campaign in Yamanashi - the old constituency of Mr Shin Kanemaru, disgraced godfather of the ruling Liberal Democrats (LDP), Reuter reports from Kofu. Under a banner reading 'Let's put Japan to rights from Yamanashi', Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party, said there could be no better place to start a clean-up. 'Needless to say we chose Yamanashi to start the campaign because of its scandalous political climate,' he said in a speech to 2,000 supporters in Kofu, the prefectural cap-ital. 'This is where the cosy relations between politicians and businessmen are at their worst.' Kofu, 100 km west of Tokyo in the shadow of Mount Fuji, radiates the prosperity of modern Japan. Its wide boulevards are lined with department stores, gleaming office buildings and trees and shrubs. However, much of the wealth came from Mr Kanemaru's manipulation of a system under which politicians used their influence to benefit their most generous campaign donors. It is a system Mr Hosokawa and a generation of new politicians say they want to change. Last week Fair Trade Commission investigators raided the offices of 30 construction companies in Yamanashi. Experts on corruption said the move only became possible after Mr Kanemaru's clout over civil servants evaporated following his recent arrest on charges of massive tax evasion. Prosecutors said the companies in question extended billions of yen in questionable donations to Mr Kanemaru. In return, they were believed to have been shielded from censure by civil servants. When Japan's national railway wanted to build a track to test a proposed high-speed supertrain, Mr Kanemaru made sure it came to Yamanashi. Land prices shot up and made local farmers richer overnight.</p>

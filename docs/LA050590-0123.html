			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE PRICE PLAN STRUCK DOWN;  </P> <P> PROP. 103: A JUDGE RULES AGAINST PROPOSAL BY COMMISSIONER GILLESPIE TO SUPPRESS  ZIP CODES AS A BASIS FOR SETTING AUTO PREMIUMS.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles judge on Friday struck down Insurance Commissioner Roxani  Gillespie's auto insurance pricing plan that suppressed ZIP codes -- or  neighborhoods -- as a basis for setting premiums and ruled out use of gender  and marital status in pricing. Gillespie was ordered to draft a new plan.  </P> <P> Judge Miriam A. Vogel said Gillespie's plan, announced last Dec. 6, must fall  because pricing of auto insurance has to continue to be cost-based. Vogel said  that where one lives is an important factor. But she said the part of  Proposition 103 that the commissioner cited for justification of her plan is  inconsistent with another part of the measure and must yield to it.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Vogel ruled that Gillespie's freeze on auto  insurance rates, announced last Oct. 2, will be allowed to continue  indefinitely.  </P> <P> The practical effect of the ruling was that Los Angeles and other urban drivers  will not be getting the rate decreases that Gillespie promised. On the other  hand, rural and many suburban drivers will not be getting the small increases  implied when she issued the plan. Current rate structures, under which city  drivers, particularly in minority and low-income neighborhoods, pay the most  will stay in effect.  </P> <P> Gillespie's attorney for Proposition 103 matters, Karl Rubinstein, vowed to  appeal Vogel's ruling against the commissioner's pricing plan to the state  Court of Appeal and seek a stay of the injunction against the plan Vogel said  she will issue next week.  </P> <P> But the effect of Friday's rulings was once again to delay implementation of  key provisions of Proposition 103. Vogel specifically said the insurance  companies will now not have to file new rating plans on May 11, as Gillespie  was demanding.  </P> <P> Eighteen months after the initiative was approved by the electorate, its most  important parts -- the new pricing plans, rate rollbacks and rate regulation  according to a fair rate of return formula for the companies -- remain in  limbo.  </P> <P> Gillespie vowed last May, for instance, to make all rate rollback decisions by  last November, ruling which, if any, companies would have to give rebates of  premiums. But six more months have passed and she has yet to make a decision  regarding a single company.  </P> <P> Even when she does set fair rate of return standards for the companies, her  decision is subject to court appeal, as would be subsequent decisions on which  companies, according to these standards, will have to roll back their rates and  give their customers rebates. The appeals process could take years.  </P> <P> Consumer advocates were discouraged by Vogel's decision, with Proposition 103  author Harvey Rosenfield saying it guts a substantial part of the measure.  </P> <P> But even some insurance company lawyers expressed weariness with the legal  process and a few pointed out that the freeze on rates that Vogel supported  Friday has already lasted seven months and seems sure now to last beyond the  November election.  </P> <P> To that extent, the insurers' lawyers said, Gillespie has been successful in  that she has stopped what had been a high rate of annual auto insurance price  increases for the better part of a year.  </P> <P> Vogel is now charged with hearing virtually all litigation involving  Proposition 103 -- more than a dozen cases. She won the role after the  appellate courts denied a motion of bias filed against her by Gillespie, who  believes that Vogel favors the insurance companies too much in her rulings.  </P> <P> In her tentative written ruling Friday, which she indicated might be revised  slightly before being made final next week, Vogel reiterated that "negative  social implications" of current insurance rates, such as charging the poor the  highest rates, cannot be allowed to be decisive considerations in ruling  whether a regulation passes muster.  </P> <P> Even if Gillespie's regulations were socially desirable, the judge wrote, they  "are simply not a proper basis for excluding (pricing) factors that . . . (are  a) sound actuarial basis for fixing rates."  </P> <P> Besides, in mandating substantially lower rates in the cities while allowing  insurers to recoup only part of the difference with slightly higher rates in  rural areas, Gillespie was virtually ruling out the possibility that the  insurers could receive a fair rate of return on their total business, Vogel  said.  </P> <P> Vogel added that there was "no substantial evidence" that Gillespie is  justified in giving special price advantages to urban areas, regardless of the  higher accident and claims rates in those areas.  </P></p>

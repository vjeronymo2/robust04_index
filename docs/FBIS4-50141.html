			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui  returned to Taipei Monday [16 May] after a 3-day four-nation  state visit.    President Li was greeted by many high-ranking officials,  including Vice President Li Yuan-zu, at Sungshan Airport in  downtown Taipei.    Li did not make any formal statements on his trip at the  airport. He may meet the press on May 26 to explain the  significance of his four-nation state visit, government sources  said.    Accompanied by a large entourage, Li began his global tour  aboard a chartered China Airlines plane, which took him to  Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland.    Li made a stopover at Singapore's Changi International  Airport on his return flight from South Africa. Many senior  Singaporean officials, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong,  greeted Li at the airport, television news reports said.    Li's four-nation visit aimed to strengthen the Republic of  China [ROC]'s diplomatic ties with its allies. Li signed joint  communiques with heads of state of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and  Swaziland pledging to further strengthen cooperation in various  fields. Li also met with the new South African president,  Nelson Mandela, during his stay in Pretoria. Li and Mandela  reaffirmed their determination to further boost bilateral ties.    This was Li's first official overseas trip since he assumed  the presidency in 1988. Li made an unofficial visit to  Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand  early this year as part of his effort to promote Taiwan's  substantive relations with other countries and to increase  Taiwan's presence in the world arena. Taiwan does not maintain  diplomatic ties with the four Southeast Asian nations.</p>

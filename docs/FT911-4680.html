			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Japanese railway in straight issue KINKI Nippon Railway, a leading Japanese private railway company, launched the first straight bond issue by an industrial company for two years yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The nine-year bonds are worth Y10bn with a coupon of 7 per cent. This will be the first domestic straight bond issue by a industrial company since Mitsubishi Estate's flotation in November 1988, only a month after the market was opened to industrial companies. Japanese companies have since relied on equity-linked funding, such as warrant bonds and convertible bonds, and kept their distance from the straight bonds. Government restrictions preventing companies with low ratings from financing had partly stemmed the flow, as had the high commission costs, which had made the bonds less attractive than equity-linked issues. The result has been that only a select group of utilities companies, such as electrical power companies and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, have used straight bonds. But tighter lending policies enforced by Japanese banks and a realisation of the risks linked to equity financing in a volatile stock market have prompted companies to seek other sources of financing. Leading industrial companies are expected to turn to the straight bond market. Mitsubishi Estate has again filed applications with the Ministry of Finance, and plans to issue a total of Y200bn within the next two years. Mr Mitsuru Nagai, director and general manager at Kinki Nippon Railway's finance and accounting division, said that the sluggish stock market has made the company cautious about equity linked financing. 'And you can't get a bank to lend Y10bn on the spot these days,' he added.</p>

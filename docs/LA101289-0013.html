			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CLEANUP AT ASBESTOS-TAINTED SITE TO START;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: A FORMER MANUFACTURING PLANT IN CARSON WILL BURY CONTAMINATED SOIL  AT THE SITE WHERE THE SOIL WAS FOUND.  </P> <P> Cleanup is scheduled to start today on a former Carson manufacturing site  contaminated with asbestos, which can cause cancer.  </P> <P> Thousands of cubic yards of contaminated soil will be buried at the 65-acre  site, where Manville Corp. operated a pipe manufacturing plant from 1937 to  1982. The soil will be buried in two dumps on the west side of the site, at  2420 E. 223rd St.  </P> <P> According to the state Department of Health Services, this is the first time  that a South Bay company has been allowed to permanently bury toxic waste on  the same site at which it was found.  </P> <P> "It's less costly and a lot safer," said Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for the  state Health Services Toxic Substances Control Division. "You want to try to  move the asbestos as little as possible."  </P> <P> When inhaled, asbestos fibers have been shown to cause lung cancer and  respiratory ailments, Hirsch said.  </P> <P> The site is across the Dominguez Flood Control Channel from the Arco Oil  Refinery and borders the Ventura Transfer Co. The nearest residential area,  Lincoln Village, is three-fourths of a mile away. Hirsch said residents will  not be at risk during the project because the soil will be sprinkled with water  to keep the asbestos fibers from entering the air.  </P> <P> Whether the site posed a health risk to residents in the past is uncertain,  said Bill Kelly, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management  District. "Obviously," Kelly said, "it is possible the asbestos migrated from  the wind off the site."  </P> <P> During the four-month project, workers will move about 70,000 cubic yards of  soil -- enough to fill 28 Olympic-size swimming pools -- to two heavily  contaminated areas of the site, said Dave Samson, a spokesman for Denver-based  Manville Corp. These two disposal areas, at the western edge of the property,  already contain about 325,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil.  </P> <P> According to state documents, soil studies have found that in some areas,  including the disposal sites, asbestos concentrations ranged from 40% to 90%.  Concentrations in most areas were less than 1%.  </P> <P> The Regional Water Quality Control Board found that asbestos had not  contaminated the ground water, Hirsch said. It also found no evidence that,  once buried, the asbestos would migrate through the ground to other areas, he  said.  </P> <P> State agencies will continue to monitor the site's two disposal areas once the  project is done, Hirsch said.  </P> <P> One of the dumps, a 7 1/2-acre disposal area at the northwest edge of the  property, will be covered with a foot of fresh soil and a layer of sod. A 6  1/2-acre waste dump at the southwest corner will be covered by a foot of soil  topped by asphalt.  </P> <P> Hirsch said deed restrictions will prohibit anyone from developing the areas or  digging into them without state approval. Nevertheless, Trammell Crow Co., a  developer of business and industrial parks, has agreed to purchase the property  provided the cleanup is a success, Samson said.  </P> <P> Walter Rakowich, a partner in Trammell Crow's South Bay office in Carson, said  the firm plans to build a business park at the site. Samson and Rakowich  declined to reveal the sales price.  </P> <P> Although Manville will retain ownership and maintenance responsibilities of  both disposal areas, it will lease the asphalt lot to Trammell Crow, which  plans to use it to store trucks and vehicles, Samson said.  </P> <P> Manville, formerly the Johns-Manville Corp., manufactured asbestos-lined cement  pipes and insulation at the site from 1937 to 1982.  </P> <P> When Manville began dismantling the site in 1983, it informed the Department of  Health Services that asbestos was present on the property, Hirsch said. Over  the years, asbestos had been dumped in waste piles, pits and settling ponds on  the site.  </P> <P> In 1984, the state asked Manville to begin an investigation into the extent of  the soil contamination. Manville submitted a work plan for the investigation in  1985, and the department approved the results of the investigation in November,  1987.  </P> <P> In August, 1987, the South Coast Air Quality Management District had cited  Manville for violating a regulation that requires sprinkling or coating of  areas where dust can be released into the air, Kelly said. Manville pleaded no  contest and was fined $1,026, he said.  </P> <P> After the citation, Manville installed a water sprinkling system to keep the  fibers from freely floating in the air, Samson said.  </P> <P> Manville started a feasibility study in 1987 on its options: among them, moving  the asbestos off the property, perhaps out of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "That was by far the most expensive (solution)," Samson said. "That also posed  the greatest risk."  </P> <P> Moving the asbestos off the site would have cost $119 million, according to an  engineering study included in the cleanup plan. That would also have risked  asbestos spreading through the air during transport, Samson said.  </P> <P> "Hauling all the asbestos off probably poses the greatest danger," said David  Reizer, an assistant planner for the city of Carson. "You're talking about  hauling stuff out and hauling stuff in, not to mention the traffic side. It  would be a very monumental project."  </P> <P> Instead, Long Beach-based Earth Technology Corp., a firm that specializes in  planning hazardous-waste cleanups, came up with the plan to keep the asbestos  on the site yet salvage most of the property. The Department of Health Services  approved that plan in May.  </P> <P> Manville will spend about $3 million on the cleanup, including the cost of  maintaining the area, Samson said. It also includes the cost of studies  performed by Earth Technology for Manville over the last five years, he said.  </P> <P> Manville has done a similar project in Toronto, and is using on-site burial in  cleaning up one of its sites in Manville, N.J., Samson said.  </P> <P> "It's not a new experimental technique," Hirsch said. "It's been done  elsewhere."  </P> <P> During the project, workers will wear respirators and protective suits while  they move the soil, Samson said. They also will continue to water down the soil  to prevent it from blowing to nearby industrial plants during the move, Samson  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> can raise the risk of lung cancer. Recent studies suggest that drinking  asbestos-contaminated water can increase the risk of gastrointestinal and  pancreatic cancers.  </P></p>

The  president of the new parliament will be the archbishop of  Kisingani, Laurent Monsengwo, who had chaired the High Council  of the Republic (HCR) set up in 1992 by a national conference.  His first deputy president will be the former head of the rival  National Assembly, consisting mainly of supporters of President  Mobutu Sese Seko, Anzulini Bembe, the sources said.    The appointments were made in a parliamentary session late  Tuesday, but the radical opposition had not named their  candidate for premier of the central African country, prolonging  a deadlock that has led to more than two years of political  turmoil and economic chaos. The radical opposition coalition  Holy Alliance has stated it wants the deputy chairman of the  former HCR, Joseph Ileo, to be its candidate, but its  self-styled allies want other candidates and said they have not  been consulted by the Holy Alliance.

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Doubts over D-Mark The Bundesbank's decision yesterday to keep its main interest rates unchanged unnerved foreign exchange markets and forced a reassessment of German monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith. Although views had been split about the likelihood of policy being eased, many in the market felt that the Bank's actions may prove counterproductive. The extent to which the rates decision surprised some was captured by the near record levels of activity in Bund futures and Euromark futures. The first hint that the Bundesbank might not ease policy came with the publication of German M3 figures which rose at an annualised 8.1 per cent last December, well above the 7.2 per cent consensus forecast. While a high M3 number had been well flagged and the Bundesbank had indicated that it would be aberrant, many in the market took yesterday's announcement as a reminder that money supply data would be central to the Bank's decisions. If this view is correct, the market may have to wait until the Bundesbank Council's March 17 meeting before policy is changed because fresh money supply data are not expected much before then. Observers said the Bank would also want to avoid repeating the error of last October when it cut rates in anticipation of good money supply figures which failed to materialise. Sentiment towards the D-Mark was also depressed by a lack of clarity about the Bank's repo operations. The Bank has said it will be returning to announcing a weekly repo rate following a period at which it was fixed at 6 per cent. If a variable rate is announced, the market will take this as a signal that the Bank is prepared to allow rates to slip below 6 per cent, thus easing policy. A number of analysts said the Bundesbank was resolute in its desire to lead, rather than follow, the market. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said the Bundesbank's strategy, however, risked being counterproductive: 'It has not noticeably underpinned the D-Mark or the long bund future.' He added that one could now anticipate enormous speculation every two weeks when the Bank's council meets. If this is the case it will introduce 'enormous volatility and instability in the system'. Other commentators said the Bundesbank tardiness in cutting rates had increased the risk that impatient US investors in the bund market would shift their investments into dollars, thus undermining the German currency. A further possible explanation for the Bank's decision came yesterday from Swiss National Bank president Mr Markus Lusser. He told a Frankfurt radio station that US representatives had recently urged Bundesbank officials to lower rates. He said he had advised the Bundesbank to resist this advice. In another revealing observation, Mr Lusser added: 'There is no global economic and monetary policy yet. There is not even a European economic and monetary policy. And as long as we have only national institutions, national central banks, that make national monetary policy, then these banks are responsible to their own economies and citizens.' Considering the timing and location of the comments and their strong message of economic sovereignty, analysts said it was likely that Mr Lusser had cleared his remarks with Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president. The dollar made sharp gains after the close of London trading yesterday on market rumours of a possible tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. The speculation was prompted by the Fed's failure to add reserves to the system when this was widely anticipated. Earlier the US currency had eased only slightly after the Bundesbank said it was leaving official interest rates unchanged and after news of a steep rise in US weekly jobless claims. Although President Clinton has said there is no need to tighten policy, he appears to be at odds with Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. US observers believe his congressional testimony earlier this week was aimed at priming congress for higher rates. Late yesterday the dollar was trading at Y108.40 and near to the DM1.7450 level, more than a pfennig up from the DM1.7314 at which it closed in London. The Japanese yen receded from the spotlight yesterday after details emerged of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's planned fiscal stimulus package. Uncertainty about the final shape of the package, and ongoing trade talks with the US, have left the market nervous. The yen finished in London at Y108.045 to the dollar, marginally weaker than its Wednesday close. The dollar ended in New York at Y108.15 and DM1.7415. Yesterday was a quiet day for sterling, with no important releases and market attention focused on the D-Mark. Dealers said it continued the recent pattern of tracking the dollar closely. The pound ended a shade higher in London at DM2.5937. It also rose slightly against the dollar to finish at Dollars 1.4980. The Bank of England provided the UK money market with about Pounds 300m of late unspecified assistance. Earlier the Bank had provided Pounds 610m after revising its liquidity shortage to Pounds 1.05bn from an earlier estimate of Pounds 900m.</p>

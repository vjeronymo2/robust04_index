			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello by Roberto </F> Cabada, place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello has confirmed that  Cuba will refine oil from diverse sources in conjunction with a  Mexican enterprise. The Mexican radio station, Radio Rey,  recently announced an accord between Cuba and Mexico to refine  oil from various sources in Cienfuegos. Radio Rebelde  interviewed Carlos Tello in Havana on this subject:    [Begin recording] [Tello] A letter of intent between the  Cuban Government and the Mexican enterprise Mexpetrol has been  signed. The goal is to join forces in operating Cienfuegos' fuel  refinery through a joint enterprise. Work has begun to this  effect. I believe that soon, very soon, we will see this  enterprise in full operation. The idea is to refine oil, not  always from Mexico. The refinery can handle approximately 60,000  barrels a day, refine it, and sell the product to the Cuban  market with the surplus, of course, being marketed to markets  abroad.    [Cabada] Will its profits be divided between Mexico and  Cuba?    [Tello] What is divided?    [Cabada] That which is accrued from the refining process.    [Tello] No. The product of the refinery will be for Cuba and  the surplus will be for the market abroad. [end recording]</p>

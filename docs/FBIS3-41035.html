[passage omitted]    Anatoliy Zlenko said that Ukraine expects $4 billion worth  of  aid as a result of its disarmament. As regards nuclear arms  withdrawal which, according to Ukrainian People's Deputy  Valentin Lemish, seems to have started already, Tarasyuk said:  "I declare with all due responsibility that no warhead has  crossed the borders of Ukraine as yet. Indeed, three warheads  have been transferred to Russia for dismantling, but only  because of their disastrous condition and in response to  experts' demands."</p>

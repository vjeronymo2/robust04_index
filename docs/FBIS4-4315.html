			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Korean Architects  Union observed its 40th birthday.    The great leader President Kim Il-song founded the union in  March 1954 in the difficult postwar period when everything had  been razed to the ground. He has clearly indicated the path of  the union in each stage of the revolutionary development.    The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea sent a  congratulatory message to the members of the union on its 40th  birthday.    The message notes that over the past 40 years the union has  actively helped to build Pyongyang and other cities and rural  communities of Korea splendidly and modern industrial  establishments and grand monumental edifices in different parts  of the nation for the prosperity of the country and the  improvement of the people's living standard.    The message highly estimates the union members for the great  feats they have performed over the past 40 years in ushering in  a brilliant heyday of chuche architecture in Korea.    A meeting was held here Tuesday to mark the anniversary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 29, IRNA -- When an explosion rocked a  Maronite church in Beirut on February 27 just after the  al-Khalil [Hebron] massacre the Western media immediately blamed  Islamic groups. But the recent arrest of former Lebanese  Christian warlord Samir Ja'ja' in connection with the church  blast that killed 11 people dispels the suspicions against  Islamic groups and brings the culprits to light. It is certain  that the Zionists instigated the church blast to distract world  condemnation of the massacre of 60 Palestinians in the Ibrahimi  Mosque in occupied al-Khalil during Ramadan.    The leader of the Phalangist party, George Sa'adah, said on  March 24 that the Christians had to be ashamed of committing  such a crime against the church. It is, however, quite strange  that the Western media did not make much noise about the  perpetrators of this henious crime and did not compete with one  another to call them terrorists, as it always does with Muslims,  even if they are not convicted and their responsibility for such  incidents not proved.    When the Zionists announced that the massacre was the act of  a "mad person," the Western media repeated the version like a  parrot as a confirmed fact, even before a judicial enquiry was  conducted.    The Zionists announced the same justification when the  al-'Aqsa Mosque was set on fire in 1967. They claimed that the  perpetrator, a Canadian Jew, was "mentally deranged," just as  they did in the case of the American-born Goldstein, the  murderer of al-Khalil.    As a general rule the Western media forgets its reasoning  power and neutrality when Zionists make any claims, no matter  how illogical they may be. It tries to promote the false image  of the Zionist state as the "only democratic state in the Middle  East," ignoring the fact that it is a state built on terrorism  and brutal force. Shabra and Shatila, Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim,  al-Khalil are just a few names in the long list of terrorist  activities perpetrated by the Zionist state.    The Beirut church incident is one more example for Muslims  that the Western media is neither fair nor neutral. It is  biased against Islam and working hand-in-glove with the  interests of the Western world.</p>

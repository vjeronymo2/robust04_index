			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by </F> unidentified correspondent on results of Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet's official friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia from  2 to 3 April; recorded -- place and date not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] Comrade foreign minister, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet has just concluded his official friendship  visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Could you please tell us the  main points about the results of that visit?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] Even though Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's  visit to Cambodia this time was very short, it brought about  very fine results. First of all, both sides reiterated the  principles governing bilateral relations in the new situation.  Those principles are based on mutual respect for each country's  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;  noninterference in each other's internal affairs; and  cooperation for mutual benefit. Those principles provide the  basis for the two countries to promote friendship and good  neighborliness. In other words, it is necessary to further  consolidate the time-honored ties between the two peoples.  Based on those principles, our prime minister and the Cambodian  first and second prime ministers as well as the two government  delegations agreed on the need to take practical measures to  further develop bilateral relations. This move will benefit not  only each country's development, but also regional development  as a whole. These measures consist, first of all, of efforts to  step up economic, trade, cultural, scientific-technological,  educational, and training cooperation. Generally speaking, this  cooperation involves all areas of activities. Nonetheless, top  priority is given to economic and trade cooperation. Therefore,  on this occasion, the two sides signed a trade agreement under  which the two countries will accelerate goods exchanges a step  further. Regarding economic cooperation, the two sides agreed  to step up cooperation under different forms, including joint  ventures and participation of Vietnamese companies in bidding  for contracts to build projects funded by aid to Cambodia from  foreign countries or international organizations. Refund and  other forms of cooperation will be available, too.    Regarding trade, along with efforts to step up goods  exchanges, the Cambodian side made an earnest request for goods  transit permission. We gave this request very favorable  consideration based on the principle of mutual benefit.    Regarding other areas of cooperation, the two sides agreed  on  cultural and scientific-technological exchanges. In particular,  the Cambodian delegation wanted us to continue to help Cambodia  with cadre training and human resources development. We also  concurred with the Cambodian side on this issue.    We try our best to promote bilateral relations based on the  principle of mutual benefit. Nonetheless, as far as bilateral  ties are concerned, a number of problems still need to be  resolved. It must be said that, generally speaking, broad  sections of public opinion show due concern for those problems.  The first problem involves the border issue. According to the  Cambodian side, there are many factions in Cambodia. Therefore,  it is necessary to reconsider the border issue and take measures  to resolve existing problems.    The second problem involves Vietnamese residents in  Cambodia.  In the past, due to the Khmer Rouge massacre of Vietnamese, a  number of Vietnamese residents fled to the border area. In the  meantime, Vietnamese nationals who stay in Cambodia often fall  victim to the Khmer Rouge's attacks and cruel massacres.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the safety of Vietnamese  residents in Cambodia. At the same time, it is necessary to  resolve the issue relating to the number of Vietnamese residents  who are stranded in the border area.    [Correspondent] Comrade foreign minister, during Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit, the Vietnamese prime minister and  the two Cambodian co-prime ministers discussed the problems that  you have already mentioned. Did they agree on any  problem-solving methods?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] This is part of the very important  contents of the exchanges of views this time between Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet and the two Cambodian co-prime ministers,  as well as between the two government delegations.    First of all, regarding the border issue, we made it known  to  Cambodia that it is our intention to resolve this issue at an  early date in order to turn the Vietnamese-Cambodian border into  an area of long-lasting peace and friendship for the two  nations. Needless to say, if this goal is realized, there will  be conditions for the two countries to enjoy stability, which,  in turn, will benefit the region as a whole.    Based on this principle, the two sides agreed on the  formation of a joint committee of specialists to exchange views  on ways to resolve this problem according to the contents of  different documents reached so far.    Secondly, there is another aspect of the border issue which  is worth noting here, namely order and stability in the border  area at present. At times, different incidents have taken place  along the border which adversely affected mutual understanding.  Also, we must mention the situation concerning smuggling  activities. During his visit to Cambodia, Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet made a very clear analysis of the advantages and  disadvantages of the situation and stressed the need to ensure  order and stability in the border area. As a result, the  Cambodian leadership unanimously concurred with the need to set  up a joint committee comprising representatives of agencies and  localities concerned to help maintain order and ensure stability  along the border. This move will help prevent the movement of  illegal migrants and other violations which are likely to happen  because of a lack of a well-defined border demarcation line.  However, this move is designed especially to deal with  smuggling activities, which are detrimental to both sides.    Cambodian First Prime Minister Ranariddh as well as Second  Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian Government delegation  were very much in agreement that border stability and order must  be quickly restored, and especially that the two sides must work  together to counter smuggling.    With respect to Vietnamese residents, our prime minister  clearly stated that Vietnamese residents have been living in  Cambodia for several generations. They have shared weal and woe  with the Cambodian people through all stages of history. They  have shared victories and difficulties with the Cambodian people  and they have offered their contribution to national  construction. Therefore, they deserve correct treatment so that  they can conduct their own business in peace. Their business is  not only for their own benefit, but also for building and  reconstructing Cambodia.    This time, First Prime Minister Ranariddh stated clearly  that  the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will continue  the policy of Prince Sihanouk when he was the head of state  before 1970. He also said that the Royal Government will ensure  safety as well as life so that the Vietnamese residents can  enjoy the same conditions as other ethnic groups in Cambodia.    Regarding those who are stranded in the border area, we said  clearly that this is not an issue of our concern only, but it  also attracts attention from the region, the world, and  international organizations. This issue, if left unsolved, will  not be beneficial. The Cambodian side said that several  investigations have been conducted lately leading to the return  of some people. We suggested that this issue continue to be  settled early and to return these people to Cambodia because  they have been living there for many years with their families,  assets, and property. Therefore, if they can return they will  find it easier to get on with their lives and to contribute to  Cambodian reconstruction. Prime Minister Hun Sen said that he  would try his best.    [Correspondent] Dear minister, Vietnam and Cambodia signed  four agreements during the visit. Can you inform us which  issues of these four agreements will be implemented quickly in  the intermediate period?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] It is correct that four agreements were  signed during the visit. They include an agreement on trade  cooperation; an agreement on transit goods; an agreement on  cultural, education, scientific, and technical cooperation; and  an agreement on creating a joint committee for field cooperation  to help the two governments carrying out their agreements.    I believe that in the current conditions, stemming from the  expectations of both sides, we must quickly form committees to  settle the border issue and the issue of Vietnamese residents in  Cambodia. Other issues will continue to be accelerated.  Lately, we have accelerated steps in economic and trade  relations. Moreover, we must quickly form a joint committee in  order to review bilateral relations before finding measures to  accelerate these relations for the better.    I believe that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit opened a  totally new stage in relations between the two countries. It  also correctly executed the principles agreed to by the two  sides about current relations. Therefore, I believe that  relations between the two countries will be further accelerated,  thus contributing to regional peace and stability.    [Correspondent] Thank you, minister.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Westland advances 11% and seeks closer links with Agusta WESTLAND, the helicopter group, is intensifying its industrial links with Agusta, the Italian state-controlled helicopter company, in an effort to forge a second European helicopter partnership to compete against the recently established Franco-German Eurocopter venture. The group said it was getting closer to Agusta and looking for new co-operation opportunities with the Italian company. The two companies are joint partners in the development of the EH101 anti-submarine and search and rescue helicopters. Westland also reported yesterday a 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.4m for the six months to March 27, compared with Pounds 9.4m. The figure was helped by a lower exceptional charge of Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 3.4m) mainly because of lower redundancy costs. Mr Alan Jones, Westland's chief executive, said the EH101 programme underpinned the future of the company's helicopter business. He described the collaboration with Agusta as encouraging and expected it to lead to greater co-operation in production and marketing activities. However, he emphasised the two companies were not considering equity investments or other financial links at this stage. Mr Jones said the UK government's agreement last year to acquire 44 EH101 helicopters for the Royal Navy would provide Westland with business worth Pounds 900m, the first helicopters being due to be delivered in 1995. Italy is also committed to buy EH101 helicopters for its navy but the order hinges on Italian parliamentary approval. Although the current confused political situation in Italy has made the timing of the helicopter order uncertain, Italy is expected to order 16 with options on an additional eight. Westland would benefit by about Pounds 125m from the Italian order. Mr Jones said Canada was reviewing the possibility of acquiring 50 of the helicopters. He expected a decision by the end of this year but conceded Canada could either go ahead or drop the proposal. While seeking closer ties with Agusta in Europe, Westland is continuing to co-operate with Sikorsky and McDonnell Douglas of the US on other military programmes. Westland has teamed up with McDonnell Douglas to bid for a Pounds 2bn UK army attack helicopter contract based on the McDonnell Douglas Apache AH-64. It faces competition from the Franco-German Eurocopter Tiger helicopter, which may bid with British Aerospace, and a joint bid from General Electric Company of the UK and Bell of the US with the Cobra Venom helicopter. The army is expected to make a formal request for bids next year. Westland is also hoping to clinch an order to manufacture up to 88 Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopters for Saudi Arabia. Mr Jones said the timing of the order remained uncertain and Westland was not expecting any significant developments in the immediate future. The Black Hawk requirement would be part of the second phase of the Saudi Al Yamamah defence contract led by British Aerospace. Mr Jones said the Saudis' top priority was a new air base, followed by additional Tornado aircraft with the Black Hawks in third place. Mr Jones was satisfied with the company's first half performance which showed improvements in the profit margins of all the company's divisions in difficult market conditions. Turnover fell from Pounds 241.4m to Pounds 198.1m because of fewer helicopter deliveries. Earnings per share fell to 4.8p, compared with 6.1p after an increased tax charge of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.1m) reflecting a higher tax rate of 24 per cent (20 per cent). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.25p. Mr Jones said the company's commercial aerospace business had been affected by the difficulties of the civil aircraft and airline markets. But the company is hoping to see some recovery in the second part of the year as airline traffic continues to improve. See Lex</p>

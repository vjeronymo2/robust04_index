			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Legal aid awarded to Ramsden MR TERRY RAMSDEN, former chairman of Glen International, an investment firm which collapsed in 1987 with losses of Pounds 142m, has been granted legal aid for his defence against criminal charges. City of London magistrates yesterday said a contribution by Mr Ramsden of Pounds 25,000, assessed by the court's legal aid officer, would not become payable until the end of the criminal proceedings. Mr Ramsden was remanded on Pounds 150,000 bail until April 29. Mr Michael Drury, for the Serious Fraud Office, told the magistrates that by this time proceedings for transfer of the case to the crown court would have taken place. The magistrates altered Mr Ramsden's bail conditions to allow him to report to Fulham police once a week instead of daily. A condition that he must have no contact with a list of people was amended to permit contact through his solicitors. It was Mr Ramsden's second court appearance since his voluntary return to the UK two weeks ago after waiving his right to contest proceedings for his extradition from the US. The 22 charges against him include allegations of fraudulent trading, obtaining property by deception, dishonestly inducing creditors to wait for payment, false accounting and making deceptive statements to investors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The government proposed  Wednesday raising to 330 million yen the amount of compensation  to residents who have sued over high noise levels at U.S. Yokota  Air Base in on the outskirts of Tokyo.    The proposal, submitted in writing to the Tokyo high court  by  officials of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, is 50  million yen more than the government's original proposal.    The figure is still some 300 million yen short of the amount  of compensation suggested by the Tokyo high court in a  compromise proposal, however.    Restrictions on night flights sought by the residents were  also not a part of the compromise agreement but were  incorporated into a nonbinding preamble to the proposal.    Hundreds of residents living near the Yokota base filed the  joint action suit against the government demanding compensation  and a ban on night flights.    In March 1989, the Hachioji Branch of the Tokyo District  Court rejected the residents' demands for a ban on night flights  and compensation for future disturbances. But it ordered the  government to pay 330 million yen in compensation for past  victimization.    Both sides then appealed the ruling, but have been in  negotiations since June following a Supreme Court decision in  February 1993 rejecting a ban on night flights and compensation  for future noise disturbances in two earlier noise pollution  suits.    In November, the Tokyo high court sought a compromise by  proposing an end to the night flights "in principle."    Japan and the U.S. have agreed that flights and ground  activities at the base between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. should be  restricted to those that are essential to the U.S. military's  operations.</p>

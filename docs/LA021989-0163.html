			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> California 120 leading into Yosemite Valley has been reopened after being  closed 2 1/2 days by a rock slide. A 60-yard section of the road was clogged by  huge rocks in a slide park officials blamed on the alternate freezing and  thawing of recent weeks. Even though five boulders as large as automobiles  crashed down the mountain onto the pavement, no injuries were reported. Two  other major routes to Yosemite, California 41 and 140, remained open.  California 120, which enters the park from the Modesto area via Tuolumne  County, reopened Friday just in time for throngs heading to Yosemite for the  three-day President's Day weekend.  </P></p>

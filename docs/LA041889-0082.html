			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRONIC FATIGUE: A MYSTERY UNRAVELS  </P> <P> Dr. Jay Goldstein of Anaheim Hills has spent the last five years researching  and treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating disease  characterized by incapacitating exhaustion and a range of other perplexing  symptoms.  </P> <P> Explaining his theory of an unknown retrovirus invading the immune system,  inducing cells to produce a chemical transmitter affecting the entire body,  Goldstein pauses. "You know," the family practitioner says, "some very  respected physicians will tell you I am crazy."  </P> <P> That's because in posing a medical explanation for the existence of chronic  fatigue syndrome -- a disease with no known cause or cure -- Goldstein is  bucking conventional wisdom. For years now, many in the medical community have  regarded the ailment as primarily psychological, and they are wary of  practitioners who pose unproven medical theories.  </P> <P> But, in fact, a growing number of the nation's most respected scientists are  taking the illness very seriously, researching various hunches and theories of  their own, as they reported at the First Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Conference  held last weekend in San Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dubbed 'Yuppie Flu'  </P> <P> Once dubbed the "yuppie flu" and dismissed as a vogue ailment affecting  neurotic women, chronic fatigue syndrome is now believed to be a complex  illness of immune dysfunction that affects people of both sexes and varying  ages and ethnicity.  </P> <P> Though there is little funding for its study, scientists are hoping to  understand more about chronic fatigue by scrutinizing viruses, including the  involvement of the newly discovered Human Herpes Virus 6, or HHV-6, which has  been linked to cancer and AIDS; questioning whether chronic fatigue is linked  to multiple sclerosis; puzzling over how it is transmitted, and experimenting  with treatment.  </P> <P> "Even AIDS was simpler than this, because it was caused by one virus, and that  virus is very new in the last 20 years. It is more likely (with chronic  fatigue) that a whole bunch of other old viruses and other infectious agents  are all able to cause some people's bodies to act in a particular way to cause  this disease," said Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, associate professor of medicine at  Harvard University and chief of general medicine at Brigham and Women's  Hospital in Boston. "It is only since new technology has enabled us to take  pictures of what goes on in the brain that many physicians became convinced  this was an illness," he said.  </P> <P> Komaroff, a presenter at Saturday's conference attended by about 500  health-care professionals, said he and other researchers speculate toxins,  heredity, allergy and stress may work in concert with other factors to trigger  the malady.  </P> <P> Although statistics documenting its prevalence aren't available, chronic  fatigue syndrome has been classified as a disease by the U.S. Centers for  Disease Control in Atlanta, which is launching a four-year study. In evaluating  a grant proposal, the CDC recently noted the illness "appears to be reaching  epidemic proportions."  </P> <P> Nationwide, there are more than 200 support groups for patients. The CFIDS  Chronicle, the journal of the nonprofit Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction  Syndrome Assn., based in Charlotte, N.C., publishes a bimonthly, 70-page  journal of advocacy information and research.  </P> <P> Repeatedly, chronic fatigue sufferers talk of callous treatment by the medical  community. Through the course of her two-year illness, conference speaker  Melinda Paras, 35, of San Francisco, said she dealt with seven practitioners at  her health maintenance organization. On one occasion, she said, she was told: "  'This is a seven-minute appointment. I don't have time to hear your  complaints.' "  </P> <P> After a battery of laboratory work, Paras was advised to take an AIDS test. As  terrible as it was to wait two agonizing weeks for the appointment and another  two weeks for results, it paled by what was to come, she said. "Absolutely the  worst part of this disease came when I had a particularly acute attack and was  so weak I couldn't breathe and could hardly move. I was scared. I called the  HMO, and the nurse-practitioner said: 'There is nothing more we can do for you.  We recommend you seek psychiatric treatment,' " Paras recalled.  </P> <P> Formerly a program coordinator for a nonprofit institution, Paras was stricken  while on a business trip in Washington. She thought it was severe flu, but in  the next two months became so debilitated, "it took me 30 minutes to crawl to  the bathroom and I had to take a nap on the floor for 30 minutes on the way  back to bed."  </P> <P> Another speaker, Tom Hennessey, a 35-year-old former BMW salesman who described  himself as "a very aggressive, competitive person," said he is now unable to  work because of chronic fatigue and has spent his last $20,000 on medical  expenses. "My life savings and individual retirement account are gone,"  Hennessey said, "and I have sold two cars. I don't have the money to pay the  May rent."  </P> <P> Recently, his claim for Social Security disability was denied, he said. He  urged health-care workers assembled to support patients with letters and  documents necessary for disability payments, rent subsidies and food stamps.  "We also need buddy systems to help us with chores, such as cooking, cleaning  and taking care of ourselves," he added.  </P> <P> Many are struck in theirs 30s and 40s, experts say, more often women than men.  Typically, incapacitating exhaustion is accompanied by flu-like symptoms,  including sore throat, swollen lymph glands, drenching night sweats, chronic  cough, painful and weak muscles and joints, and dizziness.  </P> <P> Some also exhibit multiple sclerosis-like symptoms, such as disorientation,  memory loss, inability to concentrate, balance disturbances and brain  inflammation. The disease can last for six months or two years. Others never  seem to recover.  </P> <P> There is disagreement on how long chronic fatigue syndrome has been around,  perhaps in different guises. Estimates range from the last 30 years to more  than 120. In the 20th Century, it has been identified as anemia, a bacterial  infection, low-blood sugar, environmental allergy, bodywide yeast infection,  and more recently, Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, which causes infectious  mononucleosis and other diseases.  </P> <P> However, Dr. Paul Cheney of the Nalle Clinic in Charlotte, N.C., speculates  chronic fatigue may be an old disease that has evolved. "If this had been  around for 200 years, with people this sick, I can't believe we could have  missed it for so long," he said. "I think it's something that has existed as  long as viruses, but some new co-factor has been added, as well."  </P> <P> In searching for clues, scientists are trying to understand how viruses work  singly and together as well as how they affect the immune system.  </P> <P> Although HHV-6 and the Epstein-Barr virus don't cause chronic fatigue syndrome,  they may hold powerful clues, researchers say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evidence of Virus  </P> <P> "We now have evidence that HHV-6 is present and active at the time (chronic  fatigue patients) are sick," Komaroff reported, citing a collaborative effort  with Dr. Dharam Ablashi of the National Cancer Institute and Dr. Berch Henry of  the University of Nevada. The finding may be significant, Komaroff said,  because an active virus can infect cells of the nervous system, which might  contribute to some or all symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. At the National  Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., a high prevalence of antibodies to HHV-6  also has been found in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma  and childhood acute leukemia.  </P> <P> Researchers hypothesize that, like the AIDS virus, HHV-6 has the ability to  kill the immune system's helper cells. "In the culture system, we have found  that when you can co-infect these CD4 helper-positive cells with two viruses,  the cellular killing effect is much faster than either will do alone," said  Ablashi, coordinator for DNA virus studies at the National Cancer Institute. In  a similar vein, investigators speculate that the combination of Epstein-Barr  and HHV-6 might co-infect the immune system of chronic fatigue patients in a  devastating manner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still a Puzzle  </P> <P> Just what goes on their immune systems is a puzzle. "It is very difficult to  sort out the mix of what different agents may be causing this illness. The only  common denominator for all potential causes or co-factors seems to be the  element of immunological dysfunction in all these patients," Cheney of the  Nalle clinic said.  </P> <P> Cheney became interested in the disease while practicing medicine in the early  1980s. At the time, he was inundated with patients from Lake Tahoe suffering  from what he thought might be a chronic mononucleosis-type illness.  </P> <P> After years of research, he believes "the immunologic problem isn't necessarily  a severe one like AIDS. It looks as much like an allergy. Rather than being  suppressed, the immune system looks like it is hyper-responsive, really  fighting something." Theoretically, he added, the immune system's raging battle  may be one reason chronic fatigue patients feel ill constantly.  </P> <P> Virologist Dr. Jay Levy and his Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research Group at UC  San Francisco have been unsuccessful in attempts to isolate an agent that might  cause chronic fatigue. Perplexed by patients whose symptoms resemble multiple  sclerosis, he poses these unanswered questions: "Are these really MS patients,  or is this an early sign of multiple sclerosis in some people? Could chronic  fatigue syndrome be an acute symptom of another virus that gives rise to  multiple sclerosis in certain people?"  </P> <P> Another researcher, Dr. David Bell of Lyndonville, N.Y., started seeing  children with what he now believes is chronic fatigue syndrome in 1983. "These  children had large lymph nodes, big spleens and were quite sick. They still are  sick today," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Genetic or Infectious?  </P> <P> After identifying 21 cases at a local school, the pediatrician compared the  youngsters with a group of 42 healthy children, examining about 50 factors.  Among his findings: "The people who got sick had a high rate of allergy,  implying a genetic marker. There was a high rate of people within the same  family becoming ill, implying an infectious agent. And people with the illness  were much more likely to have been drinking raw milk." After three years of  research, however, the pediatrician has been unable to explain what role raw  milk might play.  </P> <P> Bell, who is affiliated with the Roswell Park Memorial Institute, a cancer  research center in Buffalo, N.Y., reflects a common complaint about lack of  research grants. "When you see a disease that is so devastating to the lives of  children and families, it is remarkable that so little has been done about  this. I see children who haven't been out of bed in a year, and yet there is  very little government response," he said.  </P> <P> Also of concern to doctors is the impact the illness appears to have on the  brain. Cheney said brain tests in some patients reveal unexplained white  lesions of the cortex -- the brain's outer layer of gray matter -- and  abnormalities in the temporal lobes where vision, hearing, memory and emotion  are processed.  </P> <P> "Our scans, mapping electrical activity, show there are characteristics of  brain lesions in almost all of the people who have chronic fatigue syndrome,"  added Goldstein of Anaheim Hills. "In some patients, we see areas of decreased  blood flow in certain areas of the brain."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cognitive Problems  </P> <P> These changes correspond with cognitive impairment. "I have seen IQ tests drop  30 points. I have a doctor in my practice who can't drive a car because he  can't read street signs and mothers who don't remember the names of their  daughters," he said.  </P> <P> He theorizes that an unknown virus enters cells of the immune system of a  genetically susceptible person, inducing production of a chemical transmitter  or cytokine. Other cells, in turn, make their own transmitter chemicals. "You  can almost view the immune system and the brain as one organ. The body is a  network of these communicating systems," Goldstein said.  </P> <P> He speculates that by treating the brain, the immune system can be altered.  Experimenting with a drug that increases slow-wave sleep, he plans to study "in  what ways this treatment might make people feel better."  </P> <P> Other clinicians are also searching for treatments. In some of her patients,  Bay Area physician Dr. Carol Jessop has found an imbalance of gastrointestinal  bacteria and yeast caused, she believes, by chronic use of antibiotics, a  high-sugar diet, birth control pills, steroids, or, in some people, an  immunosuppression caused by an unknown viral agent.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, patient advocacy groups are becoming increasingly vocal. Jan  Montgomery of San Francisco's Chronic Fatigue Immune Deficiency Syndrome  Foundation was instrumental in urging city officials to form a task force  resulting in the conference, co-sponsored by the San Francisco Medical Society,  the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the UC San Francisco  Department of Medicine and School of Nursing.  </P> <P> And researchers, too, are coming to the defense of chronic fatigue patients.  </P> <P> "I don't believe, personally, these are people who are primarily depressed or  psychologically ill," said Dr. Leonard S. Zegans, professor of psychiatry and  director of professional education at the Langley Porter Institute, a UC  psychiatric research, teaching and treatment facility.  </P> <P> The disease represents powerful stress, the psychiatrist said. Moreover,  symptoms such as impaired attention and anxiety alter performance at work or  school, "calling self-worth and self-esteem into question." Not being able to  work is especially devastating because "many of these people are ambitious,"  Zegans added. Patients become isolated, in part, because "not everyone believes  they are sick."  </P> <P> He, too, suspects a virus, latent in the blood stream, maybe re-activated by a  variety of causes, including stress.  </P> <P> "We are just now beginning to learn about the interaction between the nervous  system and the immune system," he told his colleagues at the conference. "We  have a very complex system of checks and balances in the body and there perhaps  are ways in which the equilibrium of body defenses can be altered. I think in  the next 20 years, we are going to be learning a tremendous amount about this."  </P> <P>  For more information about chronic fatigue syndrome, contact the CFIDS Assn.,  P.O.

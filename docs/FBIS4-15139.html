			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- Estonia must step up its  activity from present in the United Nations and try to push  through a resolution that would declare it inadmissible to carry  out wide-scale state supported programs aimed at changing the  demographic situation in occupied and annexed territories,  opposition politician Hardo Aasmae said.    After such a resolution is adopted, all accusations against  Estonia concerning the country's law on aliens and citizenship  law would have no more sense, Aasmae said in an interview. He  said chances were high that such a resolution would be passed in  the United Nations in a simple majority vote if Estonia's policy  before that was active enough.    The opposition politician says Estonia must hurry with its  efforts toward the adoption of the resolution, because the  country will be left with one good argument less in support of  its campaign after the Russian troops have left.    Aasmae predicted support for Estonia's move from a number of  Islamic countries, who are interested in positively resolving  the issue of the West Bank territories occupied by Israel.    "It is quite probable that support for us will also come  from  Japan, who has interest in resolving the problem of the annexed  South Kurils, as well as from many countries who are interested  in the unity of Cyprus. Also the overwhelming majority of  European countries and the United States would find it difficult  to vote against that resolution, since they have mostly always  denounced occupation and annexation," Aasmae said.</p>

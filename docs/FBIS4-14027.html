			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Arabs Are Under Siege"] </F>   [Text] The "international" Security Council has once again  decided to maintain the sanctions on the Libyan people which, it  falsely claims, are imposed on the Libyan regime for its refusal  to extradite two of its citizens accused of involvement in  blowing up an American airliner over Scotland in 1988.    This decision means continuing the siege of Libya, both  people and state, for another four months, during which Libyan  citizens will be paying the price for a crime they have not  committed. Libya's children, including babies, will shoulder the  burden of punishment for a crime on which no sentence has yet  been issued.    At the same time, the siege of Iraq continues. It is the  siege of the people and state and not the siege of Saddam Husayn  alone or his regime. The long-range monitoring is continuing  and its purpose is to prevent the Iraqi people from benefiting  from their resources and wealth.    It is regrettable that international resolutions are issued  one after the other against Libya and Iraq amid Arab silence at  the best of times and even with an Arab welcome and blessing.  While this silence by any other Arab country can be excused, we  cannot excuse the silence of Egypt, the citadel of Arabism, the  pillar of the Arab movement, and the country that represents the  fundamental basis of every correct Arab policy. Also, lifting  the siege from Libya and Iraq serves -- in the present  circumstances -- a purely Egyptian interest. It is enough to  mention that there are thousands of Egyptians working in these  two fraternal countries and both countries can absorb more when  the situation stabilizes and improves.    We do not deny that there is Egyptian action toward lifting  the siege. But we believe that, in view of its role, Egypt can  act more strongly in this direction. The Arab League secretary  general can also support and back this action. Conditions are  possibly appropriate today for the Arab League head to call for  an Arab summit, not to affect a reconciliation, to "kiss and  make up," or to "forget the past," but to stop the deterioration  in Arab relations, to save the fraternal peoples in Libya and  Iraq, and to draw up a plan for lifting the siege imposed on  them.    At the same time, all the Egyptian forces, parties, and  establishments, both the ruling and opposition ones, can today  start an Arab campaign to save the Iraqi and Libyan peoples.  The quicker this action is, the better it will be; otherwise,  we will all pay the price in the form of more differences,  divisions, and weakness in this era of the siege of the Arabs.</p>

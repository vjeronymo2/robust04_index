			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / 'Last chance' talks for Bosnia Serbs BOSNIA'S Serbs will come under intense pressure at the weekend to accept an internationally-brokered peace plan for Bosnia when they meet leaders of the other warring factions and the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia at a two-day summit in Athens. The 'last chance' summit has been called by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the United Nations and European Community mediators, amid urgent consultations by the US, its European allies and Russia on the kind of military measures than can be taken to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to endorse the Vance-Owen plan. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is due in London tomorrow or Monday for talks with Mr John Major, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, which are expected to review all the possible options for further action in Bosnia. With both Britain and France strongly opposed to the selective lifting of the arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia to help the Moslems, it is probable that the talks will concentrate on the feasibility of air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply routes. Following his talks in London, Mr Christopher is scheduled to fly to Moscow on Tuesday, where he will meet President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, in a bid to enlist their support for military measures which Moscow has always been reluctant to approve. Mr Christopher's task will be made easier by Mr Yeltsin's recent victory in the Russian referendum, which has weakened the influence of pro-Serbian hardliners in the Russian parliament. 'We are very satisfied with our co-operation with the US,' Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, said yesterday. Military action and the continued implementation of tougher sanctions, which formally came into effect earlier this week, can be pre-empted by an agreement between the warring factions in Athens. Mr Vance and Lord Owen firmly believe that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia holds the key to a solution of the one-year-long conflict in Bosnia. 'We know that the Bosnian Serb fighting forces are fuelled by Yugoslavia,' Lord Owen said in a radio interview yesterday. Yet the mediators nevertheless appear confident that Mr Milosevic, who tried hard to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan last week, will continue to exert the same kind of pressure on them in Athens. 'President Milosevic has decided this is the best settlement he can get. And he has told them (the Bosnian Serbs) straight he is not going to have the whole of Yugoslavia's economy, livelihood, and even safety, put at risk any longer for the Bosnian Serbs,' Lord Owen said. 'Milosevic has a very heavy responsibility to bear for what has happened over the last two years. But he is not an ideologue. He is a pragmatist. I think he has made a pragmatic choice. He is not going to confront the international community.' Lord Owen's optimism appeared to be backed up by US President Bill Clinton who said yesterday that talk of possible use of allied military force may have made the Bosnian Serbs take a second look at a UN-backed peace plan. Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told reporters in his stronghold of Pale, near Sarajevo, that he believed enough progress could be made in Athens to enable his 'parliament' to accept the peace plan at its meeting on May 5. But he stressed that he did not expect to sign the plan during the weekend summit.</p>

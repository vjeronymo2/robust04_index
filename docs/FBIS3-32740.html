Consequently, the constitutional guarantees related to the  inviolability of personal domicile, the right to move freely in  the country, and the right to hold peaceful and unarmed meetings  remain suspended.    The decree dictates that such emergency measures will  facilitate the antiterrorist operations in this part of the  country. The Armed Forces will ensure an internal order, in  accordance with the existing laws, in those provinces.</p>

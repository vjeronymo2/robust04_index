			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest hurt by write-off THERE WAS widespread disappointment in the market with preliminary results from National Westminster Bank, although traders commented that the shares had merely given up the previous day's gains. They also pointed to the share's 35 per cent relative outperformance over the past year. The bank's pre-tax profits, at Pounds 405m, were in the middle of the market range, but dealers expressed concern at the continuing high level of bad debts which led the bank to write off Pounds 1.9bn, compared with the previous year's figure of Pounds 1.87bn. NatWest shares opened lower at 452p after the results were known and then embarked on a gradual decline which saw them down to 437p in mid-session as analysts assessed current year forecasts in the light of the cautious statement accompanying the figures. At the close the shares were trading 16 lower at 443p, a fall of 3.5 per cent. Turnover totalled 15m shares. One analyst said there remained a question mark over the group's capital base and that an injection of funds would be required at some point, although not in the short term. Another said: 'There was nothing in the bank's figures nor in the post-results meeting with analysts to suggest there are any hidden goodies.' Barclays Bank shares fell 4.9 per cent, or 21 1/2 to 427 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 8m. Barclays reports preliminary numbers on March 4. BAT weaken Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries suffered in the wake of worries of increased US taxes as well as some takeover speculation. The shares were weak all day and came off sharply when the US market opened to end the day 33 lower at 926p on heavy turnover of 8.4m shares. Concern that Mrs Hillary Clinton would raise cigarette taxes as part of her health reforms surfaced on Monday and sent the price of Philip Morris shares spiralling downward in the US. BAT, makes about a third of its profits from US tobacco sales and a similar amount from insurance, most of which has recently been US generated. There was also nervousness that a tax could be imposed on US insurance premiums. Finally there was talk, generally greeted with scepticism, that BAT might make a bid for high street bank TSB. Guinness down Several adverse factors combined to hit Guinness, causing the shares to retreat 12 to 456p. The chief factor was continuing worry that LVMH, cross-holding partner of the UK drinks group, may be considering a corproate restructure so as to raise cash for a bid in the French media industry. But speculation that LVMH could look to Guinness to increase its existing 24 per cent stake would be at odds with the latter's stated strategy as well as breaching the agreement between the two. Other negative influences yesterday included a bearish report on prospects for increases in US excise taxes, and sluggish whisky sales in Japan. LVMH was also said to be reducing champagne prices by some 10 per cent, and there was also talk of a downgrade on the group in Paris by James Capel. In London, BZW shaved its forecast for Guinness. Drugs stance A perception that the heavy US selling of pharmaceuticals is drying up prompted Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull to adopt a more positive stance on the sector. Strauss, a significant player in American Depositary Receipts, moved its recommendation to 'neutral' from 'underweight' and said it was not far off becoming a buyer. Mr Paul Diggle, pharmaceutical analyst and Strauss's head of research said: 'I don't think everything Mrs Clinton can do to the sector is fully reflected in the price, but I can't believe there is much downside to go.' Glaxo rose 4 against the market to 653p and SmithKline Beecham, which announced well-received full-year results, lifted 3 to 424p in the 'A's and 2 1/2 to 367p in the Units. The company announced a profit of Pounds 1.115bn and a 15 per cent sales growth. However, Wellcome suffered as a result of an overhang of stock and the realisation that the group's rating has not fallen in line with its rivals. The shares dropped 29 to 881p. BPB setback A Pounds 64m convertible bond issue due in 2008, accompanied by a forecast that the 1992 dividend total will be cut from last year's 11.25p to 7.5p, undermined sentiment in BPB shares. They retreated 17 to 217p, having dropped to 214 1/2 p at one point. The fall took place in exceptionally heavy trading during which 12m BPB shares changed hands. Specialists were perplexed at the extent of the shares' decline, pointing out that most analysts had already forecast a cut in the dividend payout. Final results from Unilever came within market forecasts but a raised dividend helped bolster the shares which rose 16 to 1160p. Mr David Hallam at Williams de Broe said a good performance in most markets was being threatened by the weakness in the German economy and he remained a short-term holder. Most analysts, however, were positive on a longer term view. Worries by one broker over margin pressures at Boots the chemist knocked the shares, off 9 at 484p. Sears suffered from a badly handled order and lost 4 to 97p. Rumours of a big rights issue in the leisure sector found few credible candidates, although some fingered Granada, the group, which has been busily presenting itself to the institutions in recent weeks. The shares added 4 to 392p. Despite an upbeat message at the agm, shares in Grand Metropolitan fell back, closing 6 off at 445p. Dealers said the stock, along with selected other drinks shares, was suffering a hangover from Monday's big programme trade. Bass slipped 7 to 583p, and Whitbread A shares 6 to 449p. Much better interim profits than expected from Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, and an unexpected interim dividend, saw the shares race up 4 to 29p. Turnover reached 10m, the heaviest single-day's business since last July, when the company first warned of big losses. At best, analysts had expected Amstrad to break even during the period with some looking for losses of up to Pounds 20m, compared with Pounds 15.2m losses at the same stage last year. For the full year Amstrad posted losses of Pounds 71m. A sizeable profits downgrading for business services group BET led to heavy selling and a sharp fall for the shares. Hoare Govett maintained its forecast for the year to March 1993 at Pounds 70m but cut the following year's estimate by nearly 20 per cent to Pounds 81m, to take account of restructuring costs. The move led to strong selling of the stock and by the close the shares were down 8 1/2 to 88 1/2 p, following trade of 7.8m. Hoare Govett warned that BET may be forced to reduce its dividend by 2p to 4.5p. James Capel reduced its dividend expectation from 6.5p to 4p. Elsewhere in the sector, Vinten Group continued to be boosted by the recent recommendation by NatWest Securities and put on another 3 to 357p. Fears that the dispute between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic could worsen continued to hurt the shares of the UK flag carrier. They closed 4 down at 280p, having touched 277p, in trade of 4.4m, with speculation circulating of a possible rights issue. The announcement by Glasgow-based engineering company Howden Group of a two-for-seven rights issue at 52p to raise Pounds 31.4m, saw the shares ease 4 to 59p. Leather and hosiery group Hartsone was hit by a spate of stories including a profit forecast downgrade by the broker and management changes. The shares, down 15 at one stage, recovered to close 2 off at 270p.

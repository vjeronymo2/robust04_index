			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL JAILS IN U.S. GROW MORE CROWDED  </P> <P> Although space in local jails rose 44% nationally between 1983 and 1988, an  even larger surge in inmates cut average space for each prisoner by 6%, the  Bureau of Justice Statistics reported Sunday.  </P> <P> The increased jail space was outstripped by a 54% increase in inmates, leaving  nearly 10% of the nation's 3,316 locally run jails under court orders to  relieve crowding.  </P> <P> Inmates in local jails in California averaged 43 square feet of space, compared  to the 60 square feet adopted as a standard by the American Correctional Assn.  California was one of nine states below the national average of 50.9 square  feet per inmate, according to the bureau, an arm of the Justice Department.  California also registered the highest average of inmates per jail housing unit  -- 5.2.  </P> <P> "The management of jail facilities becomes more difficult when more inmates are  living in high density situations," the bureau noted in its report.  "Maintaining high population densities in large segments of a jail can affect  routine activities such as food service, visitation, recreation, medical care  and sick call, inmate property management and inmates' movements to and from  court or consultations with attorneys."  </P> <P> From 1983 -- the year of the last previous jail census -- to 1988, the number  of jail inmates increased from 223,551 to 343,569.  </P></p>

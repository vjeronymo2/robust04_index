			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Little light at tunnel's end: The outlook for British Coal is looking grimmer by the month The warning from Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, was less than explicit when it finally came, spoken almost as an aside. But there was no doubt about the meaning. He had just received an unenthusiastic reception at the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers after telling delegates that half the company's 6,000 white collar workers were no longer required. Then came the crunch. 'Unless we are more competitive, the consequence will effectively be the closure of more pits,' he said. Last October, the government said that, of Britain's 50 remaining pits, it wanted to close all but 19 because the market for coal was not big enough to sustain them. In a white paper published in March, the government reprieved 12 of the doomed pits after a public outcry forced it to retreat. Within the industry, however, there were strong doubts about whether these 12 pits would stay open for long. In raising the doubts in public, Mr Clarke finally acknowledged what others in the industry had been saying in private for some time. His intervention may also have been prompted by a recognition that the outlook for coal has worsened significantly over the past few months. As the global oversupply in coal continues to undermine the market, British Coal's main customers - the two electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen - are shifting increasingly to a cleaner and, they argue, cheaper, source of energy: gas. The threat to coal from gas and also from nuclear power is greater, and happening more quickly, Mr Clarke told the UDM, than he had anticipated. A new threat to the future of the coal industry has emerged in the shape of anti-pollution measures. The government's Pollution Inspectorate has served notice on the generators that stricter and more costly environmental controls on coal-fired electricity generation are to be imposed by the end of the decade. The generators will have to fit their coal-fired plants with expensive pollution control equipment or run them less intensively; both options are costly and this has reinforced their decisions to build gas-fired stations. The increased cost of pollution control is thus speeding up the so-called 'dash for gas'. National Power, the largest UK generator, this week announced it was closing its coal-fired Thorpe Marsh generator in Yorkshire next March with the loss of 200 jobs. Its place will be taken eventually by gas-fired plants such as Staythorpe, in Nottinghamshire, for which the government granted National Power planning permission a week ago. Nuclear power is also increasing its share of the electricity-generating market. Last year, Nuclear Electric lifted its share from 18.5 per cent to 21.5 per cent. This could rise to 25 per cent by 1997-98 after Sizewell B comes on stream next year. The shift to gas and nuclear power has gradually eroded the domination of Britain's energy market by coal. The industry that the government plans to privatise over the next three years is tiny compared with that brought into the state sector in 1947. Then, there were 958 pits; at the end of the 1984-85 miners' strike, 169 were left. By the end of the century, industry observers believe, there could be fewer than 15 pits in production. Privatisation has already started in a small way. Private operators are being offered licences to run the 18 of the pits which British Coal has said it no longer wants to mine itself, and is either closing or mothballing. The signs are not encouraging. The response from the private sector has been muted, with at least one potential bidder, Young Group, saying it is interested in none of the pits. The mines being offered to the private sector are after all, in British Coal's judgment, the least productive. It is unlikely that more than six will attract private operators. The future for the 12 reprieved pits may be only slightly brighter. British Coal is trying, against difficult odds, to persuade the power generators to buy more coal. It is also looking for niche markets in the industrial and domestic sectors, but the main opportunity for extra sales lies with the generators. As part of its review of the coal industry, the government pressed the generators to buy an extra 65m tonnes over five years from April this year, probably enough to keep open nine of the 12 reprieved pits for most of that period. The generators resisted, but indicated they would take 40m tonnes - perhaps enough to provide a lifeline to six of the 12 mines. Now, even that looks optimistic. Armed with the promise of subsidies from the government in the white paper, British Coal offered coal at 90p to 95p a gigajoule (a measure of thermal efficiency), less than two-thirds of production costs and two-thirds the price received in existing contracts. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, acknowledges that the price cut is 'designed by British Coal to be in the competitive ball park', but he says he does not want to decide how much coal to buy until this autumn. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive at PowerGen, is also non-commital about the offer of a price cut. 'I would take coal tomorrow if the price was right,' he says. Without further pressure from the government, which owns 40 per cent of each of the power-generating companies, PowerGen and National Power may take very little of the extra coal needed to keep the 12 in operation. Both have stocks to last six months and they can buy from the world market, arguably at lower prices than the corporation has offered. In its white paper the government said it would discuss with the generators 'as a matter of urgency' the strategic coal stocks they are legally required to store to ensure continued electricity generation. But discussions are still at an early stage two months later. 'The government has been all over the place on what to do about stocks,' says one generator executive. 'But they have backed off from asking us to increase the levels required by law.' There is little sign the government is ready to step up pressure on the power generators to secure more sales. Ministers appear to feel there is less need for action as pressure from trade unions, opposition politicians and an angry public has waned. By effectively phasing the pit closures over a longer period than first planned, the government has managed to remove some of the sting. According to one generator executive, all 12 of the reprieved pits could be closed tomorrow without sparking the backlash of last October. 'The heat is off and they know it.'</p>

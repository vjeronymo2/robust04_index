			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Clinton warns Haiti, 'Time is up': Invasion force gathers as junta hopes talks may prevent bloodshed President Bill Clinton signalled last night that the US was ready to invade Haiti, warning the military junta: 'Your time is up. Leave now or we will force you from power.' His blunt threat came as Washington intensified preparations for a US-led force to go ashore in the Caribbean republic to restore to power the exiled president, Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The Haiti strongman, General Raoul Cedras, last night declared an intention to 'defend my country' and warned of a 'massacre'. But in a sign that his junta might be wavering, he added that he hoped talks would prevent bloodshed. Mr Clinton, in a televised address, said the US had exhausted diplomacy and now must act to protect its interests in the region and to stop brutal atrocities in Haiti. While the US could not and should not be the 'world's policeman', it had a responsibility to act when 'brutality occurs close to its shores', even though there were 'risks'. Mindful of post-Vietnam concern in the US to avoid lengthy military operations abroad, he pledged that the 'vast majority' of US troops would return home 'within months, not years'. Mr Clinton warned Americans they could face a fresh wave of refugees from Haiti if nothing was done to force the country's military rulers from power. He attempted to disarm critics of Mr Aristide by disclosing that fresh elections would be held in Haiti next year and the exiled president would hand over to a successor early in 1996. Mr Clinton set no deadline for the junta to leave, nor did he set any date for an invasion. The military tempo built up, however, as the navy command ship Mount Whitney set sail yesterday from Norfolk, Virginia. It will direct a gathering armada of at least 18 US warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as 14 military cargo transport vessels. All warships are expected to be on station, ready for action, by Sunday. The US also announced the call-up of 1,600 reservists for back-up roles such as logistics, medical support and policing. The United Nations Security Council has already authorised a multi-national force to use 'all necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership' which seized power from Mr Aristide in 1991. Senior administration officials said the US assumed that American-led troops would have to make a 'forced entry' into Haiti, but Washington still hoped the junta would realise 'their best alternative is to leave and not to try to resist this force'. Mr Clinton's speech was partly designed to gain US public support for a military action that currently is unpopular. Recent opinion polls showed 66 per cent or more of those questioned opposed an invasion. Republicans and many Democratic members of Congress have urged the president to seek congressional authorisation for military action - a vote he would be unlikely to win. In Haiti, almost all open supporters of Mr Aristide have gone into hiding - fearing they will be targets of the country's military. Their decision to go underground follows the murder of several of his prominent supporters in the past two years. It was encouraged by statements from army officers last week that 'traitorous' Haitians would 'pay' if there was an invasion. There is growing fear in the capital, Port-au-Prince, that the country's military may turn its guns on the slums, where Mr Aristide has significant popular support. Although Haiti's poorly equipped and poorly trained army of 7,000 has been expanded by a recruitment programme, it is not expected to offer much resistance to an invading force expected to be three times larger. But maverick elements in the military are considered likely to hide in the slums or countryside and begin guerrilla resistance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Institute of Intellectual Property (IIP, Ichiro  Kato, chairman), an organization of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry's Patent Office, sensing the  increasing severity of Japan-U.S. relations regarding  intellectual property rights (IPR), has recently opened an  office in Washington. The office will gather information on such  issues as the movement in the U.S. Congress for patent law  revision and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's  (CAFC) Goal of uniform judicial precedents for IPR in the United  States. IIP has appointed as its first office director Hirutsuna  Yamashita, a chief researcher from the Patent Office presently  on loan.    IIP in the past has invited such influential individuals as  CAFC Chief Judge Helen Nies and former U.S. Patent and Trademark  Office (USPTO) Commissioner Harry Manbech obtained information  on trends in U.S. patent suits and system revision. However,  cases with Japanese corporations caught up in law suits at the  court level have been increasing, and there is a growing need  for detailed information. IIP also opened the local office  because there has been a change in administration from the  Republican Party to the Democratic Party, and it is important to  develop new connections.    In the Clinton administration, the power of the hard-line  faction on Japan has increased with the appointment of U.S.  senate staffer Bruce Lehman as USPTO commissioner. Individuals  involved in patents also see the intentions of the hard-line  faction in the U.S. request in the Framework talks for the total  prohibition of conputer program reverse engineering.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government  yesterday confirmed its inflexible will to overcome our  landlocked status, 115 years after losing the port of  Antofagasta.    A Foreign Ministry communique notes: "The policy of  recovering Bolivia's sea outlet follows the world  democratization, trade opening, cooperation enhancement, and  true integration processes."    The communique adds: "Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean,  through a free, sovereign, and useful outlet, through diplomatic  procedures, is a priority for our country and our government.  It is supported by the hemispheric community."    The then-Bolivian port of Antofagasta was seized on 14  February 1879 by the Chilean Army, thus initiating the "War of  the Pacific;" a military conflict that involved the Republic of  Peru and ended in the loss by Bolivia of the Littoral Department  to Chile.    The national territory's amputation was consummated through  a  Peace and Borders Treaty signed under Chilean pressure in 1904  which sentenced Bolivia to become a landlocked country. Various  attempts to negotiate a revision of the treaty have failed due  to the Chilean unswerving refusal to consider Bolivian  aspirations.    Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been  severed since 1962, apart from a brief interval during the  government of former de facto President Hugo Banzer.    The Foreign Ministry notes that the sea recovery claim will  remain unchanged in all international forums.    The Foreign Ministry says: "We are committed to pursue, at  the appropriate forums and based on a national consensus, the  appropriate actions to favorably resolve Bolivia's sea claim,  thus implementing justice in international relations and an  effective Latin American fraternity."</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Bentsen calls for rouble stability fund Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, yesterday revived the idea of a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) fund to stabilise the Russian rouble, writes Peter Norman in Madrid. Speaking at the IMF-World Bank annual meeting, he made mobilisation of the fund dependent on Russia pegging the rouble on the foreign exchange market in the context of a strong economic reform programme. Observers speculated that his remarks were designed to inject some confidence into the rouble. The west offered Russia a rouble fund last year but Moscow has so far failed to meet the conditions for it to operate.</p>

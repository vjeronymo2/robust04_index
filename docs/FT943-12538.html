			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Switch to foreign banks reported Dissatisfaction with UK banks has led to many British companies switching to foreign banks during the past 18 months, a study says today. The analysis of 243,000 companies by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the broker, says foreign banks have increased their market share by about 10 per cent. Yet it finds that the rate of switching slowed in the first half of this year. Not only have foreign banks gained strongly, but they have attracted a slightly higher proportion of low-risk companies, measured by credit quality. The analysis of companies in business-information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet's corporate database is the first to measure the practical effect of complaints about standards of bank service from small companies during the past two years. However, the study points out that only about 2 per cent of companies change banks each year. Barclays lost most, with a net 1,591 companies leaving. Lloyds lost the biggest proportion - 2.8 per cent of its corporate customers. National Westminster Bank was a very small gainer of both high-risk and low-risk companies. Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland were net gainers of low-risk companies, with Royal Bank of Scotland also losing high-risk companies. Midland lost a net 232 customers in the first half of last year, falling to 69 in the second, and 48 in the first six months of this year. Barclays stood out in all three half-years as the largest net loser of customers. Trends in Bank Quality. BZW Securities, Ebbgate House, 2 Swan Lane, London EC4R 3TS. By subscription.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Siemens shares US train order Siemens, the German electrical engineering group, claimed yesterday that its share in a US order for 350 diesel-electric locomotives provided a firm base for further expansion in the American railways market, Christopher Parkes writes from Frankfurt. The DM1bn (Pounds 400m) order from Burlington Northern Railroad, one of the biggest rail freight carriers in the US, was the largest single investment in the history of US railways, Siemens said. The lead contractor will be General Motors' locomotive division, EMD, which will build the engines. The Stuttgart-based group will earn around DM170m, excluding income from licences granted to EMD, from the supply of three-phase alternating current motors. The first eight 4,500 horsepower locomotives will be delivered this year.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV'S VISIT SURPASSES BONN'S HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS  </P> <P> The visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Grobachev to West Germany surpassed  the West German government's fondest hopes for success.  </P> <P> Not only did the four days of high-level talks and lower-level glad-handing  strengthen the ties between Bonn and Moscow, analysts agreed Friday, but it  boosted West Germany's position within the Western Alliance as a major partner.  </P> <P> "Moscow &amp; Bonn -- Complete Success," crowed the newspaper Cologne Anzeiger.  And the Bonn newspaper General-Anzeiger added: "Bonn Draws Positive Balance."  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave a glowing report of the visit to the West German  Parliament on Friday. He said Gorbachev told him that the conventional arms  talks in Vienna could be successfully completed by mid-1990.  </P> <P> Gorbachev further said that such an agreement could be implemented a couple of  years after that.  </P> <P> Kohl told Parliament that Gorbachev "shared my opinion that the deadlines set  by President Bush -- first agreement in six to 12 months and its implementation  by 1992-93 -- are quite attainable if both sides work at it. We must keep this  goal in view."  </P> <P> But the main result of the visit, in West German eyes, was to place the nation  in a new role: that of a kind of go-between with Moscow and Washington.  </P> <P> As Claus Gennrich commented in the right-of-center newspaper Frankfurter  Allgemeine: "Gorbachev and Kohl managed to achieve what each of them urgently  needs: a foreign policy success."  </P> <P> West Germany, several commentators argued, is "moving up to the rank of partner  in leadership with Washington and Moscow," as one put it, adding, "although  this does not make it a hinge between West and East, it makes it the basis for  Western influence on Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> Even Kohl's political opponents, the Social Democrats, congratulated the  chancellor for his talks with Gorbachev. A veteran member of the opposition,  former Chancellor Willy Brandt, said that Gorbachev's trip was "a success for  the federal government, which we applaud."  </P> <P> In determining how much credit Kohl and the ruling coalition will accrue from  the Gorbachev visit, the first formal public reaction may come Sunday when the  West German electorate votes for members of the European Parliament -- and,  perhaps more important, for local offices in two states: Kohl's own  Rhineland-Palatinate, and the industrially depressed Saarland.  </P> <P> Kohl hopes recent foreign policy successes -- the favorable outcome of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Brussels last month, President  Bush's visit, and now the enormous outpouring of public support for Gorbachev  -- will reverse his falling popularity at the political box office.  </P> <P> But even if Kohl and his Christian Democratic-Free Democratic coalition do  badly Sunday, the new cordiality in Bonn-Moscow relations may give him time to  improve his standing with the voters before the general election in December  1990.  </P></p>

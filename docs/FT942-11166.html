			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Colgate shows interest in Kodak unit Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, hinted yesterday that it could emerge as a bidder for L &amp; F Products, one of the companies being sold by Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group. Earlier this week, Kodak announced it was selling its pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare businesses to concentrate on its core imaging business. L &amp; F makes Lysol disinfectant, Ogilvie hair treatment and other household products, while Colgate's wide range of brands includes Ajax cleaner and Palmolive shampoo. Mr Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman and chief executive, said at the company's annual meeting that senior officers would take a look at L &amp; F. 'We are always on the look-out for good, strategic acquisitions,' he said. 'We will, naturally, examine it.' Mr Mark also said Colgate would consider buying back more shares under its stock repurchase programme.</p>

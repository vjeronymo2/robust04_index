			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DON'T DRINK WATER' PROVIDES TOO FEW LAUGHS FOR THIS CAST  </P> <P> There are still people who think Woody Allen's earlier movies (and the plays  some of them were based on) are his funniest works.  </P> <P> They'll take "Sleeper" over "Annie Hall," "Play It Again, Sam" before  "Manhattan" and "Take the Money and Run" over "Hannah and Her Sisters."  Different styles for different smiles.  </P> <P> "Don't Drink the Water," currently revived at the San Clemente Community  Theater, argues for those who prefer the later stuff. The comedy, first  produced for the stage in 1966, shows how far Allen has come.  </P> <P> This loopy story of a New Jersey family forced to hide in an American Embassy  behind the Iron Curtain after being mistaken for spies does have a few nifty  lines and scenes. Even a couple of super ones. But it also has more than its  share of corn and contrivance.  </P> <P> Director Caren Ross and her cast do reasonably well when the jokes are on, but  don't always have the necessary timing to make the middling ones work and  certainly not enough to plump up the flat ones. The production provides laughs,  especially in the punchier, better-written first act, but it's a hit-and-miss  affair.  </P> <P> Most of the giggles come when Marge Anderson's Marion and Joe Abrams' Walter  are on stage. This "Don't Drink the Water" tends to work better when these two  go at it, arguing either with each other or with Axel Magee (John Brennan), the  incredibly ineffectual diplomat's son who tries to steer them through this  international mess.  </P> <P> Walter is among the first in a long line of Allen complainers. His job may be  catering weddings and bar mitzvahs, but his hobby is full-tilt kvetching.  Everything annoys him and everything is a target for his fast-talking sarcasm.  He's ready to take anybody on, whether it's the embassy's swishy chef or the  local Luger-toting KGB man.  </P> <P> But "Don't Drink the Water," despite the locale, is really a domestic comedy,  so it's Marion whom he takes on most of the time. She's a worthy adversary too,  especially through Anderson's spunky interpretation. Anderson and Abrams almost  make this show click.  </P> <P> Well, almost. In the end, it's a case of minor-league Woody Allen being handled  in a pretty routine way.  </P> <P> 'DON'T DRINK THE WATER'  </P> <P> A San Clemente Community Theater production of Woody Allen's comedy.

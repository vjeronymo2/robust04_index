			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Israelis rely on diaspora bond buyers for Dollars 1.5bn FETING AND flattering wealthy Jews from the Americas and Europe is a familiar routine for Israeli leaders. Last week there was a keener than usual note of exhortation from those addressing a visiting delegation of leading buyers of Israel Bonds - with good reason. Israel's politically sensitive request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in US loan guarantees to help it finance Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union may attract most of the headlines. But the government is also banking on a big increase in its overseas bonds operation to help it meet foreign funding needs of more than Dollars 20bn that immigration is expected to create over the next five years. This year alone, the Finance Ministry has set a target of Dollars 1.5bn to be raised by the sale of Israel Bonds - a 50 per cent increase on the Dollars 990m sold in 1991 and twice the value sold in 1990. A fall in immigration figures lately has raised some doubts over the projection of 1m newcomers by 1995. But for the moment the government's demand curve for overseas bond sales is set to go on rising well into the decade. The pressure to raise more money has forced the Development Corporation for Israel, the New York-based bonds organisation, to look for new sources of investment and tighten its own administrative belt. Israel has been selling government bonds chiefly to the North American Jewish community since 1951. To date, a total of some Dollars 12bn has been raised through a variety of instruments ranging from a few hundred dollars in value to promissory notes worth up to Dollars 1m. The organisation has 40 offices in the US, six in Canada and 22 elsewhere, mainly in South America and Europe. Traditionally the bonds have been sold to and through the diaspora Jewish communities - 1,300 synagogues in North America have served to spread the word - as a means of giving material support to Israel. However, Mr Meir Rosenne, a veteran Israeli diplomat who heads the bonds operation, says it is now time to change the image of the bonds 'from a charity to an investment'. He notes that Dollars 200m in mature bonds have never been redeemed by their holders, so accustomed have investors become to regarding the bonds as a 'gift' to Israel. Already about 30 per cent of Israel Bonds are sold to non-Jewish investors, including regular financial institutions, pension funds and municipalities. Mr Rosenne aims to increase this and has taken the unprecedented - and expensive - step of advertising in the media. He has also cut his staff from 700 to 540, paring administrative costs to about 4 per cent of sales. Interest rates, set by the Treasury in Jerusalem, have been kept up, with the zero coupon and variable rate issue bonds, at 7.20 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively, both well above the current US prime rate of 6.5 per cent. Jewish communities will remain the key target for sales. To sharpen the appeal, the Israeli government has pledged that all bonds money will be spent exclusively on immigration absorption, and not go into the general budget as before. Still, says Mr Rosenne, the 1992 target is 'very ambitious'. Israel's example of selling government bonds overseas has not gone unnoticed by other countries in need of foreign funds. Egypt, Poland, Hungary and the Ukraine are understood to have studied the operation with a view to launching something similar of their own.</p>

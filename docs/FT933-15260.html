			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Amstrad to close Spanish arm AMSTRAD, the UK-based consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, is closing its Spanish subsidiary and is expected to post a substantial full year pre-tax loss as a result. Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, Amstrad will be forced to take a Pounds 25m exceptional charge against its full year profits to cover the goodwill written-off to reserves at the time of the Spanish subsidiary's acquisition in September 1987. The charge is expected to swamp any operating profits but will have no effect on shareholders funds or cash flow. Amstrad's already depressed stock closed down  1/2 p at 32p after the announcement. Amstrad acquired its troubled Spanish distribution subsidiary, previously called Indescomp, from Mr Jose Luis Dominguez Morales who had built the business up riding the boom in personal computer sales in Spain over the previous three years. In its heyday the subsidiary, renamed Amstrad Espana, had personal computer sales of more than Pounds 100m and was one of Amstrad's largest operations outside the UK employing 250 people. However, 1987/88 was its peak year and the subsidiary has lost money ever since as personal computer prices tumbled in the face of growing competition. The closure of the Spanish operations were foreshadowed in February at the time of Amstrad's interim results when the group took nearly Pounds 12m of restructuring charges to cover stock write downs, the costs of Mr Sugar's failed buy-back bid, and the costs of re-organising the Spanish subsidiary. Amstrad Espana's operations had already been significantly scaled-back over the past 12 months with its workforce dropping from 40 to just 12. In the end Mr Tony Dean, group finance director, said Amstrad decided it would be cheaper to support its products in the Spanish market through an independent distributor and close the subsidiary. Yesterday Amstrad, which has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years as competition has intensified and the group has appeared to run out of 'blockbuster' products, said it has successfully concluded negotiations with an independent distributor.</p>

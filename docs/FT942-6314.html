			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: To the victor the jewel in the crown - If Enterprise's bid is successful it will take over Lasmo's Indonesian oil interests, centred on the gas liquification plant at Bontang As the contested takeover between Enterprise Oil and Lasmo develops, part of the battle is being fought in the rain forests and mangrove swamps of East Kalimantan. Here, on the shores of the island of Borneo, Lasmo is a leading force in Indonesia's fast-growing liquified natural gas industry, already the world's largest. Enterprise, by contrast, has only a minor presence in Indonesia, but sees good potential provided it can get in at the right price. Not that Kalimantan is an easy place to do business. In this remote equatorial region, rainfall is measured in metres and roads are scarce. Indonesia's state oil company, Pertamina, also runs a tight regime which effectively relegates all foreign oil companies to the status of contractors. Nonetheless, Lasmo - and Enterprise - see the operation here as something of a jewel in the company's crown. Lasmo's operations, which are centred on the giant gas liquification plant at Bontang, consist of a 38 per cent interest in the Indonesian joint venture, a part-nership of foreign oil companies and consumers which explores for and produces gas in the Sanga Sanga contract block. Lasmo is also half owner, with Union Texas Petroleum, of Vico, the company which operates the block. The properties came to Lasmo when it acquired Ultramar in 1991. Sanga Sanga currently supplies about half of the gas requirements of Bontang, which ships 15m tons of liquified natural gas a year under long-term contract to electric utilities in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Vico's reserves were estimated at the end of last year at 13.5 trillion cu ft of gas, equivalent to about 2bn barrels of oil, enough for another 10-15 years. However, the challenge facing Lasmo in Kalimantan is to hold its leading position in this key industry. Vico's reserves were the first to be discovered in the area, more than 20 years ago, and the effects of depletion are beginning to show. Although reserves continue to rise, the rate of increase has slowed, and some of the rise is coming from better reserve management rather than new discoveries. Although this is not affecting Vico's ability to meet its commitments to Bontang, its position is beginning to be overshadowed by the newer arrival, Total, which has made some very large discoveries offshore and is set to become Bontang's biggest supplier later this decade. At 15.2 trillion cu ft, Total's reserves are already larger than Vico's. Total's success is one of the main reasons why Pertamina is going ahead with plans to add a seventh 'train' or production line to Bontang by 1998, and is also talking about an eighth shortly after that. There is little doubt in Pertamina's mind that the market for the gas exists: it is merely a question of finding enough of it. According to Mr Subroto, the manufacturing manager at Bontang, Pertamina expects the Pacific market for LNG to double from its present 43m tonnes a year by the year 2010. Under the arrangements at Bontang, the gas producing companies get to supply the plant in proportion to the size of their reserves, which have to be independently certif-ied. In the first contract, Vico's share was 97 per cent. But in the most recent, the fourth, it had fallen to only 27 per cent. This share is likely to be even lower in the new contracts which Pertamina is currently negotiating with its utility customers. (These contracts are concurrent, which is why Vico still supplies over half Bontang's needs). The contract participation system 'provides a strong incentive for the producers to maintain the pace of exploration' if they want to keep supplying Bontang, says Mr John Lofthouse, Vico's president. Lasmo's hopes of holding its position in the long term are pinned mainly on Runtu, a 13,000 sq km block next to Sanga Sanga where it has a production sharing contract with Pertamina - in its own name rather than through a joint venture with other foreign partners. This huge block, which extends deep into Kalimantan's remote interior, is now being explored with seismic tests. According to Lasmo, it shares many of Sanga Sanga's features, and the company is hoping for positive results. 'There's tremendous potential,' says Mr Lofthouse. Enterprise has declined to comment specifically on what it would do with the Kalimantan properties if it won control of Lasmo. But Mr Graham Hearne, the chairman, has said that part of the rationale for the takeover would be to make Lasmo's assets 'work harder'. Given its own small position in Indonesia (it only has two production sharing contracts, one of which it is selling in order to focus on a more promising offshore gas prospect at Natuna in the north) Enterprise could, however, be expected to step up the pace of exploration in the region in the hope of increasing the 'upside' return through larger finds.</p>

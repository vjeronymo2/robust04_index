			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie dips below 3,100 after Wall Street slide - Market Report The UK equity market, like its European counterparts, could not ignore the impact of Monday night's 46-point retreat by Wall Street and once again dropped through the 3,100 level on the FT-SE 100 scale. Sentiment across Europe took another hard knock in the afternoon, when the US stock market started under renewed pressure which saw the Dow Average slide more than 20 points shortly after the opening. The Dow later rallied to show a fall of only some 10 points, before embarking on a fresh retreat an hour after London closed. There was no real respite for the FT-SE 100 Index which, in spite of numerous attempts to rally, finished a net 42.3 off at 3,078.7, only a whisker above the day's low of 3,078.6. Over the past two sessions the index has fallen 52.3 points, or 1.7 per cent. There was evidence of some good support for the second-liners, but this was quickly overwhelmed, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ending the session 24.2 lower at 3,545.3. There were, however, some encouraging features in London. The gilt-edged sector was never anything but a firm market and closed at the day's best levels, mirroring similarly strong performances by bonds and bunds across the globe. The market debut of TeleWest, the UK's first cable television flotation, was an unqualified success, with the shares, seen as tightly priced by telecoms specialists, opening at a 5 per cent premium and attracting sufficient international demand to close comfortably above the issue price. Turnover in Tele-West reached a short 59m shares, accounting for around 9 per cent of overall market turnover. This came out at 664.8m shares, compared with Monday's 487.4m. Non-Footsie stocks accounted for 65 per cent of the total. The Stock Exchange revealed that customer business transacted on Monday was worth Pounds 1.44bn. Dealers in London were surprised at the extent of Wall Street's fall on Monday evening, which was said to have occurred in the wake of a big shift by Morgan Stanley, the influential US investment bank, in the cash allocation of its US-only port-folio from 3 per cent to 15 per cent. A dealer at one of the big international banks said much of the weakness in Wall Street could be attributed to a series of options and futures expiries last Friday which carried over into Monday. There were also stories circulating in London of a substantial switch from UK equities to gilts, a move which was borne out by the performance of both markets but not by trading volumes. US markets were also said to have been weakened by rumours of imminent resignations in the Clinton administration after the recent polling disaster in the mid-term elections. London opened sharply lower, with the FT-SE 100 down almost 30 points, as marketmakers chopped their initial quotations to head off any large selling pressure. After a couple of half-hearted rallies, the market began to wilt and eventually settled just above the day's low. Traders said the market was delicately poised at the close, with the FT-SE 100 future at a discount to the cash market and resting at a major chart point. Senior marketmakers, although nursing losses over the past couple of sessions, remained stoic, pointing to the continued strength of bond markets in the face of the weakness in equities, and quick to emphasise that it was the weakness in bonds that drove markets lower in the early part of the year. Laird, the engineering group, gave ground after announcing a Pounds 68m rights issue, awakening market worries about cash calls. Vodafone continued the recent flow of excellent dividend news, hoisting the interim payment by a much higher than expected 19 per cent.</p>

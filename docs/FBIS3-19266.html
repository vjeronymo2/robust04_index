			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Weakened GATT"] </F>   [Text] It is a serious commercial weapon that President  Clinton exhumed by reestablishing on 3 March and for a two-year  duration the dispositions of the trade law called "Super 301"  with a view to reducing the gigantic Japanese trade surplus with  the United States. Applied for the first time between 1988 and  1990 to force Washington's trade partners to open their markets  to U.S. products, it proved its efficiency, particularly against  Japan which, at the time, was already in Washington's line of  sight. Recommended by congressional officials, its  re-establishment through a presidential decree will please a  U.S. public opinion that is sensitive to a measure which,  according to Mr Clinton, will "create jobs" on the other side of  the Atlantic.    The escalation tactics that Washington decided to adopt  toward Japan are nevertheless inopportune. They create an  impasse in the very unequal state of health of the two principal  economic powers of the world. The United States' strong growth  stimulates imports, while Japan, faced with a recession  unprecedented since the end of the war, is applying the brakes  on imports. Part of the U.S. deficit ought to be ascribed to the  present gap.    It is also inopportune for President Clinton to take it out  on a Japanese prime minister already seriously weakened  domestically, especially at a time when the Japanese Government  promises to open significantly the Japanese market to foreign  competition, against the opinion of part of the administration.    Japan is not alone in having to worry about U.S. actions.  This is true also of Mexico and Canada, now linked to Washington  by a free-trade agreement. It is equally true of the Europe of  the Twelve. Beyond the fact that the Americans would sell more  to Japan to the detriment of the European Union, it is the  edifice that was laboriously constructed thanks to the GATT  during the Uruguay Round negotiations that appears threatened.    The EU [European Union] countries--and France more than  others--have insisted on the major advance represented by the  creation of a World Trade Organization to replace the GATT.  Responsible for smoothing out future trade conflicts, this  organization is supposed to mark the end of "bilateralism," and  thus deprive the United States of the right to impose its law on  less powerful partners. A month and a half away from the  official signing of the final act of the Uruguay Round, the  reestablishment of "Super 301" proves that Washington intends to  preserve its full freedom of action.</p>

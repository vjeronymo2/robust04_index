			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Water treatment investment by Twelve to soar INVESTMENT in water treatment will double from its present level by the year 2000, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassis, the European environment commissioner, said yesterday. Germany expects to spend almost Ecu30bn (Dollars 35.4bn) on drinking water in the next 10 years, the UK Ecu20bn, France Ecu8bn, and Denmark Ecu330m, he added. The two-day gathering of European government officials and water companies marks the start of the Commission's first review of its 13-year-old drinking water directive, one of the most ambitious parts of its environmental regulation. The review has been prompted by complaints from water companies that the standards have been higher than needed on health grounds and have led to unnecessary expense. However, Mr Paleo-krassis told the delegates: 'I cannot accept that Europeans drink fetid, stale and brown water on the grounds that it is not dangerous.' This appears to contradict the argument by Mr Tim Yeo, UK environment minister, earlier this week that 'temperature, taste and odour' of water were 'not the Commission's business'. The UK Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large UK water companies, said yesterday that Mr Paleokrassis was 'using emotive words' and that it backed Mr Yeo's call for a more narrowly-focused directive. Mr Paleokrassis indicated, however, that he would 'think very carefully' about whether to incorporate the World Health Organisation's recent, tighter guidelines on lead into the directive. But he emphasised, however, that 'the Commission will take into account the financial impact'. UK companies have estimated that replacing all lead pipes could cost Pounds 8bn. The WHO also argued yesterday that a single limit for tolerable levels of pesticides was inappropriate, as different pesticides were toxic to different degrees.</p>

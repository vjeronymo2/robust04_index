			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Too Much at a Time"] </F>   [Text] The United States' complaint that China is behaving  like another Japan may sound exaggerated, but it shows how  sensitive the United States is in dealing with the two trading  nations in the Far East, for 70 percent of the U.S. export  deficit, which increased to $116 billion in 1993, was  accumulated in trade with Japan and China. The United States do  not regard the reason for failing in trade with these two  countries to be their own, possibly not quite competitive,  product range; but they consider it to be these countries'  alleged closing of their markets to U.S. products.    It is, therefore, hardly surprising that U.S. Trade envoy  Mickey Kantor calls the Japanese proposals to open the markets  in 11 key areas "a half-finished job." In Kantor's view, the  Japanese prime minister's proposals are not sufficient to  dissipate Bill Clinton's reservations. What is more: Tokyo's  concessions have not been enough to resume the suspended  negotiations. But Kantor is giving Tokyo another chance: "We  are not disappointed. The Japanese Government has called the  proposals a first step, we consider them improvable."    The current suspension of U.S.-Japanese talks shows that  neither threats of trade sanctions, nor top-level meetings, such  as the unsuccessful meeting between Clinton and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, can bridge the gap. The reason is the  different starting point of the two adversaries. The United  States wants to open Japanese markets forcefully -- not only for  its own benefit, but for the good of other nations as well.  Washington feels it has been kept waiting too long by Japan;  for instance when former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,  threatened by being voted down already, conceded the U.S.  President's framework agreements at the July 1993 Tokyo World  Economic Summit, which his successor Hosokawa did not want to  keep.    But when Tokyo finally takes a small step forward -- this is  how the Americans see it -- the slight progress is offset by  setbacks in other areas, or it is not put into practice at all.  This explains Clinton's unfriendly reaction to Hosokawa's  proposal, which the prime minister personally presented to the  President, who is vacationing in California at the time.  Clinton's cool reply: The Japanese market will be "carefully  examined."    But perhaps the two adversaries will benefit from a break  for  contemplation while the talks are suspended. Kantor's way of  negotiating is somewhat hectic anyhow. The U.S. trade envoy  always wants too much at once. He gives the impression of  constantly being pressed for time. For Kantor the talks with  his Japanese adversaries are a very important experience. What  is unfortunate for the United States is that the trade envoy's  learning process is harming domestic industry.</p>

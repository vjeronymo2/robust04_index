			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Record first half for OM OM Group, the Swedish company which runs derivatives exchanges in Stockholm and London, yesterday reported a surge in pre-tax profits in the first half to SKr158m (Dollars 21m) from SKr100m in the same period last year as turnover rose to record levels. OM has been riding the recent heavy growth in derivative trading through its OM Exchange in the Swedish capital and the OMLX exchange in London. Average daily turnover rose in the first half to 133,891 contracts - a record for a six-month period - from the daily average of 92,553 contracts for all 1993 and 83,437 for the first half of last year. Operating revenues rose to SKr289.5m from SKr190.6m and operating profit more than doubled to SKr128m from SKr61m. In May, OM decided to sell its financing businesses and pull out of a plan to participate in founding a new Swedish bank. The sale of OM Finans has yet to take place, but OM included costs of SKr8.4m in its first-half expenses incurred in the aborted bank project.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Thomson denies radar claims Thomson-CSF of France yesterday denied allegations that in the course of winning its recent contract to supply Austria with 22 radars worth Sch1.2bn (Pounds 68m) it had tried to bribe a member of the governing Social Democrat party. The Austrian defence ministry confirmed that the Vienna prosecutor's office had been asked to investigate allegations in yesterday's edition of the weekly 'News' that Thomson-CSF's local representative had offered a Sch22m bribe to a Social Democrat official who refused the offer and informed the party's head, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. The ministry said the award of the contract to the French electronics company, with Steyr as its local partner, was because its radars were 'clearly superior' to those of the rival consortium of Ericsson of Sweden and Schrack of Austria.</p>

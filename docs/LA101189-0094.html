			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FIRMS SAY VIRUS THREAT IS SERIOUS  </P> <P> Major computer companies say they are taking seriously the threat of a computer  virus attack later this week and are advising employees to take precautions to  protect their systems.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and International Business Machines  Corp. have both issued internal memos warning staff about the impending virus,  called Datacrime, which is expected to be activated Thursday or Friday.  </P> <P> A computer virus is a destructive program in a computer system that can damage  or destroy data. It is called a virus because it acts like a biological virus  -- it can travel from an "infected" disk or program and infect other computers.  </P> <P> Computer industry experts say Datacrime is an especially dangerous virus that  could infect older IBM personal computers and compatibles based on Intel  Corp.'s 8086 chip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Puts Organization at Risk  </P> <P> "It's very, very rare but very destructive," said Russell Brand, chief  technical adviser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,  Calif. Brand said his group has examined Datacrime in an infected computer.  </P> <P> Since networked computer systems are so widely used by major corporations,  universities and the government, a virus could disrupt thousands of machines. A  virus also puts an organization at risk if its computer is penetrated by  outsiders or exposed to programs of unknown origin.  </P> <P> Brand said Datacrime is unique because it can wipe out a complete hard disk.  "Most viruses, you can put the data back together," he said.  </P> <P> Without a hard disk drive, there is no way of getting to information on the  disk, except to re-format that sector -- thus destroying all the files.  </P> <P> At AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, employees were warned not to use software from  unknown sources and to back up data.  </P> <P> IBM, which introduced an anti-viral software product last week, said it is  advising its employees to begin using its new software, and make copies of  their data.  </P> <P> IBM's product scans IBM compatible computer programs, looking for a change in  programming patterns that may signify a computer virus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source Is Unknown  </P> <P> Datacrime, also dubbed the Columbus Day virus because of this week's Columbus  Day holiday, has already infected a number of corporate systems and government  installations.  </P> <P> Experts do not know the source of Datacrime, except that it was first discussed  publicly at a conference for computer hackers in Europe this summer.  </P> <P> Brand and other experts said there are other viruses rumored among computer  hackers -- one estimate is that about 77 viruses are in circulation.  </P> <P> One of the oldest viruses is called Jerusalem and has about 12 strains, or  variations. Jerusalem, which was discovered by a professor at Hebrew  University, may also awaken later this week.  </P> <P> Computer viruses became international news last November when Robert Morris, a  Cornell University graduate student, wrote and unleashed a program that  eventually got into one of the largest computer networks in the United States.  </P> <P> "People are worried about (viruses), especially those that rely on their PCs,"  said Michael Riemer, executive vice president of Foundationware Inc., a  consulting firm in Cleveland. "But what viruses have done is forced people to  look at security and system management in place."  </P> <P> Increased concern about viruses has led to more anti-viral software programs on  the market, some available at no cost through software-sharing programs.  </P></p>

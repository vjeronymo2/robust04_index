			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COACH HURT AS ANGRY FANS STORM ONTO COURT  </P> <P> A West Chester University basketball coach remained hospitalized today with  injuries he sustained when fans stormed the court in the final seconds of a  game with Cheyney University.  </P> <P> Violence erupted at Cheyney's Cope Hall at 10 p.m. Monday in the final seconds  of the game, with Cheyney leading 67-66.  </P> <P> A West Chester player intentionally fouled a Cheyney player, and the Cheyney  fans went wild.  </P> <P> State police in Avondale said many Cheyney fans charged onto the floor and  started punching and kicking West Chester players and coaches.  </P> <P> Five people were taken to the hospital, but four were released after treatment.  </P> <P> Bernie Driscoll, 34, West Chester assistant coach, remained in Riddle Memorial  Hospital in stable condition with a concussion and possibly other injuries.  </P> <P> One player needed nine stitches above his eye. Another had a possible spinal  injury. West Chester trainer Tom Gannon, 19, of Brook Haven sustained a  possible cheekbone fracture.  </P> <P> The game was suspended and state police were called in to clear the gym. There  were no arrests and the investigation was continuing.  </P> <P> Dick Delaney, West Chester head coach, has called for Cheyney to forfeit the  game.  </P> <P> Cheyney and West Chester officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Tod Eberle, commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference, said  Cheyney's remaining league home game scheduled for Wednesday with Millersville  probably would be moved to a neutral location.  </P> <P> A non-league game with Lincoln University is scheduled for Cheyney's home court  on Monday, but Eberle said that game would not be moved.  </P> <P> Eberle said NCAA rules address fighting among players but not among fans.  </P> <P> "I don't think any players got ejected," Eberle said. "I think all hell broke  loose and a lot of fans got involved. That wouldn't come under the NCAA rules."  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Markets: Mastering the rat race - Economics Notebook One of the main aims of the Social Justice Commission, whose final report is out today, was to explain why certain groups in the UK are not working, and suggest ways to help them to get jobs. But another puzzle has tended to receive less attention: why are others, especially in non-manual jobs, working harder? Some would say that non-work and hard work have a single explanation: the structure of the tax and benefit system. Just as high marginal tax rates discourage the 'poverty trapped' from taking work, lower rates for those already working a full 35-hour week might have encouraged many employed people to work harder. Yet international evidence suggests that neither different tax rates, nor different levels of earnings, can fully explain why some people work longer hours. Longer hours may well be a response to distorted incentives, something policy-makers cannot easily change. In a seminar last week at the London School of Economics, Professor Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, provided an interesting test-case for any explanation of differing work habits. He noted that a sizeable gap has emerged between hours worked in the US and Germany. In 1970, US employees worked, on average, somewhat fewer hours over the course of a year than their German counterparts. By 1993, however, Americans were working some 200 hours more than Germans, a difference of 13 per cent. At first sight, a tax-based explanation of the difference in work effort seems highly plausible. On average, German workers face about a third higher average and marginal tax rates than their counterparts in the US. Germans can also rely on more 'social income' (such as welfare payments), which might lead them to choose more leisure. In the US, income taxes for medium and high earners fell in the 1980s. Differing real wage trends since 1970 provide another explanation for longer US hours. German real wages have continued to rise since the 1970s, in contrast to the US where they have been stagnant or falling. Standard economic theory would predict that Germans would choose more leisure as their real incomes rose, while Americans might be expected to work harder to hold on to the same standard of living. There are difficulties, however, with both the tax-benefit and the real wage interpretation of the US-German 'work-gap'. For one thing, workers in Germany also work fewer hours than those in neighbouring countries, where taxes and benefits are just as high. Second, although some of the rise in hours worked among low-paid US workers is probably a response to falling wages, work effort has risen most among professional, educated workers, whose relative earnings have actually risen over the period. So why do Americans work so much more? Drawing on data from a wide range of countries, Prof Freeman has concluded that is it not the level of individual pre- or post-tax wages per se, but the overall distribution of earnings that explains cross-country differences in work-effort. In the US, high and rising earnings inequality means that 'the rewards to greater effort are large and the penalties to slack are substantial'. The opposite is true in Germany, where the social safety net is higher and the overall distribution of pay has remained fairly equal. Clearly, for many in the US, a great deal may hinge on whether they can persuade their bosses that they are hard workers. But the people who put in the longest hours are not necessarily the most productive. In many jobs, one might expect the reverse to hold. Someone who spends 12 hours on a task which takes others only 10 may get points for effort, but few for productivity. At other times, the quantity of work done is a better indication of its quality, but the correlation is rarely one-to-one. Employers would usually do better assessing the individual's output more directly. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. In many labour-intensive professions, a willingness to 'put in the hours' may be the only way for employers to gauge, however imperfectly, whether someone is up to the job. There is danger here, first spotted by George Akerlof, the economist, in the mid-1970s. Employees who would prefer to work fewer hours are aware that their boss may take this to denote poor quality. They may, therefore, try to hide their true preferences, agreeing to work longer hours in return for a given wage than they would otherwise choose. Knowing the incentive to deceive, employers may, in turn, demand unnecessarily long hours to flush out those who are only pretending to like working late. The upshot is a 'rat race equilibrium' in which everyone ends up working more than either they, or the jobs themselves, would otherwise demand. Some occupations will suffer from this problem more than others. Recent research in large US law firms, for example, has found significant evidence of over-work consistent with the Akerlof model.* It is plausible that the recent rise in hours worked, much of it unpaid, among managerial workers in the UK partly reflects a similar problem. Changing the tax system could allow more people to join the rat race: it might not make it any less exhausting. *Rat Race Redux: Adverse Selection in the Determination of Work Hours, R Landers, J Rebitzer &amp; L Taylor, MIT mimeo, October 1994.</p>

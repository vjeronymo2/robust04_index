However, several deputies believe the presence of U.S. troops  could be justified if they are used to combat drug traffickers  or to perform tasks that benefit the population.    Recently, President Carlos Roberto Reina said he favored the  withdrawal of those soldiers. His opinion is shared by other  sectors of Honduran society. However, on more than one  occasion, U.S. embassy officials have asserted that the presence  or withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed here depends on the  Honduran Government's decision.    Liberal Deputy Valentin Suarez said: "The clashes between  Honduras and El Salvador have ended, and the Nicaraguan and  Salvadoran guerrillas no longer exist. Thus, the gringo troops  should be out of Honduras." Suarez added that Hondurans,  especially the people in the central departments, need Palmerola  Military Base to turn it into an international airport. "In our  country's situation, we cannot continue to invest in more  airports," the deputy emphasized.    National Party Deputy Jose Rubio said the withdrawal of U.S.  troops "is a decision the government must make and the Comayagua  people should be asked if they want the troops to stay in  Palmerola or not."    Liberal Deputy Donaldo Dominguez asserted that "the Cold War  era has ended, but we now have to fight other things such as  drug trafficking. In this respect we could use the help of  foreign troops. However, we believe that in exchange for this,  the Honduran Government should receive more from the U.S.  Government."    National Party Deputy Salomon Padilla said that "we have to  see the positive and negative aspects of the troops' presence.  The presence of soldiers in our country is no longer necessary  because the period of violence is over." However, he considers  that the presence of the U.S. soldiers could be justified if  they stay to improve roads, build schools, and implement other  community programs.</p>

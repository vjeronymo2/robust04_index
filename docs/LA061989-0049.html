			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MATUSZAK'S CAUSE OF DEATH NOT YET KNOWN  </P> <P> An autopsy Sunday of former Oakland Raider John Matuszak, who died unexpectedly  at 38, failed to determine the cause of death, said Lilie Shelton, L.A. County  Coroner's supervising investigator.  </P> <P> Further toxicological and microscopic tests will be taken within the next four  days, she said. Those tests, which are routine according to the coroner's  office, include drug and toxin tests, as well as examination of tissues from  various parts of the body.  </P> <P> Because of Matuszak's prominence, the tests will be conducted as quickly as  possible, Shelton said.  </P> <P> An investigator close to the situation said it was doubtful drugs were  involved. A preliminary police investigation found no signs of foul play, said  Sgt. Tom Toutant.  </P> <P> Matuszak's publicist, Kathy Pinckert, said the family asked officials not to  release information until tests were completed.  </P> <P> "Sometimes there can be multiple causes for death," she said. "Speculation is  futile . . . and unfair."  </P> <P> Matuszak, who played on two Super Bowl championship teams before turning to an  acting career, was taken from his Hollywood home overlooking Universal Studios  to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank Saturday night after suffering massive  heart failure. He died at 9:39 p.m.  </P> <P> Matuszak had laid on his bed and fell asleep early Saturday night, his live-in  girlfriend, Rachel Toni, told Dale Trevillion, director and producer of  Matuszak's latest film, "One Man Force." Matuszak was snoring when Toni went  into the kitchen, she told Trevillion. When she returned, Trevillion said,  Matuszak was not making any sounds. She called paramedics.  </P> <P> Matuszak's co-star, actress Sharon Farrell, said "One Man Force" was the break  Matuszak needed to launch his career, but he was upset over the lack of  promotion in the United States.  </P> <P> Farrell, who talked to Matuszak a few hours before he died Saturday, said he  was "distraught and bitter."  </P> <P> Matuszak returned from a promotion trip in West Germany Thursday, and told  Farrell that it went well, but he was anxious about the U.S. distribution. The  film made its debut June 2 at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Trevillion, Farrell's husband who produced, directed and wrote "One Man Force,"  said Matuszak wanted to be a star.  </P> <P> "It was hurting him that he hadn't made it to the top," Trevillion said.  </P> <P> Trevillion said in a television interview, "He looked at supporting roles like  being on the bench in football."  </P> <P> About the news of the death, Trevillion told The Times: "It was a shock. We  were just watching his film on the VCR when we got the call that he died. The  guy is so big and indestructible . . . he's too full of life to be dead."  </P> <P> Trevillion said Matuszak told him that he entered a drug and alcohol  rehabilitation clinic for 1 1/2 weeks last year after the movie was made, but  was not experiencing problems recently.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-8 Matuszak, who played with the Raiders from 1976 to 1981, had a  reputation as a ruffian and a hard-drinking, fast-living man. The defensive end  was an imposing figure on the field with his black-bearded scowl as he chased  opposing quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Matuszak retired after spending the 1982 season, the Raiders' first in Los  Angeles, on injured reserve. But he remained an embodiment of the team's outlaw  image.  </P> <P> "Our hearts go out to the Matuszak family," said Al Davis, owner of the  Raiders. "It's tragic that their family should have to face this on Father's  Day."  </P> <P> Davis, in an interview with NBC Sports, said: "He represents the greatness of  the Raiders, and we share in the tragedy. We tried to stay close to him and  we'll never forget him."  </P> <P> Matuszak, a native of Milwaukee, started his college career at Missouri but  transferred to the University of Tampa in Florida.  </P> <P> The Houston Oilers made Matuszak the No. 1 pick in the 1973 National Football  League draft. He was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in 1974, then joined the  Raiders as a free agent before the second game of the 1976 season.  </P> <P> "We had problems with our defensive line because several had gotten hurt and we  had gone to a three-man line. . . . He just played a great part of our growth,"  Davis told NBC.  </P> <P> "It was a very emotional moment when he retired because the team meant so much  to him," former Raider coach Tom Flores, now general manager of the Seattle  Seahawks, told Associated Press. "He identified with the Raiders more than  anybody. He immediately became one of the guys. He was off-the-wall by nature,  emotional and volatile. But a lot of that was just for effect."  </P> <P> After Matuszak's retirement from pro football, he worked as an actor, starring  in a short-lived 1985 prime time television series, "Hollywood Beat."  </P> <P> He also appeared in such movies as "North Dallas Forty," "Caveman" and "Ice  Pirates," and made frequent appearances on numerous television series.  </P> <P> He also wrote his biography, "Cruisin' With The Tooz."  </P> <P> Matuszak, known for his wild partying and off-the-field antics well chronicled  in the book, had legal problems throughout the years.  </P> <P> He was arrested for drunken driving and possession of a concealed weapon in  Hayward, Calif. in 1981 and in 1984 in Milwaukee for similar charges.  </P> <P> On June 5, 1986, an Alameda County Superior Court jury ruled in favor of  Matuszak in a $1.5-million lawsuit in which he was accused of beating up a male  stripper in a barroom brawl.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleged that Matuszak crashed a ladies' night show at a Castro  Valley, Calif., night club and threw male stripper Daniel Fisher over some  tables and beat up the master of ceremonies.  </P> <P> The two alleged victims had sought $1.5 million in damages, but Matuszak's  lawyer argued he was being made a scapegoat because of his fame and financial  success.  </P> <P> But those associated with Matuszak recently remember him for his kindness.  </P> <P> "What a nice guy," said Carmen Miceli, owner of Miceli's Italian restaurant in  Hollywood, a place Matuszak patronized. "Everybody loved him. He was a generous  guy, a big spender. He'd pick up other people's tabs, and sometimes buy the  whole house a round."  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements are pending until the coroner's deputies complete the  tests, Pinckert said.  </P> <P> Pinckert said a private family viewing and a church service will be held in Oak  Creek, Wis.  </P> <P> A memorial service also is expected to be held later.  </P> <P> Matuszak is survived by his parents, Marvin and Audrey Matuszak of Oak Creek,  Wis.; and three sisters -- Karen Bohlman of Orlando, Fla., Christine Evancy of  Franklin, Wis., and Dawn Baley of West Allis, Wis.  </P> <P> Two brothers both died as infants of cystic fibrosis -- Christopher at two  months and David at two years. Baley also is afflicted with the disease.  </P> <P> Matuszak said in his book that for years after those deaths, it pained him to  be around children, but he eventually conquered the pain and fear.  </P> <P> Bohlman said from the home of her parents that relatives were stunned by the  death, which she said came with no warning whatsoever.  </P> <P> "I think he was very loved by his family and we will miss him very, very much,"  she said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers John Johnson and Larry Stewart contributed to this story.  </P></p>

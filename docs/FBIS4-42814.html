			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Burak Bekdil] </F>   [Text] Moldova -- President Suleyman Demirel said Thursday  [2 June] that the path that has been followed on the Cyprus  issue has been ineffective and a new one should be found.    Demirel gave information about his trip to Ukraine and  Moldova and he expressed his views on foreign policy issues in  his news conference in Kishinev.    Demirel rejected the claims that the Cyprus issue was in a  deadlock, saying there would be a reasonable solution. "What is  the deadlock in Cyprus? Is there a Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus (TRNC)? Has it a flag? It has. What will be done with  Ghali's report? Will this situation disappear? The flag and  soil are wanted from you. We gave neither. What is being  sought after? A federation with two societies. Will the  dispute be solved if you bring together two different nations in  the same crucible?" Demirel concluded.    He pointed out that the Western countries recognized the  Greek Cypriot administration as being the whole of Cyprus and  stressed that this was unjust and wrong. One hundred fifty  thousand people have been isolated on an island in the  Mediterranean, Demirel said. "This is against humanity. Several  countries act as if Turkey invaded the island. Turkey had the  responsibility to protect the peace and did it. If it had not  done so, would it be better? The United Nations work has had no  result. Both soil and flag are wanted. You cannot offer such a  solution to anybody. It is possible to find a reasonable  solution which will be accepted by the Turkish people and the  TRNC."    Demirel pointed out that Turkey was one of the very first  countries to recognize Ukraine and Moldova's independence.  "Now, we are looking for cooperation with them," he said.  Demirel disclosed that the situation of the Gagauz Turks and  Tartars had been discussed during his visit. The Crimean  Tartars and Gagauz have to be given more importance on Turkey's  agenda, he said.    Demirel characterized the treatment of the Tartars as a  shame  for humanity and said their resettlement on their land was of  concern to Turkey.    Ottomans and Tartars were together in all victories, Demirel  said. "Nobody should take this as an offense. This is our  humanitarian department. Nobody should be uneasy about our  cooperation with Moldova and Ukraine. Our relations with Russia  are good. Our bilateral relations will not create hostility  with a third country. Our goal is to make the Black Sea a sea  of peace."    Demirel also announced that Turkey would build residences in  Crimea for Tartars with the $100 million credit from the Europe  Reconstruction Fund.    He pointed out that Turkey was helping Bosnia-Herzegovina,  northern Iraq and Azerbaijan and Moldova and Ukraine should be  added to this list. "This is the concept. Turkey has to be  interested if it is to be an important state. Turkey has a  historical responsibility. These problems are all the heritage  of our past. We cannot say (who cares about the Ottomans).  These people speak fluent Turkish. They preserved their  traditions. Turkey has to show interest in Turks who are living  outside of Turkey," he concluded.    While responding to a question, Demirel disclosed that  Turkey  was implementing a policy of friendship. "This visit has caused  repercussions in the foreign press. Turkey is implementing an  independent and free foreign policy and it is Turkey's right,"  Demirel stressed.    He also said that there was instability in northern Iraq.  Stressing the importance of Iraq's territorial integrity,  Demirel said. "If Iraq disintegrates, the problem in the Middle  East will not end in 450 years."    In answering a journalist's question, he said that a 3,500  strong tribe that had been cooperating with the PKK (outlawed  Kurdish Workers' Party) had gone to northern Iraq. They went  after the security forces' successful operations against the  separatist organization, and the security forces did not open  fire on them. Demirel said: "They had a guilt complex. They are  obeying the PKK's orders. They have camps over there. They  (the PKK) are trying to create a civilian belt around them."  <H5>  Russia Is Not a Threat </H5>   Moreover, Demirel said that he would not accept that Russia  is a threat to Turkey.    Demirel received Stepan Topal, the leader of the Gagauz  Turks, his deputy Peter Buzaci and Parliament Speaker Mikail  Kendigelen on Friday. After the reception, Demirel  participated in the ceremony of the opening of the Turkish  Embassy's temporary building in Kishinev with his Moldovan  counterpart Mircea Snegur. The two leaders held a joint news  conference after they signed eight accords in various fields.    During a news conference a journalist asked Demirel if  Russia  was a subject of threat or cooperation. Demirel disclosed that  the talks with Moldova were aimed to serve peace and welfare in  the region. "The two countries are not preparing a plan or  threat to a third country. Escalation of cooperation between  countries is an advantage to everybody. Russia is our neighbor.  I have signed the agreement of friendship and cooperation with  Yeltsin. There is no relation between the accords that we  signed today and Russia and threat," Demirel noted.    Snegur said he agreed with Demirel on this subject and noted  that the talks would escalate the cooperation between the two  countries.    Demirel also disclosed that Turkey would provide $35 million  worth of credit to Moldova to develop the southern part of the  country, which is mainly inhabited by Gagauz Turks. Turkey and  Moldova signed accords of friendship and cooperation, land  transportation, civil aviation, agriculture, culture, to  struggle against international drug trafficking, terrorism and  to struggle against organized crime.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Air freight takes fright at the gravity of recession: The cost of air cargo has plummeted over recent months in the face of falling demand and overcapacity About one-third of all international trade, by value, travels by air  - a fast-growing business that is worth about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) in annual revenues to air freight carriers. But in the past few months freight rates across the Atlantic have halved, threatening to blow off course the recovery plans of some of the world's biggest airlines, which dominate the air freight industry. From a typical price at the beginning of the year of 75p-80p a kilogram on the London to New York route, prices have fallen  - in the case of one airline to just 8p a kilo  - as rivals scramble for business. Airlines calculate that the cost of fuel alone required to take a kilo of cargo across the Atlantic is almost 7p. Cargo is big business for airlines. At Lufthansa, the German carrier which is the world's biggest airline freight operator, cargo accounts for 21 per cent of sales. Last year, DM2.9bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in revenues were generated by the division, which employs just 8 per cent of Lufthansa's workforce. This year, however, Lufthansa and its competitors are operating in a very different market. The convergence of recession and higher capacity in the industry has prompted a sharp fall in freight rates. 'The key air freight markets, US and Japan, are suffering from considerable economic difficulties,' says Mr Wilhelm Althen, Lufthansa's executive vice-president of cargo. 'With capacity supply higher than demand, the situation for cargo carriers is characterised by pressure on prices and profits.' A blunter assessment comes from Mr John Smith, general manager of cargo marketing at British Airways, the world's fourth-largest airline freight operator. 'They (the airlines) are all losing their shirts. The normal rate from Japan is 700 to 800 yen a kilo. We know of one airline asking 300 yen.' He acknowledges that BA itself is 'taking a fair amount of pain. We are a little down on where we would like to have been at this time.' BA has reduced its quoted price on the New York route from nearly 80p a kilo six months ago to about 60p now. The discounted rates actually paid by customers have fallen faster. The decline has happened suddenly because air freight was temporarily insulated from the effects of recession. As businesses cut their stocks they increasingly turned to aircraft to deliver goods at short notice. Lufthansa increased its cargo revenues by 14 per cent between 1990 and 1991. However, the persistent international economic slowdown is now taking its toll. The trade in car parts, for example  - one of the most important categories of air-freighted goods  - has followed the sharp decline in world car sales. Freight routes between Japan and Europe have been particularly affected as Japanese vehicle exports have fallen. The downturn in air freight threatens to dislodge a central plank of airline strategy since the Gulf war. 'During the war, the awareness of cargo grew dramatically,' says Mr Peter White, managing director of cargo at British Airways. 'The passengers disappeared but the cargo held up. And empty planes meant more room for the cargo.' The airlines' response to the fickle passenger was to push the cargo business higher up the management agenda and increase the profile of freight. BA's cargo division did not report to the company's main board until this year. Lufthansa, too, has only recently separated its cargo and passenger businesses. Airlines have also invested heavily in an effort to provide a better service to customers. American Airlines, for which cargo has historically been a low priority, is in the middle of a Dollars 50m cargo investment programme to automate accounts and provide a quicker and more efficient service. The airlines' ambitions extend beyond a simple desire to smooth out uneven passenger revenues. Air freight volumes have grown faster than passenger numbers for more than 20 years, and this trend will continue, says Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft maker. It predicts annual average growth in air cargo traffic of 6.5 per cent over the next 15 years, compared with barely 5 per cent growth for passengers. An important reason for the expansion of the industry has been the development of wide-bodied aircraft, and in particular the Boeing 747. The amount of space left over in its cargo bay after passengers' baggage is loaded allows airlines to act as freight carriers without buying specialist aircraft. According to Mr Althen at Lufthansa this has created 'a category of carriers which regard cargo as fill-up, and which has therefore put pressure on prices'. It was one such 'fill-up' carrier, American Airlines, that last month briefly offered a North Atlantic rate of 8p a kilo. Falling freight rates are not completely new. Over most of the past 20 years, rates have declined gradually along with air fares as capacity has risen. One result is that the range of goods carried by air has grown wider. The fortnightly BA Boeing 767 from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to London's Heathrow airport, carries bundles of clothing and crates of dates, for instance. It also has five or six copper urns of holy water, en route to Leicester's Moslem community for use in religious ceremonies. The holy water business is worth Pounds 15,000 a year to BA. In the Americas, the latest hybrid grain seeds are shuttled between northern and southern hemisphere farms to improve yields. But the most important rise in air cargo has come from four groups of goods: car and motorcycle parts, pharmaceuticals, textiles and electronics. These are largely high-value, relatively small goods. In the case of textiles, air freight might mean getting the latest fashions from Asia into shops six weeks faster than by ship. The problem for the airlines, however, is that capacity has risen faster than increased demand. American Airlines, for example, increased the amount of cargo it carried by 38 per cent in the past year, while revenues rose by only 25 per cent. Airline executives are nervous about recovery in air freight. 'I'm not sure that Boeing's growth forecasts can be supported fully now,' says Mr Steve Leonard, vice-president of cargo sales at American Airlines 'There is a restructuring going on already.' Restructuring extends to many carriers. Air Canada is selling its freighter fleet. Lufthansa is seeking to establish and extend joint ventures. In June, it increased its share in the internationally-owned specialist freight operator DHL from 5 per cent to 25 per cent in an effort to secure market share. JAL, the Japanese carrier, increased its stake by the same amount. Lufthansa has also established links with Air France, Cathay Pacific and JAL to develop a global communications network for the air cargo market. The system will allow computerised international cargo bookings. 'Going it alone was too expensive,' says JAL. Such moves by Lufthansa and its rivals are evidence of their commitment to air freight, but also of the squall in which the industry now finds itself. The airlines hope that it will prove a temporary bout of turbulence and that prices will soon be stabilised. But that will depend on how quickly its freight customers recover from recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AIR FREIGHT: CHEAPER TRAVEL FOR CARGO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Current quoted rates per kilo over 1,000 kilos London to New York  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- American Airlines                     35 pence Continental                           50 pence United Airlines                       50 pence British Airways                       57 pence Lufthansa                             70 pence Virgin                                73 pence Northwest                             76 pence KLM                                   76 pence USAir                                 82 pence  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Air Cargo News International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

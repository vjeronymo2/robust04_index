			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "JB Report" column by Teodomiro Braga] </F>   [Text] The Workers Party [PT] is the target of the  bombastic charge made in Rome on 8 March by Rio de Janeiro Judge  Carlos Amorim.    Amorim charged that a Brazilian party has received money  from  the Italian mafia, but he declined to reveal the name of the  party involved. PT members themselves, however, believe that  Amorim was referring to the PT.    Luiz Salomao, leader of the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]  bloc  in the Chamber of Deputies, added more fuel to the fire by  proposing the creation of an ad hoc committee to probe into the  charge made by the judge, who will be called to testify.    PT leaders have described the charge as another fabrication  designed to undermine the presidential candidacy of Lula [PT  leader Luiz Inacio da Silva], and noted the connection existing  between Amorim and [PDT leader and Rio de Janeiro Governor  Leonel] Brizola.    The suspicion stems from the fact that it was Brizola who  during his first term in office appointed Amorim to the Rio de  Janeiro bench.    The charge caused excitement in the camps of other Lula  adversaries, who speculated about further charges of foreign aid  to the PT.    Associates of union leader Luiz Antonio Medeiros have stated  that Medeiros has evidence of the transfer of funds to the PT  from the Communist Party of the now defunct GDR.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NO RACIAL INTENT, PROMOTER SAYS  </P> <P> Fight promoter Don King denies he tried to stir up racial tensions by visiting  the hometown of heavyweight champion James (Buster) Douglas.  </P> <P> King appealed to City Council President Jerry Hammond on Monday night to pass  along a statement by King that he did not go to Columbus to create trouble.  </P> <P> "They (King and his entourage) were concerned they were being portrayed as  divisive in the community," Hammond said after the meeting.  </P> <P> King arrived in Columbus last week, saying he planned to attend the 50th  birthday celebration of Douglas' father, James. The visit fueled local  speculation about King's motives.  </P> <P> Last Saturday, Douglas called a news conference to deny that there was a rift  between him and his manager, John Johnson. King reportedly had said on a local  radio talk show that there was a rift between Douglas, who is black, and  Johnson, who is white.  </P></p>

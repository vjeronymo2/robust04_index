			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Observer: Creased up Who bought the 117m pairs of male socks, 73m male underpants and 12m male vests sold in the UK last year? (Vests? you mean those funny string things with holes in that your mother made you wear?) Out of 1,500 adults questioned by market researchers Mintel, about a third of the men said they never bought any of those items but left it to women. If only they left their outer garment purchases to women the world might be a better place.</p>

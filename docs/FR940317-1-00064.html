			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) AR 15&hyph;6 investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Reports of survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) IG investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Safety investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Government contractor investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Investigations by other governmental agencies such as National Transportation Safety Board; Food and Drug Administration; Center for Disease Control; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; and Consumer Product Safety Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) While such an investigation may not be adequate for claims and litigation purposes, it may contain evidence and leads of value to the investigator. If the report of the prior investigation contains diagrams, photographs, or witness statements, it is not necessary for the investigator to cover the same ground. Copies of such items may be made and included in the claims investigation. Generally, however, it will be necessary for the investigator to obtain more complete statements from witnesses. This is especially true for statements in medical quality assurance reports and reports of Army accidents prepared by Army safety personnel, as there are regulatory restrictions on the use of these statements in connection with claims and litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When military records fail to confirm the occurrence of a traffic accident upon which a claim is based, or substantial doubt arises regarding the nature or extent of the actual damages or injuries allegedly sustained, claims authorities should contact the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of the appropriate State or municipality to ascertain whether an accident report of the incident is a matter of record and, if so, a copy of such report should be obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statements of witnesses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Perhaps the most important phase of an investigation is the securing of statements from available witnesses, including the claimant and persons associated with him or her, for example, persons riding in the vehicle. The claims investigator may take the unsworn statements of a witness or may, if the statement is satisfactory for claims purposes, use a statement secured by another investigator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Photographs and diagrams.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Claims investigators should have cameras and obtain photographs and diagrams to describe the scene of incidents that they investigate. Photographs and drawings should indicate when taken or made and by whom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims requiring information of a specialized nature.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Depending on the nature of the incident, the investigator must decide on the specialized nature of evidence that will be required. In this regard, reference should be made to DA Pam 27&hyph;162 wherein specific items of information and documentation required for various categories of incidents are listed. Sufficient documentation of property losses or damages and personal injury or death should be obtained. Technical advice and assistance will be furnished by other DA agencies such as the Tank and Automotive Command or the Army Safety Center for vehicular accidents, or the Army Aviation Reserve Board and the Corpus Christi Army Depot for aircraft accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Completion of investigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon completion of the investigation, the investigator must carefully review the report to ascertain whether all pertinent information has been included and inconsistencies reconciled. The review should take into consideration the following questions: Is the report of investigation complete enough to enable the approving authority to decide how the incident occurred? On whom does the responsibility for the incident rest? What is the extent of any loss or damage suffered? In the ordinary case, if the investigator has included in the report all information pertaining to the ``what,'' ``who,'' ``where,'' ``when,'' and ``how'' of the occurrence, the information needed by those who must decide the claim will be satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Claims Receipt and Disposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Presentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Who may present.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A claim may be presented by the owner of the property, or in the owner's name by a duly authorized agent or legal representative. As used in this regulation an owner includes the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For real property. The mortgagor, or the mortgagee, if he or she can maintain a cause of action in the local courts involving a tort to that specific property. When notice of divided interests in real property is received, the claim should, if feasible, be treated as a single claim or a release from all interests must be obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For personal property. A bailee, leasee, mortgagee, and conditional vendor, or others having title for purposes of security only, are not proper claimants unless specifically authorized in the chapter in question. If more than one party has an interest in the property, all must join in the claim or a release from all interests must be obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured person or by a duly authorized agent or legal representative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administrator of the deceased's estate, or by any person determined to be legally or beneficially entitled. The amount allowed will, to the extent practicable, be apportioned among the beneficiaries in accordance with the law applicable to the incident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be presented by any person who by reason of family relationship has, in fact, incurred the expenses for which the claim is made. For claims cognizable under the provisions of the FTCA, see subpart D. (See &sect;536.86 for restrictions on damages allowable in claims involving death or personal injury under the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative will be made in the name of the claimant and signed by the agent or legal representative showing his or her title or capacity. Where a claim is presented by an agent or legal representative_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Written evidence of the authority of the agent or legal representative to act, such as a power of attorney, is required, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Islamic leader offers Algerian truce Contacts between Algeria's military leaders and the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front appear to have been stepped up following the offer of a truce by one of the two paramount FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani, in a letter to the head of state, General Liamine Zeroual. This is the first time an FIS leader has suggested a truce could help create a climate in which FIS conditions for peace talks could be discussed. General Zeroual has said he is keen on creating a dialogue among all Algerian parties which 'reject violence'. FIS conditions include the release of all members of the its ruling council held in Algeria and permission for those in exile to return, and the guarantee that they can meet freely in Algeria with the Islamic Salvation Army, the FIS armed wing. According to the Algerian daily newspapers Liberte and El Watan, General Mohamed Betchine - secretary general of the presidency, former head of military security and one of General Zeroual's most trusted advisers - visited Mr Madani in Blida prison a few days ago. There are also persistent rumours that Mr Jamel Ould Abbas, president of the foreign affairs commission of the National Transision Council, an body appointed by General Zeroual earlier this summer, has held meetings with FIS representatives in Lausanne, Switzerland. The spokesman for the FIS in exile, Mr Rabah Kebir, recently acknowledged that a number of their armed supporters in Algeria are moving over to the much more radical Islamic Armed Group (GIA), which has claimed responsibility for the killing of most of the 60 foreigners murdered in the past 12 months. He has warned that the violence in Algeria, which is claiming an estimated 300 lives every week, is bound, in the absence of a dialogue, to get worse.</p>

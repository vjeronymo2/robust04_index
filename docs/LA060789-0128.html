			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAILING;  </P> <P> DELANEY'S RESTAURANTS AGREES TO BE BOUGHT BY UNDISCLOSED CORPORATION  </P> <P> Delaney's Restaurants said Tuesday that it has agreed to be bought by an  undisclosed corporation.  </P> <P> The sale of Anaheim-based Delaney's, a seafood dinner-house chain, should be  completed within 60 days, said Mike Reagan, an accountant who represents the  chain.  </P> <P> Delaney's now operates nine restaurants, eight of them in Orange County and one  in Riverside County. Reagan said the buyer intends to expand the chain "at  least initially" in Southern California.  </P> <P> Reagan declined to identify the buyer and said a price has not yet been  reached.  </P> <P> Francis M. Delaney, the chain's owner, said in a written statement that the  acquiring company now operates more than 150 restaurants and hotels. "It has  substantial financial strength and has indicated an interest in expanding the  Delaney chain far beyond its current operations," Delaney said.  </P> <P> Delaney added that both buyer and seller are moving "to complete those steps  necessary to close the acquisition. . . . There are many things to be done  before the acquisition can be completed. But I am optimistic that . . . we will  have an early closing."  </P> <P> In Orange County, there are two Delaney's restaurants in both Anaheim and the  John Wayne Airport area, and one location each in Newport Beach, Dana Point,  Laguna Hills and Garden Grove.  </P></p>

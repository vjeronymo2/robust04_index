Calm has  gradually been returning in the last few hours in Lome following  the mopping-up operation carried out by the Togolese security  forces, the last gunshots of which were heard this morning.  However, Lome Inhabitants are still reluctant to go out. They  can be found in small groups in front of their houses listening  to transistor radios. [passage omitted]    Concerning the attack, armed elements from Ghana last night  around 2250 GMT shot at Togolese security forces on duty at the  main border crossing at Aflao. The charge d'affaires of Ghana  in Togo, contacted by the minister of foreign affairs, promised  to contact the Ghanaian authorities in order to end this  flagrant act of aggression against our country. With the  persistence of shooting, the Togolese Government, calling on the  international community to bear witness, called on Ghana to stop  such acts. Since then shooting has actually stopped at the  Aflao border point. [passage omitted]</p>

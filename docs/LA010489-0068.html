			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEFFERIES IMPLICATES GAF, EXECUTIVE IN STOCK CASE;  </P> <P> FORMER BROKERAGE CHIEF TELLS OF REQUEST TO BID UP UNION CARBIDE SHARES BEFORE  SALE OF BIG BLOCK  </P> <P> Boyd L. Jefferies, the former chairman of the Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp;  Co. brokerage firm, made his debut as a prosecution witness Tuesday,  implicating GAF Corp. and its vice chairman in what the government claims was a  criminal scheme to manipulate stock prices.  </P> <P> Jefferies, 58, who appeared tan and fit despite a cold, at times had trouble  remembering dates and couldn't positively identify a central piece of evidence  in the case, which is being tried in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But he  said he clearly recalled a telephone conversation with GAF Vice Chairman James  T. Sherwin in October, 1986, in which he said Sherwin asked him to have  Jefferies &amp; Co. arrange to bid up the the price of Union Carbide Corp.  stock shortly before GAF sold off a big block of Carbide shares.  </P> <P> "Mr. Sherwin called and asked me, if they wanted to have Union Carbide close at  a specific price for several days in a row, would I be willing to do that,"  Jefferies testified. "I said, 'Yes,' and Mr. Sherwin said, 'Of course, we'll  make up any loss to you' " incurred in the transaction, Jefferies said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Implicated in Stock 'Parking'  </P> <P> GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemicals and building products concern, and Sherwin were  named in a 10-count criminal indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New  York in July. They are charged with stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire  fraud and conspiracy.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors claim that, after an unsuccessful attempt to take over  Union Carbide earlier in 1986, GAF decided to sell off some of the  approximately 10 million Carbide shares that it had amassed and enlisted  Jefferies in a conspiracy to drive up the market price.  </P> <P> Jefferies, who built his company into one of the nation's leading traders of  large blocks of stock, has been cooperating with prosecutors since he was  implicated by former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky in illegal stock "parking"  and securities fraud. In stock parking, one individual or firm intentionally  conceals the ownership of stock that is held for the benefit of another.  </P> <P> Jefferies pleaded guilty to two felony counts in 1987 and is still awaiting  sentencing. He was required to resign as chairman of both Jefferies &amp; Co.  and its parent holding company, Jefferies Group Inc. He has since been living  at his home on the grounds of the Vintage Country Club in Indian Wells, Calif.  </P> <P> Jefferies' performance as a witness is considered crucial not only to this  trial but to others as well, since he has implicated several individuals in  allegedly illegal schemes. Among other trials in which he is expected to be the  star witness is a pending case against Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis, a well-known  Wall Street takeover specialist and speculator who is accused of manipulating  the price of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in 1986.  </P> <P> The GAF case is the first of many Boesky-related cases to actually come to  trial, so it is also being viewed as an important test of how well a jury can  comprehend the complex workings of the securities world, as well as its jargon.  </P> <P> Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl H. Loewenson Jr., Jefferies at  times appeared confused about the precise dates of several of his telephone  conversations with Sherwin in which he said the GAF official gave him specific  instructions about the price at which he would like Carbide's stock to close.  </P> <P> Jefferies also testified that at Sherwin's request he made up a bill to cover  the approximately $40,000 in trading losses that Jefferies &amp; Co. suffered  in buying and later reselling Carbide stock in late October and early November,  1986. He said he instructed his secretary to falsify the bill to GAF to make it  appear, as he said Sherwin requested, that the charges were for investment  banking services for a GAF subsidiary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confusion on Dates  </P> <P> But when he was shown copies of two invoices -- one bearing handwriting that  said "OK" and signed by Sherwin, and another that had the name of the GAF  subsidiary and was stamped by Jefferies &amp; Co.'s accounting department --  Jefferies said he couldn't say which one was actually sent to GAF.  </P> <P> The existence of two invoices was brought out at the trial by Arthur L. Liman,  GAF's lead defense lawyer. Liman afterward refused to comment. But the defense  evidently hopes that Jefferies' inability to identify the invoices will cast  doubt on his claim that he and Sherwin conspired to falsify records of  Jefferies &amp; Co.'s work for GAF.  </P> <P> Liman is also one of the lead attorneys for Michael Milken, the "junk bond"  wizard at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who is expected to be indicted soon. Junk  bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt securities.  </P> <P> Jefferies said he had done business with GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman and Sherwin  for several years before the alleged market manipulation scheme. He said he had  held more than 100 telephone conversations with Heyman and many with Sherwin,  whom he said he had first met in Los Angeles when Sherwin was attending one of  Drexel's annual junk bond conventions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recounts Personal History  </P> <P> Heyman isn't accused of any wrongdoing in the case.  </P> <P> Before testifying about GAF, Jefferies was asked to lay out for the jury his  own personal history, which included working as a ranch hand for several years  after graduating from UCLA. He said he later started at an entry-level job at a  small Los Angeles brokerage firm and left after six years to found his own  company, which initially had two employees.  </P> <P> By the early 1980s, Jefferies &amp; Co. had grown to six offices nationwide and  an office in London. With about 425 employees, it had become a leading firm to  which big investors went to trade blocks of stock off the floor of the major  exchanges.  </P> <P> Jefferies testified how on a normal day he would arrive at work between 1:30  and 2:30 a.m. and remain at his desk at the center of the firm's big trading  room until 6 p.m. He said he usually tried to get four hours of sleep a night.  </P> <P> His testimony is due to resume today. Prosecutors said they didn't know how  many days Jefferies would remain on the stand.  </P> <P> The jury, made up mainly of people with blue-collar jobs, has been subjected to  terms such as "brokers' cost of carry," "pretax equivalent yield" and stocks  going "ex-dividend."  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe repeatedly stopped the proceedings to  remind lawyers and witnesses that "we are not economists here." As his  testimony opened, Jefferies was asked to give what amounted to an elementary  course for laymen on how stockbrokers make their money and on how buying and  selling shares of stock is actually carried out.  </P></p>

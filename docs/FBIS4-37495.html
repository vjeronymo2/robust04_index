			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that Israel  is not prepared to accept Syria's proposal to first cede the  Golan Heights and uproot settlements there and only then to  enter negotiations. Minister Peres noted that Israel is  conducting talks with the Syrians on three levels: territory,  the nature of peace, and security arrangements. The foreign  minister stressed that had the Syrian president signed a peace  treaty with Israel together with President al-Sadat, he would  have received everything the Egyptian president did. Our  correspondent Meron Tzur reports that Mr. Peres was speaking in  a rally of Army veterans in Tel Aviv.</p>

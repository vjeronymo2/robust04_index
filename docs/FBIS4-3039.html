			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- About 55 percent of all  Taiwan manufacturers and exporters support the government's  suspension of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges after the March 31  Qiandao Lake incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed  while visiting Mainland China, according to survey results  released Monday [18 April].    As many as 55.6 percent of those surveyed said they  supported  the government's temporary suspension of cross-strait exchanges  in order to pressure Beijing to give satisfactory answers about  the deaths, widely believed to be the result of foul play.    However, 52.4 percent of the respondents said they opposed  an  across-the-board suspension of cross-strait exchanges.    Meanwhile, 57.6 percent predicted that the government will  further restrain cross-strait exchanges if Beijing fails to  satisfactorily explain the incident.    Among the 105 Taiwan manufacturers who have invested or are  preparing to invest in Mainland China, 40 percent agreed that  the current restraint of cross-strait ties will have a negative  impact on their mainland investments. Some 45.7 percent  disagreed.    Fifty-eight percent of the 105 investors said they will  uphold the government restrictions on cross-strait ties, while  20 percent said they will not hold to the restrictions.    Results of the April 11-15 survey were compiled from 252  responses.</p>

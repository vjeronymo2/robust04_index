			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY RISES 1.6% IN 3RD PERIOD; HOURS WORKED FALL  </P> <P> In a sign that worried companies are resorting to tough cost-cutting measures,  U.S. worker productivity rose 1.6% in the July-August period, the Labor  Department reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The productivity gain underscores the intense pressure faced by many companies  to stay profitable as business conditions have deteriorated this year. While  the advance was the sharpest in two years, it also reflected the nation's  overall economic weakness.  </P> <P> "We're seeing the effects of companies laying off workers and still managing to  achieve increases in (work) output," said Lynn Reaser, a vice president and  senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But I don't think  it's a sustainable trend."  </P> <P> The gain in productivity -- rising output per hour of work -- occurred at a  time when hours worked declined by 0.1%, the first decline in more than four  years. Manufacturing productivity continued to outpace that of overall  business, rising 5.6%.  </P> <P> Hourly compensation also rose 4.5% -- but actually dropped by 1.8% when  adjusted for inflation, according to the report, a statistic that suggests wage  pressures were not contributing to inflation in recent months. At the same  time, Reaser noted, the data suggest that many workers were not able to keep up  with the cost of living.  </P> <P> The strongest productivity gains were made by some of the most embattled  industries -- manufacturers of durable goods such as appliances, furniture and  other long-lasting products. Productivity jumped 7.3% for that sector.  </P> <P> "We produced more in America with fewer people," observed Joseph A. Wahed,  chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, adding that "massive  layoffs in construction and manufacturing" influenced the statistics.  </P> <P> Besides layoffs, employers also have pared their costs by imposing hiring  freezes and reductions in overtime.  </P> <P> Since January, U.S. manufacturing payrolls have fallen by 580,000 workers, the  Labor Department reports. The labor force that remains is "working fewer hours  but working harder," Wahed said.  </P> <P> Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.6% a year -- somewhat higher  than the performance of the 1970s, but far worse than the 2.5% annual gain  posted in the decades after World War II. Such gains pave the way for advances  in living standards without inflation.  </P> <P> As a result, productivity is a key to the nation's economic competitiveness and  is closely watched by business and government.  </P> <P> The recent advances in efficiency -- while helping corporate bottom lines for  now -- will be hard to continue in the future, because companies may run out of  obvious places to trim costs.  </P> <P> "At a certain point you run into diminishing returns," Reaser said. "I imagine  we are nearing that point."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Productivity  </P> <P> Non-farm business productivity, percent change from previous quarter at annual  rate, seasonally adjusted.  </P> <P> Third quarter, 1990: +1.6% (preliminary)  </P> <P> Source: Labor Department  </P></p>

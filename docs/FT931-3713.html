			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Search for glittering prizes beneath the Canadian ice: Digging for diamonds in the frozen Northwest Territories Anybody who works outdoors at this time of year in Canada's Northwest Territories must have a very good reason. Temperatures plummet as low as  400C, and feel even lower when fierce winds whip across the snow-covered Arctic tundra. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable to snap when weight is put on it. Trucks and machinery must be kept running around the clock to prevent their engines freezing. A group of drillers and geologists employed by BHP, the Australian steel and mining group, are braving these conditions on a frozen lake 310km north-east of Yellowknife. Shielded from the wind by tarpaulins, they are working 12-hour shifts, day and night, around two 15-metre high drilling rigs. The men have five days of emergency rations in case blizzards cut them off from their base camp 4km away. By the time the ice starts melting in late April, the drills will have extracted 400 tonnes or more of kimberlite rock from beneath the lake, and at least one other site nearby. BHP and its partners are confident that the samples will contain enough high-quality gems to move towards construction of North America's first diamond mine. Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP Minerals' exploration manager in North America, says he will be disappointed if a mine does not materialise. 'We're minimising our chances of failure,' he says. BHP, which would have a 51 per cent stake in the project, plans to spend at least CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.68m) on the drilling programme this year. Mr John Lydall, mining analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, said if a mine was built, it could supply about 7 per cent of the world's diamond market. The hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories has turned into one of the biggest stampedes in North American mining history. Besides BHP, a cluster of companies ranging from heavyweights such as De Beers and Kennecott, to junior exploration outfits such as Kalahari Resources, have staked claims covering 103,600sq km, an area about the size of Portugal. One timber supplier in Yellowknife said it has sold 210,000 wooden stakes in the past 12 months to mining companies, compared with 25,000 in a normal year. The staking frenzy is reflected in the share prices of some of the players: Dia Met Minerals, BHP's Canadian partner, now has a market value of almost CDollars 450m, with its share price zooming up from less than a dollar in late 1991 to CDollars 43 now. Two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais, are in the process of buying CDollars 13m worth of Dia Met stock. The story of diamond fever in the frozen north goes back to the early 1980s when Mr Dummett, who then worked for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush pilot that De Beers was prospecting along the Mackenzie River. Under cover of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian geologist and Dia Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers camp and picked up some samples. Over the next few years, the search moved eastward towards the source of the vast ice sheet which millions of years ago scraped up - and then deposited - metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada. The BHP-Dia Met joint venture, which was formed in 1990, made a breakthrough in late 1991 in the Lac de Gras area, 350km east of the Mackenzie River. Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the grade normally required to justify a mine. The purpose of this winter's drilling programme is to extract bigger samples from other kimberlite pipes on BHP's 875,000 acre claim. The frozen samples are transported by truck to a Dia Met processing laboratory in Colorado. The results will be made known later this year. BHP wants to have a sample of at least 2,000 carats before it decides whether to press ahead with construction of a mine. The partners are already confident that the quantity of diamonds in the Lac de Gras kimberlite pipes is sufficient to support a mine milling around 10,000 tonnes of ore a day. Their optimism is based largely on the results of research by Professor John Gurney, a geo-chemist at the University of Cape Town. Prof Gurney's theory, which appears to be supported by almost every diamond discovery around the world, is that a kimberlite pipe is virtually certain to contain diamonds if the purple-grey garnets in the pipe combine a high chrome content with less than 4 per cent calcium. According to the BHP team, the calcium content of the garnets found around Lac de Gras is 0.7 per cent or lower. What still remains to be established however, is the quality of the Lac de Gras diamonds. According to Mr Fipke, 'we can predict diamond grades. But no one can predict the per cent of gem quality.' Roughly one out of 200 kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, but only one in 20 of those has a high enough proportion of gemstones to justify a mine. The Northwest Territories diamond rush may yet come to naught. In spite of the excitement, mining analysts caution that the shares of the companies involved are for speculators only. But if all goes well at Lac de Gras, BHP and its partners could have a mine in operation by 1997 or 1998. They are unconcerned by the recent glut in the world diamond market. With many of the alluvial mines on the west coast of southern Africa as well as the big Argyle property in Australia likely to run out of stones within the next decade or so, the hope is that any new mines in the Northwest Territories will come on stream at just the right time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Lech Walesa Will Fight; </F> Advantages of the President"]    [Text] Recent opinion polls on the popularity of  politicians have been very unfavorable to Lech Walesa. Sixty  percent of the respondents to the opinion poll carried out by  the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] a month ago believed  that his decisions weakened the state; 17 percent were of the  opposite opinion. In another poll carried by CBOS two weeks  ago, 5 percent of the respondents pointed at Walesa as the best  candidate for president; Kwasniewski received 17 percent and  Pawlak 10 percent.    Lech Walesa will fight for the electorate. Even if he does  not run in the presidential elections, he would certainly like  to vacate the post with good ratings. If he manages to increase  his popularity quite noticeably, if he has solid reasons to  believe that he might win the election, he will run.    During his term in office, Walesa plucked up the courage to  make unpopular decisions; he probably knew in advance that they  would not increase the number of his supporters in the  traditional electorate--among dissatisfied people. He might  have expected that, instead of that, he would gain new  supporters among people advocating market reforms, among those  who "took matters into their own hands." It seems that Walesa  attempted to "change" his electorate and replace the "negative"  electorate with "positive" voters.    Now, toward the end of his presidency, it is clear that he  has not made it. He lost a lot among the former and did not  gain much among the latter. The same holds true of the  political sphere: As he lost his rightist electorate, no new  leftist supporters appeared. Today, there is no substantial  group that, because of its material situation, interests, or  views, would be mostly pro-Walesa.    Most probably, over a year before the election, Walesa  decided to fight for his former electorate--the dissatisfied  people. Discussing the budget law, he recently wondered: "The  question arises what is more important to the  reforms--`mathematical problems' or the understanding of the  people." This may mean that he will be less inclined to make  decisions this group might not like.    The dissatisfied are now favoring the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD], the Polish Peasant Party, the Union of Labor,  and Solidarity. Many of those people do not define their  political preferences and do not go to the polls.    Walesa won the sympathy of trade unions by vetoing the new  popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. It is not known,  however, to what extent it really reflects the moods of  employees.    Why is Walesa speaking about the return of communism, about  Stalin as Kwasniewski's idol? Among other reasons, because some  of the votes supporting the SLD were cast not by staunch  supporters of this group but by people who were dissatisfied  with the reforms that had been carried out before. Lech Walesa  would now like to win them over to his side.    The slogan "Down with communism" may still be an effective  political weapon. Part of society will forgive a consistent  spokesman of such a slogan many mistakes. However, will Walesa  manage to achieve that? The people Walesa might win over with  this slogan may remember his strengthening of the left pillar;  some of them even accuse him of collaborating with the Security  Service as an agent named "Bolek."    There is still a long way to the election, and Walesa may be  retrieving the points he has lost. He is the president and has  much greater possibilities than any other candidate will have.  On the other hand, this is also a fundamental obstacle. Other  candidates will be able to present their voters with a vision of  the future without any limitations. Walesa is being carefully  observed by the mass media, and he may always be accused of  making a populist decision. Such decisions may be more of an  obstacle than an advantage for him.</p>

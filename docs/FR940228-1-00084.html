			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> General Standards of Financial Responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;668.15, the Secretary would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list general standards of financial responsibility. The first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six standards are applicable to all institutions. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 498(c)(1) of the HEA specifies that an institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility must be determined based on whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is able to provide the services that the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims to provide, to provide administrative resources necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with Title IV, HEA program requirements, and to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the institution's financial obligations, including refunds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary. These standards were adopted from current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and the Secretary proposes to continue to use them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add to the list of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility requirements for all institutions the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that an institution be current on any debt service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments. An institution normally has variable costs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluctuate to meet the demand created by increasing or decreasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume in those costs such as those for educational supplies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses and instructor salaries associated with educating an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing or decreasing number of students. Debt service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents a fixed cost, such as mortgage or lease payments, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution that generally does not fluctuate with that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume. Thus, in a situation in which an institution is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiencing a decline in revenue due to a decrease in new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollments, debt service would remain unchanged. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's flexibility to deal financially with the decline is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced because management typically is unable to adjust the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of payment for debt service without the consent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creditor to whom the debt is owed. This situation places some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of control outside the institution and beyond the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management's ability to deal with a deteriorating situation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing costs. Furthermore, a failure to meet debt service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments might precipitate collective action on the part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creditors to place the institution in an involuntary liquidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation under Federal bankruptcy laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, a growing institution usually must take on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more debt to fund its operations. Should the growth fail to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue, the institution might be unable to service the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing debt service associated with its expansion. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes an institution's failure to remain current on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its debt service payments would be a strong indicator of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's inability to meet its financial obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA provides that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must establish requirements for an institution to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refunds. Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA also provides for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption to this requirement which is discussed below under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions to the general standards of financial responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require an institution to maintain, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all times, a minimum cash reserve of at least 10 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's total deferred tuition income at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's most recent fiscal year for repayment of refunds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cash reserve would have to be maintained in a cash reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account and would have to consist of cash or cash equivalents, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those terms are defined in accordance with generally acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unduly burdensome to require an institution to calculate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage of its cash reserve on a continual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Secretary would require an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine its total deferred income at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's fiscal year and calculate the percentage based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that total. Once that percentage is determined, the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to maintain that amount of cash reserve at all times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until a new calculation is performed at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's subsequent fiscal year. The calculation would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the institution's total deferred tuition income because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferred tuition income is an indicator of the value of services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the institution will provide for the coming year. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary requests comment on a comparable way to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate level for the cash reserve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten percent of this amount represents roughly the equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a month's worth of an institution's revenue. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers this amount a reasonable amount for an institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have available to pay refunds in the event of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precipitous closure. Generally, under this proposal, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would demonstrate its compliance with this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once a year with the submission of the institution's audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements. However, because an institution would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to maintain this cash reserve at all times, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary would reserve the right to evaluate an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the requirement at any time. Finally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to allow cash equivalents to be included in the cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserve is consistent with generally accepted accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYER WHO CRASHED IN OCEAN INDICTED ON 33 FEDERAL CHARGES  </P> <P> Thomas Root, the lawyer who ditched his plane in the Atlantic Ocean last  summer, was indicted Wednesday on 33 counts of fraud and other crimes involving  radio stations that he was representing before a federal agency.  </P> <P> The federal grand jury indictment accuses the 37-year-old Root of defrauding  the federal government and five clients in Federal Communications Commission  proceedings on permits to construct FM radio stations throughout the United  States.  </P> <P> If convicted of all charges against him, Root would face a maximum 200 years in  prison and an $8-million fine.  </P> <P> Root burst onto the public scene last July when his single-engine plane ran out  of gas and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas after a six-hour, 800-mile  flight that began near Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> Doubts about Root's story began to surface almost immediately. He told  authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the odyssey, but Navy  fighter pilots flying alongside the plane reported seeing him moving in the  cockpit.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens told a news conference that a mysterious gunshot  wound that Root suffered during the flight was part of an ongoing  investigation.  </P> <P> Stephens said Wednesday that Root had been aware of the inquiry, which began in  April, 1989. He said 31 of the 33 counts in the indictment involved activities  that took place before Root's July 13 plane flight.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Conder Group goes into receivership Conder Group, a Winchester-based construction group, yesterday went into administrative receivership, writes Vanessa Houlder. Mr Alan Barrett of Price Waterhouse, who was appointed joint administrative receiver, attributed the group's financial difficulties to severe losses a year ago in its Elemeta division. The group failed in efforts to raise additional working capital and had attempted to sell parts of the business to generate cash. Following the withdrawal of the last serious purchaser this week, the board decided it was unable to continue trading. The group employs over 830 people.</p>

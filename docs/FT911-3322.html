			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom chief attacks Brussels - William Dawkins finds Mr Pierre Suard (right) prepared to defy the European Commission over its conditions on his company's link-up with Italian vehicle group Fiat ALCATEL Alsthom, a partner in the first merger to attract a European Commission inquiry under its new powers to vet cross-border deals, yesterday accused the Brussels authorities of discriminating against European businesses. Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the French telecommunications, transport and energy company, said the strict conditions demanded by Brussels for his company's wide-ranging alliance with Fiat, the Italian automotive group, created 'a strong distorting element' in his markets. 'Today, it is harder for a European company to buy another one than it is for a non-European company to buy into Europe,' said Mr Suard. The Commission was in danger of turning the European single market into 'a shifting marsh, open to all currents, with the two economic citadels of the US and Japan standing on either side,' he said. The link-up between Alcatel Alsthom and Fiat, one of Europe's biggest cross-border deals to date, was announced in October. It was the first deal to attract a full Commission inquiry under its six-month-old merger control regulation. As such, it makes a discouraging test case for the way in which the Commission can be expected to use its new powers, said Mr Suard. The French company will do its best to satisfy the Commission's demands, but Mr Suard gave no guarantee that he would comply with all of them. This is among several delays experienced by the complex deal, Mr Suard revealed yesterday. Alcatel Alsthom and Fiat have agreed to postpone another part of the accord, under which the French partner would take control of Fiat's rail equipment division, because they cannot agree on price. Nevertheless, Mr Suard emphasised that he was satisfied with the general progress of the link-up. The main part of the complex deal, which came into effect a few weeks ago - delayed six months by the Commission inquiry, says Mr Suard - gives Alcatel, the French group's telecommunications unit, control of Telettra, Fiat's telecommunications business. Fiat, meanwhile, is waiting to take control of Alcatel Alsthom's car batteries business, once the Commission has pronounced on the impact on the French market. Finally, the pair have agreed to exchange share stakes, with Fiat taking 6 per cent of Alcatel Alsthom and the French partner taking 3 per cent of Fiat. sion about the telecommunications part of the accord was that Alcatel and Telettra's Spanish subsidiaries together hold 80 per cent of the Spanish market for transmission equipment. Alcatel is the European Community's largest supplier of telecommunications equipment, with 29 per cent of the market. The Alcatel-Telettra merger could only be allowed, said the Commission, if they broke their shareholding links with Telefonica, the Spanish telephone operator, which, like some of its equivalents around the world, likes to keep minority stakes in its main suppliers. The aim is to curb any temptation for Telefonica to give Alcatel and Telettra special treatment. Mr Suard said he was happy to buy Telefonica's shares in Telettra's Italian and Spanish subsidiary, since that was part of the original Fiat agreement. However he was less than keen on the Commission's demand that Alcatel buy back the 21.14 per cent stake that Telefonica holds in the French group's Spanish subsidiary. 'We are negotiating in good faith to do so, but we can only do it if the purchase conditions are acceptable to us,' he said. 'If we cannot agree the price, there will be no acquisition,' said Mr Suard. Alcatel Alsthom will not indicate what that price might be, though Telefonica's books value its stakes in Alcatel Standard Electrica - the French group's Spanish offshoot - and Telettra Espanola at Pta4.4bn (Dollars 40.5m). Telefonica is likely to argue that this is a fraction of their real value. Mr Suard found the requirement to buy back Telefonica's stake in Alcatel's Spanish unit all the more surprising given that Telefonica continues to hold shares in the local subsidiaries of Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, and AT&amp;T of the US, both competitors of Alcatel, without being challenged by Brussels. 'We are all in favour of competition, but it must be balanced,' said Mr Suard, normally known for his liberal economic views. 'Applying this requirement only to Alcatel sets up a strong distortion in the single market.' Mr Suard does not plan to contest the decision. However, his outburst does show that France's general unease over the application of EC competition policy has spilled over from the traditional wrangling over state subsidies into a new area for dispute; mergers.</p>

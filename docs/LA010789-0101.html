			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines said it will sharply reduce its biggest discount fares on  some flights, cutting them up to $110 round-trip for travel completed by Feb.  28. Northwest said the promotional fares center primarily on flights to and  from 22 U.S. cities in the South and Southeast. The biggest reductions are for  off-peak travel, with smaller discounts for peak periods and extra savings for  senior citizens. Tickets must be purchased at least seven days before travel,  passengers must stay over a Saturday night and the fares are not refundable.  Other airlines are expected to follow suit.  </P></p>

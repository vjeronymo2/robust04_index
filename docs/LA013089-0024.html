			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANDING FIRM ON MEDICARE  </P> <P> Key congressional leaders have rejected calls to rewrite the Medicare-expansion  law that came into effect Jan. 1, and we think that they are right.  </P> <P> Many Medicare beneficiaries are objecting to the fact that the additional  services, including expanded acute care in hospitals and coverage for  prescription drugs, will be financed by the beneficiaries themselves through an  income-tax surcharge on those with higher incomes. At a time when the nation is  rapidly graying, there is no equitable alternative. The shrinking work force  can hardly be expected to subsidize these expanded services for the growing  population of older Americans. Furthermore, the benefits are a bargain.  </P> <P> Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Finance Committee, and Rep. Dan  Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, are standing  firm behind the new law.So they should. To reject this reform would be to doom  other essential expansions of service, including long-term-care insurance, that  can be developed by Congress only if at least some of the cost is borne  directly by the beneficiaries.  </P> <P> A majority of Medicare beneficiaries will pay only a basic monthly fee for the  added protections -- $4 for the current year, rising to $10 in 1993. For the  40% of the seniors with higher incomes, there is an additional income-tax  surcharge -- 15% of tax liability for this year, rising to 28%, or a maximum of  $1,050, in 1993. Congressional estimates underscore the fact that even at  maximum fees these are bargains, representing a substantial subsidy. "An  individual who pays the maximum supplemental premium of $1,050 in 1993 will  still receive, on average, a subsidy of approximately $1,700," according to  Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), one of the authors of the legislation.  </P></p>

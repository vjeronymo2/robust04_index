			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The United States has  decided to take hard-line action against North Korea, including  resumption of this year's "Team Spirit" military drill if  Pyongyang fails to fulfill a statement by the United Nations  Security Council urging it to allow additional nuclear  inspections, by April 15 when Defense Secretary William Perry  visits Seoul, a vernacular Japanese newspaper reported Tuesday.    Washington's new direction was decided Monday at the first  U.S. administration meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue  chaired by the chief negotiator at high-level talks with  Pyongyang, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, a  senior U.S. official told the MAINICHI SHIMBUN.    Attendants of the meeting included officials above the  assistant- secretarial level from the State and Defense  Departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence  Agency and the National Security Council.    Officials from most agencies except for the State Department  agreed that action against North Korea was inevitable, the U.S.  official said.    It was agreed at the meeting that Washington will prepare  action and follow-up measures if North Korea shows no  willingness to compromise by early next week, the official said.    Time is running out for North Korea as the mood in  Washington  has hardened since the communist regime's obstruction of checks  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and as a  hard-line stance is prevailing in Congress, the official told  MAINICHI.</p>

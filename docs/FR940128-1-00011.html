			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Seafood industry representatives have urged the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Government to institute a mandatory, HACCP-type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection system for their products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A nationally mandated HACCP-type system of controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appears to be a prerequisite for continued access to world  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ensuring the safety of seafood presents special challenges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to both the industry that produces it and to Government agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged with protecting the public health. Seafood is unique in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many respects. While often thought of as homogeneous in nature,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood is actually a variety of products encompassing literally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundreds of species that have little in common other than an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquatic origin. Collectively, seafoods have perhaps the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diverse and complex microbiology of any food commodity (Ref. 3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. xi).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of habitats for edible species is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary and diverse ranging from cold to warm water, bottom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dwelling to surface feeding, deep sea to near shore, and fresh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water to saltwater. Fish are exposed to the bacteria and viruses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that naturally occur in their environment as well as to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that enter the water through pollution. Chemicals, some of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are toxic to humans, can accumulate in fish as well. Fish can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also accumulate natural toxins and parasites that are specific to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine animals. As a consequence, fish are subject to a wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of hazards before harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Safety Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The question of how safe is the seafood in the marketplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been the subject of public debate in recent years. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debate has occurred partly because precise data on the numbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and causes of foodborne illnesses in the United States do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist. Foodborne illnesses tend to be significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underreported to public health authorities. Data on foodborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses that are meaningful from an epidemiological standpoint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are difficult and expensive to develop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) compiles data in its Foodborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disease Surveillance System that are reported from State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local health authorities. All foodborne illnesses are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underreported to this system (Ref. 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonetheless, CDCP data are the best available and can at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least be used to identify trends and emerging concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various diseases (Ref. 5, p. 219). The data suggest that most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood-related illnesses result from certain natural toxins in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finfish and from viruses in molluscan shellfish consumed raw or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially cooked (Ref. 4). The wide range of other hazards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can affect seafood undoubtedly result in illnesses, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available data indicate that such illnesses are not as common.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, according to the CDCP data, the actual occurrence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems tends to be limited relative to the range of hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could cause problems and tends to be associated with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minority of commercially available species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the CDCP system, seafood accounted for 4.8 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported cases of foodborne illness for the period 1973 to 1987  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 4). However, as CDCP has pointed out, variations in rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of underreporting among different foods and varying etiologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make it impossible to compare safety among different foods based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely on CDCP data (Ref. 4). This is certainly true for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood. Some seafood-related illnesses tend to be overreported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to CDCP's system relative to other foodborne diseases, due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> largely to their distinctive characteristics, while others are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably underreported relative to other causes because they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less distinctive and more difficult to diagnose (Ref. 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has attempted to determine the relative safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood through risk assessment. The results of this effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate that the risk of illness associated with molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked is greater than for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any cooked flesh food. However, seafood overall is as safe or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safer than other flesh foods in terms of frequency of illness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Refs. 5, p. 25; and 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute of Medicine, in its 1991 report entitled ``Seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety,'' are consistent with the CDCP data and the FDA risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment. According to NAS, ``Most seafoods available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. public are wholesome and unlikely to cause illness in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). Moreover, in reviewing the CDCP data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the report noted that the 23 percent increase in seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption in the United States in the 10-year period ending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989 was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood-borne illnesses (Ref. 7, p. 27). Nevertheless, as NAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out, ``there are areas of risk'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report addressed at some length virtually every possible risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could affect seafood and made numerous recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to existing and proposed control measures. NAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that improvements be made in the present system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory control (Ref. 7, p. 1) and repeatedly recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP controls wherever appropriate. ``Inspection and testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should focus on actual problems (as in HACCP systems),'' NAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded (Ref. 7, p. 16).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

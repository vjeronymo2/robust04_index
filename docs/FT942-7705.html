			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: The Limited may expand Bath &amp; Bodyworks unit The Limited, the US stores group, is considering international expansion of its fast-growing Bath &amp; Bodyworks division, with stores to open overseas, possibly within the next year, AP-DJ reports from Columbus, Ohio. Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive, said after the annual meeting that the company also planned to add a net 400 new stores in 1994 across the various divisions. The group, however, will continue to reduce the total number of stores in some of its biggest divisions, such as Lerner New York, and its flagship Limited Stores. It plans to add more than 100 Structure menswear stores and more than 100 Bath &amp; Bodyworks stores, as well as adding more Victoria's Secrets stores. The Limited, Limited Inc's large but troubled ladies clothing retailer, will reduce its total stores by 40 during 1994, the company added. Mr Michael Weiss, vice-chairman of Limited Inc, has taken personal control of The Limited Stores, and said the company was redefining its customer. 'We've defined it more closely for the woman who wants fashion but isn't trendy and is concerned about price.' Limited, which has successfully launched spin-off catalogues from businesses such as Victoria's Secrets swimsuit catalogue, said this autumn it would 'test' a catalogue for its Structure menswear stores. By the end of 1994, Limited will be operating more than 5,000 stores, including Henri Bendel, Lane Bryant and Express stores. Mr Wexner said that while the company had been and remained cautious about international expansion, he believed some of their brands had international potential. The possible international expansion of Bath &amp; Bodyworks has been under study by the company for the past year and the company could make announcements on expansions within the next month.</p>

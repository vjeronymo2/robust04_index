			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Power companies face gas sale curbs Regional electricity companies may face curbs in selling natural gas to 18m households in the first two years of the phased de-regulation of the domestic gas industry. Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, said yesterday some restrictions might be needed because companies would be able to offer full energy packages to households in 1996 and 1997. In those years, 5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of the domestic gas market will be opened to competition. Gas companies, however, will not be able to offer electricity to their customers until 1998, when the gas and electricity markets are due to be fully opened to competition. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said there was 'no question of regional electricity companies being forbidden' from entering the gas market. But Ofgas had to ensure they did not have an unfair advantage by offering energy packages in which gas sales could be subsidised by electricity supply monopolies. She denied that companies might be banned from entering the gas market until 1998, saying she did 'not plan to do anything that draconian'. The 14 electricity distributors in mainland UK, which have invested heavily for the opening of the market, said yesterday they would fight any proposals to restrict their participation in the gas market. 'We see gas as a major business,' said Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire Electricity. He denied electricity companies would have an unfair advantage. 'In terms of volume the percentages of the gas and electricity markets open to competition in 1996 will be similar.' Mr John Devaney, chief executive of Eastern Electricity, said he would be surprised if power companies were restricted in the gas market: 'It would seem foolish to restrict companies which are well equipped to take.' Offer, the electricity regulator, is already looking at speeding up the liberalisation of the power market as a result of the changes in the gas industry. Only consumers whose peak demand is 100kw or more have a choice from whom to buy supplies. This choice is due to be extended to all consumers in 1998 but Offer has asked companies for opinions on bringing forward competition in some instances to 1996.</p>

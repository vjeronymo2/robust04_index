			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ruben Davila] </F>   [Text] Saltillo, Coahuila, 28 April--Thus far this year, 13  tons of drugs have been seized on sites near this town: an  amount representing a 350 percent increase over that for the  same period in 1993. This announcement was made today by the  agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF), Luis  Ramon Balmori.    He made this statement after witnessing the incineration of  four tons of cocaine confiscated a month ago, as well as three  tons of marijuana seized in various operations by the Federal  Highway and Ports Police and the Federal Judicial Police.    He declared that Coahuila now ranks first in drug  confiscations, "because every week various amounts of narcotics,  in most instances bound for the United States, are detected."    He noted that surveillance operations have been intensified  on all highways and at foreign transport terminals, adding that  even minors have been found being used by drug dealers to carry  drugs to the border. The drug burning took place at the  facilities of the Sixth Military Zone, in a ceremony headed by  the PGR's [Attorney General's Office] state representative,  Maria del Refugio Martinez.</p>

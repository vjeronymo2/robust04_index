			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Payments balance back in surplus: City surprised as current account moves Pounds 846m into black after seven years Britain's current-account balance of payments moved into surplus for the first time for 7 1/2 years in the third quarter of this year. The Central Statistical Office confounded City expectations of a modest deficit by announcing yesterday a seasonally adjusted surplus of Pounds 846m in the three months to the end of September compared with a revised deficit of Pounds 1.1bn in the second quarter and a deficit of Pounds 2.09bn in the third quarter of 1993. The current account has been the bugbear of governments since the second world war. News of the first surplus since the first quarter of 1987 was seized upon by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as 'crowning an excellent year for the British economy'. Speaking on a day in which a MORI poll for The Times showed support for the government at a new low, Mr Clarke said Britain was 'selling more goods and services abroad than at any time'. Other official figures showed a slight easing in the rate of economic growth to 4.1 per cent in the year to the third quarter from an estimate last month of 4.2 per cent, calming fears that interest rates might have to rise early in the new year. At the same time, reports of a late surge in Christmas shopping held out the hope that retail sales in December would grow compared with last year. The improvement in the current account reflected a sharp jump in Britain's 'invisible' surplus from trade in services such as banking and insurance and investments abroad. That jumped, according to yesterday's provisional figures, to Pounds 2.37bn in the third quarter from Pounds 1.32bn in the previous three months, and more than offset the deficit on visible trade, which fell to Pounds 1.52bn from Pounds 2.43bn. However, part of the higher invisible surplus reflected potentially erratic movements in the volatile investment income account. In particular, it was boosted by British banks reporting Pounds 700m of net earnings from interest rate swaps in the third quarter, which may be subject to later revision. The investment income surplus increased between the second and third quarters to Pounds 2.73bn from Pounds 2.18bn. An improved performance by financial services, including insurance, helped to raise the surplus from trade in services to Pounds 1.39bn from Pounds 822m. Offsetting those components, the deficit on transfer payments increased to Pounds 1.75bn from Pounds 1.68bn. According to Ms Alison Wright, the director-general of British Invisibles, a trade body, the UK's private sector invisibles balance recorded a record surplus of Pounds 13.4bn in the first three quarters of this year compared with Pounds 10.8bn for the whole of last year.

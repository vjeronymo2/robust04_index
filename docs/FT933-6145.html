			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Iraq weapon UN weapons inspectors investigating Iraq's missile installations say they are struck by their remarkable similarity to Argentina's Condor II missile complex, closed in 1990 by President Carlos Menem, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. UN officials recently in Argentina were quoted as saying the similarity of the production plants and missiles gave them insights into how the larger Iraqi project worked. Argentina, Iraq and Egypt co-operated closely in developing missile technology in the 1980s.</p>

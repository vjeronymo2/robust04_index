			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Recall of Morillon sparks row: Colourful commander in Bosnia not being punished, says Leotard MR Francois Leotard, the new French defence minister, yesterday sparked a political row by stating that he planned to recall General Philippe Morillon, the colourful commander of the United Nations' peacekeeping force in Bosnia. The defence minister said on French radio that Gen Morillon, who is feted as a folk hero in France, would be given a senior military post on his return. 'His human and professional qualities merit an important command,' Mr Leotard said. But United Nations officials in New York said they had heard nothing from France about the possible replacement of General Morillon. A spokesman said troop rotations were normal within the UN force 'and certainly, as a French officer, the desires of his government would be important in this regard'. But, he added: 'We still have received nothing from the government of France regarding his replacement or a desire to replace him. And to my knowledge the secretary-general has not been in touch with him.' In Paris, Mr Leotard denied that the general was being punished for much-publicised personal initiatives in Bosnia, particularly his recent mercy mission to Srebrenica aimed at opening the way to relief convoys and protecting the local Moslem population from Serb attacks. 'Everyone including the prime minister and myself. . . wish to underline the absolutely remarkable nature of the action he has undertaken,' Mr Leotard said. However, Mr Leotard's announcement came only a few days after Gen Morillon had stated on French television that he planned to stay in Bosnia. He is now expected to return to France by the end of this month. 'I'm amazed at the little row that has developed around this officer,' Mr Leotard said, stressing that he would ask his successor to take on similar humanitarian initiatives in Bosnia. However, the defence ministry refused to disclose who would replace Gen Morillon or when his successor would be appointed. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, tried to defuse the controversy by stressing that the general's return was routine. 'Every mission has a (terminal) date,' he said. Mr Juppe denied allegations that Gen Morillon, who has been in Bosnia for 13 months - at least twice as long as any of his predecessors - was being withdrawn at the request of the Serbs. Gen Morillon, known as 'Beau Geste' in France after the swashbuckling fictional Foreign Legion officer immortalised by the English novelist PC Wren, is a controversial figure both in France and abroad. His admirers praise him for his courage in daring exploits such as his defence of the Srebrenica Moslems. But his detractors see him as a publicity-seeking egoist, claiming that his disregard for military procedure has caused serious problems for the rest of the UN operation in Bosnia. The United Nations aid airlift to Sarajevo will resume on Thursday after a five-day suspension imposed due to a threat from Serb anti-aircraft guns, a UN relief spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. The UN has scheduled 18 flights between Sarajevo and the Croatian port of Split and the Italian port of Ancona.</p>

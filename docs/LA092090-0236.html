			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> HOW TO CHANGE YOUR NAME LEGALLY  </P> <P> So what happens if Esther feels in her heart of hearts that she is actually a  Tiffany? If Billy Ray Jim Bob knows his life would be different if he became  Thaddeus? If the appellation doesn't fit, change it.  </P> <P> You can adopt a name at any time and change it on credit cards and some other  official records using an "also known as." But "a.k.a.'s get messy with tax  records," said Charlotte Hooker, probate division supervisor in the county  clerk's office. "The only way to get your birth records changed is to go  through the legal name-change process."  </P> <P> Name changes are handled locally by the probate division of the Orange County  clerk's office, located in the Orange County Courthouse, 700 Civic Center Drive  West in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The filing fee is $123. Forms for the Petition for Change of Name, Order to  Show Cause for Change of Name and Decree Changing Name are available on the  first floor of the courthouse in the county clerk's office. When completed  (they must be typewritten), they can be returned to the probate division on the  second floor, Department 3. Families -- such as husband and wife, parent and  minor child, and brother and sister under the age of 18 -- can petition  together. A hearing date will be assigned when the paperwork is filed.  </P> <P> A copy of the filed Order to Show Cause for Change of Name must be published in  an adjudicated Orange County newspaper at least once a week for four  consecutive weeks. A list of the 30 such newspapers is available in the county  clerk's office. The newspaper's Proof of Publication should be submitted no  later than two days before the hearing date.  </P> <P> In California, a request for a name change can be denied only if a person with  a legitimate reason for rejecting the change files an objection with the court.  If this is not the case, the Decree Changing Name is granted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> If you are recently married  </P> <P> You do not have to go through the court process to change your name. You do,  however, have to contact the agencies listed below to alert them to the change.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agencies to contact  </P> <P> The first agency to alert is the Social Security Administration. You can  request the necessary forms by telephone by calling (800) 234-5772. Once the  forms are filled out, you can mail them to any of the seven local Social  Security offices with the original or certified copies of the court order that  changes your name, your marriage certificate or divorce decree. The documents  will be returned to you after processing. If you do not want to send original  copies through the mail, you can take the forms and documents into any Social  Security office and they will process the name change.  </P> <P> Social Security Administration records and tax records are linked by computer,  so there is no reason to contact the Internal Revenue Service as well. Social  Security will alert the IRS.  </P> <P> The next step is to change the name on your driver's license. The Department of  Motor Vehicles will issue you a new license (with a new picture) for a $10 fee.  </P> <P> Others to contact about your name change include: your bank; your employer;  credit card, utility and insurance companies; voter registration, passport and  post offices; magazines and newspapers you subscribe to, and your school alumni  association.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NAME CHANGES FILED IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Dec. 1989: 35  </P> <P> July 1990: 73  </P> <P> Source: Orange County clerk's office, probate division; Social Security  Administration; Department of Motor Vehicles KATHIE BOZANICH  </P></p>

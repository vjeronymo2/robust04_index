			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Telelvison Not all Japanese eat whalemeat. In Whale Wars (BBC 2, 9.35), Japanese conservationists express their opposition ahead of next week's meeting of the International Whaling Commission. It also emerges that the waters have been muddied by the whaling industry's effort to convince the Japanese that the western campaign against whaling is an assault on their cultural identity. A thousand brains must have considered the idea of a TV pastiche of Radio 4's eternal Desert Island Discs, only to reject it. Now someone has come up with Memento (C4, 8.00), a misconceived, feeble series. However, anyone who cannot have enough of the creamy timbre of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's voice can enjoy her performance tonight, enthusing about her eight most prized possessions. There is a lot wrong with the British legal system, yet it is still all to the good that TV cameras are held at bay while cases are decided. They do it differently in Luxembourg, which made possible tonight's episode of True Stories: Lovers on Trial (C4, 9.35), a gory murder story worthy of Zola.</p>

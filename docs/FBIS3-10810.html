Coutinho obtained 46 votes, with three votes against him and  two abstentions, while Alkimar obtained 40 votes, seven against  and two abstentions. CADE is one of Finance Minister Henrique  Cardoso's main instruments to control oligopolies and cartels.  It will resort to the antitrust law to prosecute, on behalf of  the government, company directors who set excessive prices for  their products. If found guilty, these directors may go to  prison.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- An umbrella organization  of dissident activist groups announced Monday it will stage  nationwide rallies Tuesday in memory of the "1980 Kwangju  popular uprising" against the government.    The rallies will start at 7 PM at Chongmyo Park in downtown  Seoul [four blocks from the U.S. Embassy] and in 11 major cities  across the nation to mark the 14th anniversary of the civil  uprising, a spokesman for Chongukyonhap (The National Alliance  for Democracy and Unification) told a news conference Monday.    Local Chongukyonhap chapters will also file criminal  complaints with prosecution offices in their regions Tuesday  afternoon demanding the prosecution of Former Presidents Chon  Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and others who they claim should assume  responsibility for the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy  movement, the spokesman said.    Additional complaints will be lodged at prosecution offices  across the country on May 27, when the organization expects to  have more people joining the move against those responsible for  the massacre during the suppression, he said.    The group hopes more than 1 million people, including  400,000  from Kwangju, will join the attempt to take legal action.    In a statement, Chongukyonhap said "we are going to file  complaints with the prosecution against Chon Tu-hwan, then  commander of the Defense Security Command, No Tae-u, then  commander of the Capital Garrison Command, and 33 other military  commanders above the level of battalion commander for treason  and homicide because we think the incumbent government has no  will to reveal the truth about the Kwangju democratization  movement and prosecute those responsible for the suppression of  the movement."    In a separate move, a coalition of the nation's student  councils plans similar rallies across the nation to commemorate  the uprising during the "five-day period for struggle to succeed  the spirits of the Kwangju civil uprising" starting Tuesday,  with over 1,400 students from more than 10 universities in Seoul  expected to take part in the rallies in the capital alone.    The police, meanwhile, have beefed up security around the  residences of Former Presidents Chon and No in Yonhi-tong,  central Seoul, the U.S. Embassy and the presidential office of  Chongwadae in preparation for possible action there by students.  Police have stationed more than 2,000 men in and around the  residences of the former presidents.</p>

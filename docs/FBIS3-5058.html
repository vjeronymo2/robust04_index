The stadium was gorgeously decorated with letters  "1964-1994"  and "celebration of 30th anniversary," pictures depicting rich  harvests and illumination.    When the great leader President Kim Il-song appeared in the  box amid the welcome music, enthusiastic cheers of "hurrah!" and  thunderous applause resounded through the stadium.    Kimilsongia and Kimchongilia and letters "Glory to You,"  "Agriculture Is the Great Foundation of the Country" and  "Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Socialist Rural  Theses" appeared on the background and waves of flowers rolled  on the floor.    Watching the performance were member of the presidium of the  Political Bureau of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers'  Party of Korea [WPK] and Minister of People's Armed Forces O  Chin-u, Politburo member of the C.C., the WPK and Premier of the  Administration Council Kang Song-san, Politburo members of the  C.C., the WPK and Vice-presidents Yi Chong-ok, Pak Song-chol and  Kim Yong-chu and other party and state officials and the  participants in the national agricultural conference.    The display successfully showed on great epic canvases the  imperishable feats performed by President Kim Il-song, who  published a unique, great programme of socialist rural  construction and set an example of the century in the solution  to the rural question to build a prospering socialist  countryside in this land and the happiness of the Korean  agricultural working people, who are enjoying an independent and  creative life thanks to the rural theses.    It also demonstrated the unshakable will of our agricultural  working people and all other people to finally solve the rural  question and hasten the complete victory of socialism by  remaining loyal to the party's leadership and thoroughly  carrying out the tasks set by President Kim Il-song in his  letter to the national agricultural conference.

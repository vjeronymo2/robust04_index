			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Increased customer spending lifts Wyevale Wyevale Garden Centres, the UK's largest garden centre company, saw a fall in the number of customers to its 41 garden centres during the first half of 1994, but increased customer spending helped boost profits. Pre-tax profits rose 82 per cent from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 6.75m, but the figure was distorted by the Pounds 2.9m profit from the sale of Homelands Retail Park. There was a Pounds 340,000 exceptional charge, for payments to the chairman and a director, who retired during the first half. Wyevale has maintained pressure on its suppliers, and it improved its operating profit margins from 17.6 per cent to 18.4 per cent, in spite of a competitive retail pricing environment. Operating profit before interest and exceptional items rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 4.34m (Pounds 4.12m), on a 3 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 22m). The average spend per customer increased by more than 4 per cent to Pounds 10.50, and while customer numbers fell about 1 per cent during the period, the company said there were already signs of recovery. Following the November rights issue, Wyevale will have net cash of about Pounds 5.5m, in spite of Pounds 2.92m invested in the purchases of centres in York, Bristol and Middlesex, and the cost of redeveloping its centre at Marple, Greater Manchester. The Bristol and Middlesex centres will make a maiden contribution in the second half of the year. Mr John Rudgard, chairman, said: 'our strategy ofbroadening our retailing base will provide a framework for sustained future growth so despite the continued economic uncertainty, we remain confident of our future prospects.' The company is paying an interim dividend of 2.93p (2.75p). Earnings per share, adjusted for exceptional items, fell from 8p to 7.5p, due to the rights issue.</p>

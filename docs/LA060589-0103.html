			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN MURDER OF SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER DENIES 'INFAMOUS CRIME'  </P> <P> A man who went on trial today for the 1986 murder of Olof Palme denied that he  gunned down the prime minister.  </P> <P> "I did not kill Prime Minister Olof Palme. I did not try to kill Mrs. Palme,"  defendant Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson told the court. "The shooting was an  infamous crime that I could never have committed."  </P> <P> Palme was shot in the back from a distance of eight inches Feb. 28, 1986, as he  walked home from a movie. The gunman escaped down a dark side street. Mrs.  Palme was slightly wounded by a second bullet.  </P> <P> Chief Magistrate Michael af Geijerstam broke a five-month news blackout on the  defendant's identity by reading Pettersson's name live on a radio broadcast.  Under Swedish law his name could not be released until the trial, and he has  been identified in Swedish media only as "the 42-year-old."  </P> <P> Pettersson has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and a long criminal record.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq has protested to the Arab League that Saudi and  Kuwaiti rulers continue to make base facilities available for  American, British, and French aircraft violating the Iraqi  airspace. A letter from Iraq's permanent delegate to the Arab  League pointed out the serious threat the violations carry for  the security, sovereignty, and national unity of Iraq.    The American, British, and French aircraft mounted 277  sorties over Iraq between 1 and 7 April, having taken off from  bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    Attached to the letter was a detailed list of the flights  for  the attention of the league members.</p>

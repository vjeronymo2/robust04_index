			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Prisoner's death due to lack of care An inquest jury yesterday returned a lack of care verdict on Mr Ernest Hogg, a remand prisoner who died while in the custody of Group 4, the private security company. Mr Hogg and others had access to illegal alcohol on a remand visit from Wolds prison, Humberside, to Rotherham magistrates court last May, the jury heard. Nobody noticed that he remained in the prison escort van when it returned. By the time he was discovered Mr Hogg had inhaled vomit, and died four days later.</p>

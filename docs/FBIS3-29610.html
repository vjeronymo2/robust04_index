Under the plan, licensed mechanics at auto repair shops  would  be allowed to overhaul and repair major auto components such as  driving gear, the sources said.    Currently, only government-designated repair shops are  allowed to service such components.    At the same time, auto repair shops would be encouraged to  use generic auto parts, including imports, to end the trade  custom of favoring Japanese manufacturer-supplied parts, they  said.    In Japan, 70 to 80 percent of the auto parts are supplied by  Japanese automakers.    The government will also consider sending its own inspectors  to the United States to expedite inspections on auto imports,  the sources said.    The auto industry has also started figuring out ways to  boost  imports and local procurement of auto parts and components,  industry sources said.    Specifically, domestic automakers will draw up their  respective plans to ensure more stable business deals with U.S.  parts manufacturers and step up joint development of components  with them.    Moreover, they will study ways of increasing domestic sales  of imported vehicles, the sources said.</p>

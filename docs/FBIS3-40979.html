Hassan  Wirayuda, director for international organizations in the  Department of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Jakarta  yesterday that the plan will be brought before the House of  Representatives. This is because deliberations on the matter --  which are very delicate and will have a far-reaching impact --  will take a long time.    Meanwhile, Ian Kenyon, executive director of the  Organization  for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, welcomed the Indonesian  plan. Only four of the 154 countries that signed the convention  have ratified it. He expressed his hope that more countries  will ratify the convention. The four countries are Sweden,  Fiji, Mauritius, and Seychelles.</p>

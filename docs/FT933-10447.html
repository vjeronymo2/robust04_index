			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Observer: Cabinet maker Tory spin doctors charged with repairing the party's battered image have another potentially explosive event to pencil into their Filofaxes. The BBC announced yesterday that its four-part series Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, will run in October. The date has not been fixed but it would be a miracle if did not coincide with the Tory party conference in Blackpool. A 'no-holds-barred' interview with the grande dame is promised, duly offering yet another opportunity to re-open old wounds just when party managers will be desperately trying to rally the party faithful. Scant consolation that Hugh Scully, the executive producer, made his name as presenter of The Antiques Roadshow.</p>

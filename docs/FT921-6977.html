			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Chamber reports a fall in exports MANUFACTURING exports from Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales slipped back during the winter after a surge in the autumn, according to the latest economic and manpower survey by Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Continuing good exports by 102 service companies masked weak and variable performances among the 105 manufacturers in the survey. This kept the exports balance figure - the difference between those reporting increases and declines - positive at 13 percentage points. The autumn balance was 23 points. The decline in domestic sales continued, with a balance of minus 7 points. This compares with minus 10 in the autumn and minus 31 six months ago, prompting the chamber to say that the rate of decline may have slowed. Orders from the UK showed a balance of minus 4 points, supporting this view. The survey showed companies with more than 500 employees suffering most. Only 10 per cent of these increased sales at home. Workforce reductions continued. However, although the balance figure from quarter to quarter was unchanged at minus 9 points, 53 per cent kept numbers stable compared with 49 per cent in the autumn. The balance in the summer was minus 18 points, with 43 per cent stable. Confidence indicators remained high. Only 10 per cent expected turnover to fall this year and only 18 per cent forecast lower profits. There was some weakening of optimism - a drop of 8 points to 54 per cent expecting increased turnover, but a fall of only 3 points to 47 per cent who forecast profit improvement.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Patten unveils Pounds 1m campaign for tests Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday launched a Pounds 1m advertising campaign as part of attempts to ensure that national curriculum tests take place in English and Welsh schools this year. He said a new pamphlet on the tests would be sent to every school and county library. Secondary headteachers are now committed to seeing that the tests go ahead. Mr John Sutton, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, rejected the call by the largest teachers' union, the National Union of Teachers, to abandon this year's tests.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Low oil prices reduce Monument to Pounds 3.4m Low oil prices hit Monument Oil &amp; Gas, the independent explorer, which yesterday announced a 36 per cent fall in interim net profits from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 3.4m. Mr Tony Craven Walker, chief executive, said a 19 per cent fall in average oil prices to Pounds 10.17 a barrel was the main factor behind the 30 per cent drop in gross profits to Pounds 4.2m. Oil prices were also blamed for the 18 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 14.1m for the six months to the end of June. On the brighter side, Mr Craven Walker said the costs of developing Monument's 20 per cent interest in Liverpool Bay were running about 10 per cent below budget. This meant that the group was currently funding its obligations from cash resources. Liverpool Bay is expected to come on stream by December 1995. The declining profits masked a substantial contribution from asset disposals. A net Pounds 50.5m was raised from the sale of lossmaking North Sea assets to BP and the disposal of 3.9 per cent of Liverpool Bay. Under full-cost accounting, these gains are offset against the carrying cost of reserves in the balance sheet. As a result, Monument's depletion charge fell by 99p in the first half to Pounds 2.81 per barrel, largely due to the disposals and to a contract to sell gas in Argentina. Mr Craven Walker said the lower depletion charge would benefit the group substantially when production began to take off next year. Production in the first half fell from 7,900 barrels of oil equivalent to 7,700 boe per day. Second-half production would also be lower, due to asset disposals. Monument drilled seven wells in the first half, none of which was successful. Farm-outs had kept the drilling costs at Pounds 3m, Mr Craven Walker said. The group aimed to drill 17 wells in the second half, mostly overseas. As in previous years, there is no dividend. Earnings per share fell to 0.51p (0.8p). COMMENT Monument has set itself up nicely for a low oil price environment. Most of the high cost, low return assets have been sold, swapped or farmed out, leaving it with a strong balance sheet and exposure to interesting areas overseas. The big question is what to do now? Mr Craven Walker has long espoused the principle of crystallising value for shareholders. So far, this has been through a solid share price performance. Yet investors facing a quiet 18 months and no dividend will be asking for something more, and Monument could well deliver within the next year. The sale of a tranche of Liverpool Bay could be a taster of what is to come. Forecasts are for net profits of roughly Pounds 7m. At last night's price of 70 1/2 p, the shares appear to be up with events, at least until the future direction becomes clearer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] SA's [South Africa] election results will be known  48 hours after the polls close, with the Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] releasing an hourly tally from Friday morning,  April 29, as it counts the votes. Expressing confidence that  "the greatest show on earth" will take place on time in all  regions, IEC officials yesterday detailed its arrangements for  the election.    The commission has decided to increase the number of voting  stations to substantially more than the 9,000 originally  planned, opting for more mobile stations. The increase was  considered necessary primarily because of the poor state of some  roads. Ballot boxes will be taken from voting stations to  about 1,000 counting stations countrywide. Each station will be  responsible for counting more than 30,000 votes.    Counting will begin at 6AM on April 29 and will continue  through the night until it is completed. Officials expect the  counting to take between 26 and 36 hours. Provisional results  will be released hourly from each of the voting stations and  will be transmitted to the IEC's Midrand base, where they will  be released immediately. Between two and 10 days after the  election, the commission will make a declaration about whether  ti was free and fair, giving parties the opportunity to lodge  complaints.    Officials believe it will be impossible to have voting  stations in three large areas of Natal, but stations will be  placed close to these areas' borders. Transkei is also  understood to be creating headaches for the IEC, but officials  are confident these difficulties will be resolved. Despite the  difficulties setting up an organisation employing more people  than Anglo American, officials say planning is falling into  place and elections could take place in three regions tomorrow.    Meanwhile, the IEC has undertaken to reconsider the number  of  voting stations in Sandton, after it was pointed out that the  provisional list showed only two voting stations had been  planned.</p>

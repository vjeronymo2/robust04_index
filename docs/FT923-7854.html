			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Observer: Big debate So who has the largest free trade area in the world - Europe or North America? Widely reported claims that the North American Free Trade Agreement will create the 'largest and richest' trading bloc on earth have clearly piqued the Europeans, whose very own European Economic Area (EEA) comes into being on January 1. With just a hint of smugness, a European Commission official pointed out yesterday that the 19-nation EEA would have 379m inhabitants, against Nafta's 360m. 'Added to which, the EEA will account for half of international trade, so it's difficult to have a larger area,' she said. As for being the richest, the EEA countries seem to win that battle too, with a combined GDP of nearly Ecu6,500bn: that's more than Dollars 9,000bn, compared with the Nafta countries' Dollars 6,000bn. Trade negotiators must be hoping that such statistical sparring will be the only manifestation of rivalry between the two blocs.</p>

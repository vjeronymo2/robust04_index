			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UN forces may enter Cerska UNITED NATIONS officials yesterday announced provisional agreement to enter Cerska, the fallen Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, to check reports that hundreds of people were killed and 1,500 wounded after Serbs overran the enclave, report Laura Silber in Belgrade and Michael Littlejohns in New York. In meetings with the Bosnian Serb army, Gen Philippe Morillon, head of the UN force, called for immediate UN access to the region and creation of a 24-hour UN-monitored corridor for civilians from Zepa, Cerska and Srebrenica to move unmolested. Meanwhile, the status of the military disengagement accord between Bosnia's warring factions apppeared in doubt last night, as the Serbian side differed with Moslems in interpreting the document. Mr Karadzic insisted that, in signing the accord, all he accepted was UN monitoring of withdrawal of heavy weapons. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic, however, was induced to sign on Wednesday on the understanding that UN forces would take control of the weapons. Gen Satish Nambiar, who retired this week as UN commander, offered the compromise to break an impasse in the peace talks. But Mr Karadzic made it plain this was not what the Serbs had agreed to. Casting further doubt on the talks, Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Karadzic both announced plans to leave New York today, ignoring a Security Council call to remain in the city to 'reach quickly a fair and workable settlement'. A UN spokesman said, almost in desperation: 'Where do we go fron here?' Talks could be resumed in Geneva, Paris or some other city where it might be possible to put pressure on the warring factions more successfully than in New York.</p>

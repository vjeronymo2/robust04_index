			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Indian loss prompts bank review: Standard Chartered's head office had 'no early warning' of securities scandal STANDARD Chartered warned yesterday that losses stemming from its involvement in India's worst financial scandal could reach Pounds 100m. Mr Malcolm Williamson, Standard's managing director, said the bank was carrying out a review of its management procedures in the wake of the debacle. He said there had been 'no early warning' of a problem in India, where Standard is the second biggest foreign bank with 32 offices. He was thus checking control procedures to make sure similar situations could not occur in the 54 other countries in which the bank has operations. Late on Wednesday, only a week after Standard's London head office was first alerted to a possible problem in Bombay, the bank said it was making a provision of Pounds 50m. This would cover possible losses from its involvement in an arcane form of Indian securities business. However, Mr Williamson said yesterday that the estimated loss was 'arbitrary'. Standard's losses were 'unlikely' to be more than Pounds 100m, he said, but they could turn out to be less than Pounds 50m. The losses stem from Standard's exposure to Indian 'bank receipts' - a form of IOU by which a bank promises to deliver government stock or equities to another bank on a due date. Mr Williamson said that until last week he had not been aware that Standard was involved in issuing and taking this paper. The sums of money involved were huge, said Mr Williamson, and they far exceeded the credit limits by which the Bombay operation was supposed to have operated. He described these IOUs as unique to India and said they were designed as a way of facilitating the settlement of securities transactions - settling a stock bargain on the Bombay Exchange has traditionally been a lengthy and arduous task. At the beginning of the year, there was a sharp rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange, which was coupled with an explosion in the volume of these IOUs in circulation. Standard's uncertainty about the extent of its losses stems from a number of causes. Executives sent from London, led by the bank's treasurer, its chief inspector and its head of corporate loan recoveries, are sifting through 'trunk loads of paper'. Mr Williamson said they were unsure whether all the IOUs were genuine. There was a risk, he said, that significant amounts had been forged. The bank is also uncertain whether the counterparties named in the transactions would be able to honour their debts. Nightmare in Bombay, Page 6</p>

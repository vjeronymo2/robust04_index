The conversation  focussed on election issues and relations between central  executive power bodies and the local executive power in the  autonomous Republic of Crimea.    [Correspondent] Crimea's top executive, President Yuriy  Meshkov, plans to conduct a poll on 27 March. There has been a  lot of talk about this poll on the air....    [Kravchuk, interrupting] I talked about it, too.    [Correspondent] And about your decree that abolished some of  its premises. But a lot will depend on, and I quote the U.S.  embassy press statement, Kiev's considerable self-control. Does  Kiev have that considerable self-control, Leonid Makarovych?    [Kravchuk] Of course it does, because, first of all, this  self-control needs to be understood in the way that we are  acting in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of  Ukraine. It is very important. Whereas the president of Crimea  has exceeded his powers, that is, has ignored the law, both the  Ukrainian one and his own, the president of Ukraine is acting  clearly within the framework of the law. Thus, if you put both  of these documents [the two presidents' decrees] on the table,  then you will see that we are acting clearly in accordance with  the law, while the president of Crimea has violated the norms of  both Ukraine's and his own law. And that is dangerous. Our  self-control shows in the fact that we are staying always within  the law. The Crimean president's lack of self-control in this  case shows in the fact that he wants to break the law, and he is  breaking it. I already said this, and I want to say once again  that the main thing that needs to be done in Crimea today is to  solve economic problems.    [Announcer] That was an excerpt from an interview with  President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. You can see it in full  today, at 2200 in the television program "Without Protocol."</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY DEATHS: DAVIS, HENSON AND JILL IRELAND  </P> <P> It was in 1967 when Sammy shook hands with my heart.  </P> <P> My husband Ed and I were visiting Jerry Lewis, the fine comedian, as he was  making a movie at the Shepperton Studios just outside of London. Jerry was busy  -- so he told us to go to the commissary on our own.  </P> <P> Sammy was there making a movie too -- and noticing that we were strangers, came  to our table, welcomed us as he introduced himself, and as he shook our hands,  said, "We were strangers no more." Shalom, Sammy -- you'll make friends  wherever you are. We'll miss you, we'll miss you.  </P> <P> ELEANOR N. JACOBS  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Russia urged to halt Aeroflot break-up A senior Russian air transport official yesterday urged the government to consolidate the country's civil aviation industry and reverse Aeroflot's break-up, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Valery Kosyanenko, deputy chief of the transport ministry's aviation department, said that 160 airlines had emerged from Aeroflot, once the monopoly airline of the former Soviet Union, and that 161 new ones had been set up from scratch. Almost every town with an airport in Russia has its own airline. Mr Kosyanenko suggested one solution would be to create holding companies consolidating several 'airlines' and airports.</p>

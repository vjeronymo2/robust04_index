			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Appointments: Hodge Mark 3 Sir Julian Hodge, the 87-year-old Welsh financier, has long since retired from active duty but his name lives on at the Julian Hodge Bank where his son, Julian, is strengthening the management team. Richard Mathias, aged 43, has been recruited from Midland Bank to fill the new post of deputy general manager. Richard Cave, managing director of the bank and one of Sir Julian's longest-serving lieutenants, says that the new appointment reflects the bank's commitment to South Wales generally and Cardiff in particular. 'It is most appropriate that in addition to many years experience in banking, Mathias was born and bred a Welshman and is Welsh-speaking,' says Cave. The Julian Hodge Bank is the Hodge family's latest attempt to establish a significant Welsh financial institution. Sir Julian, who started life as a railway clerk and sold insurance door-to-door in the evenings, disposed of his first venture - the Hodge Group - to Standard Chartered in the mid-1970s and sat on the new owner's board for some years. His second banking initiative - the Commercial Bank of Wales - was bought by Bank of Scotland in 1986. Compared with earlier Hodge banks, the family-owned Julian Hodge Bank is a modest affair with assets of Pounds 84m, shareholders' funds of Pounds 38m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m a year. It specialises in lending to commercial and industrial customers and operates out of a single office in Cardiff's Windsor Place. ***** David Clifton, md of CRODA INTERNATIONAL's universal division, is appointed to the main board. Stan Cressey, md of Croda's speciality chemicals sector, is to retire at the end of March. ***** Michael Schuetzendorf has been appointed operations director Hilton International London. ***** David Dewhurst is appointed group finance director of STRONG &amp; FISHER; he moves from the head office of Hillsdown Holdings which is a majority shareholder of Strong &amp; Fisher. ***** David Pearce has been appointed chairman and chief executive of KING &amp; SHAXSON HOLDINGS following the death of William D'Abbans; David Mason is appointed company secretary in place of David Jarrett who remains a managing director.</p>

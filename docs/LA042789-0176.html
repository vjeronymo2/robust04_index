			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCOTTISH ROCKER MIDGE URE POSES SOME BIG QUESTIONS  </P> <P> For someone who named his latest album "Answers to Nothing," a title oozing  skepticism, Scottish rocker Midge Ure certainly sounds interested in finding  answers to some big questions.  </P> <P> "Dear God," the song that has helped Ure gain his first foothold with American  audiences, asks the biggest question of them all: "Dear God, is there somebody  out there? Is there someone to hear my prayer?"  </P> <P> Hoping against hope, Ure (pronounced "your") turns the song into a grand-scale  pop prayer for world peace and plenty.  </P> <P> During the first half of the 1980s, when he fronted the British techno-pop  band, Ultravox, Ure didn't dwell much on the fate-of-the-world questions that  crop up often on "Answers to Nothing." The band traded in a lush, ballroom  romanticism built on swirling layers of synthesizers and Ure's atmospheric  guitar playing.  </P> <P> On his own, Ure has gone for a less symphonic sound and a lyrical approach full  of troubled reflection on global realities rather than romantic escapes.  </P> <P> Ure jumped into reality-in-music late in 1984, when Bob Geldof drafted him to  help write "Do They Know It's Christmas?" the theme song for Band Aid, the  British rock community's project to raise money for Ethiopian famine relief.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's any doubt about it" that involvement in Band Aid changed  his perspective in a way that has made his music more socially concerned, Ure  said recently over the phone from a tour stop in San Francisco. "Pre-Band Aid  and Live Aid (which he also helped organize), I wasn't overly conscious of what  was going on around me."  </P> <P> Also, Ure said, "my personal life changed quite drastically over the past 4 or  5 years. You tend to be single-minded being a single guy." Now married and the  father of a 2-year-old girl, "I have a lot more responsibility that I never had  before. You start looking at the world around you. It's quite frightening. With  the bond (of fatherhood) comes an awful lot of worry."  </P> <P> And, apparently, an urge to pray -- as Ure does on "Dear God," even if he is a  confirmed skeptic about religion.  </P> <P> "I have that cynical edge when it comes to religion," stemming from his  experience with sectarian intolerance while growing up in Glasgow. "I was  brought up believing Catholics have it totally wrong and Protestants had it  right. I was almost dragged into fights because of it," Ure said. "What I can  see (of) what man has done to religion is pain and anguish."  </P> <P> The title song of "Answers to Nothing" knocks preachers and politicians for  selling phony answers to a gullible public. The same, Ure acknowledges, could  also be said for what a lot of pop musicians are selling.  </P> <P> "Most pop songs don't say anything at all. It's a very lightweight, disposable  medium. But it can be very effective. There are songs with a real strength  about them. I heard 'Imagine' on the radio today. It still stands up.  Somebody's got serious feelings in that."  </P> <P> To Ure, rather than looking to a preacher, a politician or a pop singer, it's  best to believe -- as John Lennon himself concluded in a song entitled "God" --  in oneself.  </P> <P> "It's inner strength. I don't want to sound like a hippie, but you've got to  believe in yourself, rather than stories written down 2,000 years ago."  </P> <P> Ure sounds secure about his standing in the pop biz, even though his success in  the United States has not been firmly established. While Ultravox had nearly 30  hit singles in England, it never caught on with a mass American public. And  while "Dear God" has brought Ure to American listeners' attention, they haven't  stampeded to buy his album, which so far hasn't been able to advance past No.  88 on the Billboard chart.  </P> <P> "Up until the last couple of months I'd given America up as a great loss, or  America had given me up as a loss," Ure said. "If (success in) America happens  for me, that's a bonus. I'm very well set. I've been lucky enough to be  immensely successful elsewhere in the world. I have the (ability) to do exactly  what I like."  </P> <P>  Midge Ure plays tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San  Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50.

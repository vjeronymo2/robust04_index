			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTS PRAISE SPIRE AT CATHEDRAL  </P> <P> Garden Grove's already acclaimed Crystal Cathedral, newly crowned with a  glistening 18-story stainless-steel steeple, can now be truly classified as an  Orange County landmark, architects said Monday.  </P> <P> "Most architecture isn't great. This project is," said architect Leason  Pomeroy, president of the Irvine-based firm that designed the county's new  airport terminal. "Our community needs landmark architecture."  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert H. Schuller on Sunday dedicated the $5.5-million spire, which  was completed over the summer and is now one of the county's tallest  structures. New York architect Phillip Johnson, the designer of both the new  steeple and the glass-walled church, was on hand for the ceremony.  </P> <P> Built with 9-foot reflective steel prisms, the 236-foot spire includes a  52-bell carillon and is topped by a beacon for aircraft. It also features an  underground chapel with a revolving crystal cross.  </P> <P> "It's designed, engineered and constructed as a thing of beauty, a joy forever  to last literally for centuries," Schuller said. The tower is also earthquake  proof, he added.  </P> <P> Johnson, 84, told the congregation during the ceremony that he was surprised at  the overall effect of his design.  </P> <P> "It is so far more than I expected that it's hard even to speak about it," he  said. "I didn't realize that what we have here, Robert, is a tower that is  built of light. That celebrates the sun as great towers should. But in a new  way."  </P> <P> Johnson, who donated his design services, went on to say that he had help in  creating the tower. "I think you all know where that help came from."  </P> <P> Johnson also designed the 10-year-old cathedral, constructed of 10,000 panes of  glass and exposed rods and pipes, and featuring 90-foot-high glass doors. The  spire, or campanile, was part of the original plan, but wasn't built because  Schuller's church ran out of money.  </P> <P> "If Philip Johnson hadn't lived to be 84, it would never have been finished.  He's the only person who could have finished it."  </P> <P> As of last September, the church was also $2 million short of being able to pay  for the tower. But a gift in that amount from Newport Beach philanthropists  John and Donna Crean put the building fund over the top, sources said. The  spire is called the Crean Tower.  </P> <P> The rest came from "friends of the ministry," including $200,000 from  philanthropist Armand Hammer and $1 million from Mary Tolerton Hood, widow of  Clifford F. Hood, former president of U.S. Steel Corp. The still unfinished  chapel is named for her.  </P> <P> When people question the cost, Schuller said he replies that it is better to  focus on how long the structure will last and how many people will enjoy it.

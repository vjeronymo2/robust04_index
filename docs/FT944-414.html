			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Exports rise boosts Vauxhall output Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, has increased vehicle production by 5.9 per cent this year helped by a recovery in exports to continental Europe. Exports of the Vauxhall Cavalier (badged Opel Vectra) and Astra - which fell by 62 per cent in 1993 to only 39,932 - have more than doubled this year to 86,358, the company said yesterday. Total exports, including car-derived vans, have risen by 99.5 per cent to 91,535 this year and have more than compensated for a 15.6 per cent drop in output for the domestic market to 168,308. Vauxhall's total vehicle production increased to 259,843 from 245,313 a year ago. LDV, formerly Leyland Daf Vans, is planning to re-enter the main volume markets of continental Europe in 1995, two years after it was rescued by a management buy-out from the financial collapse of the former Daf group. The company, which has maintained a small dealer network in Spain, said it aimed to establish sales and marketing channels in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The company has increased production by 36.4 per cent to 12,509 this year, helped by the recovery of the UK market. The workforce has grown from 960 to more than 1,200 during the year.</p>

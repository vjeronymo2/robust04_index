			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dofasco losses deepen to CDollars 72.6m DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, reduced operating losses in the second quarter, but after special restructuring charges it reported a final loss of CDollars 72.6m (Dollars 60.5m) or 92 cents a share against a loss of CDollars 31.3m or 47 cents a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 549m against CDollars 557m. Before the special items totalling 81 cents a share after tax, the operating net loss equalled 11 cents a share against 31 cents. The domestic market for flat rolled steel remained weak, Dofasco said and imports are running abnormally high. It expected markets to remain competitive with heavy pressure on prices. However, shipments were up sharply from the depressed first quarter, mostly due to offshore exports, and were also higher than a year earlier. The first-half loss was CDollars 96.9m or CDollars 1.23 a share, including the special charges, against a loss of CDollars 26.8m or 40 cents a share a year earli - er. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1bn. Dofasco is completing a broad cost reduction programme. A limestone product unit is being sold to Calic-therm of the Netherlands. The company has dropped common share dividends to conserve cash, but preferred dividends are being paid and cash resources are growing again.</p>

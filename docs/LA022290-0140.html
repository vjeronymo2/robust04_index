			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV POWER PLAN FUELS DEBATE;  </P> <P> REFORM: AN EFFORT TO BEEF UP THE SOVIET PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY SPARKS FEARS OF A  DICTATORSHIP.  </P> <P> Debate is growing in the Soviet Union over President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  proposals to strengthen the presidency, with some warning that the Kremlin may  be creating legal mechanisms that eventually could turn the country into a  dictatorship.  </P> <P> Others argue that the Soviet Union is being transformed so radically and  quickly that it threatens to slide into chaos unless the president is given  broad new powers to control the changes.  </P> <P> New details emerged this week about the extent of the authority Gorbachev hopes  to see vested in the presidency, including the power to declare a state of  emergency in any area even without the approval of regional leaders and the  right to override legislation passed by parliaments in any of the republics.  </P> <P> The proposed constitutional changes to beef up the role of the presidency have  been presented to deputies on a Supreme Soviet committee that views draft  legislation in advance, and the proposals are expected to come soon before the  entire Congress of People's Deputies, or Parliament, which has the power to  enact constitutional amendments.  </P> <P> Gorbachev became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1988,  making him also the national president. It is his post as general secretary of  the Communist Party that gives him his authority, but as the party loses power,  Gorbachev is seeking to dramatically revise that formula.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of State James A. Baker  III earlier this month that the party leadership decided it was necessary to  increase the authority of the office of president if Gorbachev is to be able to  overcome "obstacles" slowing perestroika, his program of economic and social  reform.  </P> <P> A number of officials have said that 1990 is a crucial year for the future of  perestroika but that conservatives are still standing in the way of some  reforms, particularly of the country's economic system, which they fear would  represent too great an ideological break with communism.  </P> <P> In addition, some officials have complained that Gorbachev does not have enough  authority to deal effectively with ethnic unrest that has swept the country at  a dizzying rate.  </P> <P> When he recently signed an order sending troops to the southern republic of  Azerbaijan to stop anti-Armenian pogroms and what the Kremlin described as a  nationalist uprising -- a move many in the nation thought was long overdue --  he had no clear constitutional right to do so.  </P> <P> But some fear that giving the president these vast new powers may be going too  far without the proper checks and balances. Their concern about an abuse of  power is not focused on Gorbachev as much as it is on the leaders who might  follow him, the critics say.  </P> <P> Others believe that the Communist Party leadership, which developed its plan  only earlier this month as part of an effort to restructure the government, is  trying to get it approved by legislators too quickly, without needed debate and  consideration.  </P> <P> "I am rather worried by the undue haste with which this is being pushed  through," said Anatoly Sobchak, a legislator from Leningrad.  </P> <P> "We need to be sure to create a balance of power," Sobchak said in the weekly  Moscow News, published Wednesday. "Otherwise, we face the dangerous possibility  of establishing a dictatorship."  </P> <P> Sergei Alexeyev, chairman of the committee that considers draft laws before  they are submitted to the Supreme Soviet as a whole, disagreed.  </P> <P> He said he supports strengthening the presidency as much as possible both to  help Gorbachev in the face of his anti-reform opponents and to lead to greater  political organization in the country.  </P> <P> The new system approved by the Central Committee this month -- under which the  Communist Party is no longer to be all-powerful, and could share control of the  country with other parties -- may lead to confusion and even disintegration  into nationalist groups unless the president is made the nation's clear leader,  Alexeyev said.  </P> <P> "It is as though our country were in a region threatened by a landslide, and I  would like to get out of this situation as soon as possible," Alexeyev told  Moscow News. "Delay could lead to the collapse of the state and the country.  </P> <P> "Real power must belong to a strong institution which would stand above all the  political parties and political infighting," he said.  </P> <P> But Sergei Stankevich, a member of Alexeyev's committee and prominent liberal  legislator, said the planned changes do not provide enough checks and balances  for the president's power and predicted the proposals will have a difficult  time getting approved unless they are amended.  </P> <P> "The leadership seems to have sent this document out in great haste, apparently  in an effort to get discussions on it under way," Stankevich said in an  interview. "But I definitely cannot support the proposals in their current  form, and I will actively fight against them."  </P> <P> Under the current draft changes, the president initially would be elected by  the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies for a limited term while  preparations are made for the first direct, nationwide elections of a  president. The country's leader would then serve a six-year term, Stankevich  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Tory MPs attack PM over 'back to basics' Mr John Major's handling of the back to basics controversy was under fire yesterday as the issue of the private lives of Conservative MPs threw the government into deeper disarray. MPs on all sides of the Tory party said the prime minister had mishandled the backlash which forced Mr Tim Yeo to resign as an environment minister over an affair which produced an illegitimate daughter. The government's difficulties were compounded by the resignation of Lord Caithness, a senior government spokesman in the Lords, following the apparent suicide of his wife. A post-mortem confirmed that Lady Caithness died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, admitted in a radio interview that the government had been battered by the events of the past week. 'I cannot remember a time since I have been in the House when it has been so difficult,' he added. MPs were split over whether Mr Major should have stood by Mr Yeo to demonstrate his tolerance, or fired him to demonstrate the government's commitment to family values. There was widespread agreement that his decision to do neither has deprived the back to basics initiative of a clear moral framework. One influential rightwing back bencher said the government appeared to have been caught trying to 'duck and weave and fudge issues' instead of offering decisive moral leadership. One cabinet minister applauded the prime minister's stand against a 'witch hunt' for moral nonconformists, but accused him of failing to make clear judgments about the values involved in back to basics. The confusion was also reflected in ministerial statements intended to support Mr Major's weekend assertion that the initiative was mainly concerned with education and crime. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said the campaign 'does not involve hectoring. It does not involve those matters which are more the responsibility of the pulpit than politicians'. But Mr Patten said the government should stand by its commitment to 'family responsibility'. Basic questions, Page 9 Joe Rogaly, Page 16</p>

The government plan represents an effort to stop the wave of small company bankruptcies under the impact of high interest rates, without significantly adding to the budget deficit. The two-part plan includes: Increasing by FFr1bn to FFr26bn the annual threshold for soft loans raised from low-interest deposits with the state savings banks and channelled to industrial development. Creating a loan guarantee fund of FFr300m to be operated by the state-controlled organisation Sofaris, which up to now has only helped underwrite risk capital invested in small businesses.</p>

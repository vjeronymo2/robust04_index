			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Gorbachev fails to settle Kurile islands dispute THE SOVIET UNION and Japan failed last night to reconcile differences dating from 1945. Soviet hopes that Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, on his first trip to Japan, might secure a new source of aid for his ailing economy ended in disappointment in spite of late-night efforts and no fewer than six summit meetings with Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister. A joint communique, signed with ceremony at midnight, did no more than commit the two parties to further talks on the territorial dispute over the four Kurile islands, or Northern Territories, which has plagued relations since the Second World War. Despite repeated efforts, Mr Kaifu failed to win any acknowledgment of Japan's claim to the Soviet-held territory. The main concession was the Soviets' explicit recognition - for the first time since 1956 - of the existence of the territorial issue. The Soviet side also agreed to reduce the number of troops on the islands (the Japanese had asked for their removal), to allow Japanese visits to the islands without visas and start mutual economic activities there. At a press conference early today the Soviet leader said the two sides could feel more confident about a breakthrough in the future, 'but everything is ahead of us.' Mr Gorbachev and Mr Kaifu held six sessions totalling more than 10 hours devoted to the issue, which Mr Gorbachev later described as the toughest he had had for some time. Mr Kaifu, in a press conference, said he hoped that after 45 years of waiting, talks which would lead to a peace treaty would now be accelerated. The territorial dispute has blocked the signing of a Second World War peace treaty. It became apparent even before the communique that the hope invested in the meeting had been excessively optimistic. The Soviet desperation for aid and technological help bred an expectation that a 'sale' of the islands might yield at least Dollars 20bn. On the Japanese side, hopes were fanned by politicians who wished to make their mark on history with a settlement. Domestic constraints on Mr Gorbachev, including military opposition to concessions, did not allow him to go as far as many thought he might. The Soviet leader leaves today for a one-day visit to South Korea and talks with President Roh Tae Woo. Soviet strikes, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 22</p>

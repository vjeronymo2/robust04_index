			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dressing down for Brits Sir, Reading your article about dress codes around the world (Fashion, February 19/20), I thought it ridiculous that British shoppers in Bond Street or Knightsbridge know that if they are not to be patronised or dismissed by up-market sales assistants, they must dress up in smart, fashionable clothes which excite the sales assistant's label-conscious envy. What a sad state of affairs when you have to dress to impress the people who work in the store where you have chosen to do your shopping] Far from Brits knowing what works, it seems to me that these up-market shoppers are pathetically insecure and have allowed themselves to be coerced into pandering to a bunch of condescending and snobbish shop girls. These people are employees who you are paying to serve your needs] Now I understand more clearly why the sun finally set on the British Empire. Cynthia House-Peters, 30551 Hunt Club Drive, San Juan Capistrano, California 92675-1910, US</p>

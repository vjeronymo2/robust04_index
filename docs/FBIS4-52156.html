			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Sunday [8 May] admitted his responsibility for the  resignation of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano over his  controversial remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a  fabrication.    After he replaced Nagano with Hiroshi Nakai of the  Democratic  Socialist Party, Hata told reporters, "As a matter of fact, I am  responsible (for his resignation) as the person who appointed  him (as justice minister)." However, he added that he would  like to show his responsibility by his own actions and efforts  in preventing a war.    Opposition parties are reportedly ready to question his  responsibility over Nagano's remarks at Diet deliberations which  start Monday.    Hata said he anticipated such Diet deliberations on his  responsibility, but added, "It is not bad to discuss these  matters."    The premier said it is not fruitless if Diet deliberations  will help unify a historic view of the Japanese people.    The prime minister also said he expects tough Diet going  because his cabinet started as a minority government. He cited  an early Diet passage of the government-proposed 1994 draft  budget as the government's responsibility in the international  community, considering Japan's current status in the world.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 May (AFP) -- Opposition  presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the  Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) today warned President  Joaquin Balaguer that the country faces serious "political,  economic, and moral consequences" if the post-electoral conflict  is not resolved promptly.    In a letter sent to Balaguer around midnight yesterday and  distributed to the media today, Pena Gomez urged Balaguer "to  adopt timely measures, in view of the delicate situation, to  ensure a normal solution of the electoral crisis."    According to government sources, the letter was read to  Balaguer early today and stated that "should the current  conflict not be resolved in due time, it will inflict serious  economic, political, and moral damage on the Dominican Republic."    Pena Gomez faced Balaguer, an 87-year-old seeking reelection  to a seventh term, in the 16 August [month as received] general  elections, which produced a serious crisis.    Pena Gomez contested the elections hours after the voting  concluded and claimed that a "scandalous fraud" had taken place  through various forms of information manipulation that prevented  "200,000 citizens from voting because they were reportedly  replaced by a similar number of official party followers."    In his letter, Pena Gomez told Balaguer that "we are  convinced that you will, in view of this delicate situation,  adopt timely measures to ensure a normal solution of the current  electoral crisis."    Pena Gomez also denounced the refusal of most magistrates of  the Central Electoral Board (JCE) to give the PRD the voter list  sent to the electoral boards. This list was reportedly  distorted at the JCE computer center.    As of today, the JCE has not yet proclaimed a winner in the  elections, but Balaguer is leading Pena Gomez by 1.01 percent  with 98 percent of the votes counted.    Pena Gomez told the media that he will reject a vote recount  that the JCE will begin tomorrow if the voter list is not  produced. The JCE refused to produce the votes list that the  opposition is demanding. According to the PRD, this list  reflects the fraud committed by Balaguer's followers.</p>

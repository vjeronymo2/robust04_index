			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> K.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned how, where to, and when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent fuel and casks will go? How does the decommissioning of NUHOMS affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reactor decommissioning plan if no repository is sited and the pool must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain open? Another commenter expressed concern that after the operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility has been decommissioned, the spent fuel pool may not be available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in recovery of a breached DSC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission determined in the Waste Confidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions that sufficient repository capacity will be available, in the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter of the 21st century, to accept spent fuel that is already in storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or that will be generated during the lifetime of the reactor licensed by NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission determined that spent fuel can be safely stored at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactors until it is disposed. The bases for these determinations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensively discussed in the Waste Confidence decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (54 FR 39765; September 28, 1989 and 49 FR 34658; August 31, 1984) and remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To operate the dry spent fuel storage area under the provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general license, a license to possess or operate a nuclear power reactor under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 50 is required. If the reactors were decommissioned and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license terminated, and if the spent fuel were to remain on site, a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license issued under 10 CFR 72.40 would be required. At the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for a specific license and before the Part 50 license was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated, the licensee would have to address the subject of how the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be repackaged for shipment to an MRS or repository. (None of the casks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now listed in 10 CFR 72.214 are approved for transportation). Decommissioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and termination of a Part 50 license for a given reactor site must take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account the proper disposal of any spent fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L. A number of positive and negative comments were received about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of 10 CFR 72.48 or Item 9 of the Certificate of Compliance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters questioned the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 72.48 to Certificate of Compliance holders for use by a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee. Some commenters believe that this regulation is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriately applied to general licensees and cask vendors. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters believe that the regulation was intended to apply to site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.40 only. One commenter cited the parallel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of 10 CFR 50.59 to 10 CFR Part 50 licensees. Any changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance and the supporting SAR and SER need public input  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the rulemaking process. Who would make the decisions in using the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``unreviewed safety questions,'' ``significant increase,'' and ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impact''? Other commenters liked this addition, stating that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-safety-significant changes can be made in a timely and cost effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner. Several commenters supported the incorporation of item number 9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (in 72.48 type language) in the draft Certificate of Compliance. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter wanted similar provisions made for general license holders with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping requirements applicable to the general license rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate holder. Changes requiring an amendment to the certificate should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be initiated by the certificate holder only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC will not allow changes in the Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance under 10 CFR 72.48. However, the general licensee may make changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the SAR under 10 CFR 72.48, unless it involves an unreviewed safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unreviewed environmental impact. The general licensee must make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations, in the first instance, that are necessary for application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 72.48. The licensee must also retain its evaluations on its records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (which are subject to NRC review).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supporting this application of 10 CFR 72.48 to the general license are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the words of 10 CFR 72.48(a)(1) which provides as follows: ``The holder of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license issued under this part may: (i) Make changes in the ISFSI *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the Safety Analysis Report, *&blank;*&blank;* (iii) *&blank;*&blank;* without prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission approval, unless the proposed change, test or experiment involves a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in the license conditions incorporated in the license, an unreviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant unreviewed environmental impact.'' Also supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation is 10 CFR 72.210 which provides as follows: ``A general license  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is hereby issued for the storage of spent fuel in an independent spent fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage installation at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operate nuclear power reactors under Part 50 of this chapter.'' The NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff is considering a rulemaking to amend NRC regulations to explicitly state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that 10 CFR 72.48 applies to general licensees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the CFR is silent on how a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vendor can change a cask SAR and certificate after the final rule. It should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made clear for the vendor that this cask SAR (CSAR) is generic for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States sites. All seismic, control component, distance, changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length and weight, changes in transfer devices, etc., need to be clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in the proposed rulemaking for the cask and the CSAR before public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment. Who would be liable if a utility requested the vendor to change a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified cask design?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

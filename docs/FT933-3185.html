			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Appellation was much too quaint Sir, Just a small footnote to Julian Ozanne's article (''We're making history here'', September 11) from Jerusalem on the recent peace agreement: if one hails from Basildon and works for Barclays Bank one is a foreign exchange (or Forex) dealer. However, if one does the same job, on perhaps a smaller scale, in East Jerusalem one is a money changer. I do not think that someone performing the same task in South Kensington or Oxford Street would merit that quaint appellation. Spare us the vague Biblical references and bogus Orientalism. That way, everyone may understand each other better, eventually. Baer Pettit, 24 Devonia Road, London N1 8JH</p>

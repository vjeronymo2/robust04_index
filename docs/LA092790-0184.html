			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: SHIMMY, GRIND THE NIGHT AWAY AT EL MEXI-ROCK CAFE  </P> <P> Down deep in South County, where 24-hour grocery stores and an occasional  country-Western bar supply the main night life, there's a place where people  can shake, shimmy, bump or grind until the wee hours of the morning.  </P> <P> By day, El Mexi-Rock Cafe in Mission Viejo is just another pastel-colored  medium-priced Mexican restaurant.  </P> <P> But when 9 p.m. rolls around, the DJ starts the speakers thumping and the floor  is soon packed with pumping, gyrating bodies.  </P> <P> Music ranges from the most overplayed dance hits to heavy soul, R &amp; B and  rap, with an occasional heavy-metal anthem thrown in.  </P> <P> The music brings in a diverse but young crowd.  </P> <P> Long-haired hard-rockers rub shoulders with close-shaved hip-hoppers.  </P> <P> Dressed-to-kill dancers head out on the dance floor with steps that look as if  they have been rehearsed for hours in front of the bathroom mirror.  </P> <P> There's a rather small, cramped dance floor and the bar makes full use of its  excellent sound system. The only way to have an intimate conversation is out in  the parking lot.  </P> <P> El Mexi-Rock Cafe is equipped with neon lights, modern furniture and yuppified  Mexican touches of tile floors and doorway arches.  </P> <P> Food is also offered, but most patrons seem to take advantage of the cheap  drink menu instead.  </P> <P> After a cover charge of $3 (waved if you come before 10 p.m., or if you happen  to be female on Wednesdays, Ladies Night), draft beer and mixed drinks are only  a buck.  </P> <P> The cafe also has a long happy hour from 3 to 9 p.m. and is one of the few  clubs around that still offers discount drinks on the weekends.  </P> <P> And if that isn't enough, once a week women are treated to a male strip show  and men can witness a female bathing suit contest.  </P> <P> Who said there's nothing to do in South Orange County?  </P> <P>  El Mexi-Rock Cafe, 28411 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. Open 3 p.m. to 2  a.m. Monday through Saturday. (714) 364-6674.  </P> <P> CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

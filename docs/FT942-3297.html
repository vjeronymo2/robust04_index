			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Symonds Eng Symonds Engineering cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 456,000 to Pounds 285,000 in the year to end-March after providing for exceptional items of Pounds 200,000, against Pounds 115,000. After missing the last interim and final dividends, the precision engineer declared a final of 0.25p - last year's interim was 0.15p. Mr Rod Ackrill, chairman, said the result was partly due to a return to profitable trading in the second half and to restructuring. The exceptional item relates to a recently completed redundancy programme. Turnover showed a small increase from Pounds 4.38m to Pounds 4.43m and despite the loss there was a net cash inflow from operating activities. Losses per share were 2.9p (4.6p).</p>

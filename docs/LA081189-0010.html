			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROPS OF MISTRUST CLOUD MALATHION SPRAY  </P> <P> The Medfly, that scourge of California farmers, is back. The trapping of a few  specimens of the pesky insect in the Elysian Park, Echo Park and Silver Lake  areas since late July has led to an increasingly familiar chain of events: The  declaration by the governor of a state of emergency, aerial spraying of the  pesticide malathion over populated areas, and concern by residents of the  affected communities about the possible health effects of the chemical.  </P> <P> As in the past, health and agricultural officials quickly attempted to reassure  residents living in the sprayed zones that malathion poses no danger. Thousands  of leaflets were distributed, declaring that the pesticide is "considered one  of the safest insecticides in use today" and that "at this extreme low dose,  pregnant women have no cause for concern."  </P> <P> These days, it seems that there is a strong inverse correlation between the  certitude with which the experts state that a potentially toxic chemical is  safe and the degree to which the public feels reassured. One reason is that the  experts sometimes turn out to be wrong. Over the years, a long list has  accumulated of pesticides and other chemicals that we once thought were safe  and now know are dangerous, such as DDT.  </P> <P> In the case of malathion, officials have consistently strained their  credibility by continuing to overstate the case for the pesticide's safety. In  fact, serious investigation of malathion's ability to cause genetic damage has  been under way for only about 10 to 15 years, and the results so far do not at  all exonerate the chemical. Back in 1976, a comprehensive survey of the  scientific literature by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and  Health concluded that "information on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials  of malathion is very scanty" and urged that studies of these effects "be  initiated as soon as possible."  </P> <P> Since that time, study after study has shown that malathion is capable of  causing a variety of types of genetic damage in both human and animal cells.  For example, researchers at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo found  that malathion, which is generally considered one of the weaker of its class of  insecticides, was one of the most potent in causing disruption of the cycle of  dividing cells.  </P> <P> These findings have given rise to concern that pregnant women exposed to  malathion might be at higher risk for miscarriages or for giving birth to  malformed infants. Health and agricultural officials have long argued that the  doses of malathion received from aerial spraying are too low to cause these  problems. However, an epidemiological study completed two years ago of San  Francisco Bay Area residents sprayed with malathion during the 1981-1982  "Medfly crisis," has left open the possibility that malathion could cause birth  defects.  </P> <P> The study was conducted jointly by the California Department of Health Services  and the Department of Preventive Medicine at the USC and compared the outcomes  of the pregnancies of women who had lived in the spray zones with those who had  not. Epidemiological studies are notoriously insensitive to relatively small  effects and are easily biased by other factors that can affect the analysis.  Nevertheless, after carefully controlling for these errors, the researchers  found a positive correlation between malathion exposure and stillbirths and a  significant correlation between exposure and defects of the gastrointestinal  tract in the newborn children.  </P> <P> The author of the study concluded, however, that although the results were  "suggestive" of an association with malathion exposure, it was "unlikely" that  malathion was the cause, in part because the fetal gastrointestinal system was  already formed by the time the exposure occurred. He may well be right. On the  other hand, far from giving malathion a clean bill of health, the study only  raises more questions about the safety of the pesticide -- questions that leave  us far from the certitude expressed in the public reports of health and  agricultural officials.  </P> <P> By making exaggerated claims for malathion's safety and by misrepresenting the  scientific evidence, our officials contribute heavily to the clouds of mistrust  and anger that trail the helicopters each time they take to the air.  </P></p>

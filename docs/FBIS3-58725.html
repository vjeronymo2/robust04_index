			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Riddell: "Falling Over To Help Russia"] </F>   [Text] A senior American official was asked recently why  President Clinton's policy towards Europe appeared so confused.  He replied that the administration had been undecided between a  Russian-centred and a German-centred approach. Should  Washington be more concerned about a revival of Russian  nationalism or about binding Germany and Central Europe into  West Europe? For the moment, Western fears about Russia have  predominated.    The American-inspired Partnership for Peace, to be adopted  by  NATO leaders at their summit in Brussels, fudges the question of  enlarging NATO to include Central European countries previously  in the Warsaw Pact. The American priority is not to do anything  which might undermine Boris Yeltsin, or which he says might  undermine him. But the West could put at risk the gains from its  victory in the Cold War. The liberation of the former Soviet  satellites is the one big foreign policy success of the past  decade. But NATO is now implicitly accepting that Moscow can  retain a veto over the security arrangements not just of former  Soviet republics but also of indisputably European states such  as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (generally  known as the Visegrad Four).    President Clinton naturally denies any such intention. The  President's speech in Brussels last night was full of  reassurances that Europe, and its security, remains central to  America's interests. But this is largely public relations  blather to ensure that Mr Clinton's first visit to Europe as  President is seen as a success. The leaders of the Visegrad  countries have acquiesced in Partnership for Peace, but they  have barely disguised their frustration.    The current Western caution is in marked contrast with the  formation of NATO in 1948-49. The founders of the Atlantic  alliance were acutely aware of the Soviet threat to West Europe  and bold in resisting it. The spread of communism was contained  and peace assured. Similarly, after the Berlin Wall came down  in November 1989, the Bush administration showed greater  negotiating skill than has generally been recognised. It  sponsored the talks on the future of Germany which secured the  support of the then Soviet Union for unification. America was  also firm in resisting initial Soviet opposition to a united  Germany being in NATO.    In both cases, there was a balance between recognising  Moscow's power and advancing the interests of Americas allies.  That balance is now absent. The Russia lobby is in the  ascendant, particularly in the form of Strobe Talbott, Deputy  Secretary of State designate and a close friend of Mr Clinton.  As Robert Zoellick, architect of the Bush team's European  initiatives, has argued, "there has been no strong  counterbalancing force making the case for a European policy  separate from Washington's Russian calculations."    Warren Christopher and Tony Lake, the White House national  security adviser, initially favoured expanding NATO's  membership. But in talks last October, just after the  suppression of the Russian parliamentary opposition, Mr Talbott  successfully argued against enlargement. This, he feared, would  draw a line across Europe and might strengthen nationalist  forces and critics of reform within Russia. Apart from Germany,  other NATO members were cautious. Douglas Hurd expressed British  worries to Mr Christopher in late September. The broad policy  was therefore set before the Russian elections a month ago  though Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's success has intensified the  West's predicament. But the American approach risks a  repetition of its familiar error of concentrating too much on an  individual leader, whether Mikhail Gorbachev or, now, Mr Yeltsin.    No one, however, is urging immediate expansion. NATO only  works as an integrated military alliance and the armed forces of  former Warsaw Pact countries are in no position to join yet.  There has to be a transitional period of growing co-operation,  not least while these forces show they are under proper  democratic control. Britain is also wary of extending security  guarantees unless NATO is willing to implement them.    The flaw in Partnership for Peace is that it risks creating  a  vacuum by failing to lay down a timetable and guidelines for  membership. It offers co-operation in planning, training and  exercises to almost anyone interested, including both Russia and  Ukraine, but it makes no commitments about who might be allowed  to join NATO and when. In Mr Christopher's slippery phrase,  candidates for membership are being given "an opportunity to  self- differentiate." But the invitation is so broad as to be  largely meaningless, like the all-embracing and, in practice,  ineffective Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.    NATO will never be an open-ended club. The main new entrants  for the foreseeable future are likely to be the Visegrad Four  countries. Offering them explicit hope of membership, in  parallel with their closer links with the European Union, would  not only allay some of their security fears but should also  strengthen the hand of internal pressures in favour of democracy  and reform. That could be linked to a formal agreement to  reassure Russia that it is not being isolated by a hostile West.    The danger at present is that insecurity and instability  will  be increased, not reduced. The proposed policy may not only  make no difference to events within Russia--no Western  initiatives really ever have--but it could also, yet again, let  down the West's friends in Central Europe. A stable Germany and  Central Europe are an attainable goal for America and its NATO  allies. A democratic and free-market Russia is a dream beyond  our influence. In seeking the latter NATO could jeopardise the  former.</p>

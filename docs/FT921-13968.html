			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: IBM UK's chief executive quits SIR ANTHONY CLEAVER has resigned unexpectedly as chief executive of International Business Machines' UK subsidiary. He retains the role of chairman. His successor as chief executive and UK representative on IBM's European management board is Mr Nick Temple, general manager of IBM UK since January 1991. Sir Anthony, who is 53, has worked for IBM since 1962. He succeeded Sir Edwin Nixon as chief executive in 1986 and became chairman in 1990. Mr Temple, 44, has been with IBM since 1965 and has held a variety of senior posts including European vice president with responsibility for systems and products, and general manager, European central unit, where he was involved in developing IBM's trade with the eastern bloc. For the past year Mr Temple has been developing and implementing a radical reorganisation within IBM UK designed to improve profitability and competitiveness which has led to the loss of some 2,500 jobs. His appointment is seen as reflecting IBM's need to take drastic measures to restructure the company in the face of depressed sales and declining profitability. IBM UK's figures will not be published for some weeks but, reflecting the high cost of restructuring, are expected to be unattractive. IBM results - Intl Companies</p>

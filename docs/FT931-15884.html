			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Iraqi missiles on the move as deadline passes THE THREAT of immediate military action against Iraq receded last night as the US announced further movement of Iraqi aircraft and missiles away from the exclusion zone in the country's south. Reports from the White House and the Pentagon came as the 48-hour ultimatum issued by the US, Britain and France to Iraq to withdraw its missiles expired. Earlier, Iraq had insisted it had no intention of backing down and that the deployment of air defences was a sovereign matter. Mr Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, said that if attacked Iraq would respond in kind. US officials were careful to state that it was still impossible to determine if Iraq was in compliance with the terms of the ultimatum. But they said Iraqi aircraft had been flown out of one base close to the no-fly zone while missile batteries were no longer deployed in a 'potentially hostile pattern.' General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, noted 'lots of movement' of missiles, but did not reveal their new whereabouts, possibly because heavy cloud cover in the region has made aerial reconnaissance difficult. He also implied any action in Iraq would not be immediately taken. 'There has been a good deal of movement involving these missiles but we are still in the process of determining whether Iraq is in compliance with the terms of the coalition demarche (demand),' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement just before the 5.30 pm Washington time (22.30 GMT) deadline. 'We continue to keep the situation in Iraq under close scrutiny.' President George Bush had conferred earlier with his national security advisers, including General Powell, and been briefed at the CIA. President-elect Bill Clinton again reaffirmed his support for Mr Bush's stance, saying there was 'no daylight' between their views. Military experts had considered the most likely targets for any 'surgical' allied strike would be fixed military installations such as air bases, communications centres and missile sites. These would probably include targets north of the 32nd parallel. The apparent Iraqi withdrawals came after the United Nations had been told by Baghdad that none of its aircraft, including those carrying teams of inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction, could land. A UN team was due to leave Bahrain for Bagh-dad this weekend. The Iraqi news agency said the cabinet had applauded the decision by the country's political leadership 'to confront the new, blatant American aggression which is doomed to failure thanks to the unity and steadfastness of our people and armed forces under our blessed leader Saddam Hussein'. Iraq was thought to have deployed between three and five batteries of Soviet-made SA-2 and SA-3 anti-aircraft missiles in the east of the no-fly zone. At first the movement of these missiles was consistent with standard practice and was not necessarily a response to the ultimatum. The missile systems can be dismantled, transported to another prepared site and re-assembled within a matter of hours. But later the US appeared to conclude they had been moved to non-aggressive positions. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said it was clear Mr Saddam had to remove the missiles and to stop infringing the no-fly zone. An Iraqi Mig-25 aircraft was shot down by a US fighter on December 27 over the exclusion zone and soon afterwards it was reported that the batteries of Iraqi Sam-2 and Sam-3 missiles had been moved south of the 32nd parallel. The no-fly zone was imposed at the end of August to protect the Shia population against further attacks by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. US, British and French aircraft were moved to Saudi Arabia to supplement the American carrier-based forces operating in the Gulf. Allied strength now amounts to more than 200 combat aircraft, supported by airborne radar systems and electronic jamming equipment.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIDEN DOUBLES GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE OF COCAINE USERS;  </P> <P> ADDICTS: KEY DEMOCRAT CITES A NEW STUDY THAT PUTS THE NUMBER AT 2.2 MILLION  AMERICANS. BUSH'S DRUG POLICY CZAR ANGRILY CHALLENGES THE FIGURE.  </P> <P> Charging that the Bush Administration has underestimated the extent of the  nation's drug problem, a key Democratic senator Thursday unveiled a new staff  study estimating that 2.2 million Americans are frequent users of cocaine.  </P> <P> The figure, more than twice the number cited in the most recent government  report, incorporates new estimates of drug use among criminals and the  homeless, who are not included in an authoritative household survey by the  National Institute on Drug Abuse.  </P> <P> If accurate, the conclusion would mean that about one in 100 Americans uses  cocaine at least once a week.  </P> <P> "These findings should give pause to us all," said Senate Judiciary Committee  Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said the new report on "hard-core addicts"  raises new questions about an Administration strategy based on more sanguine  estimates.  </P> <P> But William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug Control  Policy, angrily retorted that Biden ought to "do his homework." A top aide  contended that the Administration already has taken into account the fact that  significant sectors of society were overlooked in the previous study.  </P> <P> "This is a cheap shot," said David Tell, Bennett's deputy chief of staff. Tell  charged that Biden had "cooked up" the report in a bid to "resuscitate" support  for his own drug strategy. Biden's plan would add nearly 40% more money to a  $10.6-billion Administration package.  </P> <P> With the contending plans soon to come before Congress, the harsh exchange  appears to mark the onset of a new political drug war, with Biden leading an  effort to put a Democratic stamp on the electorally potent issue.  </P> <P> In his opening salvo at a news conference Thursday, Biden said the findings of  his report demonstrate the need for spending on drug treatment and prison  construction far beyond what the Administration has endorsed.  </P> <P> The senator charged that the nation "cannot afford" to continue with an  Administration policy that leaves "addicts roving the streets of our cities and  towns, neither in treatment or in prison, wreaking havoc on our neighborhoods  and on themselves."  </P> <P> Bennett has warned that the number of cocaine addicts is increasing even while  the overall number of drug users declines. But in recent appearances, both he  and President Bush have emphasized more positive signs, saying they believe the  United States is beginning to succeed in its anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> Aides to Bennett questioned some of the methodology used by the Senate staff in  developing the new estimate of American cocaine addiction and said the small  number of individuals sampled made it impossible to know if the figure is  accurate.  </P> <P> In measuring the extent of the nation's drug problem, they said, Bennett's  office has given more credence to a broader survey by the National Institute on  Drug Abuse showing that some 4 million Americans use illegal drugs more than  200 times a year.  </P> <P> The new congressional study was drafted for Biden by staff members of the  Senate Judiciary Committee and was not endorsed by any other panel member.  </P> <P> It used as a starting point the 1988 household survey by the institute, which  put the best estimate of weekly cocaine users in the United States at 862,000.  But in adding projections based on studies of criminals, the homeless and  others, it concluded that more than 1.7 million frequent cocaine addicts likely  had been overlooked.  </P> <P> Among those the study said had not previously been included in government  assessments were 1,530,000 people arrested for criminal offenses, 200,000 in  prisons, hospitals or drug treatment facilities and about 55,000 homeless  people.  </P> <P> The study sought also to provide estimates of cocaine addiction by state and  identified Washington, D.C., as the home of the largest number of frequent  cocaine users per capita, with 32.9 such users per 1,000 population.  California, with an estimated per capita rate of 11.8 per 1,000, ranked fifth  among states, behind New York, Nevada, Arizona and Illinois.  </P> <P> In appealing for additional anti-drug spending Thursday, Biden repeatedly  labeled these once-a-week users as "hard-core addicts." But Mark A. R. Kleiman,  a Harvard University professor who helped to oversee the project, described  them only as frequent cocaine users and said: "I would not use the phrase  hard-core addict."  </P> <P> Those who expressed skepticism about the new study focused most often on its  conclusions about frequent drug use among people arrested, who are reported to  represent by far America's largest segment of weekly cocaine users.  </P> <P> The conclusions were based on the national Drug Use Forecast system, which  collects data from 20 cities where some of those arrested are tested to  determine if they had used drugs in the last 72 hours.  </P> <P> The study assumed that 80% of those arrestees who tested positive for drugs  were likely to be weekly users of cocaine. Dr. Edgar Adams, chief of  epidemiology at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said that assumption "may  be too high."  </P></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Southerners rejoice at move to end union: The four-year merger was seen to favour the president's family After four years playing second fiddle to the united Yemen government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the south Yemenis, led by Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, have now publicly thrown down the gauntlet. On Saturday night they announced their secession from Yemen, and the formation of a five-man presidential council, which elected Mr al-Beidh president. In Aden, the south Yemen capital, celebrations went on all night, even though a missile fired by the north landed near Khormaksar airport and fighting continued around the key southern airbase at Al-Anad, 60km north of Aden. The news brought a predictably vitriolic response from President Saleh, but southern opinion and the army seem to be solidly behind Mr al-Beidh, his deputy, Mr Saleh Salem Mohammed, and the Yemen Socialist party (YSP) leadership. The 2.5m-3m people in southern Yemen, including many northerners who have settled in Aden, are united in their intense dislike of a northern regime based on and favouring the president's family and relatives, and the Ahmar clan within the Hashed tribal confederation to which the president belongs. This oligarchy, they say, has abused its power and diverted the south's oil revenue away from the south's economic development to satisfy the priorities of 10m northerners. 'If a referendum were to be held tomorrow in the eastern and southern governorates (of southern Yemen), there would be a clear majority in favour of south Yemen reverting to its former statehood,' Mr al-Beidh told the Dubai daily Gulf News in March. The divisions between north and south were more than simple ideology or tribal rivalry. In May 1990, when the north and south formally united, their two separate systems of government were profoundly incompatible. The southern one was based on 20 years of hardline Marxist control which emphasised a strong central authority. By contrast, the northern central government has never fully existed beyond Sanaa and two other cities, Hodeida and Taiz. Elsewhere, tribal authority imposes itself on and competes with the central government in Sanaa. There is widespread resentment in the south at the way the Saleh presidency lined up with Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, without consulting southern members of the government. As a result of Saudi antagonism, up to a million northern Yemenis had to leave Saudi Arabia, dislocating the entire Yemeni economy through the loss of remittances and the unwanted arrival in the south of several thousand northerners seeking work. The progressive devaluation of the north Yemeni rial - 84 per cent since May 1990 - and the wide difference between the official rate, YR12 to the dollar compared with the free-market rate of YR75, have dragged the southern dinar down with it. The present cohesion in the south has depended to a large extent on the durability of the oral pact earlier this year between the army and the YSP leadership. According to this agreement, the army high command, most of which comes from Dhala, Radfan, amd Yafai, the mountainous areas to the north of Aden, agreed to support the political leaders' bid for secession providing the latter stopped flirting with the idea of secession for the Hadramawt, the eastern oil-producing part of south Yemen. Most of the top leaders of the YSP come from the Hadramawt. They include Mr al-Beidh, the erstwhile prime minister, Mr Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas, the former oil minister, and south Yemen chief-of-staff Saleh Abu Bakr Bin Hussainoun, as well as the governor of Aden, Mr Salem Nasser Al-Siyali, who has a Hadrami father and a Yafite mother. All the signs are that this pact is holding up, thanks partly to the stiff resistance being put up by the army at al-Anad and the reciprocal support it was getting from the YSP leadership. The south's Marxist period from 1970 to 1990 rarely involved more than the political leadership and its acolytes in the internal security apparatus. The leadership also utilised the system handed to it by the Soviet Union and used it to remain in power. It was more a personal desire for power than a power based on ideology. The south also has a wide degree of support from south Yemenis overseas, as well as a degree of tacit sympathy from some of its neighbours. In Jeddah, the Bugshan, Binladin, and Bin Mahfouz families, all important figures in Saudi corporate and financial life, come from the Hadramawt. Saudi Arabia was never entirely happy with a united Yemen on its southern border, part of which, in the areas around Najran, Gizan, and a large swathe of the coastal Tihama plain, was conquered by the Saudis in the early 1930s  -a legacy which has not been forgotten by north Yemenis. Economic plans on the south's drawing board include the establishment in Aden of a free zone, upgrading Aden's refinery, modernising the port, and exploiting the Hadramawt's oil resources. Aden was reported to have been the preferred terminal in a US-backed scheme for vapourised natural gas to be pumped from north Yemen's gas fields of the Marib/Jawf area. If the south is to survive, it will need a sustained period of political and economic stability, and an economy based this time on a free-market rather than a Marxist system. With the north bent on its military destruction, stability seems a long way off, but without it the south will not get the foreign investments it must have.</p>

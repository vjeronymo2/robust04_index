			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Sprint makes the running in challenging telecoms policy: A company that hopes to provide domestic and international services THIS MONTH'S application by Sprint, the US telecommunication carrier, for a licence to provide telecommunication services in the UK is a challenge to British government policy. The question is whether an era of cheap and competitive transatlantic communications is about to dawn - or whether cartel practices will continue. Since the government abolished the British Telecom/Mercury Communications duopoly last year Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, has been claiming that the UK telecommunications market is the most liberal in the world. In theory, it is open to competition. But in practice, an exception has been made for international communications. Last year's white paper said: 'While the duopoly policy in respect of new international operators should be ended, (the government) is unlikely to grant new international operating licences in the short term.' Sprint's application tests this policy because it has asked to be allowed to provide domestic and international services. Mr Vincent Gargaro, a director of Sprint International UK, argues that customers are not interested in buying long-distance domestic services from one company if they have to use another operator for international calls. Sprint is already the third-largest long-distance operator in the US. It aims to become the third operator in the long-distance market from the UK and wants to link its networks in the two countries. The government is wary about competition for international calls. Prices have been kept artificially high by cartel practices, but while it might be thought that a government committed to free-market principles would want to encourage competitors to drive prices down, it is more afraid that foreign monopolists might take advantage of an open market without home companies having reciprocal access abroad. It is not only concerned about the loss to the UK of lucrative earnings  - BT made Pounds 121m in operating profits on calls between the US and the UK alone in 1987-88. It also fears the practice of a foreign monopolist playing off one UK operator against another to get the best deal for calls between the two countries. BT and Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, have persuaded the government that such concerns apply not only to monopolies from other countries, but even to companies from the US, where there is much competition. They point out that US regulations automatically place a heavier regulatory burden on non-US companies. Such regulatory considerations held up C&amp;W's planned Dollars 174m acquisition of TRT/FTC, the fourth-largest US long-distance operator, last year. But, contrary to appearances, C&amp;W eventually pulled out of the deal for commercial rather than regulatory reasons. Moreover, last month the Federal Communications Commission, the US regulatory body, proposed relaxing the regulatory burden on foreign companies. Sprint believes that the UK should therefore agree to its licence application and is keeping the FCC informed. The DTI's decision will not only affect Sprint. It will set a precedent for the whole industry. Telecommunication operators are in the process of restructuring themselves from national monopolies into globally competitive groups, with the Atlantic route one of the main battlegrounds. AT&amp;T, the largest US carrier, has shown an interest in the UK market. Meanwhile, BT has been trying to establish a global network via its US-based Syncordia subsidiary. New types of competitor are emerging. Resellers such as US-based World Communications are buying up cable capacity in bulk and selling it on to customers at a discount. Private satellite groups such as Pan American Satellite and Orion are preparing competitive offerings. Orion financing, Page 21</p>

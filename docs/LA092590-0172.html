			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. HOLDS KEYS TO IRAQI'S BLACK LIMO  </P> <P> Like a father laying down the law to his teen-age son, the U.S. government says  that as long as Iraq occupies Kuwait, Saddam Hussein can't use the car.  </P> <P> The Iraqi president's black, bomb-proof, $300,000 limousine is resting on its  bulletproof tires at a repair shop in the suburb of Livonia, where the Cadillac  was sent to have its engine rebuilt, the Customs Service said.  </P> <P> It will be held there under authority of President Bush's executive order  freezing Iraqi assets in the United States.  </P> <P> "We have reason to believe that this car might have been used by Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein," said Donald Watson, a Customs official in Chicago.  "In any case, he's not going to get it back."  </P> <P> The Customs Service titled its news release on the car, "Is Saddam Hussein  Walking?"  </P> <P> The Cadillac has bomb-proof armor and tear gas dispensers.  </P></p>

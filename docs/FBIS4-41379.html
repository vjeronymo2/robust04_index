			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb, by </F> Joanna Boczkowska-Crettenand; place and date not given: "Today  Presidential Elections in Belarus; A Great Unknown"]    [Text] [Boczkowska-Cretenand] The first free presidential  elections will be held in Belarus on 23 June. Can one predict  the preference of the people?    [Hryb] Today it is still difficult to predict which one of  the six candidates will be elected. The candidates represent  various political options -- from the extreme left to the  extreme right; discussions are under way. However, the results  are a great unknown.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] A few months ago you introduced a new  Constitution in Belarus. How broad will the sphere of powers of  the new president be?    [Hryb] We did introduce the Constitution; however, one  cannot say that it is new. Before that there was a constitution  of the Belarusian Soviet Republic. If one speaks about a new  Constitution, one assumes that there used to be an old one;  however, since March we have had the first sovereign  Constitution of Belarus. The president will not be new, either.  He will have superior representative and executive powers. In  other words, it will be a strong presidential authority. He  will be elected by the entire nation.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] If the people elect a president that  comes from a communist party, what will be the political and  economic consequences of this?    [Hryb] It is hard to tell; however, I think that this will  cause serious problems.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] What kinds of problems?    [Hryb] In relations with the leaders of Eastern and Western  Europe, as well as the United States.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Can it impede the economic reforms as  well?    [Hryb] It is possible in a way; however, the presidential  candidate from the communist party claims that his election will  not affect the continuation of economic reforms.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Are you an advocate of a monetary  union with Russia?    [Hryb] I do not deny that there is a possibility of  introducing such a union, based on the experiences of the  European Union, which has been discussing this problem for some  time now. A monetary union may give many economic advantages.  However, this issue should still be analyzed. My country does  not have an answer to this question yet. It is still too early.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Does Belarus have legislation  encouraging foreign investments?    [Hryb] Yes, it does. These are regulations, enacted in the  autumn of last year, which concern ownership rights, the law on  enterprises, on foreign investments and investors. It is a  whole legislative packet that favors investments. The  advantageous conditions are known to Polish businessmen  investing their capital in Belarus. They are under protection,  and they are making profits.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] You said in Crans Montana that the  West is imposing restrictive barriers on Belarussian flax. Do  you think that the West might open its markets more broadly for  products from Eastern Europe?    [Hryb] I think that access to the markets in Europe should  be free and based on competition. Just like Poles, we would  also like to have a free market. Why are the countries of rich  Europe afraid of our poor market, our goods, and our quality?    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] How do you perceive the problem of  security in our part of Europe?    [Hryb] I believe the security problems should be resolved by  strengthening independence. We should be sovereign and maintain  good relations with our neighbors. The "Partnership for Peace"  does not guarantee security to its members.    [Boczkowska-Cretenand] However, it is the first step on this  road...    [Hryb] Nevertheless, between the first and the second step  there is a long distance, and it is not at all certain that the  second step will be made. The road from the "Partnership" to  membership in NATO is long. Membership of the East European  states in NATO will make it even more difficult for this  organization to make decisions. Therefore, it must change its  statute. We are not against the "Partnership for Peace";  however, first we must solve our economic problems.</p>

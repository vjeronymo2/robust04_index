			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Tempting terrine - Cookery I rather fancy the idea of giving foie gras terrine as a Christmas present to a dozen special friends. Not sending one to each - you would need a big win on the National Lottery to do that - but inviting them all to come and share it under my roof. At this alternative Christmas feast I would happily skip the turkey. The terrine is luscious enough. There would be salads and cheeses to follow, and fruits, nuts, sweetmeats and mince pies for those with stamina. And maybe the party would end by offering guests just before they depart cups of steaming, intensively savoury consomme. This used to be the practice in the early days of the motor car - a soothing and admirably sensible 'one for the road'. The recipe which follows comes from Shaun Hill's Gidleigh Park Cookery Book (Century Pounds 15.99), one of my favourite books by a chef. Hill left Gidleigh Park last summer and is now in the final stages of putting together his own restaurant with rooms. The Merchant House, Lower Corve Street, Ludlow, Shropshire SY8 1DU (tel and fax: 0584-875438) should open its doors in time to celebrate the New Year. As Hill points out, success in this dish depends on careful preparation: the cooking is easy. It will concentrate the mind wonderfully, he suggests, if you keep the receipts for the ingredients in front of you as you work. Carelessness will prove extremely expensive. TERRINE OF DUCK FOIE GRAS (serves 12 - very generously I would say) Three duck foie gras (total weight about 4lb); 5 fl oz port; 2 1/2 fl oz Armagnac; 10 fl oz chicken consomme; salt, pepper and nutmeg. As soon as you take the livers out of the fridge cut each one horizontally into three or four slices. These livers have a high fat content, and become very soft when not refrigerated. Leave them for about half an hour to warm slowly to room temperature. When soft, carefully pick out all nerves and veins, a messy job. Use your fingertips to lift up the veins from the liver, and a sharp knife or scissors to cut. Do not forget to take off the outer membrane and do not hurry. This is a very important stage of the recipe. The more care you exercise in cleaning the livers the better the terrine will be. If the livers become so soft that they begin to collapse and are difficult to de-vein easily, refrigerate them again briefly to firm them up a little before completing the cleaning process. Season each prepared slice liberally on both sides with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and arrange them in layers in a terrine. A Le Creuset terrine measuring 12in x 3in is ideal. After each layer sprinkle with the Armagnac and port. Use decent port - a 10-year-old tawny is fine. Words like ruby or vintage character on the label often mean nasty and coarse, and represent a false economy when you consider the cost of the foie gras over which you are pouring it. Cover and refrigerate the terrine for 6-8 hours or overnight. The livers will absorb most of the port and brandy and become firm again. Place the covered terrine in a roasting dish half-filled with cold water and cook in the middle of an oven preheated to 300`F (150`C) gas mark 2 for 20 minutes. The liver will not look cooked at the end of this time, but it is. If you cook it any longer you will end up with half the quantity of terrine and pints of butter-like fat. When it emerges from the oven, take the terrine out of the water bath and spoon off any fat. Lay a plastic card or a couple of spatulas along the top of the terrine and then weight with three 2oz weights. Put the terrine in a cool larder and leave until completely cold and set firm. At this stage the terrine can be unmoulded (save the spoonful or two of juices that have collected in the dish). Wrap the terrine in food film and foil and refrigerate it. It will keep for up to five days. Several hours before you plan to serve the terrine, add the reserved juices to the chicken consomme and boil until reduced by half. (Add a sheet of gelatine if you are nervous that your consomme may not set to a firm jelly.) Unwrap the terrine and return it to the container. Pour the reduced warm consomme over it and chill until set. The liquid will jellify as it sets, filling the gaps in the terrine and making it much easier to slice. Turn out the terrine or serve it from the dish, slicing it with a sharp knife that has been heated in boiling water then wiped dry. Serve with toasted brioche.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 16(66) of April 1994] </F>   [Text] TWO VIEWS FROM THE VOLGA ON RUSSIAN FEDERAL  MATTERS  <H5>  GOVERNOR OF NIZHNIY NOVGOROD: THE SEPARATION OF POWERS </H5> SHOULD BE BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF ALL FEDERATION MEMBERS    The governor of Nizhniy Novgorod region BORIS NEMTSOV, 34,  who until recently was also the presidential representative in  the region, belongs to the younger generation of Russian  politicians whom analysts consider candidates to the highest  posts in future Russia. Several months ago he told  Interfax-Exclusive about the distinctive features of the Nizhniy  Novgorod pattern of transition to a free market economy. Now he  answers questions from Interfax once again.    INTERFAX: What do you think of the current economic policy  of the Russian government?    NEMTSOV: I think that in their latest speeches the president  and prime-minister made points that are correct from the  viewpoint of the current situation and gave the guidelines.  They are determined to pursue a policy of restraining budget  spending, offering social security to people in the low-income  bracket, restructuring the economy, stabilizing the financial  situation and observing reasonable protectionism. However,  guidelines are not a program of action which implies concrete  decisions: presidential decrees, government resolutions - these  are few so far. I have the impression that the government does  not have a detailed program, but a declaration of intentions,  good as they can be. For example, how is the idea of building a  competitive market compatible with increasing customs tariffs on  imports? And what can one say of the agricultural policy of the  government, if on the one hand, it approves the Nizhniy Novgorod  pattern of land privatization and on the other, decides to form  a superholding company in Tula region? I think that despite the  attractiveness of the proclaimed ideas, it is premature to speak  of a clear economic policy of the cabinet - it is only in the  making.    INTERFAX: Do you see any change in the intentions of the  cabinet, if not in its policy?    NEMTSOV: So far I see the determination of Prime-Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin to continue reforms, in agriculture for  instance. It is reassuring that he has clearly realized the  danger of hyperinflation and contrary to the accusations by  former cabinet members he is not giving out money just to anyone.    INTERFAX: What do you think is keeping the current cabinet  from more resolute actions?    NEMTSOV: One gets the impression that there is no one in the  prime-minister's team capable of forecasting the consequences of  decisions. If the political resolution of Chernomyrdin is  backed by concrete and correct actions, by professional experts,  the government has a future.    INTERFAX: How much do the reforms in Nizhniy Novgorod fit in  the general picture of Russian changes? Do you have any  differences with Moscow?    NEMTSOV: No, there is no such problem. There are no  obstacles to economic reforms in our region: the federal  government regards our initiatives with approval. The big  companies are federal property, though, and they follow the  rules of the federal government, therefore our interference in  their operation is minimal. It would be good if we were allowed  to reform such important fields as oil refining, oil supplies  and engineering. But I realize that this is the prerogative of  the federal authorities.    INTERFAX: Does your region need a special status, offering  additional powers for the success of reforms?    NEMTSOV: No, we do not need one, the rights we have today  are quite enough.    INTERFAX: What do you think of the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan on are the separation of powers?    NEMTSOV: I closely studied it and did not see any  exceptional powers given to Tatarstan that would lie outside the  federal constitution. But political life is very complicated  and much depends on the name of the document. I this case I  find it absolutely unacceptable. Tatarstan is a member of the  Russian Federation, hence the treaty could have been entitled  differently, for instance, a treaty on the separation of powers  between a member of the Russian Federation, the republic of  Tatarstan and the government of Russia. But evidently for Kazan  the name was the key matter. And this is one of the unpleasant  compromises.    INTERFAX: Which of its clauses do you find positive?    NEMTSOV: I think the text itself is going to be very useful  for offering concrete contents to Articles 72 and 73 of the  federal constitution. In my opinion the treaty with Tatarstan  can become a model agreement on the separation of powers between  the federal and local governments. By the way, such documents  are already being drafted at instructions from the government.    INTERFAX: Is your region ready to sign such a document?    NEMTSOV: If the question emerges, the region is ready to do  it among the first ones. I have no objections. Still I think  that the objective process of the separation of powers should be  based on the equality of all federation members. Inequality  might turn Russia into a shapeless structure.    INTERFAX: Do you mean that treaties with all regions should  be signed simultaneously?    NEMTSOV: Yes. Here I support Prime-Minister Chernomyrdin.  But first the general rules of separating powers should be  formulated. Particulars can be described in separate  supplements. In this context the treaty with Tatarstan seems to  play a positive role as a model, but on the other, it is an  unpleasant example: the one who acts fast, is going to get more  rights.    INTERFAX: Ominous forecasts are made about the consequences  of the amnesty declared by the State Duma. How grounded do you  think they are?    NEMTSOV: I think that the hullabaloo raised over the matter  is incomparable with the possible consequences. It is a pity,  of course, that an honest person (Aleksey Kazannik - Interfax)  was forced to resign from the post of Prosecutor General. But  the amnesty itself should not be dramatized. It will not have  any serious consequences. The coming changes, primarily in the  economy, is what determines things for Russia, not the number of  detainees or convicts released. I am convinced that such things  as the collapse of the industry, the snowballing of crime, the  disintegration of production are much more dangerous for the  stability of the country than the participation of some former  convicts in rallies and demonstrations.    INTERFAX: But they are not planning to give up politics.    NEMTSOV: Evidently the persons who were set free as a result  of the amnesty have passed the peak of their political career  even though many of them think they have everything ahead.  Take, for example, one of the contenders for presidency  Aleksandr Rutskoy. I do not think he is going to find a  platform with which he could win the elections because his  political niche has been occupied partly by the Democratic Party  of Nikolay Travkin, partly by the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, partly by the Communist Party of Gennadiy  Zyuganov. Their political ambitions will not permit them to  give up their positions. As for the others, they did not  noticeably influence the Russian political scene even earlier.    INTERFAX: You are known to have been active in the defence  of the White House during the abortive coup in August 1991.  What is your attitude to the release of the coup leaders?    NEMTSOV: Pragmatic. Evidently those people were guilty: I  saw with my own eyes how they sent tanks to Moscow. But as a  politician predicting the consequences of the steps taken by the  Russian leadership I think that the release of Kryuchkov, Pavlov  and other coup leaders will not influence the situation in the  country in any way. These people will only join the  irreconcilable opposition without becoming its leaders though. I  would want to single out another aspect of the problem: the  amnesty relieved of responsibility the organizers of the tragic  events in October 1993 "on both sides". I do not think the  State Duma did reasonably when it refused to investigate the  circumstance causing human losses. That is not in parliamentary  traditions. One gets the impression that the amnesty is  beneficial only for the opposition.    INTERFAX: What do you think of the idea of a memorandum on  civic accord in Russia?    NEMTSOV: I do not think that my viewpoint coincides with the  official one: to my mind the effort is totally lost. Russia  approved such documents and memorandums back in the days of  Ruslan Khasbulatov (the speaker of the last Supreme Soviet).  Their historic value was minimal because they are not legally  binding for their parties. On the other hand, the move can be  supported as an initiative which at least morally binds the  sides to refrain from destructive actions. But I think it is  very naive to hope that after signing the memorandum civic peace  is going to reign in Russia.  <H5>  TATAR GOVERNMENT ACCUSED OF OBSTRUCTING REFORMS </H5>   Tatarstan has won greater economic independence after  signing  a treaty and package of agreements with Russia. In the two  years of talks and the republic's insistence on a special  status, Kazan has had an opportunity of embracing economic  policies distinct from the center's. To what extent did Kazan  avail itself of that chance? Tatar Vice Premier Ravil Muratov  was airing his view on this and other questions in a recent  interview with Interfax.    INTERFAX: Many say the advantages of Tatarstan's choice of a  softer transition to market are obvious: the government has  managed to an extent to cushion off the shock from price  liberalization and halt production slump in the farming sector.  But all of those measures were taken at the cost of the budget  and oil exports. The non-payment crisis and a fall in world oil  prices have put to question those two sources of financing.  What are the prospects awaiting the Tatar economy?    MURATOV: Regrettably, the government has virtually missed a  range of promising economic development programs by focusing on  social programs and propping the countryside or in other words,  by fighting for the republic's survival. True, oil revenues did  help to stave off an economic collapse to an extent. But  relative stabilization of the economy must be seen as the  starting point for reforms, above all in financial, tax and land  reform. Tatarstan was one of the first to introduce bills of  exchange in an effort to ease the crisis of non-payment and a  lack of federal credits. But the local banks, and above all,  the National Bank, have obstructed the measure. The National  Bank preferred cash operations and making high profits for the  Central Bank of Russia rather than dealing in securities. Nor  was the measure accepted by enterprises. Kazan has lost both  its chances and time. Russian banks which have begun to  circulate bills of exchange are faring far better than we did.  We have now started falling behind some neighboring regions  which are fleshing out their own programs. In the meantime,  local enterprises which are stuck in a mire of non-payment have  been stubbornly holding back to old ways of account clearing.  The government is having to allocate billions of rubles to  Nizhnekamsneftekhim company to rescue Tatneft oil producer. But  the trouble is, state companies are interlinked. While we think  of appeasing oil producers until the petrochemical industry has  sold its product, both of the sectors prefer to pile up their  own debt.    INTERFAX: Where does the money come from to be able to  sustain such plans?    MURATOV: The government takes up costly social programs  which in itself is positive. But the impression is we do not at  all care how to raise money. In the first place, the question  is one of the budget itself. Who will pay taxes? State  companies heavily indebted to each other can ill afford to do  so. The burden of tax on the private sector weighs so heavily  that the only option is to roll back production. Most of the  collective and state farms depending on government subsidies are  loss makers. In the meantime, we are wasting time and missing  opportunities of embracing reforms at a least possible cost.The  federal government continues to pour in billions of rubles to  back up loss making farms at a time when it must carry out land  reform, declare private ownership of the land as written down in  the constitution and transfer it to those who can till it at a  profit. Russia has no concept of land reform or promotion of  private farming. As a result, the market and state price of  meat is almost the same, but the situation is likely to worsen  as time goes by. The government will have to spend trillions  rather than millions of rubles in autumn when the harvest season  is over. What sort of budget must there be to sustain such  expenditure? What is needed is government support for those who  are willing and able to work the land efficiently instead of  subsidizing the bankrupts.    INTERFAX: Was there anything to prevent the government from  drafting its own program of support to private business in the  countryside and urban areas? Nizhniy Novgorod region has less  powers than Tatarstan and yet its model of land reform is  recommended as an example to follow. Its Governor Boris Nemtsov  did not seek a greater say in export policies and yet, the West  appears to be willing to invest in the regional economy and  small size businesses there.    MURATOV: I should have thought it is our stuck in the mud  approach, caution and a desire to avoid mistakes of the federal  reform that are in the way. Despite its verbal support for  small and medium size businesses, Kazan has taken no real steps  to do so. A year ago, it was clear that conditions and benefits  must be set for the priority development of infrastructures for  business, banks, leasing, marketing and brokerage firms.  Despite high interests, many of the smaller and medium size are  on the brink of bankruptcy, a situation that is barely conducive  for industrial development. Nor can exorbitant taxes help create  a climate for business activity. One can hardly hope for the  emergence of a middle class at a time when traders and  businessmen are widely regarded as criminals. The Tatar  parliament behaves in a conservative way by banning plant  managers to engage in private business or proposing to close  private kiosks.    INTERFAX: Surely, Kazan's independence in export trade  should give it greater financial opportunities?    MURATOV: Much of it is still on paper. We still have to  fight to get it. One example. The federal fuel and energy  ministry has transferred exclusive rights for shipment and  exports of crude oil through Odessa port to the Russian Koneks  firm in violation of agreements with Moscow and Kiev on a free  flow of goods through both countries. Tatarstan is entitled to  conduct its own export policies but attempts are being made to  dictate terms to Kazan including import and export taxes set by  the federal government. What sort of guarantees for repatriation  of capital could the Tatar government possibly give to foreign  investors in a situation such as it is now? Worse still, higher  import tariffs have wrecked some of the government programs. We  are now unable to import telecommunications equipment into the  republic. Away from doom and gloom, assertions about Tatarstan's  economic prosperity are not true. Even if its economic  indicators are a bit better than those of Tatarstan's neighbors,  there must be no illusions - the republic is virtually at a  standstill. Now that the treaty with Moscow has been signed,  Tatarstan should avail itself in full measure of the rights  provided and get all of the agreements being put in place.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Rev. Jerry Falwell is cutting back on his television schedule. Falwell  plans to discontinue his daily syndicated show "Pastor's Study" so that he can  focus his energy on his religious teachings. Spokesman Mark DeMoss said Falwell  is still deciding other activities to eliminate "that he doesn't deem critical  or central to what's of utmost importance to him, and that's mainly Thomas Road  Baptist Church and Liberty University," which are located in Lynchburg, Va.  Falwell still will have his "Old Time Gospel Hour" on television, but "Pastor's  Study" was taking too much time, he said, according to wire reports. The show,  which ran for two years, featured interviews, musical performances and promoted  the school andchurch. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

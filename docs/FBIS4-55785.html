			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 14 (ATA) -- A fierce debate is  continuing in the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] parliament in regard to the census.  Referring to sources from Skopje, the Albanian Television  reported that the Albanian deputies requested on May 13, that  the document of the citizenship be presented during the census  because the Interior Ministry is not able to provide them;  Albanians who work abroad be treated as citizens of The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and also be included in the  general number of the population, not in special categories.    The Albanian deputies requested also that several Albanian  people be employed at the Statistical Enterprise and a formulary  sample should remain at the families who have been registered.    The amendments of the Albanians deputies did not find  support  and caused uncontrolled reactions by the Macedonian deputies.  According to the Macedonian deputies, these amendments request  the legalization of the Albanians who have come from Kosova,  Serbia, and Albania. The Macedonian deputies supported  indirectly the thesis that the Albanians of Macedonia have  Macedonian citizenship and should be declared as Macedonians.  The parliament stopped its proceedings because of the tense  atmosphere created by partial and dissuading discussion.</p>

Mentese who is currently attending a Council of Europe  ministerial meeting on drugs said the file showed that PKK had  links with 53 drug traffic incidents which happened between  1990-1993 adding that nearly four tonnes of heroin were seized  during this time.    Mentese said European security officials also confirmed the  organization's activities on drug traffic.    The file gives the names of the terrorists from the outlawed  separatist PKK organization who were earlier caught together  with large quantities of narcotics in several countries of the  world and in Turkey.    Meanwhile, a document published at the end of the meeting,  with Turkey's initiatives, said "European countries strengthen  their commitment that they will work together against terror  organizations who have links with drug traffic."</p>

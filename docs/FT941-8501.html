			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Drugs companies fight generics push A dispute between pharma-ceutical industry representatives and the Department of Health erupted again yesterday over whether generic drugs should be prescribed in place of more expensive branded versions. The Department of Health has said that it wanted to restart talks with doctors aimed at allowing pharmacists to dispense generic versions. But the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries' says this could cut drug sales by Pounds 500m a year and drive out drug-company investment. It added: 'If generic substitution was permitted by parliament this could have a very serious affect on the UK-based business. Canada introduced a policy of generic substitution 30 years ago. Very quickly it went from being a net exporter of pharmaceuticals to a net importer.' The government is considering various ways of controlling its spending on the National Health Service. The NHS drugs budget is about Pounds 3bn and last year the government imposed a 2.5 per cent price cut on pharmaceuticals sold in the UK. On Thursday, Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, told the Commons health committee that he wanted to reopen talks with doctors aimed at increasing the proportion of generic drugs dispensed under the NHS. The department said yesterday that it had long held a policy of encouraging generic prescribing. Of the 60 per cent to 65 per cent of branded drug prescriptions that could be replaced with generic prescriptions, more than 40 per cent already were. Patents protect other drugs from generic competition. The department said it had held talks with doctors over generic substitution since 1983. The British Medical Association said these talks failed because the department wanted to add a box to prescription forms for doctors to tick if they did not want a generic drug dispensed. The BMA said it was re-examining its opposition to 'ticking out', which was one of the reasons the government wanted to restart talks. It said there were questions over safeguards on the quality of generic drugs and warned of a danger that the government might use pressure on doctors, rather than advice, to prescribe generics.</p>

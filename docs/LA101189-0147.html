			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAZDA WORKERS VOTE ATTENDANCE BONUSES  </P> <P> Hourly workers at Mazda Motor Manufacturing Corp. have voted for fat cash  bonuses for themselves for perfect attendance and automatic dismissal for  anyone missing 15 days a year.  </P> <P> The vote, held Monday and Tuesday, is the latest effort to curb high  absenteeism, which auto makers regard as a serious roadblock, to boost quality  and cut costs.  </P> <P> By a vote of 1,120 to 434, United Auto Workers Local 3000 chose a "no-fault"  absenteeism policy, effective immediately.  </P> <P> The policy calls for an annual $1,500 bonus for perfect attendance, 60% of  regular pay on the first four absences per year and automatic dismissal after  15 absences, or 6.25% of scheduled work days annually.  </P> <P> Under the plan, workers would be eligible for 15 sick days or personal days  each year, not including holidays, vacations or pre-approved sick days.  </P> <P> At the same time, workers rejected a plan that included a $500 bonus for  perfect attendance, 60% of regular pay for the first 14 absences per year and  termination after the 15th absence.  </P></p>

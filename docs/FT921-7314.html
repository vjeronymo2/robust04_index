			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: Local politics needs paid professional councillors Sir, Your welcome editorial today in defence of local politics (February 20) calls for councils to be 'more representative'. You suggest that the government's antipathy has made local government unattractive (as a political activity) to men and women of ability. Indeed, it is in fact a miracle that so many able and talented councillors still function, and in many cases highly effectively. Not only have they to deal with an unceasing stream of new legislation, multi-million pound budgets, vast personnel/employer responsibilities, constituents' multiple needs and party political business; but they do it all in their spare time and for no remuneration. The work is intellectually and emotionally taxing. Research shows that the country's 27,000 councillors average some 20 hours a week each on public service, but very few can claim as much as Pounds 1,000 a year in expenses. It is hardly surprising that they are unrepresentative. They tend to be white and male, and older than the populations they represent. A broader group of citizens refrains from standing for election - all political parties express difficulty in finding sufficient candidates, let alone able ones. Proportional representation will not deal with this issue; and until we recognise that consistently high quality local and regional government requires radical political change involving paid professional councillors, (as well as concerted consideration of finance, function and structure) we must continue to depend on those public-spirited and generous enough to offer themselves - even if you find them sometimes capricious and dictatorial.

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Stockholm A busy week is in store on the corporate results front, starting with first-half figures from Volvo tomorrow. UBS says first-half results have so far matched, or in many cases handsomely beaten, already high expectations. It expects Volvo to continue the trend posting net profits up to SKr8.05bn from SKr380m in the first half of last year. Few of Sweden's recovering industrial groups are as well positioned as Volvo to benefit from the improving US economy, heavy internal restructuring and product launches, says UBS.</p>

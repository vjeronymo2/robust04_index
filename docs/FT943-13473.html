			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mail reports Daily Mail &amp; General Trust 'A' bounced 7 to 1000p as the market got wind of reports that it was poised to unwind its loss-making stake in US multi-media group Whittle Communications. DMGT announced previously that this year's profits would be down by Pounds 20m because of losses at Whittle, prompting SG Warburg to cut its full-year forecast to Pounds 62m. Yesterday a US trade press article claimed Whittle was offloading its problem section to Reuters Holdings and selling half of its educational TV service to an investment fund managed by Goldman Sachs. Analysts said the move would not help this year's DMGT numbers but could provide a boost next year. Reuters lost 1 at 476p.</p>

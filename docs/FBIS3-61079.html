Yeltsin, the  government of Moscow has prepared a draft edict on special  features of privatization in the capital of Russia. Moscow's  Mayor, Yuriy Luzhkov, emphasizes the main point of the edict:  The size of the charter capital and appraisal of entities'  property on the territory of Moscow are subject to approval by  the government of Moscow in accordance with the methodology  developed by it.    [INTERFAX] May we say that the preparation of the draft  edict  marks the end of the protracted argument about the ways to  privatize Moscow's property?    [Luzhkov] The discussion on the principles of implementing  privatization in Russia and in its capital city of Moscow is not  yet over. Speaking about the capital, our opponents accuse us of  allegedly attempting to secure special status for Moscow in  matters of privatization. Actually, this is not so.    On the other hand, every person, even without being a  specialist on the subject, understands that the value of capital  assets in the capital infrastructure should be different than  the value of, for instance, an identical enterprise in another  Russian city. A uniform measure cannot be applied to  privatization rules in this respect.    The most important point is that we disagree with the  purpose  of privatization and the methodology attached to this process by  Mr. Chubays et al.    [INTERFAX] Have you tried to convince A. Chubays and his  entourage, attract their attention to your conclusions, in order  to work out a common point of view?    [Luzhkov] Unfortunately, A. Chubays does not even make an  effort to grasp the substance of our objections. He simply  replies: We will continue to conduct privatization the same way  as before.    Since discussion is not working out, I would like to explain  publicly where, precisely, we disagree on substance. First, a  purpose of privatization is to transfer property that the state  can no longer manage. I do not see any ways of realizing this  goal in A. Chubays' privatization program.    What that program does is to reduce to a minimum the number  of enterprises in which the state retains ownership; everything  else is subject to privatization. I think that a real proprietor  would try in the current inflationary conditions to hold back on  selling off real estate. It is easy to sell off everything you  have accumulated over time.    The second purpose of privatization, in my firm opinion, is  to transfer an enterprises to an owner who will use it better  and more effectively. We do not see this purpose being realized  at all. It is no secret that both across the country and in  Moscow major plants are being sold and purchased as a mere piece  of real estate. People bet on the fact that the voucher, which  at this point has low value, once invested in the purchase of,  for instance, a plant, will eventually produce a 1,000-fold  return on investment...    [INTERFAX] Could you give a specific example?    [Luzhkov] Certainly. Take the ZIL [imeni Lenina Plant]. The  controlling share of this giant's stock has been purchased for  4.5 billion rubles [R]. This is the price of the vouchers  purchased earlier on the cheap. As a result, this miserly amount  bought not only the right to manage, but also the right to  ownership of a huge ongoing enterprise.    Let us look, however, what is R4.5 billion--it is $4.5  million. There is $300 million worth of imported equipment alone  installed at the ZIL. And then twice as much worth of  domestic-made equipment, buildings, and communications.    Even all these details are not enough to appraise the full  value of the enterprise. The ZIL is a functioning system, which  manufactures a competitive, needed product that is selling well.  This is far from a mere piece of real estate.    Neither can I disregard this aspect: This technological  structure employs people who know their business, know how to  develop and improve it. It is a living, promising system, and it  must be appraised using completely different measures and  parameters. When we speak of this, we assume that as a final  result a privatized enterprise must acquire a good master, who  will manage it better than the old one. Where is the logic in  the ZIL example?    The third purpose of privatization is to earn money on a  sale  of an enterprise. The state is poor right now. There is no money  for social programs, the military, the conversion. There are  many other pressing needs as well. At the same time, the country  essentially sits on a fortune in property. Of course, some of it  should be sold. In our estimation, if this selling is done  sensibly, Russia may get R200 trillion-R250 trillion, that is,  several times as much as its annual budget.    What are we going to get from privatization "according to  Chubays"? His program says it straight: R1.5 trillion. What is  there to gain from such privatization? Political points,  perhaps? But this aspect is short-lived. Then we will sober up.    I am also very concerned with respect to this point: When  such complex processes are under way in the economy as we have  now, we have to protect the state from having its property  bought up by foreign companies and firms. We have to try to  leave as many key enterprises as possible in the sphere of  operations of domestic capital, not let foreigners buy up  Russian riches for peanuts, taking advantage of the situation. I  do not like high-sounding words, but I think that the meaning of  what I have said is clear to everyone.    In the estimation of one serious economic expert, today's  privatization prices are such that the entire of Russia may be  purchased for $60 billion. In 1994 our privatization policy will  open the gates for foreign capital to start buying up Russia.  Such foreign company may buy more than one plant such as the ZIL  at voucher auctions. I am convinced that we have to think more  about domestic capital....    [INTERFAX] But this is protectionism.    [Luzhkov] And what is wrong with that? Let the young Russian  capital get its legitimate privileges in the course of  privatization.    As to protectionism, as long as the capital's residents vest  their trust in me, it is simply my responsibility to express the  summary will of the Muscovites.    [INTERFAX] What specifically are your proposals? What is  their substance?    [Luzhkov] First. To change substantially the methodology of  appraising the value of everything that is to be privatized. To  make it so that the enterprise's price reflects its real value.  We have many examples where the initial appraisal of a plant has  turned out to be 200 times lower than its real worth. This only  surfaces at auction sales. As of 1 July 1992 the price of  enterprises was frozen, including those in Moscow, and that was  it. There has not been any revision since. Money has devalued,  and many enterprises can now been had almost for free.    Second. A territory's right in the privatization process. So  far it does not have any rights whatsoever. All we can regulate,  for instance, is the transfer into private ownership of dental  offices, sea ports of local significance, and cemeteries. Such  is the legal space of local bodies of power, including those in  Moscow.    I, for instance, cannot make a decision to put on hold  privatization of hotels in the capital. If the collective  decided to privatize the water supply or sewer system, for  instance, they could do this through the courts in a matter of  one or two months.    We know that hotels and farmers markets in Moscow are highly  criminalized structures. So why should we hand state property  over to the mafia on the cheap? Who gave the current privatizers  such a right? Let the city itself dispose of its property!    But Mr. Chubays says: "No, we, and only we, will conduct  privatization--the State Committee for the Administration of  State Property" [GKI].    During a personal encounter two or three weeks ago, I asked  Chubays: "Anatoliy Borisovich, why is it that you mistrust us so  much? What is it that I have done, for instance, for you to  harbor suspicions?"    I want to remind you that I was there when the cooperative  movement was just taking off in Moscow; we developed it further  than anywhere else. And there were quite a few specialists at  the time who tried to do away with this undertaking.    The first commodity exchange also was in Moscow. It was G.  Popov and I who launched it. This was the beginning of a market  infrastructure, after all! The government of Moscow facilitated  in every way possible the development of a commercial banking  infrastructure. Trading houses and chambers of commerce were  also our initiative....    But Chubays just keeps repeating the same thing: "You will  halt, slow down privatization...."    We say: We need all peoples' privatization. The vouchers  should have been personalized from the very beginning, so they  could be traced. Then there would not be machinations involving  them. But they did not make the voucher this way. I do not know  whose ill intent this was. And instead of people's privatization  we got a concentration of voucher capital and the use of the  latter for buying up property appraised literally at pennies.    [INTERFAX] In your opinion, where will all this lead?    [Luzhkov] If Moscow loses its property now, it will be for  good. The euphoria will pass; what will remain is deep and  bitter disappointment. So what do we do then--begin reshuffling  once again?    I gathered directors of defense enterprises for a meeting  recently. What did we talk about most? They are concerned with  the course of privatization. They also say that a different  approach is needed.    [INTERFAX] What did the president tell you on this subject?    [Luzhkov] He is much better than Chubays; he understood our  concerns. He believes, for instance, that Moscow should decide  on its own what to privatize and what not. He said the same to  Chubays, straight. I deliberately asked B. Yeltsin to have a  meeting with both of us together.    The president asked my opponent why, for instance, Moscow  enterprises have been appraised so low. The head of state  pointed out that Moscow is an infrastructure that is completely  different from any other city in Russia. And why are the rights  of local authorities so limited in privatization process in  general, inquired the president.    [INTERFAX] So what conclusion did B. Yeltsin reach on the  basis of this conversation?    [Luzhkov] The president said that he is willing to sign an  edict that will give Moscow the right to establish special  privatization terms. He also told us that he is willing to grant  the 10-12 largest enterprises in Russia special conditions in  this process.    [INTERFAX] Of what class are these enterprises?    [Luzhkov] Well, for instance, the GAZ [Gorkiy Auto Works].  There are such enterprises in Moscow, too.... On the basis of  this conversation, the government of Moscow has prepared a draft  presidential edict.    By the way, I do not understand in general why we, while  constantly talking about demonopolization, have created such a  monster--a supermonopoly such as the GKI. The USSR had 140  sectoral ministries, and they still could not cope with this  enormous task. And now it turns out that Chubays on his own can  manage this property colossus.    In my opinion, the GKI should only develop a methodology for  the process, and implementation should be left to the  territories. Chubays and his agencies in essence have become a  supermonopoly. Is this not dangerous? Dictatorial methods of  privatization will not result in any good. What is happening  with respect to property right now is a 1917 Revolution, except  in reverse. Have we not had enough social experiments and  cataclysms?    By the way, Moscow city property had been appraised at R100  billion at the old prices. How much then should it be worth now?  As a minimum, let us multiply the price by a factor of 1,000.  Chubays, however, wants to privatize the entire of Russia for  R1.5 trillion. It is laughable, although this is a laughter  through tears. And this property is not owned by some  bureaucrats--it belongs to Muscovites. It is our responsibility  to bring it to them.    Speaking again about domestic capital and its role in  purchasing Moscow property. It needs help. Let them buy it on  credit--not everyone has been able to save the necessary means.    And what will such a buyer do, for instance, having acquired  such a plant? He will try to set the production in such a way  that would allow him to pay off the debt as quickly as possible.  There is no other opinion about it. This is the road to  increasing the volume of production. An outsider, however,  having acquired the controlling share of stock, will look at  this same plant as a piece of real estate. What option is better  for all of us, Russians and Muscovites? That is why there is  such a boom around privatization, which often leads to physical  violence.    And finally, on the national and city budget. Moscow is  literally scraping up subsidies for pensioners, the disabled,  and so on these days. We could proceed with these measures on a  much greater scale had we received everything due us from the  sale of city property.    [INTERFAX] By the way, what is your position on the idea of  transferring the mayoralty building (formerly COMECON  headquarters) to the State Duma?    [Luzhkov] First, we are disciplined people and comply with  the president's decision. The Moscow government does not merely  treat the decision of the head of state with respect--it  supports the president, and sincerely is on his side.    Keeping all this in mind, however, we reported to B. Yeltsin  that this building is not capable of accommodating the State  Duma. This is an objective economic evaluation. The former  COMECON building has 489 offices. Of them, 157 have reception  rooms. There are very few conference halls that could be used  for commissions' work and joint sessions.    It is not as though we were holding onto this property. The  point is quite different. Moscow is the capital of Russia. When  it comes to providing accommodations for the bodies of  authority, it is the responsibility of the city government to do  it. I personally think that the building of the former Academy  of Social Sciences will provide better accommodations for the  State Duma.    [INTERFAX] Why?    [Luzhkov] There are only about 100 people studying there  now.  In the entire huge, prestigious complex. The rest of the space  is rented out. As to the contention that this building is too  far from the center of Moscow, this may even be for the better.  Lawmakers should work in peace, away from the pressure of the  street, away from the everyday hustle and bustle. By the way,  there are many examples of this in the world. As for me  personally, I want normal relations with the deputies of  Russia's new parliament.    By the way, if the issue comes to the point where it is  decided that Moscow should build a new building for the State  Duma, we will; we will find a good place for it. There is such  an option. We will build it quickly. We have the resources and  abilities to do this. And we will build a building for the  Federation Council, taking into account the specificity of this  chamber.    [INTERFAX] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, you yourself have mentioned  that the fight for property caused by the existing methodology  of privatization often shifts into the mode of physical violence  against the competitors. Here is another murder--the chairman of  the Rosselkhozbank's board of directors is dead....    [Luzhkov] The situation is very difficult. Murder of top  officials of commercial structures is becoming a regular  occurrence. Unfortunately, not only in Moscow.    What happened to Nikolay Likhachev makes us think again  about  the situation in the capital. We need major measures aimed at  normalization of the situation in the city as a whole. I also  think that tougher measures need to be taken to provide  individual protection for persons of interest to criminal  structures.    Maintenance of law and order is first and foremost a task  for  the state. But the territories should not just stand on the  sidelines. I do not want to promise much to Muscovites. Words  are just words.    I would like to draw their attention to just one fact: Over  the past year, Moscow has allocated more money to beef up law  enforcement organs than the total they have received since the  beginning of the century. This includes everything:  communications, housing, personnel pay, transportation. I think  we will soon have the right to demand of the Moscow militia more  effective work in maintaining law and order in the city. Even  what has already been implemented in Moscow in this respect is  producing results, though. We will do everything possible to  develop this trend further.</p>

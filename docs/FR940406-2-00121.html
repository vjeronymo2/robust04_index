Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 476A <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, or registered or non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a minor violation of certain specified Exchange rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 476A was approved by the Commission on January 25, 1985. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21688 (January 25, 1985), 50 FR 5025 (February 5, 1985). Subsequent additions of rules to the Rule 476A Violations List were made in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 22037 (May 14, 1985), 50 FR 21008 (May 21, 1985); 23104 (April 11, 1986), 51 FR 13307 (April 18, 1986); 24985 (October 5, 1987), 52 FR 41643 (October 29, 1987); 25763 (May 27, 1988), 54 FR 20925 (June 7, 1988); 27878 (April 4, 1990), 55 FR 13345 (April 10, 1990); 28003 (May 8, 1990), 55 FR 20004 (May 14, 1990); 28505 (October 2, 1990), 55 FR 41288 (October 10, 1990); 28995 (March 21, 1991), 56 FR 12967 (March 28, 1991); 30280 (January 22, 1992), 57 FR 3452 (January 29, 1992); 30536 (March 31, 1992), 57 FR 12357 (April 9, 1992); 32421 (June 7, 1993), 58 FR 32973 (June 14, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is appropriate, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 476A provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules or policies, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. Violations of these rules and policies that are deemed by the Exchange not to be minor in nature are also subject to formal disciplinary proceedings under Exchange Rule 476. The list of rules and policies which are eligible for the Rule 476A procedures specifies those rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes a schedule of fines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

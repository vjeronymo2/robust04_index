			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Usinor's chairman backs steel output cuts European governments must address the difficulties facing the steel industry and back plans for cuts in production, Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor-Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, said yesterday. Directing his comments at a meeting of European Union industry ministers scheduled for December 17, Mr Mer said European governments had been using 'artificial means' and subsidies to maintain production at steel plants. 'Industry members have been seeking to reduce production to support prices, while European governments have been acting irresponsibly.' Mr Mer said the EU steel industry needed to cut output by about 30m tonnes: 20m in rolled steel and 10m in flat. He described the current situation as 'dire' and said that next year was likely to be as bad. 'There is surplus production in Europe and we need to shut some of it down,' he said. He cited Ilva in Italy and Ekostahl in Germany as examples where stronger action was necessary. In the case of Ilva, he said its loss-making Cogne subsidiary should be closed. He also expressed concerns about a joint project between Ekostahl and Riva of Italy to expand production. He estimated that the project would create up to 2m tonnes of new steel supplies.</p>

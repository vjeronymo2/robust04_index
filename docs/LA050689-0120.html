			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAST HEARING BEGINS MONDAY;  </P> <P> FINALLY, DRIVERS TO TESTIFY ABOUT O.C. TRAFFIC PLAN  </P> <P> Orange County motorists will have their first -- and perhaps last -- chance  Monday to testify about an ambitious 20-year plan to improve traffic and manage  growth that would be paid for partly by a half-cent sales tax.  </P> <P> The final hearing on the plan and tax -- the first proposed since voters  soundly rejected a 1-cent sales tax increase for transportation 5 years ago --  will be at the County Hall of Administration in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The plan is designed to reduce traffic congestion to 1983-84 levels. The  transportation package includes restraints on growth as well as a specific list  of road improvement projects -- elements not in the 1984 proposal that voters  turned down by a 2-to-1 margin.  </P> <P> Traffic congestion is the county's No. 1 problem, according to public opinion  surveys, and emotions run high about how best to fight it.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, for example, a homeowners' group picketed the California  Department of Transportation in an unsuccessful bid to have car-pool lanes  opened to all vehicles. A group of rail transit advocates campaigned strongly  against allowing commercial development on a weedy, trackless old Pacific  Electric trolley line right-of-way in Garden Grove. And this week, a member of  a citizens group advising county officials walked out of a meeting in protest  of proposed bus and rail projects.  </P> <P> Critics of the sales-tax plan, Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach)  among them, believe the plan is "pie in the sky" and reflects "bureaucrats'  wishful thinking."  </P> <P> Frizzelle, noting the plan's heavy reliance on exclusive lanes for buses and  car pools, said it contains "things urban designers dream about but which most  people will never use or see."  </P> <P> Supporters see no other remedy for the county's worsening traffic.  </P> <P> "I'm looking out my office window at traffic on the San Diego Freeway. It's  completely stopped," said California Transportation Commission member and  former county supervisor Bruce Nestande, now an executive with Arnel  Development Co., in a recent interview. "Unless people support a plan like  this, they will have to reconcile themselves to sitting in that traffic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan Required by Law  </P> <P> Orange County is the only urban county in California without such a tax. Under  state law, a transportation plan must be adopted before voters can be asked to  approve a transportation sales tax.  </P> <P> The tax would generate $3.1 billion over 20 years. Proceeds would be used to  help pay for implementing the 20-year plan. The total cost of traffic  improvements would be would be $11.6 billion. About $1.3 billion of the sales  tax revenue would be earmarked for freeway projects; street and transit  projects would get $900 million each.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for much of the tax revenue to go toward speeding up the  completion of the Santa Ana Freeway widening project, in which the number of  lanes is being doubled from six to 12, and toward additional lanes (most for  car pools) on the Orange, Costa Mesa, Riverside and San Diego freeways.  </P> <P> The street money would be used by individual cities to synchronize traffic  signals and make road repairs and improvements. The new transit projects would  include at least two new commuter trains on the Los Angeles-San Diego route  through Orange County, possibly the establishment of commuter rail service  between Riverside and Irvine. Transit money would also provide the initial  funding for some experimental automated "people mover" systems, elevated  light-rail systems such as the one now being considered in Anaheim.  </P> <P> To prevent traffic from becoming worse, no city would be eligible for the tax  revenue unless it adopted a strict growth management plan.  </P> <P> Commission members will hear sharply divergent views at Monday's hearing, which  comes after public workshops, surveys, the formation of a citizens task force  and meetings with community organizations in an attempt to reach a public  consensus.  </P> <P> The testimony is expected to include:  </P> <P> * Protests from groups critical of the plan's heavy reliance on additional  car-pool lanes. Dana W. Reed, a Costa Mesa lawyer who serves as the  public-at-large member of the county commission, says he will resist any  attempt to scuttle car-pool projects. "There is no way we can build enough  lanes for everybody to ride the freeway at 55 m.p.h. during rush hour," he  argues. "People will have to double up."  </P> <P> * Suggestions from the Transportation Commission's own citizens advisory task  force that more transit dollars be put toward commuter trains on the Los  Angeles-San Clemente line rather than toward so-called feeder lines -- such as  Anaheim's people mover system or Irvine's planned monorail project. "The real  problem is that there is not enough funding to do what's in the plan, and we  prefer a more realistic approach," says James Brooks of Irvine, a task force  member.  </P> <P> * Criticism that provisions for enforcing cities' adherence to growth controls  in the plan are too weak, a suggestion that the members of a citizens'  oversight panel, that has been proposed be elected rather than appointed, and a  demand that projects be ranked by priority so that voters can see which have  the first call on tax proceeds. "We'd like to see a project priority list  narrowed very rapidly," says Russ Burkett of Orange County Tomorrow, a  slow-growth group.  </P> <P> Without an elected citizens' oversight panel, argues Tom Rogers of Citizens  Against Unfair Taxation, the same people responsible for creating today's  traffic mess will control proceeds from the transportation sales tax.  </P> <P> Complaints from Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, and from possibly others, that  the growth control provisions affecting cities are too restrictive. Young  argues that if residents believe a city is not living up to the plan's growth  management standards, they should take the matter to court.  </P> <P> * Proposals from a new group, the Foundation for Consensus in Transportation,  to establish annual independent financial and management audits, a citizens'  oversight committee "with substantial powers to accommodate citizen input and  review," a consolidation of county transportation agencies, and "a financing  mechanism to acquire additional open space and upgrade present recreational  areas." The group is chaired by Reed L. Royalty , Pacific Bell's area vice  president.  </P> <P> The "financing mechanism," Royalty says, could be the $235-million open-space  bond act proposed by Elizabeth Brown, president of Laguna Greenbelt Inc., one  of the county's most influential environmental groups. Brown is on the  executive committee of Royalty's foundation.  </P> <P> Voters in Contra Costa County approved a similar open-space bond measure (for  $225 million) as well as a half-cent transportation sales tax last November.  Sponsors of both measures helped each other as part of a quid pro quo.  </P> <P> Some commission members said Friday that a vote on adoption of the 20-year plan  may be postponed 2 weeks if testimony is not completed on Monday or if fine  tuning of the document is necessary.  </P> <P> The Transportation Commission staff has been preparing for a Nov. 7 special  election. But under state law, the commission must first adopt the 20-year  plan, and it must be ratified by a majority of the city councils representing  most of the county's population as well as by the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The supervisors have until Aug. 8 to order the printing of ballots.  </P> <P> Monday's meeting begins at 9 a.m. in the Hearing Room of the County Hall of  Administration in the Civic Center in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF HALF-CENT TAX  </P> <P> These are some of the projects that the Orange County Transportation Commission  suggests might be undertaken with passage of a half-cent tax measure:  </P> <P> Ten-year earlier completion of rebuilding the Santa Ana Freeway from the Los  Angeles County line to the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> Rebuilding the interchange of the Santa Ana Freeway with the San Diego Freeway  at the El Toro Y.  </P> <P> Adding lanes to the San Diego Freeway in southern Orange County, the Riverside  Freeway throughout the county, the Orange Freeway from the Los Angeles County  line to the Santa Ana Freeway, and adding a lane to the Costa Mesa Freeway  between the Riverside Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway.  </P> <P> Building a 220-mile network of "Super Streets" on Orange County's 21 busiest  streets.  </P> <P> Expanding Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail service.  </P> <P> Coordinating traffic signals throughout the county.  </P> <P> Requiring every city and the county to adopt a comprehensive growth management  plan to link traffic relief and planned future development.  </P> <P> Source: Orange County Transportation Commission  </P> <P> </P></p>

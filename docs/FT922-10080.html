			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / EEA treaty to spur hot debate on bigger EC SIGNATURE later here today of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, giving seven more countries effective half-membership of the European Community, looks like accelerating a hotly-contested debate on its enlargement. The main formal business on enlargement, for foreign ministers of the Twelve at their regular six-monthly meeting, is to join their counterparts from the seven European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries in signing the EEA pact. This needs ratification by EC and Efta parliaments by the end of this year so that the plan, extending the single EC market to Efta, can be effective next January 1. The chief hurdle will be a Swiss referendum. But three Efta states, Austria, Sweden and Finland, have already applied for full membership. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has warned that his report on the institutional implications of enlargement for the June summit in Lisbon will shock existing member states. At this weekend's meeting he may be asked to expand on his emerging idea of upgrading the Commission into a more powerful political executive, whose head would be elected by the European Parliament and which would be accountable to that body and the European Council, as EC summits are known. As yesterday's meeting began, an official of the UK, which takes over the EC presidency in July, warned that for Mr Delors to launch another big debate so soon after the Maastricht treaty, 'could stop the whole show'. The UK believes the EC must focus on issues such as future financing and membership of the EC. But Commission officials are frustrated at the way the rotating presidency system overstretches small countries, such as Portugal at present, effectively to steer the Community. The emerging Delors plan is not to replace the presidency, but create a more powerful EC executive in foreign and economic policy-making. Its head could act as de facto EC president, leaving the national presidencies a more ceremonial role.</p>

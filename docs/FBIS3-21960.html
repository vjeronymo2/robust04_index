			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 Mar (MTI) -- On March 11, Hungarian  police seized 15 kgs of amphetamine ready to be compressed into  tablets, and another 30 kgs of uncleansed material at a secret  laboratory set up in the cellar of a country house in Biatorbagy  near Budapest. (Amphetamine is a chemically produced synthetic  material). This has been the greatest catch in Hungarian drug  history, the Budapest daily NEPSZAVA reported today.    The search followed a warning from the Swedish police of  good-quality amphetamine being distributed near Malmo,  presumably transported to Scandinavia from or via Hungary.    The drug quantity produced and distributed in Europe is  still  unknown.    A Swedish-resident Hungarian man and a Greek citizen, who  rented the house in Biatorbagy, were taken into custody.</p>

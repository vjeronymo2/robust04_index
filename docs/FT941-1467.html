			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Singapore set to order 52 airliners Singapore Airlines (SIA) is planning to order up to 52 wide-body airliners worth more than Pounds 4.1bn to meet expected growth of 8 to 9 per cent a year over the next 10 years. The proposed order has sparked a fierce contest between Boeing of the US and the European Airbus consortium. Both rivals have submitted proposals to SIA. The three leading aero-engine manufacturers - Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK - have also submitted bids to supply engines. SIA has told the bidders it needs 22 Boeing 747-400 jumbos and 30 Airbus A340 long-range airliners for delivery starting in 1997 and running through to 2003. These orders are in addition to 12 Boeing 747-400s and 13 A340s the airline already has on option. Although SIA is considering buying a mix of Boeing and Airbus wide-body airliners, it has also indicated it could opt for just one aircraft type if it received a sufficiently attractive proposal. The separate negotiations over the conversion of SIA's Boeing and Airbus options are also likely to have an impact on the airline's proposed Dollars 6bn order since the manufacturers can be expected to use these negotiations to offer an overall package to enhance their chances. The stakes are big because aircraft orders of this magnitude are rare in the troubled airline industry. The European Airbus consortium is particularly anxious to clinch the Singapore deal after losing out to its US rivals in supplying airliners Saudi Arabia. SIA is regarded as a prestige customer for the manufacturers because it is one of the few strongly profitable airlines based in the world's fastest growing aviation market of the Asia-Pacific region. The company has never cancelled a firm order. Although SIA has also been hit by the world airline industry downturn during the last three years, it has pursued its strategy of maintaining a young fleet, averaging about five years, by regularly acquiring new aircraft and selling its older airliners. The new Dollars 6bn order, expected to be placed in two to three months' time, reflects SIA's growth strategy which will see the airline doubling in size during the next 10 years. SIA has in the past used the proceeds of sales of older aircraft to finance its continuous fleet renewal and expansion programme. However, the aircraft resale market has been depressed during the past two years and SIA has been considering leasing aircraft until the market picks up.</p>

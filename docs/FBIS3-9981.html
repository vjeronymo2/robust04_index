			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgard Barberena] </F>   [Excerpt] With 63 deputies voting, the National Assembly  on 23 February eliminated the "second padlock" from the  Constitution, which will make it possible before mid-year to  approve partial amendments to the Constitution in one round of  debates    The historical step was taken by the deputies of the Center  Bloc (BC), Christian Democratic Union (UDC), Unity and  Reconciliation (BUR), the Sandinist bloc, the legislative group  of the Conservative Popular Alliance (APC), and the Social  Democratic bloc comprised of representatives from the MDN  [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement] and the PSD [Social Democratic  Party].    The second debate followed the 60-percent procedure  established by law. Therefore, President Violeta de Chamorro is  expected to sanction the first amendments made to the  Constitution since its promulgation on 10 January 1987.  <H5>  Chamorro Cannot Exercise Veto </H5>   With regard to the constitutional amendments, President  Chamorro has no veto authority, and if the Executive Branch does  not veto the amendments within the 15 days stipulated by law,  National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman must order its  publication in the official gazette or any other media.  [sentence as published]    The only ones who walked out during the voting were some UNO  [National Opposition Union] deputies after Adolfo Garcia  Esquivel delivered a confusing speech that no one understood  announcing the withdrawal of the minority group they now have in  the National Assembly.  <H5>  First Modifications </H5>   The constitutional amendments approved on 23 February read  as  follows:    Article 192: "The bill on partial amendments must specify  the titles, chapters, and articles to be amended, abrogated, or  added and explain the reasons; it must be submitted to a special  commission that will announce its decision within a period of 60  days. The bill on constitutional amendments will then be subject  to the procedures established for the creation of laws."    Article 195: "Amendments to constitutional laws will be made  in accordance with procedures established for partial amendments  to the Constitution." [passage omitted]</p>

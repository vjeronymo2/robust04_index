			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  "categorically" welcomed the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian  Serbs. At a news conference in Bonn on Thursday [10 February],  however, he stressed that the final decision about potential air  strikes remains with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.  According to the most recent information he has obtained,  Butrus-Ghali did not state -- in contrast to press reports --  that decisions have to be delegated to the UN Security Council,  Kinkel said. In the view of UN experts, there they would  probably be blocked by a Russian veto.    Kinkel explained the two stages of decisionmaking as  follows:    1. If Sarajevo is attacked again before the deadline  expires, British General Michael Rose, the local UN general,  would order countermeasures in coordination with NATO. It is  not certain whether General Rose has to consult with  Butrus-Ghali in this case.    2. If the heavy Serbian weapons are not withdrawn by 20  February, as demanded by the ultimatum, NATO will launch air  strikes as threatened, if such strikes have expressly been  demanded by the UN secretary general.    Kinkel placed great hopes on the possibility that the three  parties to the conflict, who met for a new round of negotiations  in Geneva on Thursday, will give in. Without the Serbs, the  Croats, and the Bosnian Muslims a political solution is  impossible. At the same time, the foreign minister announced  new contacts with the Americans, who, with the European Union,  are examining approaches for political solutions and want to  include the Russians, who strongly oppose military strikes, in  this.    An 18 February meeting in Athens between Moscow's Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and a delegation of European Union  ministers is still being examined. The so-called troika  consists of the foreign minister of the country that holds the  Presidency, that is, Greece, his predecessor, Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes, as well as his successor, Klaus Kinkel,  On 1 July, Germany will take over the Presidency. Diplomats  indicated that a meeting with Kozyrev will probably not be  possible two days before the expiration of the NATO ultimatum.    Kinkel said a repetition of the massacre of Sarajevo will  "not be tolerated." As soon as the deadline expires on 20  February, "unauthorized weapons systems will become the target  of air strikes." German participation, which goes beyond the  current help in air and sea monitoring as well as in  humanitarian supplies, is impossible because of the legal  situation and because of German history. Kinkel pointed to  military information, according to which NATO's AWACS  reconnaissance planes, which also carry some German crew  members, do not have anything to do with leading potential air  strikes.    So far, by paying 612 million German marks, Germany has  provided more help than any other nation, with the exception of  the United States. The FRG has accepted more than 400,000  refugees, Kinkel stated.</p>

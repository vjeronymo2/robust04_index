			<p>BFN     [Text] A nationwide poll conducted by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on  16 and 17 April revealed that 70 percent of the people feel  uneasy about North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development.  The number of respondents who answered that they would  "support" Japan's decision to cooperate with the United Nations  in imposing sanctions against North Korea if it continues to  reject nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), and if the United Nations decides to take some  kind of sanction, totaled 60 percent.    How to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear  arms development has become the most important task confronting  Japan. It is also a focal point of policy discussions among the  ruling coalition parties. However, the poll indicated that the  people are highly interested in this issue, and many of them are  of the view that the international community, with the United  Nations as the central figure, should take a decisive stand  against North Korea.    As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development, the total of respondents who answered they were  "very much interested" or "somewhat interested" reached 70  percent, exceeding by far the 27 percent who answered they were  "not so much" or "completely not" interested.    As for apprehension about suspected nuclear arms  development,  as many as 71 percent of those surveyed answered they "feel it,"  and only 23 percent said they "do not feel it." As regards the  question of whether Japan should cooperate with the United  Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea, 60 percent  said they would "support" and 24 percent said they would "not  support" the government's decision to cooperate.    It seems the people are highly interested in and feel  apprehensive about the issue due to the fact that, in addition  to Japanese disapproval of and precautions against nuclear  weapons, North Korea has developed missiles which can strike  most parts of Japan.    Asked why they supported Japan's cooperation in imposing UN  sanctions, 42 percent--the highest rate--said that North Korea's  nuclear development is a "threat to Japan's security." This was  followed by 31 percent who said North Korean nuclear arms  development "runs counter to international trends, including  reductions of nuclear weapons" and by 14 percent who said "North  Korean is ignoring UN agreements."</p>

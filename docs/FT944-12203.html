			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Hellenic Republic launches Y120bn samurai issue New eurobond issues were rare yesterday, with many European markets closed for holidays. However, activity is likely to increase dramatically over the coming days, with a number of borrowers tipped to be coming to the market. Spain's Comunidad Autonoma de Andalucia is expected to launch its debut eurodollar offering imminently. The issue, lead managed by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, is expected to be a Dollars 250m offering of 5 1/4 -year bonds, priced to yield around 40 basis points over US Treasuries, a market source said. Andalucia tapped the D-Mark and French franc sectors last year with five and 10-year offerings respectively. The Hellenic Republic yesterday launched a Y120bn offering of samurai bonds, targeted at Japanese investors. The offering, lead managed by Nomura, was divided into three tranches: Y60bn of four-year bonds offering a coupon of 5.05 per cent, Y40bn of seven-year bonds with a coupon of 6.1 per cent, and Y20bn of 15-year bonds offering a coupon of 7.1 per cent. Salomon Brothers and CS First Boston have been mandated to lead-manage the launch of the republic's first global eurodollar offering, which is expected to be launched after a series of road-shows next week. The offering is likely to be in the five-year area, market sources said. In the sterling sector, Irish Permanent, the former building society which was recently floated as a bank, launched a Pounds 100m offering of three-year floating-rate bonds offering a coupon of 10 basis points over three-month Libor. The closure of most European markets had little effect on the success of the offering, since it was supported primarily by UK institutional interest, with further demand from German investors, lead manager NatWest Markets said. Irish Permanent tapped the floating-rate sterling sector last year, and the proceeds from yesterday's offering will be used partly to repay a US dollar syndicated loan also launched last year, the lead manager said. There is currently firm demand for dollar issues, especially in the three-year area, a syndicate official at NatWest markets said. Other building societies in particular are keen buyers of the three-year sector, he said. The proceeds from the offering were believed to have been swapped into Irish punts. Beijing Expressways, a special purpose vehicle created by the infrastructure financing arm of the Beijing municipal government, is expected to launch a three-tranche Dollars 460m offering later this week, lead-managed by Lehman Brothers. The offering will involve five-year, 10-year and 12-year bonds. Also in the dollar sector, Banco Votorantim launched a Dollars 50m offering of three-year bonds, priced to yield 435 basis points over US government bonds, lead-managed by ING Bank.</p>

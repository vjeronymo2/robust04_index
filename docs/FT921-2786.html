			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Management: Flying off at a tangent Is Siemens going 'transnational'? Germany's electronics and electrical engineering giant has created quite a stir among organisation experts by deciding to locate the headquarters of its air traffic management (ATM) business in Britain, instead of its home country. On the face of it, the move might seem to place Siemens for the first time in the company of organisational pioneers such as ABB, IBM and Unilever. These have become transnationals (as distinct from mere multinationals) by transferring the base of at least one international product division away from their home base (or, in Unilever's case, its twin bases). But how big a break from Siemens' past practice really is the ATM decision? Unlike IBM, Siemens has not yet transferred the HQs of any of its global business groups outside its home base; it has 13 such entities, almost double IBM's number. What is less well-known is that at least six of the many business units beneath those groups in its structure have been dispersed abroad, mainly following acquisitions there. So in one sense the ATM decision is merely the latest in a growing list: Siemens talks openly of its intention to shift units' HQs to wherever the market or technology is most advanced (or demanding), and to the company's most obvious centre of competence. This was clearly the case for Siemens with ATM. The 'new' HQ location, Chessington in Surrey, was the existing home of Plessey Radar. Siemens bought it as part of its 1989 carve-up of Plessey with GEC, and it accounts for about 80 per cent of the ATM unit's revenues of about Pounds 100m. But in several senses the move is an important one. Siemens' ATM is the fastest growing unit within the group's defence electronics business group. It also now includes German-based research, development and manufacturing operations which have been specially carved out of three other parts of Siemens.</p>

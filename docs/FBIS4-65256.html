			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michel Bellemare (with AFP): "The Presence of </F> Neofascists Worries Europe"]    [Excerpt] The commentaries abroad, and especially in  France, on the new Italian Government have concentrated on  condemning the presence of neofascist ministers in the  Berlusconi team.    On Tuesday evening [10 May], during his television speech  and  when he did not yet know the exact number of portfolios held by  the neofascists, French President Francois Mitterrand  "regretted" their presence while recognizing "the Italians'  right to choose." "The first right to be respected," he  stressed, is that of a "people who have given large numbers of  votes to the neofascist party. I regret it, but I recognize the  Italians' right to choose, especially in view of the fact that  this neofascist party does not have a majority and I do not  think that this party can determine Italian policy." "We must,"  he concluded, "educate, advise, and speak in a friendly way to  the Italians, and I think it is nonsensical for us to declare a  `ban' on them."    This is a viewpoint which surprises Charles Millon. "I think  Francois Mitterrand was surprisingly moderate," the chairman of  the UDF [French Democratic Union] National Assembly group  stressed yesterday. As a member of the Foreign Affairs  Commission, he wants to go further: "The European Union [EU]  was built on a scale of values and on a concept of human rights  which refers to notions of freedom, equality, and respect for  the individual."    Consequently, he "wants and demands that the Italian  president should guarantee the Italian Government's respect for  these values." However, like former Socialist minister Jack  Lang, Charles Million "is not calling for the boycott or  ostracism (of the neofascist ministers), but for respect for  European values."    For his part, Dominique Baudis, head of the united UDF-RPR  [Rally for the Republic] list for the European elections, said  in a communique that the ministers of the other 11 EU countries  will have to be "extremely vigilant with regard to the  representatives of the Italian extreme Right. The entry into  the Italian Government of neofascist representatives is an  event, the gravity of which must be gauged."    While the RPR leadership remained silent on the subject,  there were many statements at Socialist Party [PSF] headquarters  on the "danger" presented by the presence of neofascists. Jack  Lang, former culture minister, expressed the hope in LIBERATION  on Tuesday that "through diplomacy, the French Government will  make it known that the French counterparts of the neofascist  ministers will not establish relations with them."  Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, PSF secretary for external  relations, yesterday called for a boycott and the establishment  of an "exclusion zone." As for First Secretary Michel Rocard,  he "greatly regretted that Italy has done this," but stressed  that it was necessary "to remember that the election was  democratic" and that "this is clearly a majority choice by the  Italian people. Nobody has the right to dictate to others."  [passage omitted]</p>

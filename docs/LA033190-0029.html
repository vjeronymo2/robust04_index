			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DMV IN N. HOLLYWOOD HALTS DRIVING TESTS  </P> <P> Officials of the state Department of Motor Vehicles announced Friday that they  will no longer offer the behind-the-wheel portion of the driver's license test  at their North Hollywood office because neighbors complained that the tests  generated too much traffic.  </P> <P> "We have had a considerable number of complaints since the office opened in  November, 1988, that the traffic in the area was disturbing them because there  was too much of it," DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said.  </P> <P> Between 25 and 35 people a day took the practical driving test at the office in  the 10900 block of Victory Boulevard.  </P> <P> Gengler said DMV officials hope that canceling the tests will alleviate some  congestion. "We want to be good neighbors," he said.  </P> <P> Gengler said he did not know whether such tests had been canceled at any other  DMV office, but said that in the past, the routes that examiners used had been  changed in response to neighbors' complaints.  </P> <P> The office will continue to provide all other driver's license and registration  services. Applicants needing a behind-the-wheel test will be directed to DMV  offices in Arleta, Van Nuys, Glendale or Hollywood, he said.  </P></p>

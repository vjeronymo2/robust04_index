			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Pucallpa, 14 Dec -- The vice minister of health, Dr.  Eduardo Yong Motta, claimed: "The incidence of cholera in our  country at present, compared with the cases that appeared in  1991 and 1992, has declined over 75 percent. This is due to the  fact that the population is taking care of its health."    He emphasized: "If the population continues to adopt  preventive measures of a hygienic and sanitary type, we shall  soon be able to state that cholera has been eradicated."    He stressed the importance of reiterating certain measures,  such as boiling water, protecting water supplies by chlorinating  them, washing fruits and vegetables, washing hands, and others.  <H5>  1994 Budget </H5>   He also reported that the Ministry of Economy and Finance  has  expressed an interest in supporting the Health Ministry, by  increasing the 1994 budget by 700,000 new soles. He explained  that this will enable the sector to deal more easily with the  health problems on the national level, especially those  associated with infectious-contagious diseases.    Yong preferred not to comment on the suspension of the state  employees' registration in the AFP [Pension Fund Associations]  ordered by the government. He remarked: "That comes under the  jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, not the  Health Ministry. I think that the measure should be analyzed and  assessed in its entirety, with the necessary good judgment, by  those who have issued these orders."    Yong Motta was in this city to inspect the status of the  Health Ministry's services in Pucallpa, and to coordinate  measures with the pertinent authorities.  <H5>  Health Policy </H5>   With the regional health director, Antonio Mundini Medrano,  he toured various settlements in the rural and riverside areas,  coordinating national health policy action that must be  implemented on the regional level.    According to the report, they also inspected the health  stations and centers, to assess the possibility of transferring  them to the future private health service organizations (OSS).</p>

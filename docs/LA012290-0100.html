			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BARRY LEAVES WASHINGTON FOR TREATMENT CENTER IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry, facing a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge, left the  nation's capital today to check into a residential treatment facility in  Florida, a city official said.  </P> <P> "At this point the mayor is not considering resignation," City Administrator  Carol Thompson told a news conference.  </P> <P> "There will be no management vacuum" in the mayor's absence.  </P> <P> Barry, who has turned over the daily control of the local government to  Thompson, did not speak to reporters before leaving his home.  </P> <P> "The mayor has left the city. . . . He has left for treatment," Thompson said.  She said it was "not appropriate" for her to disclose details of the mayor's  treatment. She said Barry would be doing that.  </P> <P> However, a top political aide to the mayor said Barry left for the  Hanley-Hazelden Treatment Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. Clinic spokeswoman  Patricia McRae said confidentiality rules forbid the clinic from revealing the  names of patients.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERRY, SHAW LEAD ROME IN DEBUT  </P> <P> Dressed in sweatpants and an Il Messaggero T-shirt as he sat in the lobby of  his team's hotel Tuesday, Danny Ferry wondered if basketball on Italy's  Tyrrhenian Coast would be much different than it is on the Atlantic Coast.  </P> <P> "I've heard the crowds here are worse than they are at Duke," he said.  </P> <P> "But not as clever," he was told.  </P> <P> "I don't know," he said. "I don't understand the language yet."  </P> <P> In last season's Italian League championship game, the fans in this port city  about 10 miles south of Pisa were so riotous when Enimont Livorno lost to  Philips Milan on a controversial call that the team has not been allowed to  play its first three games this season at home.  </P> <P> Home is the inappropriately named Sports Palace, a tired, old gymnasium that  seats 4,000 on concrete bleachers and looks like a World War II airplane  hangar.  </P> <P> It is shared by the city's other team, Pallacanestro Livorno. That is the team  that Il Messaggero struggled to beat, 91-90, Tuesday night in the opening game  of the Italian Cup, a round-robin tournament involving all 32 league teams that  runs concurrently with the regular season.  </P> <P> Pallacanestro, which means basketball in Italian, is the other team in every  sense of the word. Owned by a cooperative of small businessmen, it finished so  poorly in the standings last season that it has been relegated to the second  division. Pallacanestro is to Enimont as the Clippers are to the Lakers.  </P> <P> On the other end of the scale, if not yet the standings, Il Messaggero of Rome  is perhaps the world's richest basketball team. Its new owner is Raul Gardini,  the director of Gruppo Ferruzzi, an agricultural concern which did $18 billion  in business last year and was accused of attempting to corner the U.S. market  in soybeans.  </P> <P> Now Gardini is investing in U.S. basketball players. With only two foreigners  allowed per team, he went after two of the best available, Ferry and Brian  Shaw.  </P> <P> "Ferruzzi wants to be the best at whatever they do, basketball or soybeans,"  Ferry said.  </P> <P> Ferry, a 6-foot-10 forward who was the Clippers' first-round draft choice this  year out of Duke, signed a one-year contract estimated at $1.8 million. Shaw, a  6-6 guard who started last season for the Celtics as a rookie from UC Santa  Barbara, signed a one-year contract estimated at $1 million.  </P> <P> After eight exhibition games, Gardini finally had a chance Tuesday night to  discover whether his latest acquisitions would pay dividends in a game that  counted.  </P> <P> According to a local journalist sitting at courtside, the capacity crowd was  treating the game as a metaphor for the class struggle. But, to their credit,  the fans did not necessarily want to participate other than vocally. Besides,  they were separated from the court by a plexiglass restraining wall. There also  was substantial security.  </P> <P> The crowd was given hope when Pallacanestro went up by 10 points early in the  second half. But then Ferry and Shaw did what they are payed to do, scoring 22  of Il Messaggero's last 30 points. Shaw's three-point shot from 25 feet with 25  seconds remaining was the difference.  </P> <P> After missing last week's exhibition with an injured ankle, Ferry played both  forward positions and center. He had 30 points, nine rebounds, and three  assists. Shaw had 23 points and eight rebounds.  </P> <P> Ferry said that he was not surprised Pallacanestro raised the level of its game  against Il Messaggero.  </P> <P> "I saw the same thing, and Brian saw the same thing last year," he said.  "There's an aura about Duke and an aura about the Celtics. These teams will  have our pictures on the wall all year."  </P> <P> Il Messaggero's coach, Valerio Bianchini, said that he believes that his team  eventually will contend for the championship when all of the players get to  know each other. Only two players returned from last season's team, which  finished in the lower half of the standings. Bianchini also is new to the team.  </P> <P> "It's like we say, Rome was not made in one day," he said.  </P></p>

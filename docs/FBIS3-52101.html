			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mona Salem] </F>   [Text] Cairo, Jan 2 (AFP) -- The PLO said Sunday [2  January] it rejected Israeli "blackmail" over the resumption of  autonomy talks, after Israel warned that the organisation would  first have to accept a disputed Cairo document.    "We are not involved in negotiations in which ultimatums can  be issued," senior PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th told AFP.    "No side can accept such blackmail."    He said the "text presented by Israel as an accord is only a  draft working paper drawn up by the Israeli delegation and on  which the Palestinian delegation never gave its agreement."    But the Palestine Liberation Organisation is "serious in its  desire to reach a solution to the problems as quickly as  possible, if the other party shows the same will," he said.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin warned earlier that his  country would return to the autonomy talks only if the PLO  accepted the document drafted by negotiators in Cairo.    "We are not in a hurry, it's the Palestinians' turn to sweat  it out," Israeli state radio quoted Rabin as telling ministers  at the weekly cabinet meeting.    The Palestinians have called for new negotiations in the  Egyptian Red Sea resort of Tabah on Monday following  recriminations over whether any agreement was made during  negotiations in Cairo last week.    Israel announced Wednesday that the Palestinians had agreed  to a draft document which would give joint control of border  crossings and double the size of the autonomous area of Jericho  to about 60 square kilometres (25 sq. miles).    But the PLO denied any accord and the Israeli press has  reported that chairman Yasir 'Arafat is insisting on no Israeli  presence at points where Palestinians will cross into the  autonomous enclaves from Jordan and Egypt.    Israel alleged Palestinian negotiators had gone back on  their  word.    Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, who helped draw up  the Cairo document, said: "It is not definite if the talks are  to resume.    "If they are based on the understandings reached in Cairo,  they can go on, but for the moment there is no basis to pursue  them."    But Sha'th insisted that "only the paragraph concerning the  Jericho zone represents common ideas" and that the Israelis had  failed to take the Palestinians' views into account in the rest  of the document.    The paper was intended to review both points of view but the  Israelis left out "at least 60 percent" of what was verbally  agreed by the two sides, said the Palestinian negotiator.    Implementation of the September 13 PLO-Israeli autonomy  accord has been delayed by failure to agree mainly on the  withdrawal of the Israeli army, the size of Jericho and control  of crossings.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Small rally for sterling STERLING bounced back from the lows of the day after the government announced it was to postpone the closure of most of the 31 coal pits previously earmarked for shut down. But the rally was short lived and the pound closed over 2 1/2 pfennigs lower on the day at DM2.4200 as investors remained nervous about the UK's political and economic outlook. 'I think the seriousness of the economic situation and the deteriorating political backdrop have undermined sentiment towards the pound,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank. The announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, that only ten pits were to close was greeted scornfully by foreign exchange traders. 'The government can't even do a U-turn properly,' said one. 'I can see no reason for wanting to buy sterling.' The outlook for the currency looks bleak. Traders say they expect further rate cuts as the government reacts to pressure to boost economic activity, regardless of the implications for inflation. The next big hurdle for the government will be tomorrow's debate on the future of the coal industry. Traders will be watching closely, unconvinced that yesterday's climb down healed the rifts in the Conservative party. The pound also drifted lower against the dollar. It closed in London at Dollars 1.6320, 2 1/2 cents down on the day. Sentiment towards the dollar continued to improve cautiously in London yesterday although the currency struggled to build on Friday's gains against the D-Mark. The dollar failed to break through the DM1.49 level, closing in London at DM1.4835, not quite a pfennig higher on the day. Dealers expect the currency to trade within the DM1.45 to DM1.50 range between now and the presidential election on November 3. A victory by Bill Clinton appears to have been discounted by the markets and most expect it to strengthen after the election when, if the economy starts to recover, the Federal Reserve will be less likely to cut its discount rate. 'The dollar's long term outlook is one of increasing strength,' said Mr Eric Fishwick, analyst at IBJ International in London. In New York the dollar opened firmer against most currencies, but had its biggest gains against the pound. Rumours that currencies still in the European exchange rate mechanism would realign this weekend, when the European Community's monetary committee meets in Berlin, abated when the state secretary at the German finance ministry ruled one out. The speculation had centred on a devaluation of the Spanish peseta which closed in European trading at 70.45 per D-Mark compared with Friday's close of 71.39.</p>

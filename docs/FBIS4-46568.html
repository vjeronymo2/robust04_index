In 1949, he  graduated from VVMIU [Higher Naval Engineering School] imeni  F.E. Dzerzhinskiy, then served in the navy, and began working at  the TsKB in 1953. Many models of nuclear and diesel submarines  have been developed with Igor Dmitriyevich's participation and  under his guidance. Having become the TsKB chief, I.D. Spasskiy  fundamentally rejected the role of primary designer of  individual models and as Chief Designer is now involved with  resolving the primary issues.    Igor Dmitriyevich was awarded the rank of Hero of  Socialist Labor for success in the development of arms and  military equipment for the country's Naval submarine fleet, he  has been awarded four orders of the USSR, and he is a Lenin and  State prize laureate. In 1987, he was selected as an academician  of the USSR Academy of Sciences.    The Naval Equipment TsKB was created in 1926 from a small  collective at Baltiysk Plant. B.M. Malinin, who became the  primary designer of the first Soviet submarines, was the first  bureau chief. Already in 1928, the TsKB managed to develop the  first ship from the "Dekabrist" series. Six of these ships were  built during the period from 1928 through 1931. The  "Narodovolets", the second submarine of this series, has been  preserved to our days. It has been installed at Vasilyevskiy  Island in Galernyy Harbor on the territory of the exhibition  complex. They plan to open a pavilion through which entry into  the submarine will be accomplished on the 300th Anniversary of  the Russian Navy. Our TsKB is also participating in this work.    A number of series of submarines, specifically, series of  such famous submarines as "Shchuka" and "Malyutka" with which  the Pacific Ocean Fleet was equipped, were developed at the TsKB  prior to the Great Patriotic War. Nearly completed submarines  were shipped by railroad (on special flat cars) to the Far East  where they were completed because a special shipbuilding plant  had not been created there.    The largest submarine of the prewar period -- was the 14th  series "K" class submarine -- which could complete long-range  cruises. The submarines that were developed at the TsKB actively  participated in the Great Patriotic War but much has already  been written about that and there's no sense repeating that.    After the war, a number of diesel submarines were developed  that were in the Naval inventory for a long time. They were  designs 611 and 613. Approximately 200 of the latter design were  built. Later, many new classes of submarines were developed  based upon them, specifically, it is on them that we began to  familiarize ourselves with missile weapons. The idea of a single  engine that permits a submarine to be submerged for a prolonged  period of time was developed on design 615 submarines that  appeared after 1953.    At the beginning of the 1960's, submarines with nuclear  power  plants appeared but diesel submarines continued to be improved  in parallel. Specifically, modifications of design 613  submarines were armed with cruise missiles. The latest  diesel-electric submarine, developed at the TsKB --is the  "Varshavyanka" (NATO designation -- Kilo). We need to note one  other diesel electric submarine -- "Neptun". This is an  excursion ship designed for 40 passengers that can remain  submerged for nearly an hour. "Neptun", like other submarines  developed by the TsKB, was built by "Sevmash" Production  Association at Severodvinsk. Right now "Neptun" is being  utilized to attract tourists to the Antilles Islands.    Submarines with nuclear power plants, equipped with cruise  missiles and ballistic missiles, were also developed at the  TsKB. These submarines are known under the NATO designations  Oscar, Delta and others. The latest, the largest submarine is  the "Tayfun". The specifications of the submarines are listed in  JANES, the well-known weapons reference book.    If you compare our submarines with American submarines, we  need to say that many technical solutions are very similar but  there are differences in their architecture. We devote greater  attention to the missions of survivability due to the complexity  of accessing the open ocean.    Ballistic and cruise missiles are strategic submarines'  primary weapons. Domestically-produced missiles are heavier and  larger than their foreign equivalents with approximately  identical operating ranges. But we are striving to accommodate  the same number of missiles on our submarines as on foreign  submarines. Furthermore, domestically-produced onboard  electronic equipment is also heavier and larger. All of this  results in the fact that domestically-produced submarines are  larger than foreign submarines. Some of their specifications are  cited in the table.

out that right now the United States is  building strategic submarines only with nuclear power plants. By  the end of the century, these probably will be Ohio and Los  Angeles class submarines. In our country, we are proposing  building "Tayfun" and Oscar class submarines.    For a long time, our submarines had a high noise level and  therefore were easily detected by acoustic instruments. However,  during the last ten years, the noise level has been reduced and  has become the same as that of American submarines. In the  opinion of U.S. admirals, it has now become much more difficult  to detect our submarines.    For a long time the Maritime Equipment TsKB was the only KB  [design bureau] for the development of submarines in the  country. But two other KB's appeared in the USSR during the last  20-30 years: "Makhalit" and "Lazurit" which branched off from  our TsKB. During the time of the USSR's existence, approximately  1,000 submarines were handed over to the Navy, of them more than  80% were developed at "Rubin" TsKB.    Previously, our three KB's had a total of approximately  8,000  developers. In today's situation, that number of KB's and  specialists-developers of submarines is excessive as a result of  the appearance of the military concept of defensive sufficiency  and the drastic reduction of defense orders.    A similar situation is being observed not only in the sphere  of military shipbuilding but also in all directions of weapons  and military equipment. Some people are advocating the  maintenance of all military directions and all defense  enterprises. I think that this is incorrect and the main thing  -- impossible. First and foremost, we need to preserve the  scientific potential of the defense profile and to optimize the  structure of enterprises and the number of their workers.    That policy has been conducted in our KB for nearly five  years. We understand that military orders will be substantially  reduced and the productivity of design work is significantly  increasing due to its computerization. Based upon anticipated  orders from the Navy, we will be able to pay for the work of  approximately 1,000 people. We have begun to reduce the number  of KB workers. So, previously there were 4,000 designers in the  KB and right now approximately 2,000 are left. We are conducting  job placement for all of those people whose jobs have been  eliminated, primarily in the small enterprises that are being  formed around the KB and in other structures that are associated  with us. A submarine is a very complex structure that is  equipped with practically all types of equipment. If we are to  develop a good submarine, then we need to have good specialists  for each type of equipment and for each functional assembly, not  only for the structural profile but also for various spheres of  science and technology, and who analyze all of the processes of  that assembly's interaction with other functional assemblies and  systems. Proceeding from this, the number of designers must be  no less than 1,500-2,000 people.    So, it is impossible to count only on defense orders. While  resolving the problem of ensuring the enterprise's stability and  preserving the collective that is needed to develop a submarine,  we have followed that path which major foreign firms have long  followed: they have several different directions of activity.  Previously, they thought that three were adequate and now they  are orienting themselves on five directions. Then the firm will  be stable under any cataclysms. Figuratively speaking, they  stand on three (or five) legs. If one leg turns out to be  removed, the enterprise's stability is nevertheless preserved.    We at the TsKB have also begun to form other technical  directions that are oriented on the needs of the national  economy. Some of the TsKB's associates have transferred to these  directions, utilizing their rich experience as designers in  them. Generally speaking, it turns out to be useful for many  developers to sometimes change work profiles. They contribute  their ideas in the new direction which turn out to be very  productive here. So, a mutual enrichment occurs both of the  developers and of the technical directions to which they have  transferred.    We have noted several new directions of the TsKB's work. We  have rejected some of them and some were grabbed by other firms.  However, we have begun to develop at least three directions  besides submarine building.    First of all, I need to talk about the direction of the  development of high-speed rolling stock for the St.  Petersburg-Moscow Main Line. The TsKB has been involved with the  development of this project for approximately a year. During  that time, the cooperation of enterprises has been developed  both on the design and also on the production of high-speed  rolling stock and there are already a number of contracts. The  TsKB has managed to gain prestige among those design collectives  that were previously involved with these issues. Enterprises  that were previously not part of the military-industrial complex  have not managed to do this project because they were financed  based upon the residual principle and did not have the  capability to develop and retain good specialists, and so forth.  The best cadres were concentrated in military-industrial complex  enterprises and their involvement in national economic matters  has had a positive impact because they are introducing new  ideas. Not only our but also other defense enterprises have been  attracted to this direction. Specifically, VNIItransmash  [All-Union Scientific Institute of Machinery for  Transportation], the director of which is E.K. Potemkin, is  conducting the design of a special dolly. I think that we,  jointly with other defense complex enterprises and rail  transportation specialists from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and  Riga, are successfully resolving this task in which the Maritime  Equipment TsKB is performing the function of lead design and  coordinating center. The manufacture of rolling stock will be  conducted near St. Petersburg in the city of Tikhvin at the  Transmash plant that previously produced transmissions for  tractors and that accomplished some orders on a defense theme.  The plant has been equipped with modern equipment and has good  cadres and a technological culture. This enterprise will be the  lead enterprise and will receive components from subcontractors.  The Yakovlev KB has undertaken the design of the body from  aluminum alloys, the control panel, and so forth.    Our TsKB, as the lead design bureau, is involved with the  critical analysis of all issues associated with the construction  of the main line. The rail line has been laid through Novgorod.  This rail line will be specialized and slow rolling stock will  not move along it. They plan to attain rolling stock speeds of  up to 350 kph in order for a train to cover the distance between  St. Petersburg-Moscow in two hours. Launch of the rail line will  be carried out gradually: the first rolling stock must begin  movement already in 1996, indeed, its speed at the beginning  will be somewhat less (250 kph). By utilizing the experience of  the entire world (France, the United States, Japan and Italy)  during the critical analysis, we hope to introduce original  solutions to individual assemblies of the rolling stock that  permit us to improve their quality.    The second direction -- is the development of offshore  platforms for oil and gas production on the continental shelf.  This direction is close to our primary direction because these  platforms are equipped with all kinds of life support,  electrical and power systems just like submarines. We are  oriented on the Northern and Sakhalin areas. In the Sakhalin  area, we are working jointly with American, English and Japanese  firms. We did the technical and economic feasibility (TEO)  jointly with Americans in Houston. The technical and economic  feasibility has been approved, however, the leadership on  Sakhalin has changed right now and further work has slowed down  for the time being.    A great deal of work is being proposed in the Northern Area  -- the Shtokmanovskiy Oil Field in the Barents Sea. This oil  field is very large and oil production work can begin already in  the near future. Although we are encountering fierce competition  from foreign firms and everything is not clear organizationally,  this direction will mandatorily be actively developed and  significant forces of our TsKB will participate in it.    The third direction is associated with electric power.  Specifically, we are already participating on the Far East order  in the design of underground AES's [nuclear power plants]. I  think that this direction is the future of nuclear power  engineering. Only at first glance does it appear that these  AES's will be very expensive. However, they will occupy  substantially less space, we have found a simpler solution to  remove them from service, the safety of the plant itself is  being sharply increased, and so forth. Consequently, these AES's  will be even cheaper than surface AES's, if you take into  account their entire life cycle, including the stage to remove  them from service and scrap them.    These three directions have permitted us to preserve the  strength of our TsKB at approximately 2,000 people. Right now we  are acquiring a large shipment of computers that will increase  the labor productivity of designers and we will be able to  dismiss a few more workers. I think that the remaining  specialists will ensure the resolution of tasks in these three  directions and the main thing -- they will be able to  successfully continue work on our main profile -- the  development of submarines.    Right now, polemics are being conducted with regard to types  of nuclear weapon delivery platforms. The polemics indicate that  a shift to two types is possible: submarines and airborne  platforms. Therefore submarines remain promising for another  prolonged period of time and, consequently, we need to continue  to develop our primary direction.    As I have already pointed out, already five years ago the  TsKB leadership arrived at the conclusion that they had to  anticipate a substantial reduction of military orders and  searches began for possible paths to support the future TsKB.  For example, we built a business center. This is an entire  complex: a 100-room European-level hotel equipped with modern  communications systems and rooms for offices that have been  leased to businessmen. Right now we are building a restaurant, a  sports complex with a swimming pool, and a greenhouse in which  vegetables will be cultivated the whole year round. Utilizing  our previous experience of developing greenhouses on submarines  that are going out on cruises for a prolonged period of time, we  have already developed one greenhouse and we have adapted attic  rooms to do that. We annually conduct four harvests of  vegetables and we sell them to city restaurants.    The Council on Conversion, headed by Retired Admiral  Shcherbakov, has been created in St. Petersburg under the city  administration. I serve as deputy on this Council. In our city,  more than half of the work was in the defense complex. It is  difficult to restructure all of these enterprises to civilian  production.    We did a great deal of work on the development of a data  base  on the city's converted enterprises, the information on which we  gathered using specially created teams. We utilized the  experience of East Germany, where a similar data base was also  created. We have been working with a German firm for 2.5 years.  Information on converted enterprises has been gathered in a  separate book that has been published in English, entered into  an electronic information system and introduced into the  European Network. This helps to find foreign investors since all  of this was done in a form that is accepted in Europe and  America. I need to say that at first many foreign firms  displayed interest in our enterprises. However, the political  and economic instability in Russia and the absence of precise  laws is delaying this process. It is very difficult to operate  in that situation. How can you begin a new business venture if  the tax system has not been formed in the country. New laws are  continuously being adopted that transform all economic  calculations. What was profitable yesterday becomes unprofitable  today. Serious investors will not operate in this situation.    I need to say that despite the difficulties that arise, work  nevertheless continues. For example, Kirov Plant, jointly with  the Germans, has set up the production of tractors for farmers.  However, this work is still small. If "real" laws are adopted,  the investment process will broadly expand and not only in our  country. We will also be able to invest capital in the West and  obtain a profit both for ourselves and for the country as a  whole. We are counting on the fact that the required laws will  be adopted in Russia in the near future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "One More Step Toward Unity"] </F>   [Text] A meeting of the Political Executive Committee of  the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU [UCP-CPSU] Council and the  Secretariat of the Russian Communist Workers Party [RCWP]  Central Committee has taken place. Questions of joint actions  to implement the decisions of the 29th CPSU Congress and the  Third RCWP Congress were examined at it. The discussion  confirmed the unity of views of the UCP-CPSU and the RCWP on the  following basic issues:    -- the transfer of political power into the hands of the  workers and the restoration of the soviets as the highest form  of democracy;    -- the struggle against the restoration of capitalism, and  the country's return to the socialist path of development;    -- the repeal of the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements and  the restoration of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics.    The UCP-CPSU and the RCWP regard the ruling regime in Russia  and the imposed Constitution as antipeople elements and will  jointly endeavor to have the Constitution's adoption judged  unlawful at the Russian Federation Supreme Court.    In response to the propaganda hysteria surrounding the  political amnesty, participants in the meeting stated that they  categorically reject violence as a means of resolving social  problems. The UCP-CPSU and the RCWP consider that national  accord and the establishment of capitalism by force are  incompatible. It is not the political amnesty which is  provoking a civil war but unemployment, hunger, the plunder of  the people's property, the poverty of millions of working  people, and the monstrous enrichment of a few people.    The RCWP's admission to the UCP-CPSU as an associate member  is regarded as a step toward rallying the Soviet Union's  communists. It was noted that the unification of communists is  being hindered by the opportunist tendencies remaining within  it. It was emphasized that it is essential to concentrate  efforts on creating in the future a single Communist Party of  Russia based on Marxist-Leninist principles. Such a party could  take as its basis the current programs of the UCP-CPSU, the  RCWP, and other parties.    The path to the organizational unification of the communist  parties existing today lies in extending unity of action in the  struggle to defend the working people's interests. The UCP-CPSU  and the RCWP will use in this struggle all means and methods  (both parliamentary and extraparliamentary) known from the  practice of the world communist movement, and will consider the  development of an organized workers resistance [organizovannoye  rabocheye soprotivleniye] as a task of the utmost importance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Yuriy Sizov, Vladimir </F> Malyshev, and Yuriy Malinin]    [Text] Kerkira (Corfu), 24 Jun -- A full-scale document  comprising over 80 pages and translated into the 12 [as  received] languages of the EU [European Union] member-countries  has not yet been circulated in the press center in Kerkira.  However, ITAR-TASS correspondents have learned from circles  close to the Russian delegation that the main aim of the  agreement is to facilitate trade, investments, and harmonious  economic relations and to strengthen political and economic  freedoms.    It follows from the agreement that a permanent political  dialogue is being established between Russia and the EU, which  both countries intend to develop and make more active. The  document also envisages meetings between the Russian president  and the chairmen of the EU Council and Commission. A political  dialogue at parliamentary level is envisaged to be held twice a  year.    The agreement plans to set up a cooperation council, which  will monitor the implementation of this historic document. It  will comprise members of the Russian Federation Government and  leaders of the EU working bodies. A Parliamentary cooperation  committee is also being set up.    The 10 sections of the agreement pay special attention to  economic cooperation, including, in particular, articles on  trade in nuclear materials and financial and cultural  cooperation.</p>

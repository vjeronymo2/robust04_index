			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Incentive to sell cutlery unit INCENTIVE, the Swedish industrial and investment group dominated by the Wallenberg family, is to sell its Gense silver and stainless steel cutlery division to the Dutch company Corpeq. The move is another stage in Incentive's strategy to concentrate its industrial activities in the engineering sector. Gense remains Scandinavia's largest and one of Europe's leading makers of silver and metal-based serving materials with annual sales of around SKr260m (Dollars 45m). Corpeq is a diverse industrial group that also makes building materials, consumer products and hospital equipment, with annual sales of Fl 260m and around 1,200 employees. Gense will become part of its cutlery and stainless steel serving materials division which is the market leader in the Netherlands under the Van Kempen and Begeer name. Incentive was separated from the Swedish engineering company Asea early in 1991 and floated on the Stockholm bourse last July. In the restructuring of the company, up to seven segments of the old Incentive, accounting for around a quarter of its profits, are to be divested.</p>

The parents of chief culprit Wu Lihong [0702 3680 1347]  returned home on the evening of 21 April. Wu's father is 58  years old this year, and his mother is 56 years old; both are  farmers. There are five brothers and sisters in the family, Wu  being the youngest son. He has an elder brother and three  married elder sisters. His brother graduated from the Hangzhou  Armed Police Corps Cadet School and is now an armed police corps  officer.    The Wus' house is located at Qianjiao village, Tongziwu  township in Chunan County, by the side of Qiandao Lake. Six  years ago, Wu's father spent some 10,000 yuan to build a new,  six-room two-story house, with a floor space of some 170 square  meters. According to Wu's father, his youngest son was an  introvert in temperament, and had been good at his studies since  he was young. Later, through an entrance examination, he was  admitted to a local key high school, Qinghan Middle School.  Later, he failed the entrance examination for senior middle  school, being 10 points short. Consequently, he studied at home  for two years and took the entrance examination again, but  failed it once again. Last April, Wu borrowed 8,000 yuan from  his elder brother, and another 2,000 from his father and a  friend; in addition he took out a loan of 15,000 yuan. With  this money, he purchased a 25-horsepower Shuixing-brand  speedboat, thus starting his business of carrying tourists on  the lake. Toward the end of last year, he sold the speedboat,  and spend 68,000 yuan to purchase a 75-horsepower Yamaha 70-seat  speedboat, in partnership with his good friend, Yu Aijun [0151  1947 6511], (another culprit in the same case), with which they  continued the business of carrying tourists. Wu's father said  that before the incident took place, Wu Lihong was doing  business in the town of Qiandaohu, and seldom came home. He  knew of his son's bad habit of gambling, but he knew nothing  about his son's heinous crime.    Wu's father said that a person should bear sole  responsibility for his adtions, and he had a grasp of this  truth. Now that his son had committed a heinous crime, it  served him right to received a stern legal penalty. The old man  had faith in the people's government.    An accomplice of Wu Lihong was 23-year-old Yu Aijun [0151  1947 6511], a native of the city of Jiangde, in Zhejiang  Province. He had been a soldier, and when apprehended, was  wearing a worn Army uniform without insignia; he was a very  handsome young man, at that.    The other culprit was 24-year-old Hu Zhihan [5170 1807  3466],  a native of Chunan County, Qiandaohu Town. He was small in  physique. His father worked at the Chunan Agricultural Bureau.  During the trial, he sat with his legs crossed, making a  confession of his crime behind iron bars. He was very logical  when he spoke, and was the most eloquent of the three culprits.    The three culprits used to be schoolmates. During the trial,  all of them looked and spoke with very clear train of thought.  They told the police that they had worked on the plan for six  months or so, and did not expect their case to be discovered;  they expressed admiration for the police.</p>

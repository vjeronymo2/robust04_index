			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Don't panic on executive pensions SOME life companies think they have found a new way to sell executive pension plans. The Inland Revenue has announced that the rules governing contributions to EPPs - available only to company directors and high-ranking executives - may be too generous. It is considering tightening them. Several companies have used this as an excuse to push executives and companies towards taking out the schemes. They are acting prematurely. The Inland Revenue this week made it clear that no decisions had been reached; it is not yet clear that any change will be made. There is certainly no timescale. The Association of British Insurers (ABI), which is in confidential talks with the Revenue on behalf of the pensions industry, has taken a similar attitude. A spokesman said: 'It is quite clear that nothing has been decided. If anyone is putting about that things have been decided, then that's wrong.' Neither side denies that discussions are taking place, prompted by the Revenue's desire to tighten the rules. The Revenue has been stirred into action by the high benefits that executives are able to earn: pension contributions can be set as a level amount rather than a proportion of current salary, allowing young executives to put away huge proportions of their income. This was allowed because it was assumed executive salaries would rise significantly before retirement. Under the current rules, a 30-year old starting an executive scheme can make contributions equal to 110 per cent of salary. This could be cut to 35 per cent. Individuals can also walk away from the schemes, taking their entire fund value with them. If they retire early or if the scheme is wound up, directors can take excessive benefits in retirement. So the Revenue's disquiet is understandable. If, as seems likely, the regulations are tightened, it could pay directors and companies to set up schemes with high contributions sooner rather than later. It is still unclear, however, what the new regulations would be. They could even be retrospective, making action now pointless. Regrettably, this has not prevented some life offices from using the change as a chance to sell. For example, advisers Chamberlain De Broe received a mailshot from NPI headed: 'For You: A New Sales Opportunity.' It goes on: 'As you know, the Inland Revenue is soon to impose dramatic new changes which will affect the method of funding for Executive Pension Plans and possibly Small Self-Administered Schemes too.' Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe, said: 'We are getting tired of watching the industry deservedly earning its poor reputation by pushing something which a) might not be appropriate and b) might anyway be vitiated by the Revenue rules.' In a gloomy economic climate, committing yourself at the age of 30 to regular payments of more than you are earning could be dangerous. Companies are also advocating that people start regular premium contracts to establish an arrangement before the Inland Revenue can change the rules. However, an inflexible contract that calls for regular premiums, at a rate which is in excess of your current salary, could soon impose an unwieldy strain. And Bolland notes that it is needlessly expensive. For a man earning Pounds 35,000, the maximum contribution could be Pounds 50,000, he says, generating a commission, if on a regular premium basis, of about Pounds 26,000 in the first year. Insurance companies could charge for a regular contract on a single premium, rather than a regular premium, basis. This would work out much cheaper for the investor. Bolland admits that the schemes can be very tax-efficient, but only at the expense of flexibility. He says: 'There are, no doubt, many companies that set up this type of scheme on high contributions in good times, before the recession, and have since found that cash flow has prohibited those levels of payments from being maintained. The bottom line is a profoundly detrimental penalty system.' Making contributions on a single premium basis, for younger directors, or, for those nearing retirement, a regular premium contract on a single premium basis, are sensible actions for those worried about the change in the pipeline. If any brokers or salesmen try a more robust approach, remember that the Revenue is still not committed to doing anything at all, and that the ABI has said no decisions have been made and rebuked members for using the moves as a sales pitch.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A security official from the office of the mayor of  Sanaa, the capital, has reported that the casualty toll from the  Scud missile fired yesterday evening by the renegade,  secessionist gang in the Socialist Party leadership has reached  120 people killed or wounded, mostly women and children. The  missile fell in a densely populated residential neighborhood.  Rescue teams are still searching for survivors believed to be  buried under the rubble of the four houses that were leveled.  Numerous houses across a wide radius around the bombing site  also suffered substantial damage.    The missile, which hit one of the poorer districts of Sanaa,  was the 23d to target the capital since the war was triggered by  al-Bid and his separatist coterie. This is in addition to those  that were launched on other civilian installations and the  population in Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Makha, and the Rahidah  Hospital.    The source indicated that the horrific and murderous action  killed or wounded newborns and caused miscarriages. The victims  included a physician whose fingers on his right hand were blown  off while on duty at a nearby hospital.    The security source condemned the action as a treacherous,  gruesome crime. He also condemned the traitor al-Bid's threat  at a news conference of further Scud missile attacks at  innocents and civilian establishments in Sanaa and other Yemeni  cities. This kind of threat, the source said, shows that al-Bid  and his secessionist band are consumed with such hate that they  will not hesitate to perpetrate the most gruesome of crimes  against defenseless innocents comparable to their atrocities  against the homeland and its unity.</p>

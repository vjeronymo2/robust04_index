			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Few corners to cut: The chancellor's dilemma: an inside view The best way to reduce public borrowing would be to cut public spending, because there is no doubt that it would work. The alternative, raising tax rates, is considered a poor second-best by financial markets. They worry that high tax rates damage incentives, reduce growth and may not produce the hoped-for extra yield. Unfortunately, cutting public spending is more easily said than done. General government expenditure has grown, year in year out, for 30 years, regularly coming in above target. That was true even under the Thatcher governments, dedicated to reining in public spending, when 'the cuts' became a fact of life and were blamed for everything from shortages of school books to potholes. But Mrs Thatcher's approach to public spending, based on plans, did achieve a reduction in its rate of growth in real terms. (Public spending grew more slowly than the rate of inflation in the late 1980s when unemployment, and associated benefits, started to fall.) It also reduced the share of national income devoted to public spending. That was a historic achievement, because (as the chart shows) public spending has tended to take an increasing share of GDP since the war. Earlier Conservative governments had at best managed to hold the share constant, while Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s presided over some spectacular increases. However, the most important influence on the public spending share is not the complexion of the government. It is the economic cycle. The share has risen especially sharply in recessions (1966, 1975, 1980). It fell steadily in the long boom of the 1980s, but has risen again sharply in the recession of the early 1990s. So after a decade of 'cuts', the public spending share is now actually higher than when Mrs Thatcher took office, and only 2 per cent lower than in the recession of the early 1980s. The political result is that the government is now accused of inadequate provision of public services by Labour and of inadequate control of spending by its own back-benchers. Both sets of charges seem to stick. Why? The answer lies in the way public spending is planned. Fine-sounding, but vague, commitments appear in election manifestos. These are costed in the sponsoring departments. The costs are then added up by the Treasury and compared with the total in the Budget. Invariably departmental bids exceed available cash. That is when we read that 'the Treasury demands cuts'. Every department then goes into the bleeding stumps routine, briefing friendly journalists on the appalling consequences for their programmes of meeting Treasury demands. The aim is to strengthen the hand of their minister in the cabinet battle to set public spending priorities. The usual outcome is that the Treasury allows some increase in the public spending ceiling, but not enough to accommodate all bids. The losers thus complain bitterly about 'cuts', on which they blame any shortcomings in the service they are supposed to provide. This time-honoured ritual ensures that, while spending plans are revised steadily upwards, the public only hears about cuts. Few understand the crucial difference between cuts from bids, and cuts in plans. The former happen every year. The latter almost never. That has implications for the problem of the Budget deficit. To reduce it requires cuts in spending plans. The cabinet decision on public spending in June, billed the toughest for 15 years, promised large cuts in bids but not in plans. This does nothing to reduce the huge borrowing requirement over the next few years. It only stops it getting worse. Why do the costs of meeting existing commitments rise so inexorably? Inflation can obviously make it difficult to stick to plans drawn up in cash terms. Demographics is a commonly cited factor: an ageing population costs more in pensions and health spending. The difficulty of improving productivity in the jobs-for-life public sector culture is also often blamed. These are important factors, but inflation has not been a problem recently, while demographics have been reducing the number of children to be educated. That has not stopped the education budget from drifting upwards along with the health budget. In these two areas, rising expectations put continuous upward pressure on spending. The point about health and education is that, if they were left to the markets, spending on them would probably be higher. The richer people get, the more they want to spend on these services. The effect is not apparent if we compare one year with the next, but it is blindingly obvious if we compare today's levels of provision with what was available shortly after the war. At that time, 'free education' meant learning the three Rs in a draughty class room with bare floors inadequately heated by an open fire. The school-leaving age was 14 and few went to university. Today the idea of free education embraces philosophical discussions in comfortable seminar rooms in purpose-built universities. The school-leaving age is 16 and one in four goes on to higher education. Rising expectations are even more apparent in the health service. Early postwar triumphs consisted in curing some infectious diseases with the new wonder drug penicillin and limiting the spread of others by mass inoculation. Since then, technical progress has given us open heart surgery and liver dialysis, available at doctors' discretion on the national health. We are starting to debate whether cosmetic surgery - including removing self-inflicted tattoo marks - should be available on national health. The rising costs of public provision in health and education thus reflect steadily rising standards, demanded most vociferously by the articulate middle classes. It will require a radical new approach to curb them. But the pressure on spending from health and education is dwarfed by the huge increase in the social security budget. That is the real cuckoo in the nest, and requires even more radical treatment. I shall return to the subject next week.

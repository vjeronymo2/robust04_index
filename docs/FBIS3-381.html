The area  was recaptured by the Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] a few days ago.  UNITA has been shelling the area from Zairian territory. On  the situation in Cabinda FAA's Colonel Manuel Paiva said:    [Begin Paiva recording] UNITA has been carrying out  offensive  movements, particularly in northern Cabinda Province. This has  caused certain instability at (Candozinsi) and (Chombo). UNITA  troops, coming from Zaire, have been shelling areas and carrying  out terrorist actions, ambushes, and attacks on government  positions in those areas.    In response, our forces expelled the enemy in certain areas,  notably Chimbuande and Choco. In brief, we can say that the  political and military situation is relatively calm, since our  forces were able to put the enemy on the defensive and establish  greater tranquility and security in northern Cabinda.

There is muttering, an abandoning of  serious argument, and a lot of bad temper, with people saying  that nothing good can come of this electoral campaign which, if  one listens to the forecasts, sees the League-Forza Italia pole  speeding like a freight train across the Lombard prairie.    What does Professor Gianfranco Miglio think of this? Miglio  was one of the first, months ago, to warn the League against the  danger of so many former Christian Democrats and former  Socialists jumping onto the Berlusconi bandwagon. "At the end  of all this we will, as always, have our usual major success in  Lombardy, and Silvio Berlusconi will also be discreetly  successful. But I have observed that his team, in fact, has  made slightly hurried choices. They have been precipitous and  frivolous, and have chosen people who are visibly  remote-controlled by the old Christian Democratic bosses.  Although I have to recognize one thing."    [LA REPUBBLICA] What, professor?    [Miglio] In a country in which everyone was Christian  Democrat, even the dogs and cats, it becomes very difficult  indeed to find anyone who did not compromise with the DC  [Christian Democratic Party]. I still feel that with a bit of  patience they could have found other people and they recognize  this. But they had very little time, with the obvious  consequences. Right now that is the reaction among the League,  which is ultimately a good thing.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And why?    [Miglio] Because it shows that the League is not like I  slightly feared, given their largely Christian Democratic  origin. They are not people disposed to compromise, they react  very negatively to the prospect of having to set aside the  League's program. In fact we are finding that the League is  very stubborn.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Professor, you are not one of those who  believe that, ultimately, the League could end up weakened by  the agreement with Silvio Berlusconi?    [Miglio] No, because those who used to say: "I like the  League's principles, but not the League's members, because they  are coarse and churlish," are now voting for Berlusconi and in  this way their votes are going to the alliance.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In the meantime [Northern League Secretary]  Bossi continues to prick his Forza Italia ally.    [Miglio] Excuse me, is your conception of the alliance like  the way people used to see marriage? A union for life, until  death? This is rubbish. We are talking about something else.  Both the progressive line-up and our own have made purely  electoral agreements. And our alliance will last until the  evening of 28 March.    [LA REPUBBLICA] And then, Professor Miglio, what will  happen?    [Miglio] Then we shall see how many votes and what cards  everyone holds and the game will begin. And we will see how the  elected representatives will vote in parliament, whether the  Popular Party people, [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni's  people, and the DC people who have wormed their way into  Berlusconi's party, will hear the same tune and vote together.</p>

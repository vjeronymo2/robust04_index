			<p>BFN     [Text] The appointment of Mr. Arthur Chaskalson as  president of the constitutional court has been welcomed by  political parties and legal organizations. The announcement  that a commission is to be named to appoint other members of the  court has, however, been greeted with caution. The legal  organization [not further specified] says the appointment of Mr.  Chaskalson, a respected senior advocate from Johannesburg, is a  blessing, and the commission represents a fine legal balance  which will guarantee the appointment of independent members of  the constitutional court.    The National Party has welcomed the appointment of Mr.  Chaskalson, but has pointed out that nine of the 13 members of  the commission are ANC sympathizers. The Democratic Party has  also welcomed it, but also pointed out hat Mr. Chaskalson had  close links with the ANC.</p>

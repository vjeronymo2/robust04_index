			<p>BFN     [Text] Paraguayan Central Bank [BCP] President Jacinto  Estigarribia and members of the BCP board of directors have met  with members of the Senate's Constitutional Affairs and Foreign  Relations Committees to examine the text of the agreement on the  laundering of drug trafficking money which was signed by our  government and the U.S. Government.    The agreement reflects the BCP position establishing that  the  parties directly involved are the U.S. Treasury Department, the  BCP, and the Paraguayan Finance Ministry.    The agreement also establishes that the BCP will be  responsible for providing information whenever required on  foreign exchange operations, either because there is suspicion  something irregular has occurred or because the case is under  investigation in both countries.    The president of the BCP said the bank is already  implementing controls on foreign exchange operations.  "Commercial banks and foreign exchange companies regularly  provide information on all operations over $10,000 to the Banks  Superintendency. The list includes the name of the person  purchasing or selling those dollars, his address, and his  identity card number. That information is currently available  at the Banks Superintendency," Estigarribia explained.    The agreement says this is precisely the type of information  the parties are committed to provide if there is a concrete  request or if there are doubts on certain operations.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Claverhouse raising up to Pounds 110m in conversion issue FLEMING Claverhouse is raising up to Pounds 100m via an offer of conversion shares. The investment trust is only expecting to receive between Pounds 25m and Pounds 35m but has set a high maximum so that applications do not have to be scaled down. The shares have been trading at a premium to net asset value - 5.3 per cent at the start of dealing yesterday - a sign that demand exceeds supply. Issuing new shares may eliminate the premium. The directors believe that the potential for economic recovery in the UK provides attractive opportunities for investment and it is an appropriate time to expand the capital base. The trust is the top performer in its sector over both three and 10 years, with growth of 579.7 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income reinvested) over 10 years. It is attractive to private investors, who now own nearly 65 per cent of the equity. The shares, issued at 100p each, will be converted into ordinary shares once the proceeds of the offer are invested. This is designed to ensure that existing shares do not suffer any dilution in net asset value, and is now a common structure for investment trust share offerings.</p>

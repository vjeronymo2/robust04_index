According to official newspapers, since June 1992, the six  priests, including Hsia Yu, have entered Fujian repeatedly,  carrying large quantities of "Tien-tao" classics and ceremonial  equipment under the cover of making investments and running  factories. They have made wide contacts with possible followers  and propagated "Tien-tao" teachings everywhere. They did not  hesitate to spend large sums of money to support the  construction of pulpits. They set up eight fixed altars and one  temporary altar in eight places, including Zhuanghu Lane and  Donghu Road in downtown Quanzhou, the town of Fuqiao, the city  of Nanan, Huian County, and the city of Zhangzhou and recruited  more than 400 followers.    On 17 April this year, while once again making their way  into  Fujian and conducting activities there, the six priests,  including Hsia Yu, were caught red-handed.    The Quanzhou police are currently interrogating and  educating  the six priests, including Hsia Yu. Altar masters at home,  including Xu Huilian, were given subpoenas and education and  were ordered to remove their pulpits.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Belgrade warns Bosnian Serbs Serbia, facing the prospect of stiffer sanctions, threatened yesterday to sever relations with the Bosnian Serbs if they continued to reject the latest international peace plan. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic told the Bosnian Serb leaders that failure to accept the plan unconditionally would amount to 'treason' and 'crimes against their own people'. Mr Milosevic's strong message was praised by Russian and British officials. Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, Mr Vitaly Churkin, raised the possibility that sanctions against Belgrade could be lifted if it broke with the Bosnian Serbs. Also yesterday, Serb and Moslem forces clashed across Bosnia, and in the north-western enclave of Bihac, forces loyal to the Moslem government intensified their attack on a rebel Moslem faction.</p>

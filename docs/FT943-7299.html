			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / People: Brian Yates: the new consumers' champion The new chairman of the Consumers' Association, publishers of Which? and related magazines, is Brian Yates, a chartered engineer who runs a division of a Loughborough company making cranes and lifting systems. With a brief interruption, Yates, 49, has sat on the Consumers' Association council since 1986, and has been chairman of the operating company for the past two years. The opportunity to chair the holding company arose when his predecessor, Phillip Whitehead, decided to run for the European elections in June. Both chairmanships are unpaid. For those who would contend that the 37-year-old association has had its day, Yates, of course, has a ready answer. 'We may not be testing pop-up toasters, but our relevance is undiminished,' he contends, pointing out that there are plenty of battles to be fought on behalf of the consumer throughout the service industries. While testing will remain an important part of the association's work, the new chairman is also interested in using technology to 'improve the delivery of information', for instance, via interactive terminals at shopping centres. Yates reckons his manufacturing background is a considerable asset. 'People often say the association is against the supply side of business. That is not true.' He has worked at Morris Mechanical Handling for the past 10 years, and is now on the board of the company that was sold to its management by Trafalgar House in May. He advises companies on ways of improving productivity through computer automation. The CA is also poised to choose a new chief executive to succeed John Beishon, whose controversial term comes to an end when he turns 64 in November. An announcement is expected next month.</p>

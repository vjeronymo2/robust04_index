			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Clarke's full agenda The City knew before last night that Mr Kenneth Clarke is a man of considerable political skill. That skill was again in evidence in his Mansion House speech, with its rallying call to business and its emphasis on growth as well as fiscal and monetary rectitude. What remains unclear is whether Mr Clarke also has the special qualities required of a chancellor. The speech was short on detail and left policy options open. It left his audience guessing about the true importance attached to the exchange rate as an indicator. Mr Clarke was tantalisingly vague about the extent to which further fiscal tightening will be necessary. To be fair, he was unlikely to box himself so soon. The new chancellor may also want to avoid undermining confidence in the recovery by parading his hair shirt, if he was wearing one underneath the white tie and tails. But at some stage he will have to face the fact that, without a further attack on the PSBR in this autumn's Budget, the twin objective of growth with low inflation could well be lost. For the time being, the City will have to take it on trust that action will be taken. Thus far, the government's funding programme has proceeded relatively smoothly, but only because real yields are high and gilts are trading at an attractive 130 basis point premium to German bunds. At least Mr Clarke showed he is aware of the cost of borrowing at 8 per cent when inflation is well below two. If the government really means to keep price rises that low, it is getting a very bad deal indeed.</p>

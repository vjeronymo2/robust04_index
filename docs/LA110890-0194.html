			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> ABSENTEE VOTES MAY DECIDE COUNCIL SEAT  </P> <P> Absentee ballots may decide who fills one City Council seat, with Wednesday's  election tallies showing incumbent Walter Bowman leading challenger Chuck Hicks  by just 213 votes.  </P> <P> Bowman, a real estate agent, placed third in the race behind former Councilman  Richard Partin and challenger Joyce Nicholson.  </P> <P> It was Bowman's first test at the polls since being appointed to the council in  June, 1989, by a court order.  </P> <P> "In the past we haven't had a lot of deviation" from election night totals,  City Clerk Lillian Haina said. "But you never know."  </P> <P> Hicks said he didn't think the absentee ballots would make a difference in the  race. "I am happy with the campaign that I ran," he said.  </P> <P> The final tally should be available by next Tuesday, Haina said.  </P> <P> Three four-year terms were up for grabs in Tuesday's election. Councilwoman  Margaret M. Arnold decided not to seek reelection and Councilman John Kanel was  prohibited from running again because of the city's limit of two terms for  council members.  </P> <P> Nicholson, also a real estate agent, led all candidates in the balloting. She  has been active in the city for several years and is president of Concerned  Citizens of Cypress, a powerful grass-roots group.  </P> <P> "I am so happy," said Nicholson. "I was just hoping to place."  </P> <P> However, Nicholson's strength wasn't enough to carry challenger John  Standiford, who ran on a slate with her. Standiford, a former staffer with  state Sen. Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), finished last, behind Judith Pineda.  </P> <P> Voters also defeated a proposal to re-establish the city's defunct Planning  Commission. The commission was abolished several years ago to offset  Proposition 13 cutbacks. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

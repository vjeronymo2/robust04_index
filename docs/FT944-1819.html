			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Caribbean carnival At the Cochrane Theatre, the black Talawa company has found another offbeat Christmas show to stage. This year it is Sylvia Wynter's Maskarade, with music by Olive Lewin, which recreates a Jamaican street festival known as 'Jonkunnu'. (Nobody is quite sure why, but it may commemorate a man called John Canoe.) For colour and verve, Yvonne Brewster's production scores high; there is a certain intelligibility problem with the Jamaican dialect, but that rather enhances the exotic charm of the piece. The setting is Kingston in 1841, a year in which the Mayor rashly decided to ban the Jonkunnu parade. The civil disorder that resulted barely crops up in Maskarade, however, for it is not a political show. In the first act we watch the local citizenry preparing for the carnival, planning their costumes, jockeying for the best roles in the mummers' play; in the second, we get the play itself, declaimed in quaint rhetoric amid a swirl of fantastical costumes. Those, like the stereotyped folk-characters who prance and revel in them, carry half-remembered echoes from all over: Africa, courtly Europe, pure local fantasy. The cast of ten - all-singing, all-dancing  - project everything with terrific gusto, even when what they have to say is opaque to non-Caribbean ears. (The Caribbean part of the audience relished many things that passed the rest of us by.) This is a thoroughly professional cast, by the way, not just talented amateurs, and any West Indian connections they have probably go back a generation or two. There are a lot of appealing songs, simple and mostly short, accompanied by a trio sitting high on one side of Ellen Cairns' pretty set (an arrangement of screens and straw carnival-figures). There are lively fusillades of drumming. The whole show takes less than two hours, and ends with a touching lament. Children might mind not being able to figure out just what, exactly, is going on; but if they don't, they will probably enjoy everything else about Maskarade.</p>

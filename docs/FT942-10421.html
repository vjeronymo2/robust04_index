			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's inflation falls below 1% Norway's inflation rate continued its fall from a March 1987 peak of 10.4 per cent a year to reach a new low of 0.9 per cent in April 1994. The consumer price index rose by only 0.1 per cent in April from March and 0.9 per cent from April last year, according to the central statistics bureau. The 0.1 per cent rise in consumer prices in April followed an 0.5 per cent gain in March, the bureau said. The Spanish government achieved its best budgetary performance this decade, narrowing the deficit by a provisional 20 per cent to an accumulated Pta599bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the first four months of 1994. This compares with Pta744bn in the same period of 1993 and follows a surprise surplus of around Pta14bn in April, the Finance Ministry announced yesterday. The Bundesbank yesterday revised German M3 money supply growth through March to a seasonally adjusted and annualised 15.4 per cent rate from the preliminary 15.2 per cent rate reported last month. The National Bank of Poland lowered its obligatory rate at reverse repurchase auctions by 0.5 percentage points to 26.5 per cent for one day deals. This signals that official interest rates will be cut, a senior banker said yesterday. French industrialists expect an increase in investment this year of 3 per cent in value terms following a 15 per cent drop in 1993, the National Statistics Institute said yesterday.</p>

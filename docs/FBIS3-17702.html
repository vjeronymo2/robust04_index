Boris Yeltsin Focuses on Peace and  Food"]    [Excerpt] Leaving Sochi on Sunday, the president singled  out three objectives of primary importance that he is going to  deal with right upon his return to Moscow -- the completion of  the work on the mechanisms of implementing the presidential  message to the parliament, the drafting of an agreement on civil  peace, and the revision of new customs tariffs with a view to  lowering them. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that a draft  agreement, which had been drawn up by a group under Boris  Topornin, director of the Institute of State and Law, was  presented to Boris Yeltsin yesterday. Work on the mechanisms of  implementing the presidential message is going on. As for food  importers, they will apparently have to be patient.  <H5>  Boris Yeltsin To Revise Civil Peace Agreement </H5>   "Version No. 0" of the Agreement on Civil Peace and Accord,  which had been drawn up by Boris Topornin's group (see  KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 26 March), was seriously revised last  weekend. According to unofficial reports, the text of the draft  agreement (which, in the drafters' view, should not be made  public before it is studied by the president) has been cut to  nearly one-half of its original size: many declaratory  provisions, already set forth in the Constitution and Russian  laws, have been deleted.    There have been qualitative changes, too. The latest version  of the "universal peace pact" as of yesterday no longer included  the term "Third-Party Public Court," which, under initial plans,  was to be made responsible for monitoring the implementation of  the agreement and vested with the right publicly to demand that  violators be removed from office or give up their deputy powers  voluntarily. Now these functions have been given to the  Conciliatory Commission, to be made up of representatives of the  president, the government, State Duma factions, and political  activists, and designed to work out mechanisms of the phased  implementation of the agreement.    The working group has decided that a two-year moratorium on  amending the Constitution should not be included in the draft  and that it will be replaced with the proposal that "changes  destabilizing the situation in society not be made to the  Constitution." Provisions regarding the moratorium on changing  the status of regions and concluding bilateral treaties between  them and the federal authorities have been retained, as has the  trade unions' obligation not to call strikes for the purpose of  reallocating budget revenues.    It is hard to predict how much time Boris Yeltsin will need  to comprehend the draft agreement and with which provisions of  it he may disagree. At the same time, the question of the  sequence of signing the agreement has not yet been resolved, and  the Public Chamber's meeting to discuss it, initially scheduled  for 2 April, will be postponed at least for a week,  KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned.

In  the promotional video entitled "The Plutonium Story: Pluto-Boy,  Our Reliable Friend," there is a scene where an animated  character representing a little boy drinks water containing  plutonium. In her letter, O'Leary has urged the PRNFC to  withdraw its videotapes. The PRNFC has admitted receiving the  letter.    The PRNFC produced 200 videotapes last spring to publicize  the current situation regarding its use of plutonium as nuclear  fuel. In the video, an animated character called "Pluto-Boy"  appears and explains the harmlessness of plutonium. There is a  scene where Pluto-Boy drinks water containing plutonium, saying  that "even if plutonium is ingested along with water, the body  discharges it, hardly absorbing any of it."    O'Leary sent a letter dated 7 February to Takao Ishiwatari,  president of the PRNFC, urging him to consider withdrawing the  videotapes. In the letter, O'Leary said: "There have been  reports (about the videotapes) in many U.S. newspapers. To say  that it is safe to drink water containing plutonium is a gross  underestimation of the dangers of plutonium. It is potentially  dangerous, even in very small amounts, whether it is ingested or  inhaled. It is urged that an advertisement be produced to  publicize that strong measures are being taken to prevent the  release of plutonium into the environment, instead of an  advertisement that may mislead the public about the dangers of  plutonium."    In response, a spokesman for the PRNFC said: "It is known  that plutonium is discharged from the body even when ingested,  and there are hardly any effects of its radiation on the body.  Details of the videotapes are accurate, and we have no  intention of withdrawing them."    Experiments with animals have shown that when inhaled in  powder form, plutonium adheres to the surface tissue of lungs  and bones, leading to cancerous growths. The element is said to  have strong radioactive toxicity, with one gram equivalent to  the maximum tolerable intake for tens of millions of people in  one year.</p>

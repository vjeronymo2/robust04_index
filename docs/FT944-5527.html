			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Court order for Nadir bank Turkish Cypriot authorities have obtained a court order against a bank owned by fugitive tycoon Mr Asil Nadir for defaulting on Dollars 4.2m in deposits for a pension fund, Mr Ozkan Murat, minister of labour and social security, said on Thursday. 'We have taken legal action to make sure this money is not lost. We are not sure if the assets of the bank will be enough to meet this amount, but we have taken action to save the money of the workers,' Mr Ozkan said. Under the court order, Mr Nadir will continue to operate the Kibris Endustri Bankasi but will not be able to sell its assets. Mr Murat said the pension fund had deposited money to earn interest in the bank owned by Mr Nadir, who fled to his native northern Cyprus in 1993 after jumping bail in Britain to avoid trial on charges of theft and false accounting over his collapsed fruit-to-electronics conglomerate Polly Peck.</p>

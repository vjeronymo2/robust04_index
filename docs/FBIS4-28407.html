			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The propaganda  department of the Central Committee of the South Korean National  Democratic Front (Hanminjon) on June 5 released "Article to the  Entire People" throwing a revealing light on the environmental  destruction in South Korea on "world day of environment,"  according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.    The land, rivers and sea, the article says, have been  polluted, leaving to the people no place where they can live  without worries, due to the crimes of the South Korean puppets  in reducing South Korea to a garbage dump of the imperialists  and appendage to the Western pollution-causing industries.    Pointing out that South Korea has been reduced to a land of  radioactive pollution owing to the puppet clique's development  of nuclear weapons, the article says the danger of nuclear  scourge is not a possibility of tomorrow but the reality today.    The article appeals to the South Korean people to turn out  to  expand the struggle for the dismantling of atomic reactors, the  sources of disasters, introduced by the authorities for the  criminal development of nuclear weapons, and against the  building of nuclear waste dumps into an all-people movement to  defend the land of people's life.</p>

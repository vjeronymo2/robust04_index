			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Draft puts greater onus on principal auditors THE PRINCIPAL auditors to companies must ensure that they are satisfied with the adequacy of work carried out by other auditors used during an audit, under draft guidelines issued yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board. The quality of work must be considered when using affiliates, correspondent firms and unrelated firms in the UK or overseas. Auditors must consider the 'materiality of the statements they audit' to the group accounts, their knowledge of the business and their relationship with affiliated firms before accepting appointment as principal auditors, it says. The details come in SAS 510 on the relationship between principal and other auditors, one of five draft standards issued yesterday by the board. Mr John Hennessy, of accountants Arthur Andersen, who is a member of the board, said: 'This is just a matter, we hope, of putting what is sensible good practice down on to paper.' SAS 100, the statement on objective and general principles, says auditors should comply with auditing standards, and obtain sufficient evidence to determine whether the statements are free of material misstatement and prepared in accordance with legislation and accounting standards. SAS 470, on the review of financial statements, says auditors must consider whether the presentation of accounts has been unduly influenced by management's desire to present facts in a favourable or unfavourable light, and the effects of the aggregation of uncorrected misstatements. SAS 500, on the work of internal audit, for the first time places an obligation on auditors to look at the activities of internal audit and the effect on external audit, and to liaise with the internal auditors. The board has invited comments on the drafts by the end of September, and will publish a collection of draft standards by the end of October. SAS 100, 470, 500, 510, 520.

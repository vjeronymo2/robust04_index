			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chargeurs sees losses at industrial division CHARGEURS, the French textile and media group, yesterday warned that its industrial activities would make a loss in the first half of this year because of the cost of a rationalisation package involving 1,000 job losses. The group, which is a prominent player in the international wool textile industry and a significant shareholder in BSkyB, the UK satellite television service, plans to close a wool processing plant in Argentina and to reduce its manufacturing capacity in France. Mr Jerome Seydoux, chairman, said the job losses, which would reduce Chargeurs' workforce by more than 10 per cent, would aggravate the problems of the industrial division during the first half, but should contribute towards an improved performance in the second half. The media division is expected to produce similar results to last year when the group as a whole saw net profits almost double to FFr724m (Dollars 134m), after a FFr410m surplus on the sale of its stake in the UTA airline to Air France, from FFr366m in 1991. Chargeurs' sales fell by 16 per cent in the first quarter and by 12 per cent last month.</p>

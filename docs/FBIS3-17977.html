			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Myroslav Popovych, member of the Ukrainian </F> Academy of Sciences, by Pol Mathil in Kiev; date not given: "On  the elections in Ukraine"]    [Text] [Mathil] Contrary to all forecasts, 75 percent of  Ukrainian voters went to the polls. Is that a surprise?    [Popovych] I am surprised. It is further evidence that  sociology is not an exact science.    [Mathil] Were the Ukrainians not said to be disappointed and  apathetic?    [Popovych] Disappointed yes, but not apathetic. The  Ukrainians seemed to be absent from public life because they did  not identify with the existing government. Logically, they went  to the polls to express that rejection. There was a surprising  resurgence in the last two or three weeks.    [Mathil] What was the reason for this resurgence?    [Popovych] It is mainly what I call the "Canary Islands  phenomenon." Dmytro Poyizd, a vulgar and populist leader, found  an audience for his slogans which were very hostile to the whole  political class: "We will find all these profiteers and  traitors," he said, "even if they hide in the Canaries," a  symbol of opulence in his eyes. For some people that was  enough. He was elected in the first round.    [Mathil] And who will vote in the second round? Do you have  any forecast to make for the future Parliament?    [Popovych] No. Only 49 deputies were elected in the first  round, in other words there are still 802 candidates in the  second round. Our electoral Commission was not capable of  telling us, 48 hours after the election, who will run against  whom in these 401 duels. That being so, my forecast is as  imprecise as it is pessimistic.    In short, the Parliament will not bring about many changes.  Our democracy is very young, the political parties are very  weak, and the politicians are not very mature, some are already  corrupt. The government has neutralized some of its opponents,  in particular by distributing apartments to deputies in the  capital's fashionable districts. That area is called "Tsarskoye  Selo [as published]," a reference to the residence of the czars  near St. Petersburg. Our electoral law is harmful, it has  really liquidated the political parties. Honest candidates  could not withstand the assault of populist, nationalist, or  communist propaganda.    [Mathil] So who will govern this country?    [Popovych] In general, the same people, those who are called  "the government party" in our country.    [Mathil] What about the presidency?    [Popovych] Exit Leonid Kravchuk. His career is over. Enter  Leonid Kuchma. It is he who will be president of Ukraine after  the elections on 26 June.    [Mathil] What will he do?    [Popovych] Nobody knows. Not even him. But it is he, the  former boss of "Yuzmash [as published]," the biggest missile  factory in the world, and former prime minister who, if he keeps  his promises, will perhaps implement a series of reforms, which  Kravchuk has been incapable of doing.    [Mathil] The West will miss Kravchuk...    [Popovych] Yes, he has merits. He did not understand  anything about economic affairs, but he created Ukraine's image  abroad. He was able to avert the specter of Russian occupation.  There are of course problems like the Crimea or the Black Sea  fleet, but in short, he has removed the "Serbo-Croat prospect"  from Ukraine.    [Mathil] Permanently?    [Popovych] Nothing is permanent. Russia will try to gain the  right to examine all of Ukraine's strategic decisions. Of  course, we would like to be closer to Poland, in other words to  Europe; we have made various proposals, but, as you know, Warsaw  is not very welcoming. There is the shadow of Moscow...    [Mathil] Would you be prepared to give up half of the Black  Sea fleet?    [Popovych] I am prepared to give up the whole fleet. The  problem is that that will never end. After the fleet there will  be Crimea, then Donetsk, and so forth. Without Ukraine, there  is no Russian empire. However, in Moscow people are dreaming  more and more of a new empire.    [Mathil] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has said that he  will request the aid of the Black Sea fleet to achieve his  separatist dreams...    [Popovych] Meshkov is a dangerous imbecile. In comparison  with Meshkov, Zhirinovskiy is a pillar of lucidity.    [Mathil] What can the West do?    [Popovych] The West does not understand anything about what  is happening in our country. It has the Kravchuk complex, like  it had the Gorbachev or Yeltsin complex.    [Mathil] What does that mean in practice?    [Popovych] In practice, our elite is virtually banned from  radio and television. Why not help it to break Kravchuk's  monopoly over radio and television? And then, we must be  guaranteed that specific economic aid will accompany our  reforms. If and when there are reforms...    [Mathil] Meanwhile?    [Popovych] Today, policy toward Ukraine is still only  defined  in accordance with policy toward Russia. That is beginning to  change. Nothing specific, but we can see that the West is  thinking...    [Mathil] You are so critical of all the others. Do you, the  former president of "Rukh,[Ukrainian Popular Movement -- UPM]"  have your own political ambitions?    [Popovych] Oh, no. I was president because a president was  needed, but there are enough amateurs in our political class.    [Mathil] You have a very black view of everything...    [Popovych] And how are we living here? Do things look  bright?</p>

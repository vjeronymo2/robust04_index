			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Japan's money supply revives THE MOST severe monetary contraction in Japanese post-war history may be over, according to figures published yesterday which show that the money supply has started to grow again. The Bank of Japan said the money supply in February grew by 0.2 per cent compared with the year before. In January, there was a year-on-year contraction of 0.3 per cent. The money supply's revival may help to fuel the recent strong rally in the Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei average closed at 18,537 yesterday, down by 190 points on the day, but 10 per cent up from a close of 16,817 two weeks ago. Some analysts believe the rebound in Tokyo share prices may mark the end of a three-year bear market as the decline in the economy bottoms out with signs of rising output in areas such as steel and bulk chemicals. The rally, however, has mainly been driven by speculation about the government's plans for a further package of measures to stimulate the economy. These are likely to be finalised shortly before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, leaves for a visit to Washington on April 15. The renewed growth in the broadly defined money supply, M2 and certificates of deposits, follows the Bank of Japan's recent cut in its official discount rate to a historic low of 2.5 per cent. The money supply grew by 0.5 per cent from January, when it had contracted by 0.3 per cent. It fell by 0.5 per cent last September, the first contraction on record, and then by 0.6 per cent in October and November. Broad liquidity, which measures monetary conditions more generally, rose by 2.9 per cent in February, up from a growth rate of 2.6 per cent in January. The Bank of Japan said the rise was due to increased holdings of commercial paper by financial institutions and reduced tax payments by corporations. A government savings survey, however, suggested renewed strong growth in personal consumption, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of gross domestic product, is unlikely.

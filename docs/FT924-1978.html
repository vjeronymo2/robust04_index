			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (6): 'It's too early for bonds' - Why the market is likely to take some time to pick up THE ITALIAN bond market currently represents something of a conundrum for investors. International investors have been badly burnt by volatile market conditions, including a currency devaluation, this year. Worse, they are still not at all convinced that the structural problems facing the Italian economy will be overcome. Many of them are biding their time before re-entering the market, at least until they feel more confident about the stability of the currency. Yet Italy offers among the highest real rates of interest in Europe. At current levels, the market may well prove to be oversold, and when the German Bundesbank starts to cut interest rates, Italian bonds will be among the beneficiaries. Still, investor confidence is not yet close to being restored. 'Given the continuing tensions and strains within the exchange rate mechanism, it is a bit early to consider moving back into Italian bonds,' believes Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore, which sold all its Italian bond holdings eight months ago. Mr Ray Greenshields of AMP Asset Management says that he is watching the market with interest 'but our fingers are not poised on the trigger. 'We need to have a lot more confidence in the fiscal and monetary management of the country before we would go in as a physical investor'. He adds that the use of options on the market has been consid- ered, but even that route has been thought to be too risky. One London-based securities firm, once fairly active in the market, no longer has any clients holding Italian bonds, according to a trader there. 'We still trade on our own account, but there is no investor interest at all,' he says. The largest government bond market in Europe, and the third largest in the world after the US and Japan, Italy is caught in a debt-trap. Its public debt versus gross domestic product ratio, currently 103 per cent, is set to rise further, unless the government manages to bring the budget deficit under control. There are signs that it has the will, but, even when the budget deficit reduction programme is approved, it will still be hard to convince investors that the policy will be rigidly imposed, given the country's history of political instability. But the Italian government's financing needs leave little room for manoeuvre. Unlike the UK, Italy has not been able to benefit from its withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism by drastically cutting interest rates, because without high interest rates, it will not be able to fund its deficit. However, unless interest rates fall, servicing of the public debt will continue to eat up a large part of government revenues. Although Belgium has an even larger public debt relative to GDP, at 133 per cent, analysts point out that, unlike Italy, Belgium's debt ratio is moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, Mr Giorgio Radaelli, an international economist at Lehman Brothers, believes there is some room for optimism on the bond market's prospects. 'In the long run, the outlook is for rates to move downwards,' he says. He believes that the debt ratio will be stabilised and that European economic union is still likely to go ahead, with Italy as a part of it. He points out that, while Italy may not meet Maastricht targets on debt levels, Belgium is not likely to either, and it is inconceivable for union to take place without Belgium. 'Domestic investors are more bullish on Emu (than international investors),' says Mr Radaelli. From the Italian government's point of view, the continued goodwill of domestic investors is vital. Despite a huge surge of international interest in Italian bonds in recent years, international investors still account for only 7 per cent of the market, mostly fixed-rate Buoni del Tesoro Poliennali (BTPs). International investors still have to pay withholding tax on Italian government bonds (since the mechanism for reclaiming tax still fails to function) so that 10-year bonds yield 12 per cent for international investors, compared with 13.7 per cent for Italians. Still, with inflation at just under 5 per cent, the rates would be attractive, were it not for continued concern about the currency. However, some fund managers are considering re-entering the bond market, but fully hedging any currency risk. 'I think we will move back into Italian bonds within the next six months,' says one London-based fund manager who declined to be quoted. 'The market has had a tempestuous time and that has made it much cheaper, compared with other European markets. The currency may well devalue further, but that is not necessarily bad news for bonds, in lira terms. So we would hedge out the currency risk.' Some managers have also lost confidence in the liquidity of the market. Despite its size, the market's volatility has made it one of the most difficult to trade. When short-term interest rates shot up, positions taken by dealers became very expensive to hold. As dealers found themselves losing money on the market, they gradually stopped making prices and liquidity in the cash market disappeared. Some investors were not only unable to sell their bonds, they were not even able to get prices. When prices were quoted, the market jumped in gaps of as much as two points. While stability has now returned to the market, investors and traders are likely to maintain a wary stance for some time to come.</p>

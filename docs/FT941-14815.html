			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Major says Labour to blame for 'smear and innuendo' Westminster was mired in smear and counter-smear last night after Mr John Major accused Labour of conducting a campaign of innuendo against the government and Lord Justice Scott demanded clarification of the prime minister's evidence to the arms for Iraq inquiry. A day after giving his evidence, Mr Major sought to build on a positive Conservative response to his performance by going on the offensive for the first time in several weeks. The prime minister told the Commons at question time that Labour MPs were spreading 'smear and innuendo on a week to week basis with a complete disregard for the truth'. Downing Street said Mr Major had responded spontaneously to attacks on the government's integrity and the credibility of his back to basics campaign. But a senior Conservative official quickly released a list of seven alleged Labour smears, suggesting Mr Major's response was an attempt to draw Labour into the debate on the government's moral standing. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, dismissed the prime minister's claims as a 'pathetic' response to opposition attacks on the 'hypocrisy and deceit' of the government's taxation policies. In the Commons, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, attacked the moral standing of Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the treasury, for 'undermining the institutions' of postwar Britain. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, renewed allegations about the relationship between Mr Gerry Malone, the Tory party's deputy chairman, and Mr Asil Nadir, fugitive head of the collapsed Polly Peck. In a letter to Mr Major, Lord Justice Scott asked him to name a civil servant who deleted a reference to a 'minor modification' in government arms sales guidelines in a briefing note submitted to the prime minister. The document in which the deletion occurs could prove significant if the inquiry establishes it involved an attempt to mislead parliament or contradicted Mr Major's statement that he played no part in forming or amending the guidelines. Mr Major suggested on Monday that the alteration may have been made by someone who was unaware that the guidelines had been changed. This was dismissed by the judge as a 'pretty improbable speculation'. The person who made the alteration would surely have asked what was meant by 'minor modification' before deleting it, he said.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: TCI moves back into the black Tele-Communications Inc, the biggest US cable TV operator, moved back into profit in the third quarter, helped by a contribution from Liberty Media, with which it merged in August. On sales up 23 per cent at Dollars 1.29bn, TCI suffered a 21 per cent fall in operating profit to Dollars 186m. However, after a Dollars 101m contribution from Liberty and sharply lower tax, it made a net profit of 4 cents a share, compared with a 14 cents loss. TCI said basic service customers had risen by 5.1 per cent over the past 12 months to 11.3m. However, cable companies' profits have been hit this year by government-imposed reductions in cable rates. TCI is withdrawing a planned Dollars 500m offering of preferred stock, due to difficult equity market conditions. In late October it said it was in partnership with other cable companies and Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, to bid for personal communications service (PCS) mobile phone licences in a forthcoming government auction. It is thought the drop in its share price on the announcement may have contributed to the decision to withdraw the preference issue.</p>

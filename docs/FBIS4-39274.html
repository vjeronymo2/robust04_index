The talks can  be seen as introductory and consultative in nature. A wide  range of issues were discussed in their talks. The key issue  was focused on the development of bilateral relations, the  possibility of economic cooperation, and the establishment of a  legal and contractual basis for that. It was noted that Ukraine  and the DPRK had signed only two agreements to date.    In addition, the two officials voiced their countries'  positions on nuclear issues. Kim Yong-nam declared that the  DPRK intended firmly to become a nuclear-free state. The DPRK's  position on the matter coincides with Ukraine's, he stressed.    The sides plan to sign a number of bilateral agreements at  the end of the visit 9 June.</p>

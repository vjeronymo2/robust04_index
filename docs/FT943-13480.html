			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Positive signs but climate unsettled Equity markets enjoyed a markedly more positive time last week, but in the current unsettled climate it must remain uncertain as to whether or not this marks a turning point. Taken on a year to date perspective the figures do not read so well - in dollar terms, Hong Kong, for instance, one of last week's star performers, remains off nearly 25 per cent, although, on the other hand, some good rises are still to be seen in Finland and Italy, up by similar amounts, while Japan leads the way, up 31 per cent so far. The European financial community will be waiting expectantly for the Bundesbank meeting on Thursday, the last time it meets before the four-week summer recess, although some analysts do not forecast a further rate easing, just yet.</p>

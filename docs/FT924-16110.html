			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC, US push for Gatt deal by mid-month THE EC and the US intend to try for a breakthrough on the Uruguay Round world trade talks early this month, in time for endorsement by European Community heads of government at the Birmingham summit on October 16, should the talks prove successful. European Commission officials in Brussels are approaching the meeting with the caution born of a series of previously-billed breakthroughs which turned into impasses, but with genuine belief that a deal could now be done. 'The political will is now there' to get through the farm subsidies maze which has held up the Round since the Brussels summit collapsed in December 1990, a European Community negotiator said last month. In Washington, Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said the United States was 'neither optimistic nor pessimistic' about the possibility of a compromise over agriculture to move the Round ahead. No meetings were scheduled, although 'conversations' were continuing, he added. EC officials disclosed the bilateral talks are provisionally scheduled for October 10 in Brussels. So far, they say, these would involve Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, Mrs Carla Hills, US special trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. The talks are intended to exploit the so-called 'window of opportunity' for settling the Round, between the French referendum on Maastricht on September 20 last, and the US elections on November 3. In spite of EC-US brinkmanship in their worsening oilseed subsidies row, and a fast-fomenting dispute over steel subsidies which the Commission discussed yesterday, the main players on the Community side still believe a deal is possible. On the row over oilseed subsidies, which a Gatt panel has twice condemned as against Gatt rules, the US has given the EC until noon today to agree to binding arbitration. There are said to be several reasons for renewed political impetus towards a Uruguay round settlement: President Bush's wish to improve his fading chances of re-election, through what could be presented as an economic success for the US, which might allow him to present his opponent, Governor Bill Clinton, as a protectionist; The fact that the French referendum on Maastricht revealed France's farmers to be so alienated from EC farm policy that there is almost nothing President Francois Mitterrand can recover from this constituency. The EC's need for a success which could help it get member states' economies moving again and shift attention from the crisis over the Maastricht Treaty.</p>

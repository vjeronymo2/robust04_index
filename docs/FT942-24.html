			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (7): High-risk neighbourhood - Ian Hamilton Fazey studies Cheshire fire brigade's emergency drill Cheshire's Fire and Emergency Service has to live with more risk than most others. The county has one of Britain's most intense concentrations of chemical and petrochemical industries in its area, in particular a necklace of large sites along the south bank of Manchester Ship Canal from Runcorn to Ellesmere Port. There have been three big incidents in the last five years and several lesser ones. All have successfully tested the effectiveness of emergency plans and, in some cases, the courage of fire crews. In 1989, a pipeline ruptured, spilling thick Venezuelan crude oil into the Mersey between Birkenhead and Shell's Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port. The same year, a chlorine leak from ICI's plant at Runcorn caused an emergency as the gas formed a cloud. This year, a big fire at Associated Octel - which makes additives for petrol - alarmed Ellesmere Port residents and prompted calls for a public inquiry which are still being made. Generally, no one faults the response of the emergency services to any incident. Modern communications have made for ever-faster response, while companies take a 'better safe than sorry' approach towards raising an alarm. Mr Dennis Davis, Cheshire's chief officer, says plans to anticipate and deal with emergencies are comprehensive, although not too detailed. 'You can't predict everything that might happen,' he says. 'It is important to build in flexibility so you can alter your response to any situation you find, or which develops.' This means ensuring thorough knowledge of what is being done where, or stored in any factory, so firefighters will know what they might expect. Liaison with chemical plant management and staff is therefore on-going, with all companies taking their own responsibilities seriously. Where a new climate is developing, however, is in public relations. The chemical industry and the emergency services are finding new, more questioning, public attitudes emerging, with less trust, more suspicion and a greater demand for information. Industry and emergency services say they not only welcome this, but they want to take a lead. This is partly defensive. Public consciousness has been raised by the increasing politicisation of environmental issues: people generally want to know more, while pressure groups and green activists are likely to control the agenda if unchallenged by those they criticise. 'It's a matter of trying to encourage people to be realistic,' says Mr Edward Brady, head of public affairs for ICI's cluster of plant and offices at Runcorn. 'Perspective is important. Most incidents are brought under control quickly by a plant's own emergency staff. The problem comes when people start asking 'What if .?' and extrapolating towards the unrealistic.' Sensational media reporting encourages this - as does entirely reasonable reporting. In the Octel fire, for example, the blaze near one reaction vessel was brought under control after one hour and 40 minutes. The vessel was encased in a safety coating with a guaranteed two-hour fire resistance. While chemical engineers saw this as evidence of the protective coating doing its job, media reporting understandably took a '20 minutes from disaster' line. The question to Mr Davis was: 'What if the two hours were up? Would you have withdrawn your men and left the tank to explode?' In fact, two hours' fire resistance was the minimum rating for the coating's integrity. Not only could it reasonably have been expected to last longer, it did not even have to push the limit of the least it was supposed to do. The mistake was to give the two-hour figure,' says one PR professional unconnected with the incident. 'It led to inevitable questions which then raised an unrealistic level of public alarm.' Mr Davis says the best approach is to ensure the widest local public knowledge of what is going on in any chemical plant - and what is the best thing to do if anything goes wrong. 'The first policy is shelter, not evacuation,' he says. 'But many people assume there will be mass evacuations and want to know why we are not going ahead getting them out. The safest thing to do, however, is to stay indoors, shut the windows and doors, and listen to the local radio.' He points out that a policy of evacuation could make things worse, adding to congestion and requiring management time that could be more crucially deployed against the emergency. 'We want people to be safe. Sheltering in their homes will usually be safer than leaving them. If a need develops to evacuate people, we will then get them out,' Mr Davis says. Under a code called CIMAH - the control of industrial major accidents and hazards - all owners of potentially dangerous plant are required to write every few years to all people living within 1,500 metres of a plant telling them what is stored at the plant and what they should do in an emergency - which is to shelter indoors in the way Mr Davis advises unless told to do otherwise. Emergencies are signalled by siren. 'If you can't hear the siren, you're almost certainly far enough away not to be in any danger,' Mr Brady says. The question is if, and when, to sound the siren, especially at night, and especially since most potential problems are nipped in the bud. No one wants to cry wolf. In one instance there was confusion when a small leak at ICI was quickly contained, but a warning to stay indoors had already been sent out for radio broadcast. Not all the radio stations broadcast the warning - but one that did broadcast it failed to send the all clear. Cheshire's chemicals companies are talking about working together better, jointly publishing information and making more concerted attempts to better inform the public at large. Mr Davis also wants a more informed media corps. Knowledge and understanding are seen as the principal tools for achieving this. This also includes understanding that the right thing to do in some emergencies is nothing - as with spilt oil that can often be left to break down naturally. Mr Davis says uninformed exhortations to 'do something' can add to the problem. Both he and Mr Brady also think that calls for relocation of plant or rehousing of people near them have to be debated on reasonable assumptions of risk. Fair debate, however, depends on disseminating enough information to promote wider knowledge and understanding. Responsibility for this lies with the industry.</p>

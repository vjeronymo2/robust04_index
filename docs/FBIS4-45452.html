As is  customary, large quantities of drugs confiscated are set to the  torch, hoping that this and the fines and imprisonment terms can  act as a deterrent for both perpetrators and would-be felons.  Last month, members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force,  accompanied by prison inmates, took a large quantity of  confiscated drugs to the dump site and set it alight. The  stash, comprising marijuana, cocaine, and crack, was estimated  at over EC$250,000.</p>

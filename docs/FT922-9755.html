			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE showed no sign of any major reversal in the downward trend, with charts pointing towards lower values. Sentiment on fundamentals is bearish - heavy sales are expected from producers such as Indonesia during the next few weeks. The nearby July contract recovered to Dollars 716 a tonne after falling to a fresh 22-year low of Dollars 712 in early trading. The premium for cash ZINC widened further on the LME, reflecting the tightness of nearby supplies. The increasing tightness helped to reverse the early downward drift in forward prices, with three-month metal recovering from a Dollars 1,281 low to close at Dollars 1,290.50 a tonne, down just Dollars 2. Generally base metals business has been slow to pick up after the holiday weekend, dealers said. However, May option declarations today could spark interest in copper and aluminium. SILVER moved ahead on the London bullion market on positive technicals and renewed confidence in the pace of US economic recovery. On Comex analysts felt that silver was gearing up for another upward run after breaking key resistance levels at midday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

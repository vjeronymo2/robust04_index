			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Filipino President Fidel Ramos has described his  tour of Vietnam as one of the most significant visits he has  ever made. He told the media on Tuesday before leaving Hanoi  that the Philippines, together with Vietnam and other countries  in Southeast Asia, wish to share a common destiny and there is  no other alternatives than promotion of economic cooperation and  construction of peace among them. The president supported  Vietnam's succession to ASEAN. He expressed readiness to share  his country's experience to build infrastructure and a legal  system in Vietnam. He maintained that the two countries have  large opportunities in scientific, technological, educational,  and health cooperation.    Before leaving Hanoi, President Fidel Ramos held a press  conference.    [Begin Ramos recording in English] I have, like other heads  of government in other parts of the world, been covering [words  indistinct]. In an effort to develop [word indistinct]  activities in our foreign relations, [word indistinct] the  Philippines cannot [word indistinct] with the vigorous economies  of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the Socialist Republic  of Vietnam as a one of the most significant I have made. With  Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines  has a shared destiny. There is no alternative for peace than  economic cooperation among us in this region that we are  inhabit. In Manila in 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty  of the ASEAN nations which binds signatories to settle regional  disputes peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a  matter [words indistinct] in principle but mainly of time and  procedure. I reiterated to Vietnam's leaders the consistent  support of the Philippines to help facilitate Vietnam's entry  into ASEAN. They in turn informed me of their intensive  preparations for full participation in ASEAN activities.    Philippine-Vietnamese relations are a critical factor for  the  solidarity of Southeast Asia and consequently for the peace and  progress of the region. I believe my visit greatly enhances  these relations. I had friendly and fruitful meetings with  President Le Duc Anh, General Secretary Do Muoi of the Communist  Party of Vietnam, and Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh; and I look  forward to our meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet later  today.    Like our own leadership, Vietnam's leaders are all acutely  aware of their country's need for regional stability so that  they can have the breathing spell after four generations of  almost continuous conflict to shape their economy and [word  indistinct] self- sustaining role. With them I explored avenues  of possible cooperation among the claimants to areas of the  South China Sea and other nations of Southeast Asia in order to  reduce tensions in the area and to promote joint development as  called for in the 1994 Manila Declaration. We agreed on the  need to devise confidence building mechanisms, cooperative  ventures in the area that will begin to assure the claimant  countries of the archipelagoes that the South China Sea can be  transformed from waters of contention into an area of  cooperation. We agreed that the increasingly favorable economic  situation in Vietnam should make it easier for our two countries  to work out the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in  the Philippines. My delegation also looked intensively into the  opportunities for countertrade and into investments and joint  ventures in each other's economies.    We offered the help of our industrialists, academics,  managers, and technologists in the building of Vietnam's  infrastructure, in financial management, in legislative policy  formulation, and in running the tourist facilities. We agreed  there is great room for our two countries to collaborate in  science and technology, education, and public health. And we  agreed to exert every effort to raise the level of trade between  us and to make and to take every advantage of complimentarities  between our two economies. [end recording]</p>

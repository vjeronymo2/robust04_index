			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article Jebul Rehman: "U.S. Demanding To Inspect Pakistani </F> Nuclear Installations"]    [Text] The Sikhs leaders of the Azad Khalistan [Sikh state]  campaign threw in the towel after fighting for about 10 years.  During their unsuccessful campaign, thousands of young Sikhs  were killed by the Indian Army, the Border Security force, and  the police. Most of those killed were young people who lived  near the Indo-Pakistani border. These young men were killed  because it was suspected that they had or could have some kind  of relationship with Pakistan. During this campaign, the Indian  Army had to raid the holy shrine of the Golden Temple because  the terrorist Sikhs had made this place of worship the center of  their activities. The decision to raid the Golden Temple was  definitely a very difficult decision for the New Delhi  government. It required a lot of courage, which they had. The  Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi became a prey of the Sikhs'  revenge. However, the Sikhs had to pay a very heavy price for  this vindicative action. Thousands of Sikhs were killed by the  Hindus in New Delhi and other large cities. The Sikh terrorists  started a rampage of killing when the campaign for the Azad  Khalistan appeared to be dying. This series of actions gave a  very bad name to the Sikh movement. The negative reaction to the  killing of innocent women and children further weakened this  campaign. The number of Sikhs who became tired and began to  oppose this campaign increased gradually. The terrorists were  forced to leave their areas of operation and the state. The Azad  Khalistan campaign died when they dispersed. The Indian  Government has also accused Pakistan of helping these separatist  elements. At one time, the United States had warned Pakistan  that if it did not stop helping the fighters in East Pakistan  and Kashmir then it would be included on the list of nations  that sponsor terrorism. General Ziaul Haq doubtlessly  sympathized with the Khalistan campaign. He felt that the  establishment of Azad Khalistan would encourage separatist  movements in other Indian states and would weaken India. This  would then ensure Pakistan's safety and security. Additionally,  the establishment of Azad Khalistan would also help resolve the  Jammu-Kashmir problem according to Pakistan's wishes. General  Ziaul Haq's plan was based on sincere desires; however, it was  not very practical. Had India felt a need to start a war with  Pakistan in order to crush the Azad Khalistan campaign, it would  not have avoided it. Moscow, Washington, and New Delhi were  equally relieved at General Ziaul Haq's death in the airplane  accident in Bahawalpur. Moscow and Washington were relieved  because General Ziaul Haq was thinking about establishing a  government according to his own desires in Afghanistan, being  called the conqueror of Afghanistan,' and becoming a Caliph in  this region against their wishes. The former Soviet Union and  the United States did not like Ziaul Haq's plans; they were  afraid of his designs. President Zia's death also satisfied New  Delhi because he was considered a zealous and sincere supporter  of the Azad Khalistan movement. U.S. pressure increased after  President Zia's death and the Azad Khalistan campaigners were  gradually disappointed. This movement became totally weak in the  end, and the accusation that Pakistan was helping the Sikhs was  also taken back to an extent. U.S. government spokesmen have  admitted that the help being given to the freedom fighters  across the Control Line has also been curtailed considerably or  is almost nominal. The fact is that Pakistan and India have made  such arrangements on the Control Line that entry of armed  persons into Kashmir is extremely difficult if not impossible.  Caravans of refugees from occupied Kashmir are coming into Azad  Kashmir. This has been made possible because India wants this  course of exodus to continue. No movement for independence can  survive long without the resources needed. The Afghans were able  to fight the U.S. war in the name of their jihad against the  former Soviet Union for eight years because large scale  assistance from the United States and its allies via Pakistan  was filtered in to them continuously. Modern American weapons  were supplied to the Afghans in huge quantities. Money was spent  like water and food was provided regularly. The former Soviet  Union was forced to retreat from Afghanistan, not only because  the Afghan war proved to be too expensive for Moscow, but  because it was spending much beyond its means on its space war  (Star War) program in order to keep up with the United States.  The Soviet Union went bankrupt because of the combined demands  of the space war technology and the Afghanistan war.    The Kashmir freedom fighters have been confronting the  Indian  Armed Forces for more than three years. Their courage is  commendable and their sacrifices should be venerated. However,  when they do not receive any help from abroad and the number of  Indian soldiers fighting them continues to increase, it would  not be fair to expect these freedom fighters to continue their  struggle for a long time. Fifty-five Kashmiri had gathered in  the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar and Indian soldiers had  surrounded them. They could not endure this siege for more than  one month. There were 12 freedom fighters among these 55  persons, and they had all kinds of weapons. Had they broken the  siege to face the Indian troops, all of them would have been  killed, and the armed freedom fighters would also have been  accused of killing innocent citizens. The besieged people in  Hazratbal decided to surrender and the Indian government  released the unarmed Kashmiris. Prudence dictated that the armed  freedom fighters who had surrendered should not be treated  inhumanly. The Indian record on human rights violations is very  bad. Even the United States and Europe have started to criticize  India about it. Pakistan is not mollified by the condemnation of  India over human rights. It is worried about increased loss of  life among the freedom fighters. It is clear from the news that  the repeated strikes in trade centers in Srinagar and other  places in the valley have caused scarcity of food and medicine.  Even more distressing is the news about fighting between the  pro-Pakistani group and those who want an independent Kashmir.  The elements who want an independent Kashmir are trying to put  pressure on those who want Kashmir to join Pakistan. No  thoughtful Pakistani would criticize the Pakistani Government  for not providing assistance to the freedom fighters. It would  be difficult to provide reinforcement with weapons even when  Pakistan is willing to do that. India has taken effective  measures to close almost all routes. If Pakistan decides to  cross the Control Line to help the freedom fighters, it would  definitely lead to a war with India and Pakistan would be blamed  for it. The United States will join the accusers and Pakistan  will be severely punished for starting a war. Pakistan will not  be able to bear the burden if the United States and India decide  to punish Pakistan for helping the Kashmiris. In light of the  imposing presence of the United States and its allies' air and  naval forces in the Gulf after the war against Iraq, we can  expect the United States to use its full force against Pakistan  if it is necessary.    Although Pakistan has frozen its nuclear program, and,  according to opposition leader Nawaz Sharif's claim, the present  government has also rolled the program back, the United States  and Japan are still not satisfied. The way Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto had repudiated Nawaz Sharif's claim has also  complicated the issue. A few days ago, when it was confirmed  that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen, there was also  the good news that the countries helping Pakistan were going to  provide it about $3.5 billion in aid. However, the United States  officially announced on 19 November 1993 that all USAID offices  in Pakistan will be closed by the end of 1995. Mr. Brian Edward,  the chief of USAID has openly announced that the USAID offices  in Pakistan are being closed as a punishment for Pakistan's  nuclear program. Mr. S. Katajima, who heads the agency that  decides Japanese government's policy on economic and technical  aid, visited Islamabad last week. After talks with top level  representative of Pakistani government, he said at a news  conference that the Japanese government is concerned about  Pakistan's nuclear program. He also mentioned that Japan will  provide economic and technical aid to Pakistan only on condition  that it stop plans to build weapons and missiles for mass  destruction, reduce its defense budget, adopt policies to spread  peace, increase plans to reduce environmental pollution,  stabilize the democratic process, and continue to implement the  economic policies started by Dr. Mayeen Qureshi. The U.S. and  Japanese attitude shows that freezing our nuclear program is not  considered enough for reinstating aid to Pakistan. Instead, we  are being asked to do much more. I have written in this column  that the United States has requested that Pakistan's roll back  its nuclear program to a level where it is incapable of making  nuclear weapons, and, in the third and the last phase, the  program that represents our nuclear preparations should be  totally disintegrated. The United States wants to do all this  not only because it fears that Pakistani nuclear weapons can be  used against India, but also because other Islamic countries  might get this technology and these weapons could be used  against Israel. In this context, Libya was mentioned in the  beginning, and now they are mentioning Iran. Pakistan has  repeatedly assured them that in spite of the availability of  technical knowledge, it has no desire to make nuclear weapons.  However, they do not believe Pakistan's assurance because the  impression that Pakistan has a nuclear bomb was widely  circulated during Ziaul Haq's time. In this context, it is  important to mention that a senior Indian journalist visiting  Pakistan met with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan. Dr. Khan stressed  during this visit that Pakistan had made an atomic bomb. It is  said that the visit of the Indian journalist with Dr. Qadeer  Khan was arranged at President Ziaul Haq's instruction, and Dr.  Khan had said things as advised by President Haq. After this  alleged admission by Dr. Qadeer Khan, the CIA made a secret  documentary film about the Kahuta laboratories using spy planes.  The CIA director showed this film to President Ziaul Haq in the  While House during his visit to the United States. The United  States claimed that it has tangible proof of Pakistan's  involvement in providing aid to Sikhs and freedom fighters in  Kashmir. However, it had always ignored evidence presented by  Pakistani governments proving the U.S. accusations to be false.  Now the United States is demanding that Pakistan allow it to  inspect its nuclear installations to satisfy the United States.    Our opposition has demanded calling a special session of the  National Assembly which will begin on 28 November. The  opposition wants to discuss all issues related to the nuclear  program. Mr. Yusuf Reza Gelani, the assembly speaker, has said  that because of the sensitive nature of the issue, all  discussion must be held in a closed session. Political observers  who do not agree with the speaker say that a closed session will  deprive the Pakistani people of the right to know the facts. The  government should not have closed sessions because Madam Bhutto  had openly said that Pakistan has no nuclear weapon and its  whole program is geared to peaceful uses. In order to have the  world believe this fact, it is important that not only there be  open discussions in the National Assembly, but also that there  should be no delay in giving permission to inspect the nuclear  installations. These steps will help Pakistan get out of the  clutches of the Pressler Amendment, and the U.S. economic and  military aid will be restored. Japan and the European nations  will also show their understanding and make good their promises  to provide economic aid.    In the context of permission to inspect the nuclear  installation, Pakistan can expect the United States, European  nations, and Japan to show more interest in resolving the  Kashmir issue. If the Kashmir issue is resolved peacefully, the  question of nuclear weapons will lose its importance. Pakistan  can make an agreement with India in such a way that it does not  have to worry about its security. India and Pakistan can  increase economic cooperation and improve joint capital  investments to strengthen their mutual trust. The U.S. policy  also asks for cooperation between the two nations to the extent  that the situation is stabilized in South Asia. If the United  States and its allies continued to have concern about Pakistan's  nuclear policy, Pakistan cannot be expected to receive favorable  treatment from these powers. Pakistan's demand for equal  treatment of India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue is  reasonable; however, the United States forms its policies  according to its own needs. Our problem is that the United  States is in a position to follow its policies while our  resources to oppose it are limited. We cannot ignore the fact  that India is much larger than Pakistan both from population and  geographic perspectives. It can become a major market for U.S.  products. The United States wants to keep its eye on the Indian  market because of its own economic interests, and wants to get  various benefits from India during this decade. The U.S.  economic experts have observed the emergence of the middle class  in India, and its purchasing power is expect to rise. The U.S.  statisticians estimate that the number of middle class members  will increase to 150 million during the next 10 years, and the  there will be a significant increase in the buyers of U.S.  products and technology. The U.S. economic interests are the  cornerstones of its foreign policy. These interests forced it to  go to war against Iraq, and it benefitted a lot from it. It is  giving India a preferential status because of the economic  issues, and has made a policy to keep it happy. All these facts  should be understood and remembered. If we ignore the facts, we  will be making the biggest mistake in history. If Madam Bhutto  is trying to find a safe place in the U.S. proposed new world  order, we should cooperate with her in this effort. Madam Bhutto  had announced before she came to power again that Pakistan had  to establish a place in the new world order.</p>

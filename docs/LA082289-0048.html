			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> The Dow Jones Industrial Average may not have reached an all-time high as yet,  but some San Diego stocks are continuing to make new highs week after week,  said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> Among the record-setters were Mail Boxes Etc., which rose to $30.75, up 50% in  a month from the $20.50 closing price on July 17. The company has shown  excellent earnings gains, but at its current price is selling for more than 30  times earnings.  </P> <P> First National Corp., which recently declared a 10% stock dividend, was up  again, recorded a new high of $18.50. The bank has shown excellent earnings  gains this year and is seeking acquisition candidates to become San Diego's  largest bank.  </P> <P> Other new highs were recorded by GTI at $5 and International Totalizator at  $4.31. Both Great American Bank and HomeFed Corp., which have been frequently  mentioned as acquisition or merger candidates because of their extensive branch  systems in San Diego, gave up some of the recent gains. Great American was down  $1, and HomeFed dropped $2.50.  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America scraped bottom, hitting an all-time low of $4 before  closing the week at $4.125.  </P> <P> Biomagnetic Technologies continued to drift down as the stock closed at $7,  down $2 from last month's public offering price of $9.  </P> <P> Cubic Corp., which gained $2.50 last week on the strength of its excellent  earnings report, gave back $1.50 of that gain this week to close at $16.  </P></p>

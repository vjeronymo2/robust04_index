			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON AGREES TO PROBE OF DESTROYED RECORDS  </P> <P> Bowing to state demands, Exxon agreed Thursday to submit to a state of Alaska  inquiry over the destruction of computer records in the nation's worst oil  spill.  </P> <P> "They have indicated they were willing to cooperate in such an investigation,"  said Alaska Atty. Gen. Doug Baily.  </P> <P> Exxon, in statements from Houston, declared that no spill documents were  destroyed, only computer copies. The same statement made no mention of Alaska  demands that Exxon submit to an investigation.  </P> <P> But Baily announced Thursday afternoon that lawyers for both sides were meeting  in Anchorage to work out an agreement that would allow the state to get sworn  testimony from Exxon officials within two weeks.  </P></p>

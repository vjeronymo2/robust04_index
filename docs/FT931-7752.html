			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister defends ECGD sell-off A GOVERNMENT minister insisted yesterday that privatisation of part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department of the Department of Trade and Industry had not disadvantaged UK exporters. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, confirmed in the Commons that transitional support from the ECGD for the privatised successor to its insurance services group would continue to be available up to December 1994. This arrangement was designed to ensure that the new company had time to arrange to source its full re-insurance requirements from the private market. Mr Needham said the newly-privatised company sourced over 90 per cent of its reinsurance needs, for both commercial and political risk worldwide, from the private sector. His response came after a concerted Labour attack on the government's export insurance regime, which has been given fresh impetus by ministers' renewed emphasis on exports as an important element in the UK's economic recovery. Mr Needham explained that under a separate arrangement the ECGD provided the new company with 100 per cent reinsurance of the risks - largely political - arising on certain high risk markets for which no capacity was available in the private market. 'This facility is not time-limited and, subject to satisfactory financial performance, it will continue for as long as the government considers it essential to meet the reasonable needs of UK exporters,' Mr Needham said. He also said that, according to 'early indications', the orderly rundown of ECGD's staff numbers over the next 12 months would be achieved by wholly voluntary means.</p>

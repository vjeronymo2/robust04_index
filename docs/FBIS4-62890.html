			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Sukhova in the "Election Campaign in </F> Belarus" column: "State Security and Militia Men Play the Role  of Agitators"]    [Text] Yesterday the registration of presidential  candidates closed in Minsk. The election campaign is in full  swing, and election battles are under way across the territory  of Belorussia [Belarus].    Sensitive to the electrified political atmosphere in the  republic and the candidates' overflowing game spirit, the  Internal Affairs Ministry and the Defense Ministry have decided  to join the election struggle. To avoid a repetition of  mistakes and so as not "to step on a rake," Minsk decided to  find out in good time whose side "the man with the gun" is on so  as to be able to revise his position if necessary.    According to the RID news agency, a special analytical group  including nine officers has been set up in the Defense  Ministry's Education Directorate. The first poll it conducted  showed an incontestable lead by Premier Vyacheslav Kebich (56  percent of the military vote). His main rival Aleksandr  Lukashenko has earned the trust of only 15 percent of the  military, and Stanislav Shushkevich was hard put to get even  four percent. In all likelihood, this four percent have not as  yet heard rumors about the ex-speaker's recent May Day speech in  Baranovichi. This, in spite of the fact that Belorussia's  security bodies have already compiled a circumstantial report on  this trip.    According to a state security official, who "accidentally"  was present at the meeting, Shushkevich was rather sharp "about  Belorussia's military problems." In particular he said that  "compensation to the military must be lower than to Internal  Affairs Ministry employees because they do not risk their lives  every single minute." (In addition, according to the same  source, Shushkevich also maintained that military pensions must  be paid by Russia, also complaining, "Where is the hard currency  for the continued presence of Russian military bases on  Belorussia's territory?") Now the ex-speaker justifies himself  by saying that the report by the special services contains  "distorted facts which nonetheless look very much like the truth  although there is only five percent of the truth in it."    Two more questions are left open: On whose desks have copies  of the report been laid, and by what right are special services  spying on a candidate? According to RID, the special services  have already produced no fewer than 10 reports on statements by  presidential candidates which were submitted to the premier.    Yet in spite of the seeming vigor of the election campaign,  Shushkevich "is bringing up the column's rear." In the  "presidential race" lead car is Vyacheslav Kebich. But even he  has to look over his shoulder all the time because Aleksandr  Lukashenko can overtake him any moment. True, Belorussia's  "implacable mafia fighter" can be let down not only by the  brakes but also the engine: The Slavic White Russia Union  [Sobor], driving him towards the presidency, is going to revise  its policy of promoting three candidates simultaneously,  confining itself to just one. The reason for this decision was  the disagreements that emerged within the Union: Four Minsk  district groups raising signatures in support of Lukashenko  refused to collaborate with him attributing this to the  "inconsistent conduct of Aleksandr Grigorievich's entourage."  Thus, the "Belorussian Commissar Cattagnio's" support group has  reduced by 400 people."    And this at a time when a mere 20,000 signatures were needed  to meet the required 100,000. In a bid to curb disagreements  White Russia stated that on 4 June it will announce one of the  three candidates: Lukhashenko, Kebich, or Novikov. And then the  people will have to make their choice....</p>

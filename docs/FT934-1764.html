			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / College tables: Correction In the performance tables for further education colleges published by the FT on November 24, the first edition omitted to include the statements made in all later editions that the data provided by the education department were incomplete. Later editions also stated that rankings for colleges for whom only A-level results, and not the results of vocational qualifications, were available, should carry a serious 'health warning' as they could not be directly compared with other further education colleges.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: TNT back in the black but payout unlikely this year TNT, the Australian transportation group, returned to the black in the first quarter of its current year with a profit of ADollars 18.3m, compared with a loss of ADollars 33.2m in the same period of the previous year. Sales were ADollars 1.45bn, against ADollars 1.4bn, and operating profit before abnormal items rose to ADollars 34.4m from ADollars 23.4m. The release of first-quarter results coincided with the company's annual meeting in Sydney. Mr Fred Millar, chairman, told the meeting that in spite of the improvement in recent profits figures, he still thought it was unlikely that TNT would pay a dividend in the current year. However, he was 'confident' that dividends would resume in 1995-96. The chairman said Spain remained a problem area for the company, but other European interests generally had made good progress. He also forecast a 'significant improvement' at GD Express Worldwide, the company's express delivery venture, which it owns jointly with various European and Canadian post offices, during the current period. Mr Millar added that TNT was in 'detailed discussions' with potential partners for logistics activities in China, Thailand and Indonesia, although it did not expect developments in these countries to move quickly. Mr David Mortimer, chief executive, said there were no plans at present to float Ansett, the airline which is owned by TNT and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. He added that TNT had not urged the Australian government to keep Air New Zealand out of the Australian internal market, and that it was not on the current agenda to bring a third party into Ansett. The government's recent decision to freeze an agreement which would have allowed the New Zealand carrier to fly domestic Australian routes from November 1 has caused a row between the two countries. There has been speculation that the government is keen to see an alliance formed between Ansett and Air Zealand, thus extending Australia's domestic airline duopoly across the Tasman.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Al Fresco Living: Never mind the weather - It is definitely time to eat outdoors in England Never mind the place or the weather. Officially, it is summer, and the British are determined to eat out of doors. Any excuse will do. This weekend, there will be strawberry feasts at Wimbledon, cricket teas on village greens, hampers at Glyndebourne - even vacuum flask and Tupperware picnics dipped into gratefully on windswept English beaches. Even stay-at-homes may consider lunching lightly under a tree in the garden or setting up a barbecue on the patio in the evening. For recipe ideas, you need look no further than the latest crop of cook-books. CRAB TART (serves 4) Rarely do I warm to cook-books by chefs but Roast Chicken &amp; Other Stories, by Simon Hopkinson with Lindsey Bareham (Ebury, Pounds 17.99), is irresistible: one mouth-watering page follows another. Hopkinson points out that although crab works extremely well here, other sorts of shellfish can be successful. Ingredients: The white meat, plus a little of the brown, from a 2lb cooked cock crab; an 8in short-crust pastry case, blind-baked until cooked through; 1 small tin of Italian plum tomatoes, chopped; 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped; 1 bay leaf; 1 small sprig of thyme; salt and pepper;  1/2 pt double cream;  1/2 tsp saffron threads; 4 egg yolks. Method: Heat the oven to 350`F/180`C (gas mark 4). Put the tomatoes, garlic, herbs and seasoning into a saucepan and reduce to a thickish sauce. Cool, remove the herbs, and spread the sauce in the bottom of the pastry case. Warm together 3 tablespoons of the cream and the saffron and allow to steep for a few minutes. Beat together the yolks and the rest of the cream and add the saffron cream. Season. Fold the crab loosely into the custard and pour the mixture carefully into the tart case. Bake in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until set and pale golden-brown. Serve warm. JAPANESE-STYLE SESAME STEAK (serves 4) This comes from Simply Different, by Sarah Woodward (Macmillan 15.99), a new (to me) young writer, keen traveller and practical cook. The recipe is not, by the author's own admission, authentic Japanese but it is quick, easy, good and suitable for grilling indoors or on a barbecue. Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb rump steak. For the marinade: 2 tablespoons sesame seeds; 2 tablespoons light soy sauce, preferably Japanese; 2 tablespoons dry sherry; 1 teaspoon white sugar. For the dipping sauce: 6 thin spring onions; 1in chunk of fresh ginger root; 2 tablespoons light soy sauce; the juice of half a lemon; 1 teaspoon white sugar; a few drops of Worcester sauce. Method: Trim away any fat and cut the meat into  1/2 in x 2in strips. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over high heat for a minute or so, stirring constantly, until they start to pop. Take care they do not burn. Crush the seeds, mix with the other marinade ingredients, add the steak and leave for half an hour. To make the sauce, first chop the white part of the spring onions very finely and peel and grate the ginger finely. Mix the two together and stir in the remaining ingredients. Heat the grill to maximum, placing a metal baking tray under it. When the baking tray is very hot, add the strips of beef. Grill for two minutes, turn the meat, baste with the rest of the marinade and grill for one to two minutes more depending on how well cooked you like your steak. Alternatively, cook the beef briefly over the glowing coals of a barbecue. Either way, serve the steak as soon as cooked with a little bowl of dipping sauce for each person. BISSARA Unlike her exciting first book, which was flavoured here and there with fish and game, Annie Bell's Evergreen (Bantam, Pounds 16.99) follows a more traditional vegetarian line. This north African puree of broad beans makes a welcome change from the well-known hummus to serve with warm pitta bread and other mezze dishes. Ingredients: 1 1/2 lb broad beans, preferably fresh (but frozen are perfectly adequate);  3/4 teaspoon fresh green chilli, chopped; 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, freshly ground; 1 teaspoon sweet, smoky-flavoured paprika; 1 garlic clove, chopped; 7 tablespoons olive oil; the juice of a small lemon; extra oil, lemon and paprika to serve. Method: Boil the beans for three to four minutes if fresh, or eight minutes if frozen. In the bowl of a food processor place the beans, chilli, cumin, paprika and garlic. Reduce to a puree, trickling in the olive oil and lemon juice. Season and rub through a sieve. Serve at room temperature in a shallow dish with some olive oil trickled over the surface, some lemon juice, and a sprinkling of paprika.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by USSR State Prize Laureate Candidate of Technical </F> Sciences Colonel Yu. Korovkin under the rubric "Flight Safety:  Investigation of Flights Accidents": "A Failure `Leaves Tracks'"]    [Text] Materials will be published under this rubric  on the methodological techniques employed when investigating a  flight accident [LP].    It is necessary to determine in any flight accident whether  it was a failure of the hardware in flight; if so, then why? It  is exceedingly difficult, however, to ascertain the causes for  the appearance and development of a failure from the misshapen  and charred fragments of an accident or crash, since they are  subject to additional influences.    The kinetic energy that an airframe possesses when  encountering an obstacle is realized over a very short time  interval, analogous to an explosion, which smashes structural  elements into small fragments and scatters them across a  considerable distance. This effect is magnified by the  destruction of systems and units operating under high pressures  using gases and liquids, the actuation of pyrotechnic materials  and ammunition, the escape of liquid or gaseous oxygen and the  like. The fire that arises after the ignition of the fuel, the  mass of which is 30--50 percent of the takeoff mass of a  contemporary aircraft, also causes considerable damage.    Establishing the true causes for an LP is moreover an  exceedingly responsible matter, since decisions are made  according to the results of the study that entail millions in  spending, for example to improve production or structural  elements of the airframe, refine operational processes, make  changes in the organization and techniques for personnel  training and perform preventive measures.    A system of methods and means of researching objects from  accidents (hereinafter the system)--for the development of which  the originators were awarded a USSR State Prize--was created at  the NII [Scientific-Research Institute] for the Operation and  Repair of Aviation Hardware [AT] in order to ascertain the  causes of failures in an operative manner. The merits of this  system are that it makes it possible to conduct research under  conditions where:    --the parts and assemblies of the aircraft, on-board  recording devices etc. used as sources of information to  establish the causes of the failure have sustained significant  damage or destruction;    --the information remaining at the disposal of specialists  is  in many cases preserved only in the form of microscopic traces;    --the functional ties between individual elements of the  aircraft system have been destroyed, and often some of them  cannot be found at the scene of the accident (owing to complete  destruction, burning, landing in a body of water etc.);    --the failed unit that led to the accident exists in a  single  copy;    --the aircraft systems have differing functional principles  (from mechanical to electronic);    --the resolution of issues pertaining to various fields of  science (from mathematics to criminology) is required in the  course of the research, and a considerable portion of the  research is being conducted under field conditions right at the  scene of the LP;    --all of the work is performed within a certain time frame.    The system is based on certain common and frequent  scientific  principles that take into account the specific nature of  studying aircraft accident sites. The most important of  those--ensuring the trustworthiness of the results--is achieved  through the use of a host of traits and methods founded on  various principles of physics for the accomplishment of a single  task, the most complete possible reconstruction of information  that was distorted as a result of the effects of destructive  factors, the documentation of all of the results obtained in the  process of research, the strict determination of the sequence of  events, ruling out mistakes that could lead to the loss of  information about a failure, and a combination of methods of  analysis and synthesis when studying the phenomena.    Chief among the methods of obtaining and employing  information on the process of development of an accident  situation are those that provide for the use of the flight  data-recording equipment (SOK), and especially on-board  recording devices (BUR). The effective utilization of flight  information when investigating a flight accident is made more  difficult (in roughly 30 percent of LPs), however, by its  partial or complete loss. Methods of reconstructing and  obtaining information from damaged media (both optical and  magnetic) have thus been developed, and are widely utilized, in  connection with this.    It should be noted that the BUR (even in cases where they  are  physically intact in an LP) carry information about changes in a  limited number of parameters of the flight and operation of the  hardware. Research on the state of the aircraft must therefore  be performed and the place where it came down studied in order  to evaluate the operability of aircraft systems, localize the  failure and establish its causes. A whole set of methods,  founded on various principles of physics and engineering and  taking into account the "materiality" of traces in parts and the  terrain in aviation hardware failures, is used for that purpose.  The general laws for the formation of these "informative" traces  in the downed aircraft have been determined and methods and  techniques have been developed that make it possible to  ascertain them in the fragments of an airframe and "force" them  to "talk."    It is possible to determine from the traces on the parts the  conditions of their destruction (in flight or upon impact with  an obstacle). It has been established, for example, that the  following characteristics of the state of the AT can be  reflected in those traces in an impact with an obstacle:    --the kinetic energy of spinning rotors (aviation engines,  generators, pumps and the like);    --the pressure of working media (liquids, gases) and their  mass and volume in aircraft systems;    --the position of controls, elements of automatic equipment,  instruments and indicators;    --the presence (or absence) of residual magnetization of a  certain level;    --the degree of heating of the parts.    Mathematical and physical modeling (part-scale and  full-scale) of the dynamics of flight and the trajectory of  movement of the airframe are widely used in the course of  investigating an LP on the basis of information from the flight  data-recording equipment. Modeling is employed in those cases  where the information from the BUR and the data obtained on the  state of the aircraft wreckage are insufficient to determine the  causes of hardware failure. It is performed with the aim of  establishing:    --the possibility and duration of the development of the  damage ascertained in a part in the failure of a unit or  assembly;    --the types of flaws that led to a failure recorded in  flight;    --the actual conditions of the operation of the part, as  well  as the boundary conditions at which the ascertained flaw arises;    --the correspondence of the damage existing on the parts to  a  certain (operable or inoperable) state of the assembly;    --the sequence of the destruction of parts;    --the possibility of the practical realization of the stated  hypotheses on the causes for the appearance of the failure.    In order to formulate a conclusion, we turn to methods that  provide for the logical processing of the primary information,  as well as analysis and synthesis of the data gathered at all  stages of the investigation of the LP. I would like to single  out among those the method of structuring a diagram of the  cause-and-effect links. Standard flowcharts are used as the  foundation, and are then clarified and supplemented in the  course of the investigation of a specific LP. The structuring is  performed by stages--from a known final consequence, obtained  from an analysis of the circumstances of the LP and information  from the SOK, to its primary cause.    Technical gear, both special gear and some used in other  areas of science and technology, has been developed and is  employed to investigate aircraft wreckage. Flying laboratories  equipped with all of the necessary equipment for working under  field conditions are of especially great significance.    This system provides for the quite complete performance of  the tasks that arise at all stages of the investigation of an  LP. Its effectiveness is characterized by the fact that the  concrete cause of the failure is found in 50 percent of the  cases, it is established that there was no failure in 40 percent  of the cases, and only in 10 percent of the cases is a cause not  found (likely or possible causes are indicated).    It must be noted in conclusion that one feature of improving  the system of methods for investigating crashed aircraft is its  ever greater algorithmization, thanks to which the necessary  preconditions are created for a fundamentally new stage--the  adoption of expert systems (ES) into the practice of  investigating flight accidents. These are distinguished by the  fact that they are oriented toward resolving a broad range of  tasks in areas that were not formalized before, which were felt  to be little accessible to the use of computers.    The specialists using ESs in the course of investigating an  LP can surpass the capabilities of experts in that realm. This  would make it possible to expand the circle of issues they  resolve by accumulating the knowledge of highly qualified  experts in the ESs.    All of the agencies concerned must be brought into the  creation of ESs (coordination of the algorithms for identifying  a priori information, entered into the system and  used in the future to determine the causes of failures in  automated mode). This will facilitate a rise in the objectivity  of the evaluations, and will make it possible to come to a  unified opinion in the course of a specific LP investigation on  questions of the traits and nature of the development of AT  failures and, consequently, its causes as well, and to take  effective and coordinated steps to prevent LPs and increase the  safety of flights.

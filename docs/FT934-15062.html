			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (7): Problems, but full of promise - Jon Marks finds the countries of North Africa hold rewards for those prepared to face the difficulties of doing business with them / The Maghreb region 'I COULD sign up so many contracts this week,' the finance director of a leading exporting company said during a recent visit to Algeria. 'It's just that I can't find the way to finance them.' Traditionally, multinationals used subsidiaries in France, Italy and other leading trading partners to tap the high levels of trade finance and export credit agency (ECA) cover available for Algeria. Now, concern over the scale of debt repayments, estimated at more than Dollars 9bn in 1993, has led many ECAs to reduce their cover. This has deprived Algiers of the medium-term credit which was for years the lifeblood of its business. 'Foreign loans are only available short-term - and then if we pay a sweetener - from banks who still say they believe in our future,' says Mr Abdelkader Belgherbi, a vice-governor of the central bank, Banque d'Algerie. 'This is a problem for an economy which depended on credit for 20 years.' Algeria has never rescheduled its debt - although that is now an option - and maintains a good repayments record. Exporters are suffering from the credit crunch. Some, such as Italian grain producers (with annual exports of Dollars 400m) and steel companies have lobbied governments to increase support. They are opposed by treasuries, concerned at the high levels of risk involved. Algeria is the single largest risk for the Italian ECA, Sezione Speciale per Assicuzione del Credito all'Esportazione (SACE), whose total exposure is about Dollars 6.5bn. Trade credits guaranteed by the Coface, French ECA, are also about Dollars 6bn. Exporters are having to secure financing by whatever route possible. With France limiting itself to a credit package of Fr6bn this year and Italy imposing new limits, companies are looking farther and wider for support. The rewards can be great. Big ticket contracts, especially for hydrocarbons schemes such as the estimated Dollars 2bn Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline, will continue to attract companies to Algeria. But the country's potential will remain unfulfilled while the credit crunch prevails. This process is working in reverse elsewhere in the region comprising Egypt and the five Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) members - Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania. Other markets are gaining from improved credit ratings. After the Gulf war of 1991, Egypt's debt programme, new credits and slow moves towards liberalisation have yielded dividends. A Dollars 2bn-plus current account surplus is forecast for 1993 and foreign exchange reserves stand at Dollars 16bn. Exporters to Egypt report that local banks, led by National Bank of Egypt (NBE), are using reserves to finance trade deals at advantageous rates. Morocco has seen ECA cover restored after the debt crisis of the 1980s. Italy, Belgium and the UK are among those using credit support to challenge France and Spain in one of their leading markets. In 1992, Morocco replaced Algeria as France's largest export market in the Maghreb region. As the region struggles with the populist challenge of radical Islam and rapidly rising populations (with Tunisia at under 2 per cent an exception), North Africa is not an easy region with which to do business. But an increasing number of analysts believe the region offers a new emerging market opportunity. They are looking towards Morocco, Tunisia and, to a lesser extent, Egypt. To others, it is a region in political turmoil where nation states have yet to come to terms with the challenge of radical Islam, a demographic time bomb or the need for solid institutions. Their worries centre on developments in Algeria, Libya and (also) Egypt. Arab North Africa offers trading partners a rich but frustrating blend of promise and problems. The EC has understood this, and will this autumn begin formal negotiations with Tunisia and Morocco to establish innovative free trade zones. Once concluded, these agreements linking North African states more closely to the European economy should substantially increase business opportunities  -on both flanks of the Mediterranean. Algeria is hungry for credit which cannot be supplied. To maintain debt repayments estimated at Dollars 9.1bn in 1993, when exports will not exceed Dollars 12bn, imports need to be held down. Reserves (minus gold stocks) had to be built to around Dollars 2bn by mid-1993, in spite of payments pressures. However, the market needs large-scale imports to stimulate higher industrial output or productive private enterprise. Algiers may now reschedule after years of resistance to such a strategy. The hydrocarbons sector will remain the focus of business activity. Egypt, the region's most populous country (59m), has gained from its 1991 debt accord with sovereign lenders to tie debt relief to progress on economic reforms, with a current account surplus capable of weathering the downturn in tourism and a build-up of foreign reserves giving increased scope for financing contracts. NBE now says it could finance larger schemes from its own resources. Private sector banks are emerging, notably Commercial International Bank, which is favoured by trade financiers. Reform has moved slowly, but privatisation is under way and full currency convertibility is expected. Substantial bilateral credits (especially from the US, France and Arab funds) and multilateral credits for projects (notably the power sector) are features of the market. Morocco is fast gaining support for the view that it can emerge as a Mediterranean investment and manufacturing centre. The dirham has been made convertible for current account transactions. An accelerating privatisation policy is stimulating new investment and interest from fund managers. In 1992, foreign investment (at Dollars 514m) for the first time exceeded the current account deficit. Trade flows have come under pressure from drought and a weak international phosphate market. Imports and exports are down in 1993. Drought meant that GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 1992. But Morocco has emerged stronger from a decade of structural adjustment, and growth is reported in most sectors. Manufacturing exports are forecast to grow by 10 per cent in 1994. Reserves remain more than Dollars 3.5bn, sufficient to cover six months of imports. All leading ECAs now provide cover, although many have ceilings in place. Soft credits are often needed to secure larger orders. Tunisia is the country where everyone wants to do more business. Bankers and companies visit, admire the economy's positive points and creditworthiness - and then often leave empty-handed. All ECAs are fully on-cover. The government's strategy is based on investment-led growth, especially in technology-related industries. This is to maintain growth rates which rose to 8.6 per cent in 1992 and for Tunis to become 'the Singapore of the Mediterranean'. Growth is forecast at around 3 per cent in 1993. Inflation fell to 5.5 per cent in 1992, and birth rates are low. But the population (8.5m people) is too small to provide an important consumer market. Imports rose to a new high in 1992, but were less than Dollars 6bn. A few big industrial projects are under way, notably British Gas' Dollars 620m Miskar gasfield project. Tunisia is seen as a rare successful graduate of structural adjustment in Africa. In January the government introduced current account convertibility for imports andexports, leading to an unusual outburst from the visiting IMF managing-director Michel Camdessus who described it as 'the most beautiful present I have ever been given'. Mauritania is the smallest, most aid-dependent UMA market. Merchandise exports in 1991 were Dollars 230m and imports Dollars 211m. In December 1992, the IMF concluded a two-year enhanced structural adjustment facility. France dominates a market which has suffered recession in fishing and its few other industries. Libya is affected by sanctions, imposed as a consequence of the Lockerbie affair. Payments arrears can be endemic for all but priority projects. But the market continues to attract exporters in line with Libya's status as an Opec oil producer with a relatively small population (around 5m) and high imports (around Dollars 8bn). Libya remains the UK's largest UMA market, with exports worth Pounds 228m in 1992. Annual oil exports are Dollars 9 to Dollars 10bn. Tightening sanctions to include hydrocarbons and financial reserves would hurt. Libya is estimated to hold up to Dollars 17bn in liquid foreign assets and some Dollars 4bn fixed assets. Payments can be a problem. Contractors, including German and South Korean companies, often use long-term letters of credit to finance deals.</p>

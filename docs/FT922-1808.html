			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Asda launches discount store ASDA is launching a limited-range discount superstore which, if successful, may lead to a significant repositioning of the Leeds-based grocery chain. The company will today open a converted 34,000 sq ft superstore, trading under the Dales logo, in Longsight, Manchester. Two other experimental stores are expected to follow shortly in different catchment areas. The Dales stores will provide a narrow range of goods concentrating on fruit and vegetables and baked products.</p>

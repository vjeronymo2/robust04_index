			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Mixed signals for franchise in privatised BR: The government yesterday launched a consultation exercise to find out what would tempt the private sector to take over British Rail's passenger trains after privatisation EVER wanted to run a railway? Many, apparently, do. According to Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, no fewer than 50 companies have expressed an interest in taking franchises to operate British Rail's passenger services after privatisation. The big question is whether they will still want to do so once they know what it involves. A 168-page consultation paper published yesterday is intended not just to tell them what franchising might mean, but to ask them if they think it will work. The basics of rail privatisation were set out in a white paper last July. A BR subsidiary called Railtrack will continue to own the railway tracks, but the operation of BR's passenger services will be franchised out to private-sector companies. In addition, other companies will be allowed to run trains in competition with those operated by franchisees. Fleshing out those bones, yesterday's consultation paper says that franchising will be undertaken progressively, not in a single 'big bang'. Assuming royal assent for a privatisation bill next summer, the aim is to franchise a 'substantial' proportion of passenger services in the lifetime of the current parliament, with the bidding starting in 1994. The franchise areas, as expected, will broadly resemble BR's 19 existing profit centres - for example, InterCity's West Coast main line, or Network SouthEast's Thames &amp; Chiltern division. Other configurations, or even individual services, may be franchised provided the effect is not to leave BR with a rump of unviable odds and ends. Franchises will be awarded on the basis of competitive tendering. In the case of the profitable InterCity operations, franchises will go to the highest bidders, while in the case of loss-making Network SouthEast and Regional Railways services, the winners will be those companies which require the lowest subsidies. After that, franchisees will rent or buy their rolling stock from BR and start making money - or losing it. They will bear the full commercial risk of their operations, paying track charges, rolling stock rentals, wages and other operating costs out of fare revenues and hoping they are left with a profit. As a result, employee concerns about privatisation seem justified. If franchisees are to make money, they will need to cut costs, and the consultation paper says they will be free to change employees' working conditions once the franchise is under way. 'Bids would therefore need to reflect the costs of making these changes, including redundancy costs if staff are planned to be replaced or overall numbers reduced,' the paper says. Passengers are assured that loss-making services will continue to be subsidised; that franchisees will be required to provide a specified minimum level of services; and that operators failing to deliver acceptable standards of service will face penalties up to and including the loss of the franchise. On fares, as on many other points, the paper is vague. It says that franchisees will be free to set their own fare levels, raising the possibility of stiff increases on some services. But it also says this power will be restricted 'where rail enjoys significant market power', suggesting that Network SouthEast fares will stay under political control. The future of stations, too, is shrouded in mystery. The paper says franchisees might want to operate the stations lying on their routes. Alternatively, a developer might wish to acquire the right to develop them. Then again, 'there could be scope for joint ventures'. The paper fails to resolve some issues of acute concern to would-be franchisees. One question is whether they will face competition from 'cherry pickers' - free-wheeling operators grabbing traffic from the franchisee's most profitable services. Ministers say that, in practice, the opportunities for competition on the rails are likely to be limited by shortages of train paths. Nevertheless, the consultation paper reaffirms the government's commitment to open access. Would-be franchisees are therefore left wondering how they are to frame their bids when they cannot be sure how much competition they will face. Mr MacGregor's answer to all such questions yesterday was that the point of the exercise was to find out the private sector's views before reaching conclusions. Even then, different passenger services had different characteristics, so there could be no universal template. 'We have taken a quite deliberate decision not to lay down a rigid blueprint for franchises,' he said. 'The private sector may well want to suggest different approaches to different types of service and I want to make sure that the franchising system is flexible enough to accommodate their ideas.' Would-be train operators have only a month to respond to the document: the exercise ends on November 12. The Franchising of Passenger Rail Services.

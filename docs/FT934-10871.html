			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swedish bank back in profit HIGHER revenues, cost-cutting and lower credit losses combined to help Svenska Handelsbanken swing to an operating profit of SKr1.39bn (Dollars 170m) in the first nine months of 1993 from a SKr883m loss in the same 1992 period. The bank's result has improved in every quarter this year, culminating in a SKr552m profit in the July to September period. This recovery and the SKr2.65bn proceeds of its October rights issue have left it in a strong competitive position based on a 12.4 per cent capital adequacy ratio. Total operating income in the first nine months was up 17 per cent at SKr10.7bn. This followed a 10 per cent rise in net interest income to SKr7.54bn and higher commission and property rental income. The bank also realised SKr400m in capital gains on bond sales, compared with SKr80m last time round. Expenses were virtually unchanged at SKr3.98bn, with higher system development costs and the weaker Swedish krona offsetting a 2 per cent fall in personnel costs. Another encouraging feature of the report was the 12 per cent fall in loan losses to SKr5.28bn, equal to 2.6 per cent of total lending. Problem loans fell to SKr12.4bn, or 4.5 per cent of lending volume, compared with SKr13.2bn at the end of June. Svenska Handelsbanken has weathered the Swedish banking crisis better than its rivals, and was the only significant bank in the Nordic region which neither received nor sought government assistance.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Perfect Christmas bliss, virtually: Louise Kehoe's diary of a 21st-century working mother fell through a time warp into the hands of the FT I've finished my Christmas shopping at last. It's taken me hours, but Harry, my personal assistant, came up with some really great ideas. He took me 'net surfing' around the world's shopping malls to find just the right thing for everyone on my list. I even found the perfect gift for my brother, Francis, the 'young man who has everything'. We found a store in Tokyo selling a brand new line of calendars that automatically adjust to local time zones. I'm sure he will like it because as a network bandwidth broker - selling time on worldwide digital communications networks - he spends much of his day in international video meetings. I asked the store to design the calendar with some original sports graphics. I'm really looking forward to seeing the look on Francis's face, Christmas morning, when he logs on to the network and finds the calendar has been downloaded on to his personal organiser. For my husband I ordered You're the 49er Quarterback, an interactive fantasy game. My daughter, Beth, 16, will get a driving simulator and a new pocket video phone. My 14-year-old son wanted a virtual girlfriend. I'm not sure that I approve, but better that than the human variety, I suppose. Perhaps a subscription to Starnet, the latest science fiction network, would keep his mind on galactic travel. Jessie, 8, my younger daughter, has asked Santa for a 'walking, talking Barbie' with long blonde hair, like her own. Harry had to scour the country to find one. It is the hit toy of the year and most stores have sold out. I also bought a new kitchen control unit for my parents. They still use a portable personal computer to programme their kitchen and it is so much nicer to have a built-in model. The whole family - my parents in Cheshire, my brothers and their wives and children in various parts of the UK and my sister, who is working on a big computerised library project in Spain - will all be gathering 'virtually' for Christmas dinner, via video links. Harry arranged the whole thing for me via DinersNet. We chose the traditional holiday package: turkey and all the trimmings. The food will be delivered to our homes on Christmas eve. Harry has E-mailed the cooking instructions to everyone's chief assistants so that their kitchens will be pre-programmed. As a surprise I arranged for live Christmas trees to be delivered along with the food. These days most people have hologram trees, but to me there is nothing quite like the real thing, even if it does mean cleaning up pine needles. We booked the video links months in advance. It is still expensive, but the price is coming down by the month. In any case, I wanted to put our new 'life size' displays to use. We just had them installed in the dining room, so we will literally be surrounded by family members for Christmas dinner. This will be the first Christmas that we have all been together for years. No doubt there will be a lot of reminiscing. Mum is sure to bring out her collection of old family photographs. Her grandchildren have a hard time believing that we used to snap pictures with little hand-held cameras and then take the film to a photograph developer, waiting for hours or days to get back a set of prints. These days it's all digital imaging. We can play back Christmas dinner over and over if we choose, or capture a special moment and record it on a wallet-sized smartcard that plugs into any display terminal. The youngsters have no idea what we used to go through getting ready for Christmas; fighting the traffic and traipsing through shopping malls to buy presents and then spending most of Christmas day in the kitchen fretting over the turkey. The information highway changed all that. By the mid-1990s TV shopping was already very popular. Then electronic catalogues stored on computer discs became all the rage. Now you can access almost any shop on the planet and arrange for express delivery of goods. It makes life so much easier. But I would be lost without Harry. He's my right-hand man, my network guide; a sort of Jeeves character, like a family butler. I designed his personality myself, choosing attributes from an electronic directory. His facial image was created automatically to match. They say that the personality of your digital assistant tells a lot about your own character. I'm rather old-fashioned. For example, I still like to read newspapers printed on paper. That is considered rather eccentric these days. Of course, I also have my multi-media text, graphics and video 'personal news-source' downloaded to my office screen every morning, with news that relates to my business. But I enjoy flicking through the pink pages, just for old times' sake. Besides, even the best news assistants don't always pick out everything that might interest you. For instance there was a ghastly story in yesterday's paper about a virus, called Homewrecker. It got into somebody's home and caused havoc with the environmental controls. The heating system blew up, the refrigerator defrosted and water pipes burst. It is hard to believe that the security sensors would not have picked something up, but I imagine they must have been disabled by the virus. I must ask Harry to run an extra virus scan on our home network. So much for the wonders of home automation. Harry says I shouldn't read 'paper news' because it always stresses the negative aspects of the 'information age'. Of course, he would say that. He's digital. I'm not one of those 'anti-tech' types, but I do have some reservations. I'm not convinced that information technology is always good for the environment. Electronic communications have vastly reduced the use of paper, but the average consumption of electricity, per household, is climbing. And with the paper industry in decline, there is little incentive for companies to maintain the forests they used to harvest. The ecological impact of technology is becoming very complex. On the other hand, there is no doubt the information superhighway has created new opportunities. My daughter is studying at an on-line university and I am taking courses in multi-media production. The biggest change, however, has been in our home life. Now we all work at home, telecommuting to our jobs. We've been able to cut back from three cars to one, but the savings have gone into financing an extension to the house for our offices. Some people find it hard to adapt to being 'homebound'. It doesn't help that land travel is becoming so expensive. We can visit distant cities electronically at a touch of the screen, but transporting your body has become a real luxury. Personally, I don't miss those supersonic flights. I always felt disoriented when landing in a foreign country and the jet lag was awful. These days I like to take the occasional 'virtual vacation' right here in my living room. Last month I took a trip on HawaiiNet. I just put on my swimsuit and basked in the sights, sounds and aromas of white sands and swaying palm trees. You can't beat it. Enough of this dreaming. I must get back to writing Christmas cards. I send them on MailNet, which only takes a few seconds, but I like to write a personal greeting on each one. Then we are off to see Santa Claus. Even he is electronic now. The children would never miss seeing Santa's reindeer pulling his sleigh through the sky on Christmas eve. The image is created with high-power lights reflected on a simulated cloud, but we try to keep that a secret. Not for much longer in this family, I fear. Yesterday, my daughter Jessie asked me if Santa Claus is 'virtual'. What could I say?</p>

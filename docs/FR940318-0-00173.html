			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, the shifts in proportions of chemicals used in the formulation result in less waste than is normally generated through the traditional manufacturing process, resulting in a lower probability of overall adverse effects to the general population. The Agency also investigated the production of waste before and after the actual cleaning process and found that waste generation at these points in the production process would not be greater than what is seen with CFC&hyph;113 or MCF use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This acceptability listing also applies to water-removable fluxes and inert gas soldering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Straight organic solvent cleaning. Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual chemicals as well as in combinations. The Agency's justification for this decision is described in the section on acceptable substitutes for metals cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Other chlorinated solvents. Trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (perc) and methylene chloride (meth) are all acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. The reasons for this decision are described in the metals cleaning discussion. Although these solvents have not received as much commercial interest for electronics cleaning as for metals cleaning applications, the Agency did receive a request to review these chemicals for electronics cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Agency's risk screen focused on use of these chemicals in metals cleaning operations, the screen suggests that release profiles for these chemicals in electronics cleaning will be either the same or lower. As a result, the Agency has reached the same conclusion with respect to electronics cleaning as in the metals cleaning analysis, namely that any risks due to the inherent toxicity of these chemicals could be controlled by existing and future regulatory standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning. Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning are all acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in electronics cleaning. The Agency did not identify any environmental issues associated with use of these substitutes. While ozone is hazardous to human health, OSHA has already set standards for use of this compound in the workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Volatile methyl siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these chemicals will be handled under a separate rule-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Precision cleaning. (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Semi-aqueous/aqueous cleaners. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Semi-aqueous and aqueous cleaners are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The reasons for this decision are the same as those described in the metals cleaning section. Each of these alternatives has the potential to service approximately 65 percent of the precision cleaning market. This figure may overestimate the technical potential for water-based cleaners in this sector, since this end use sector faces the greatest technical constraints in implementing new cleaning alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency did not specifically examine risks from water-based formulations used in precision cleaning since the processes are typically either similar to those used in metals cleaning or have lower throughputs and therefore fewer discharges. Therefore, the analysis assumed that these risks from precision cleaning would be either comparable to or less than risks associated with use of water-based formulations for metals cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Other chlorinated solvents. Other chlorinated solvents are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The reasons for this decision are described in the section on metals cleaning. For the analysis of risks from these substitutes in the precision cleaning end use sector, the Agency made the same assumptions as in its analysis for electronics cleaning applications of water-based formulations, namely that exposures would be equal to or less than exposures in the metals cleaning sector since the processes for precision cleaning are similar or even of lower emissions than those for metals cleaning. Consequently, the Agency believes that risks would also be either equivalent or lower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Straight organic solvent cleaning. Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual chemicals as well as in combinations. The Agency's justification for this decision is described in the section on acceptable substitutes for metals cleaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning. Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning are all acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The Agency did not identify any environmental issues associated with use of these substitutes. While ozone is hazardous to human health, OSHA has already set standards for use of this compound in the workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Volatile Methyl Siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the precision cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals will be handled under a separate rule-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Substitutes acceptable subject to use conditions. (None). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

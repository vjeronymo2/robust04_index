			<p>BFN     [Text] Leon (Mexico), 31 Mar (EFE) -- Authorities reported  today nine people were injured during a Molotov cocktail attack  allegedly executed by members of the Leftist Revolutionary  Movement (MIR) [Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria] in Leon,  Guanajuato, central Mexico.    The attack, which occurred yesterday afternoon, has left  more  than 50 people homeless, because it caused a fire that destroyed  13 houses.    Local police reported the reasons for the incident are still  undetermined, but witnesses say two men called Arturo Andrade  and Rito Duran, MIR leaders, were the ones who threw the bombs.    Area residents have said this is not the first time the  alleged culprits have attacked the area with explosives. Five  years ago, the residents say, those people also threw bombs at  them, because they refused to pay a cooperation quota to their  organization.    The attack was apparently aimed against the house of Maria  Guadalupe Perez, a former MIR member who decided to leave that  organization a few months ago.    MIR is an ultra-leftist political organization that emerged  in the past decade and has influence in several states in  central Mexico. MIR has not openly declared itself an armed  group.</p>

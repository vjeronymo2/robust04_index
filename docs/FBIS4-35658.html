			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read commentary] </F>   [Text] At a time when Algeria is making every possible  effort to solve all the problems of its multifaceted crisis,  statements emerge from overseas trying to turn Algeria into a  test ground and political laboratory in an attempt to cover  blatantly their rivalry over Algeria and the region.    It is normal for crises to occur in societies and states,  but  the increasing number of those who have ambitions in Algeria is  not normal.    Circles and institutes in capitals of world superpowers made  various speculations about our future. But the prescription  they have made out for us to pull through the crisis does not  succeed in concealing the political, economic, and financial  interests of these circles themselves. This prescription might  then be described as a talisman of interests by contemporary  oracles competing to interpret Algeria's crisis according to  their self interests.    It is true Algeria is in need of economic help to carry out  a  series of comprehensive economic reforms to pull through the  crisis. Algeria has negotiated with international institutions  in this regard and for this purpose. The president made this  clear in his meeting with the diplomatic corps by saying  Algeria's crisis was not eternal but a temporary one Algeria was  capable of pulling through.    We should, nevertheless, wonder about the responsibility and  duty of international institutions that supposedly are a result  of civilized international relations. Algeria's strategic and  economic weight is very well known to governments and investors  who are leading the free economy or the market economy on a  world scale.    Algeria's standing in the whole of North Africa should not  be  underestimated, and its stability positively reflects on the  whole region. In fact statements that interfere in our internal  affairs -- statements that unfortunately are sometimes reported  by our newspapers -- only prove the importance of Algeria.  Algeria is not an American-European spoil of war. Algeria  today is composed of a number of functional institutions and  efforts are being made to combat the ordeal from which Algeria  is emerging.</p>

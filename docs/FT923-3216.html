			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (3): Miracles need a long haul - Tony Hawkins takes an overview of the economic prospects ONLY a handful of third world countries in East Asia have made the difficult leap from factor-driven growth, exploiting abundant low-cost labour or rich natural resources, to a modern, investment-driven economy. Mauritius, having already exploited to the full its narrow resource base, will try during the 1990s to make this transition to a skills-intensive, service-led economy. It has little choice, because employment of both labour and land is forcing it upmarket into territory where, today at least, it has no obvious comparative advantage. International trends are forcing it along a new, more difficult, growth path too. Liberalisation of the world trading system - especially the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) - will remove an important source of past competitive advantage in the form of preferences in the European Community, while reform of the EC's common agricultural policy will hurt the sugar sector. With two of the island's three economic pillars, clothing and sugar, under threat from global forces, as well as domestic constraints, the third pillar, tourism, will have to be supplemented by new sources of growth. The trick in the 1990s will be to 'grow' new competitive advantage, especially in services: offshore banking and other business services, a free port, increased tourism, diversified agriculture and manufacturing; in the same way as it successfully developed into a world-class exporter of knitwear over the last decade. But it is going be more difficult this time round, partly because there is no longer a pool of skilled and semi-skilled workers to exploit, but also because the world of the 1990s threatens to be far more competitive. Mauritius expects to lose some of its preferential advantage in the single European market to low-cost manufacturers like Greece and Portugal, while facing tougher competition from other third world exporters if and when the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation measures is implemented. Following the important structural reforms of the early 1980s, the Mauritian economy has grown at almost 6 per cent a year, with the main thrust coming from the export processing zone( EPZ), dominated by clothing manufacturers, whose share of GDP more than doubled from 6 per cent in 1984 to 14 per cent last year. Sugar, the traditional locomotive of growth, whose reinvested profits fuelled both industrial and tourism expansion, still accounts for 10 per cent of GDP, while tourism's direct share, at 3 per cent, much understates its real importance as a foreign currency earner (16 per cent of the total) and as a source of employment. Growth prospects have deteriorated with the onset of full employment. EPZ growth slowed dramatically from more than 30 per cent annually in the mid-1980s, to an average 7 per cent a year since 1987. This reflected intensified competition in global markets, some loss of competitiveness as wage inflation took hold, and the tightening labour constraint as unemployment fell below 3 per cent last year from 19 per cent in 1983. Despite this, EPZ expansion still accounts for more than a fifth of post-1987 economic growth. By contrast, the sugar sector has gone backwards, with value-added declining 6 per cent over the past five years The bulk of growth (60 per cent) has come from services, with the finance sector, on which great hopes are pinned, expanding at more than 6.5 per cent a year. The balance of payments is healthy: a current account deficit of MR274m (Dollars 20m), 0.7 per cent of GDP. Mauritius has a large trade deficit of MR3.3bn (Dollars 235m), but this will be more than offset by tourist earnings of over MR4bn in 1992, while capital inflows, in recent years, have averaged MR1.5bn. External debt is modest at Dollars 938m (1990), with a debt-service ratio of 6 per cent. Hopes of maintaining growth at 6 per cent look optimistic. The signs are that Mauritius will have to settle for a more sedate 4 per cent growth rate in the 1990s, although this year GDP is forecast to rise 6.5 per cent, chiefly on the strength of a recovery in the sugar sector following last year's drought. Export processing zone (EPZ) diversification - with reduced dependence on clothing in favour of electronics, watch assembly, jewellery manufacture - has not yet materialised. There is a strong feeling that the Free Zone firms would do better to stick (literally) to their knitting. At present almost 85 per cent of EPZ workers are employed in the garment industry, with another 6 per cent in textiles, and this sectoral concentration has been increasing. The Mauritian education system is well equipped to provide the type of worker required for relatively low-skill clothing manufacture, but its capacity to turn out workers capable of operating high-tech state-of-the-art equipment, and people trained to staff and manage entrepreneurial service activities, is very much in doubt. Even if indigenous skills can be developed, there are just not enough pairs of hands to go round. This means not only that labour participation rates must rise, with more women being enticed to take jobs - participation rates are twice as high among men - but also that productivity growth must be secured from substantial new investment in both the software and hardware of modern business. Traditionally, growth and diversification has depended heavily on the reinvested surpluses of the sugar sector. But with sugar profitability on the wane, new sources of savings will have to be found. The 1992 budget tackles this problem, with a raft of new savings incentives targeted specifically at stock market investment. Unlike the Asian tigers, Mauritius is not a significant player in the inward investment game, attracting less than Dollars 150m in new foreign capital inflows during the 1980s. Investment has therefore been dependent on domestic savings levels which, fortunately, have averaged 27 per cent of GDP in recent years, sufficient for GDP growth of at least 5 per cent a year, given existing rates of investment efficiency. As sugar surpluses fall, however, so Mauritius will need to attract more foreign interest - not just financial inflows, but the even more important inputs of technology, expertise and access to markets, to brandnames and subcontracting arrangements. Attracting these inflows is not going to be easy; with a GDP of less than Dollars 3.5bn, the domestic market has little to offer. Government ministers believe that the improved economic prospects in the island's natural hinterland - east and southern Africa - will turn Mauritius into an attractive location for entrepot business, interfacing between Africa and south-east Asia; for regional headquarters for multinational companies as well for the offshore banking and financial services. Mr Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, sees post-apartheid South Africa as the locomotive most likely to start up the regional economy. But there is an element of wishful thinking in this regional service centre picture, given the continuing - indeed, accelerating - marginalisation of Africa and the probability of only a sluggish South African economy for the next few years at least. Even if the plan were to come good, it is very much a long-haul one. The upbeat side of it is the Mauritian track record. Given the transformation in little more than a decade from sugar mono-economy to a finely-balanced three-legged stool - sugar, clothing and tourism - the islanders' resilience and resourcefulness should not be underestimated. Mr Sithanen has started well by rationalising domestic monetary and tax policies to increase savings and investment, while also abolishing what remained of exchange controls. There is more to be done. For all its reputation as a liberal, outward-oriented economy, Mauritius today has more price controls than five 5 years ago; its system of centralised wage-bargaining is a drag on industrial and commercial efficiency. Mr Sithanen acknowledges that the public sector is overmanned, agreeing that labour must be retrained and redeployed; the sugar milling sector needs to be rationalised to reduce the number of mills and thereby improving efficiency, and the one-stop investment shop at the ministry of industry needs to be streamlined. Above all, the Mauritian miracle is going to run out of steam unless it can revitalise its human sector. Two elements are crucial. The first is the will to win, and many doubt whether the cheerful, easy-going Mauritian people, increasingly accustomed to rapidly-improving living standards (per capita income have risen 70 per cent since 1980 - have that killer instinct. Second, and perhaps more importantly, they may not have the core competencies necessary to succeed in a world where low-cost labour is no longer a passport to economic growth. Developing new attitudes and new competencies will - like financial sector growth  - be a long haul.  ----------------------------------------------------------- GDP GROWTH RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------- Years                          Annual growth rates  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1980                           -10.1 1981                             6.4 1982                             5.8 1983                             0.4 1984                             4.7 1985                             6.8 1986                             8.9 1987                             8.4 1988                             6.1 1989                             4.7 1990                             7.1 1991                             4.6 1992*                            6.5  ----------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast Source: Central Statistical Office, St Louis  -----------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION  ----------------------------------------------------------- Years     Annual %  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1980      42 1981      14.5 1982      11.4 1983      5.6 1984      7.3 1985      6.7 1986      1.8 1987      0.6 1988      9.2 1989      12.6 1990      13.5 1991      7.0 1992*      5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast Source: Central Statistical Office, St Louis  -----------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (MRs in millions)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal years                   1989-1990     1990-1991     1991-1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports                        15,925        18,166        19,499 Imports                        20,019        21,971        22,846 Trade deficit                  -4,094        -3,805        -3,347 Net invisibles                 +2,228        +2,945        +3,073 Current account deficit        -1,866        -860          -274 Net capital                    +1,409        +1,714        +1,428 Unrecorded flows               +3,498        +2,259        +1,894 Overall balance                +3,041        +3,113        +3,048  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of Mauritius  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

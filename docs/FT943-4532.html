			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Brent International at Pounds 4m following restructure Mr Keith Hutchings, promoted in March to chief executive of Brent International, said that over the past year the speciality chemicals group's businesses had been simplified and refocused into two divisions: printing services and industrial. Management of most operating units had now been replaced or restructured. At the same time the group announced a 32 per cent rise in profits before tax and exceptionals to Pounds 4.01m for the first half of 1994. After exceptionals of Pounds 2.1m, last time's headline pre-tax figure was Pounds 931,000. The interim dividend remains 1.6p. Mr Hutchings said the executives on the board were now settled following the resignation of Mr Steve Cuthbert as chief executive in August 1993. Mr Cuthbert's resignation was followed by a decline in profits to Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 11.5m) for 1993, accompanied by a cut in the total dividend to 4p (7.4p). Since then Mr Hutchings moved up from finance director, Mr Bill Jessup returned to fill that post, and Mr Sandy Dobbie was hired as chief operating officer this June. In the half, performance of the printing services - to be overseen by Mr Hutchings for the next 18 months - had been 'encouraging' with sales up 16 per cent to Pounds 11.2m. UK sales of inks and coatings advanced 25 per cent. Divisional operating profits grew to Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 1.94m). Profits on the industrial side fell to Pounds 1.96m, against Pounds 2.44m (which included a Pounds 1.15m contribution from discontinued operations) on turnover down at Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 35.5m). Mr Dobbie has specific responsibility for the division for the next 18 months. Europe, with the exception of the UK, where sales rose 18 per cent, and North America saw 'less than adequate' demand. Mr Hutchings said the group was pursuing 'niche areas where we have an edge'. Earnings per share were 3p (losses 0.5p).</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Dell warns of loss and revises lending DELL Computer's share price fell sharply yesterday when the US personal computer manufacturer warned of a second-quarter loss after writedowns and restructuring charges. Dell said the losses would be between Dollars 1.65 and Dollars 1.85 per share and pre-tax charges would amount to Dollars 75m to Dollars 85m for the quarter to August 1. The projected loss might place the company in default of the terms of its credit facilities, it said. It was working with its lenders to revise the terms. 'I am confident that we will be able to secure alternative financing or obtain a waiver,' said Mr Thomas Meredith, chief financial officer. A long-time favourite among Wall Street investors, Dell has become the fifth largest PC company in the world by pioneering direct marketing of PCs through mail and telephone sales. Its sales tripled to Dollars 2bn in the past two years. Yesterday, however, Dell's share price dropped to Dollars 13 7/8 , a 2 1/2  year low, before regaining some ground to trade at Dollars 16 1/4 at midday, down Dollars 3 from Tuesday's close and 67 per cent below its high of Dollars 49 7/8 in January. Dell expected to report second-quarter revenues of Dollars 710m to Dollars 730m, a 55-60 per cent advance on the corresponding period. Total revenues for fiscal 1993 would be about Dollars 3bn. 'Hypergrowth' was at the root of its problems, it said. Management controls had not kept pace with the rapid expansion of sales. According to analysts, it also faces 'credibility problems'. In May, Dell reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, which it blamed on delays and cancellation of notebook computer products. Analysts then expressed concern that Dell's problems appeared to go beyond notebook computers. Yesterday, their fears were confirmed. Dell said that in addition to costs associated with the delayed and cancelled notebook products, it would incur restructuring charges. It expected to resume earnings growth by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. 'While the loss is certainly disappointing, we are determined to take the steps necessary to strengthen Dell for the future,' said Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive.</p>

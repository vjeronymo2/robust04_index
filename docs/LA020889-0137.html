			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> 4 PALESTINIANS SLAIN; JEWISH SETTLER KILLED BY FIREBOMB  </P> <P> Four Palestinians were killed by army gunfire today and a Jewish settler was  burned to death when Palestinians hurled a firebomb at his car in the West  Bank. The death toll was the highest in one day for two months.  </P> <P> One of the Palestinians was killed when army guards fired tear gas, plastic  bullets and other ammunition to quell a riot in a military prison, army sources  said. Fourteen other prisoners were injured.  </P> <P> Two Palestinian teen-agers were reported shot to death today in the occupied  lands, and a Palestinian died of injuries suffered earlier in the uprising.  </P> <P> Military sources said an Israeli settler died after his car was set ablaze by  Palestinians near the settlement of Alfei Menashe. Troops rushed to the scene  of the attack, set up roadblocks and hunted for suspects.  </P> <P> Israeli government and military officials, meanwhile, rejected the conclusions  of a U.S. State Department report alleging substantial human rights violations  and said the report ignored the context of the uprising.  </P> <P> The U.S. report, released Tuesday, says methods used by the army to halt the  14-month revolt have resulted in "many avoidable deaths and injuries."  </P> <P> Jonathan Kuttab, co-founder of a human rights monitoring group, said he hopes  the U.S. government will reassess its $3-billion annual aid to Israel in light  of the findings.  </P> <P> Army sources said the unrest at the military prison in Megiddo, in northern  Israel, began outside when visiting relatives went on a rampage, raising  Palestinian flags and stoning soldiers' parked cars.  </P> <P> When guards suspended visiting hours, inmates began rioting, the sources said.  "As prisoners returned to cells, they stirred up others and a serious riot  started inside the cells," the sources said.  </P> <P> They said military guards fired tear gas and plastic bullets to try to end the  rioting. When that failed, the guards opened fire with conventional ammunition,  they said, resulting in the death and injuries.  </P></p>

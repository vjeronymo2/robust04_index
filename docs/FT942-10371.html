			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Commons backs Sunday betting on horse racing Sunday horse racing with betting on- and off-course was overwhelmingly approved by the Commons last night as the government backed down over plans to abolish market franchise rights. A MPs voted by a majority of 101 to allow Sunday betting as part of the government's de-regulation bill. It brings England and Wales into line with other horse racing nations such as Ireland, France and Italy, which already allow Sunday betting. Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, said: 'I cannot myself see that as a result of the changes proposed here, which I warmly support, the nation will suddenly be plunged into a hell-hole of gambling the like of which we have never seen before.' If the Lords back the change, the British Horse Racing Board will include in its fixture list a small number of Sundays in the next two years. The government was later forced to withdraw proposals to de-regulate the law under which local authorities holding market franchise rights can oppose the creation of rival markets - such as weekly open-air markets - nearby. Threatened with a backbench revolt, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry minister, said that the government would now 'discuss with all interested parties how best to remove the adverse effects of market franchise monopoly rights'. Sir Michael Neubert, Conservative MP for Romford, said the market franchise rights were 'an effective means of controlling markets, which has ensured that markets have prospered up and down the country'. Ministers plan to bring forward amendments 'on an agreed basis' when the de-regulation bill reaches the Lords. Labour voiced worries about the potential impact of the bill on health and safety standards. Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, called for this issue to be cut out of the legislation. He said he feared that ministers would phase out important safety regulations using the 'excessive powers' given to them under the bill to repeal measures without primary legislation. Mr Hamilton stressed the need to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on business.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Asia's sick man shows recovery potential - The recently downcast and still lethargic South Korean market WHILE RIVAL markets from Hong Kong to Singapore and from Tokyo to Taiwan have appreciated at double digit rates since the beginning of this year, Seoul has continued a slump which last year brought its biggest ever annual fall. Although Indonesia has run it close, it is the only market in the region to have declined since the beginning of 1991. At close of trading yesterday the South Korea composite index stood at 632.63, down 5.21 on the day and 9 per cent on the year. Since the beginning of 1990 it has fallen by almost 30 per cent. However, the sick man of Asia now seems to be over the worst. It briefly awoke from its lethargy on Tuesday, when the index jumped by 3.6 per cent; and yesterday, when turnover climbed from Won142.3bn to Won180bn, investors revelled in their ability to take a profit. 'The question investors are asking now is not 'should I sell?', but when should I start to buy?' says Ms Melissa Brown, director of research at Barclays De Zoete Wedd in Seoul. The protracted gloom has been due to a combination of fundamental and technical factors. Inflation, the resulting tightening of credit, and concern about the source of South Korea's growth have soured sentiment. While GNP continues to expand at one of the highest rates in the world, rising by 9 per cent last year, the pattern of growth has shifted dramatically since 1987 and 1988. Exports, the traditional engine of the economy, grew by a meagre 3 per cent in 1989 and 1990, while consumption and the service sector have taken up the slack. 'There is a feeling that the source of growth is still not very healthy,' says Mr Torquil McAlpine, chief representative of Schroder Securities in Seoul. 'Investment in manufacturing is still being crowded out.' Inflation, too, is rearing its head again. In the first quarter of this year consumer prices rose by 3.7 per cent, nearly half the government's target for the year. In an attempt to curb the spectre of double digit inflation, the government has tightened money. 'The credit crunch is beginning to bite,' says Mr Hank Morris, chief representative of Kleinwort Benson. He adds that South Korean companies are finding capital harder than ever to come by. The resulting liquidity constraint has created adverse technical factors. When the market rallies, investors, and particularly securities companies which are hardest strapped for funds, are tempted to sell. Consequently, upturns have tended to be short-lived. Trading, too, is subdued. Average daily turnover is in the region of Dollars 120m, about one quarter of the turnover in the salad days of 1989. Shafts of light, however, are now penetrating the gloom. Exports grew by an encouraging 10.2 per cent in the first quarter, year on year, a trend which is expected to be sustained by reviving economic growth in the US and much of Europe, and by post-Gulf war reconstruction. Oil prices, critical to South Korea's import-dependent energy sector, have also eased. The stabilisation fund, inspired by the government and set up by financial institutions last year to support the ailing bourse, still has estimated free funds of over Won300bn (Dollars 413m) to stimulate a rally. In addition, the prospect of direct foreign investment, to be allowed from next year, will create a boost even before the new capital arrives. That foreign interest exists is shown by the increased prices this year for South Korean Euromarket instruments. Korean convertible bonds and warrants enable investors to gain exposure to the underlying equity market before it is opened to foreigners. Their recent popularity indicates that foreign investors are already implementing their entry strategies. For these investors, the hope is that Seoul will take its time to convalesce. But with one of Asia's most dynamic economies moving back on course, they may find that the index does not wait for them on its way back up.</p>

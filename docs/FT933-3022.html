			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Big Bang ends in a whimper - Unctad challenges shock reforms in E Europe TRADE PROTECTION, weak commodity prices and high levels of indebtedness continue to dog the development efforts of many poor countries, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says in its annual report published today. In a controversial challenge to current economic orthodoxies ahead of the IMF/World Bank meeting later this month, Unctad calls for fiscal reflation combined with a one-off wealth tax to pull the industrialised nations - and the global economy - out of recession. It also questions the shock therapy prescription for developing and former communist countries. Growth in the developing world was a healthy 4.4 per cent last year and is expected to maintain that pace in 1993, the report says. However, the strong performance of east and south-east Asia is in sharp contrast to stagnation elsewhere, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The report also warns that recent economic expansion in Latin America has been fuelled by large-scale short-term capital inflows which may not be sustainable. Unctad, the main UN body for discussing north-south issues and a consistent critic of laissez-faire capitalism, says industrialised countries need a co-ordinated reflation to boost demand and cut unemployment. High budget deficits and government debt, which now constrain expansionary policies, should be reduced through privatisation and a levy on private financial assets. Recession in industrialised countries has nurtured protectionism at the same time as many developing countries have been liberalising trade regimes, the report says. It estimates that a fifth of developing country exports to the rich nations are covered by non-tariff barriers to trade, such as quotas, 'voluntary' export restraints and anti-dumping actions. For products excluding fuels the ratio rises to nearly a quarter and for textiles it reaches over 70 per cent. Over the past two years alone, developing countries have lost a sixth of their commodity export earnings due to falling commodity prices, it says continuing a decline that began in the 1980s. For Africa the earnings loss was nearly a quarter and for Latin America one-fifth. Unctad adds that although the international financial system is no longer in danger the debt crisis is not over. More than 60 countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are in arrears with their foreign creditors and the debt of some former socialist countries, notably Russia, poses new challenges. For developing countries Unctad urges bigger reductions in official bilateral debt, rescheduling of debt owed to multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, and more pressure on private creditors to agree debt reduction. It also calls for a comprehensive programme for Russia's Dollars 78bn (Pounds 50bn) foreign debt, over half of which is owed to governments. This might include extra aid or debt relief in return for a cut by Russia of its claims on other troubled debtors, including former Soviet republics. Looking at the factors which propel growth, Unctad argues that east and south-east Asian economies have built their success on trade, investment and strong government support to private business and exports. The success of gradual economic reform in China, which notched up growth of about 13 per cent last year, also casts doubt on the conventional wisdom concerning transformation of planned economies. China has introduced market-based reforms without formal privatisation of state-owned enterprises while a dual price system has until recently kept inflation under control and so avoided disruptive stabilisation programmes. By contrast, Unctad says, the formerly socialist countries of central and eastern Europe have tried 'big bang' reform through abrupt liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation. Since the beginning of the transition process output has declined on average by a third. Many of these countries now find themselves in 'a twilight zone where there is neither plan nor market', says the report arguing that government intervention is needed to give shape to the new market system and to cushion the transition. The Asian experience shows export success requires not only 'getting prices right' but also 'active government support and. . . well-targeted protection of domestic producers'. In sub-Saharan Africa, the report says a decade of structural adjustment programmes have failed to reverse economic decline. Per capita incomes are still falling and remain below 1970 levels. 'On current trends it would take 70 years to double them,' even in countries undertaking intensive adjustment measures.

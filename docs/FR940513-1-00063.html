Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1982, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) began working with the EPA regarding the establishment of Federal regulations under the Clean Air Act pertaining to air pollutants emitted from commercial marine vessels. The MARAD raised concerns regarding the potential disruption of interstate and foreign commerce and safety problems that may result from State regulation of marine vessel emissions. The MARAD believed that the most appropriate method to control these emissions without causing undue disruption of commerce or safety problems would be for the EPA to promulgate national standards regulating air pollutants from these sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, the U.S. Department of Transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that the National Academy of Sciences' National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research Council (NRC) evaluate the feasibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling emissions from marine tank vessel loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. At that time, many States were already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering vapor controls for barge and tankship loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tankship ballasting. The NRC Commission on Engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Technical Systems (CETS) then convened a Committee on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control and Recovery of Hydrocarbon Vapors from Ships and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barges. This committee operated under the guidance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marine Board of the NRC. The committee and the Marine Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisted of members of industry and academia and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives. The Coast Guard (U.S. Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation) and the EPA also worked with the committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the feasibility study. In 1987, the committee issued its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report ``Controlling Hydrocarbon Emissions From Tank Vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Loading'' (Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;I&hyph;4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Marine Board's report determined that controls were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technically feasible but that there was a need for the Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guard to promulgate safety requirements and a need for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to set uniform emissions standards to mitigate some of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety issues that could arise from varied State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The report recommended that the Coast Guard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``lead the development and implementation of a coordinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to ensure the safety and standardization of maritime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon vapor emissions controls.'' The Coast Guard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be responsible for the safety issues involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (standardized equipment, detonation arrestors, personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, etc.), and the EPA would be responsible for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions standards. One of the methods suggested to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve the coordination necessary to develop standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine tank vessel loading operations was an amendment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part of the Marine Board's task was to develop cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates. The Marine Board contracted United Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Design (UTD) to develop cost estimates for three different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model terminals and four model vessels. These model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals and costs served as the basis for the EPA costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;I&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the NRC recommendation, the Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guard's Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formed a Subcommittee on Vapor Control to develop standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for designing and operating vapor control systems. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CTAC subcommittee presented its final recommendations to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast Guard in February 1989. The Coast Guard standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe design, installation, and operation of marine vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery equipment were promulgated in June 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (55 FR 2596). The Coast Guard regulations are found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33 CFR part 154 and 46 CFR part 39.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

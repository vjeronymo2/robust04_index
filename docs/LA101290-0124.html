			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Governor. Whose ad? Republican Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> Republican Sen. Pete Wilson is airing a new 30-second television commercial  that attacks the taxing policies of Democrat Dianne Feinstein during her tenure  as mayor of San Francisco. The ad also promotes Wilson's record as mayor of San  Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall:  </P> <P> Ad: The commercial opens with side-by-side photos of Wilson and Feinstein,  noting the years they served as mayors of their cities: Wilson in San Diego  1971-82 and Feinstein in San Francisco 1978-88. Then portions of their tax  records appear beneath their respective photos: "Wilson cut property tax rates  25% and balanced 11 budgets." "Feinstein raised taxes 34%, but left a $172  million deficit."  </P> <P> Analysis: Data provided by the Wilson campaign says the city property tax rate  was $1.81 per $100 of assessed valuation in 1972, dropping to $1.36 per $100 by  1978 when Proposition 13 set all property taxes in California at the same rate,  effectively at $1 per $100 of assessed valuation. By the time Feinstein became  mayor, she had no control over property tax rates. In San Francisco, the annual  per capita tax burden grew from $429 to $576, a 34% rise, according to the  state controller's office. All of Wilson's and Feinstein's budgets technically  were balanced because cities, like the state, are prohibited by law from  running deficits. Feinstein's final budget projected a $16.2 million surplus,  but the incoming administration of Mayor Art Agnos claimed that in fact the  city faced a deficit of $172 million.  </P> <P> Ad: "San Diego's taxes were among the lowest in the state." "Under Feinstein,  taxes went up 50% faster than the state average."  </P> <P> Analysis: It can be argued that the ad attempts to mix apples and oranges. San  Francisco is the only geographic entity in California that is both a city and a  county so it serves many more functions than other cities. Also, San Diego's  population was growing much more rapidly than San Francisco's, so the relative  cost of San Francisco city services rose more quickly. San Diego adopted a  hotel room tax while Wilson was mayor. Feinstein opposed some tax increases  that were adopted.  </P> <P> Ad: The ad quotes the late Howard Jarvis, the author of Proposition 13 in 1978,  as saying, "We wouldn't have needed Proposition 13 if everyone had run their  cities like Pete Wilson." And a photo of Feinstein shows on the screen with the  comment from San Francisco Controller Sam Yockey that Feinstein "robbed the  bank and left us holding the bag."  </P> <P> Analysis: Both Wilson and Feinstein opposed Proposition 13, as did most public  officials. The major problem leading to the Proposition 13 tax revolt was not  tax rates, but the escalating property assessments that drove up tax bills.  Yockey became controller under Agnos, with whom Feinstein has quarreled  bitterly, and who supported Feinstein's opponent in the Democratic  gubernatorial primary.  </P></p>

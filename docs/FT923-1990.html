			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bonn fears collapse into vicious circle of recession - Pressure for interest rates cut may become irresistible ONE OF THE great ironies of the soaring strength of the Deutsche Mark on European currency markets is that it comes amid grim prospects for the German economy. Far from providing the motor for any European economic recovery, the soaring costs of German unification threaten to become the brake on hopes of revival in the rest of the European Community. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, warned in his budget speech a week ago that drastic action must be taken to prevent the economy getting locked into a vicious circle. He saw a failure of the east German economy to pick up from its dramatic slump, coinciding with a western economy held back from revival by the huge costs of state transfers to the east. It is those transfers, running at around DM150bn (Pounds 57bn) a year, which are weighing down on the capital markets, and persuading the Bundesbank to keep real interest rates high to hold back credit expansion and inflation. Yet the transfers, overwhelmingly for infrastructure spending, unemployment benefit and wage subsidies, are not yet having any appreciable effect on recovery in the east, where industrial investment is running at only 60 per cent of the western per capita level, suggesting that the east is if anything likely to fall further behind the west. The business magazine Wirtschaftswoche yesterday poured scorn on hopes of an economic turnround in the wake of the Bundesbank's marginal cut in interest rates last Monday. It cited figures of an accelerating decline in business confidence throughout the past year in western Germany, while in the east, the mood remained overwhelmingly negative. The gloom was reflected in the latest monthly report of the Bundesbank, published this week, which warned that the duration and size of western subsidies for the east would be far greater than first calculated. Fears over the cost of unification, and the growing unwillingness of western citizens to pay more (more than two thirds now say they are unwilling to freeze or cut their own incomes to help eastern recovery), have inspired Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' among the central government, opposition, local and state governments, employers and trade unions. While hopes for the pact are high, the starting points of the participants are far apart. Mr Kohl and the employers are clearly looking for severe wage restraint in both east and west, to encourage investment. The trade unions are adamant that no such restraint will be forthcoming without substantial increases in the contributions of industry and the better-paid to investment in the east. Mr Mollemann is looking for big reforms in labour practices to cut industrial costs. His proposals arouse fury from both the unions and the opposition Social Democrats. The prospects of a deal on the solidarity pact, supposed to be agreed by the end of the year, are therefore remote. Unemployment and hidden unemployment in the east are stoking racial unrest there, with no end to the rash of attacks on hostels occupied by foreign workers and asylum seekers. The domestic political pressures on the Bundesbank to relax its harsh interest rate policies may become irresistible by the end of the year, for fear of tipping the economy into full recession.</p>

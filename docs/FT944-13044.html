			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Political fighter feels the heat - Ryutaro Hashimoto Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the chain-smoking economic brain of the Japanese government, and potential future prime minister, played with fire this week but did not even burn his fingers. To the surprise of many, he got away with making a tactless remark about Japan's role in the second world war, despite arousing the criticism of China - to which Japan usually kowtows - and both Koreas. Two less senior cabinet ministers were sacked this year for making similar wartime gaffes. The survival of Mr Hashimoto, minister of international trade and industry and a leading member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's right wing, reflects Japan's commitment to finding a more distinct voice in Asia, and the outcome of a power struggle within the LDP. Mr Hashimoto's diplomatic misdeed was to say that it was a matter of 'delicate definition' whether Japan committed aggression against Asian nations. He could hardly have given a different reply to a mischievously posed opposition party question in a televised debate, supposed to be about tax reform. Yet the ensuing blast from Japan's neighbours and from senior members of the Social Democratic party, one of the three partners of the ruling coalition, made it look, for a moment, as if this martial arts expert was heading for a quick political death. That was until Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, gave his support to his right-wing colleague. It was a notable gesture, given Mr Murayama's profound pacifism and Asian sympathies and the fact that the leaders of the other two parties in the coalition - Mr Yohei Kono of the LDP and Mr Masayoshi Takemura of the New Harbinger Party - do not share Mr Hashimoto's ambivalent feelings about the war. They feel it was a war of aggression, for which clear apologies are in order. Yesterday, South Korea issued an even more notable statement, to the effect that it did not plan to make an issue out of Mr Hashimoto's gaffe, and China toned down its criticism. A relieved Mr Hashimoto duly expressed regret and sadness, and the affair seemed to have been brought to a close. There is a simple reason why such a storm blew itself out so quickly. China and South Korea realised it was against their interests to press Japan too hard on Mr Hashimoto and risk destabilising the sensitively balanced coalition. Mr Murayama knows that his cabinet cannot survive without Mr Hashimoto, the aggressive lead trade negotiator with the US and one of the few cabinet members with broad economic policy experience, as a former finance minister. The two earlier errant ministers were disposable, holding humble environment and justice portfolios. But Mr Hashimoto's survival also seems indicative of a growth in Japanese confidence about its relations with its Asian neighbours, such that it has been willing to allow the controversy to play itself out. Aspiring LDP leaders traditionally had to pay public respect to the families of the war dead: an influential, if declining, part of the electorate. The acceptability of, and need for, this reverance persisted in Japan due to the lack of the kind of universal remorse for the country's wartime past seen in Germany. Mr Hashimoto, chairman of the bereaved war families' association, a right-wing LDP group, clearly has his roots in such traditional sympathies. Much to Mr Murayama's discomfort, Mr Hashimoto still leads an annual visit by LDP politicians to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where the war dead are honoured. He stands for a minority that feels uncomfortable over the fulsome apologies for Japan's wartime record offered over the past year by two former prime ministers and by Mr Kono, the dove-ish LDP foreign minister, who happens to be Mr Hashimoto's bitter rival. Allowing Mr Hashimoto his frankness about the war is only the latest example of Japan exploring the limits of an independent policy in Asia. Japan has also been standing up to China - as was clear last week when Mr Hashimoto met his Taiwanese counterpart, in defiance of Chinese objections, in the first official ministerial meeting between Japan and Taiwan since Tokyo ceased diplomatic recognition of Taiwan 22 years ago. Mr Hashimoto is a member of a pro-Taiwan LDP group dedicated to retaining ties with Taiwan, a Japanese colony for 50 years until 1945. The influence of this group was also instrumental in the admission of senior Taiwanese to the recent Asian games in Hiroshima - a decision that caused another row between China and Japan. The other side of Japan's search for its own voice in Asia is its promotion of Asian interests. It is playing a growing part in the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, and has announced its support for Mr Kim Chul-su, the South Korean trade, industry and energy minister, in the race to head the new World Trade Organisation. Mr Hashimoto now looks set to play a greater role in such policies. The balance of power in the LDP moved in his favour last month, when Mr Hashimoto's political patron, Mr Noboru Takeshita, the disgraced former prime minister, rejoined the LDP's parliamentary group after a year in the shadows as an independent. But does Mr Hashimoto have what it takes to get all the way to the top? Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former LDP prime minister, believes the main qualification for leading a Japanese government is to have few enemies. Here, by all accounts, Mr Hashimoto's renowned arrogance may tell against him. Aides recall how he exploded with rage at the July Group of Seven summit of leading industrial states in Naples, when the foreign ministry failed to tell his ministry about a letter from US president Bill Clinton. On the other hand, Mr Hashimoto did take the trouble to give Mr Murayama, a novice at the G7 and a former political enemy, a private briefing on how to handle Mr Clinton. When Mr Murayama returned the compliment by supporting him this week, Mr Hashimoto must have rejoiced in the one important enemy he has managed to win over.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT: ASK THE TIMES;  </P> <P> VINYL WINDOWS TOPS IN SOUND CONTROL  </P> <P> Question: What do you think of vinyl windows, as opposed to wood and aluminum?  Please go over the pros and cons, especially in the areas of durability,  maintenance and cost. Are there grades of vinyl, or are they all the same? Do  all window dealers carry vinyl?  </P> <P> Answer: This is a big subject and there's only enough room here to touch on  some salient points., Allen L. Lowith (Lowith Metal Window Co., 10905 Peach  Grove Ave., North Hollywood 91601), said that vinyl-frame sound-control windows  are now available on the West Coast market, comparable in cost to quality  aluminum-frame windows.  </P> <P> Despite his company name, Lowith installs vinyl windows for customers who want  them. Because vinyl windows accept the thicker sound-control glass and because  vinyl is superior to aluminum in resistance to sound transmission, vinyl  windows are increasingly popular in retrofits in noisy areas. Lowith said that  aluminum windows are still the most durable.  </P> <P> Wood windows are available from manufacturers such as Pozzi, Marvin, Andersen  and Pella in finished wood, primed wood, bare wood and vinyl clad. We're  talking serious money for wood windows, but the look is distinctive and should  be considered for certain architectural styles. Mill-finish aluminum windows  are not recommended in a room addition of a house that has double-hung wood  windows. However, you should consider vinyl windows -- either hollow-core or  solid -- that match the existing wood windows.  </P> <P> If you want to know more about the advantages and disadvantages of various  window materials, read Chapter 5 of "The Low-Maintenance House" by Gene Logsdon  (Rodale Press Books, Emmaus, Pa. 18049). Logsdon describes the various  materials, their heat-loss indexes and the aesthetics of various materials.  This is a highly readable book, by the way.  </P> <P> The Times will answer remodeling questions of general interest on this page.

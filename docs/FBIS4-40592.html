			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Yuriy Kozlov]    [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russia has expanded its  formula of the international conference on security and  non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. Moscow thinks that  the forum can be attended by other interested states, including  France, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told State Duma  deputies here today.    "We have suggested the international conference in order to  discuss the nuclear problem and security on the Korean  peninsula, do away with any concerns of the DPRK as regards its  security," said the minister.    "We have suggested a conference with a clear number of  participants. These are, first of all, Russia. It is also the  United States which concern most of the claims of the DPRK.  These are China and the neighbouring states of Japan and the  Republic of Korea. Other states, including France, have shown  their interest in the conference."    In the opinion of Andrey Kozyrev, France can participate in  the forum "the more so it is a nuclear power and a permanent  member of the Security Council."</p>

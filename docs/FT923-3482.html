			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific inclusion helps lift Citic 950% CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment company, has announced a 950 per cent leap in earnings for the six months to June to HKDollars 439.5m (USDollars 56.9m), compared with HKDollars 41.8m a year earlier. The main impetus was the first-time inclusion of profits from its 12.5 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific and Citic's wholly-owned motor trading group Dah Chong Hong. Profits growth was achieved through substantial purchases funded by new shares, but even on a per-share basis, Citic achieved 114 per cent growth to 39.2 cents, from 18.3 cents. Cathay Pacific achieved a 13 per cent increase in earnings at the interim stage. Citic's other airline business, 46 per cent owned Dragonair, saw strong growth as a result of the booming business environment in China, where it has the majority of its routes. Dah Chong Hong's car sales in Hong Kong showed limited improvement in a competitive environment, but Citic's China connections enabled it to expand in the mainland. Telecommunications traffic between Macao and China increased by 32 per cent, helping to engineer 'remarkable growth' for Citic's 20 per cent owned Macao Telecom. The results should improve in the second half of the year as they will include a full contribution from 100 per cent of Dah Chong Hong. Citic owned only 35 per cent of the company in the first three months of 1992. The company recommended an interim dividend of 8.2 cents, up from 6.8 cents in 1991.</p>

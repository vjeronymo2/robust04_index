			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / People: O'Reilly Jnr picks mining Tony O'Reilly Jnr is following his elder brother Cameron into his father's far-flung business empire. But unlike Cameron, who is keeping an eye on the O'Reilly family's growing newspaper interests, Tony, 25, is going into the mining business. He has been been appointed executive director, planning and corporate development, at Arcon International Resources which was the scene of a battle for control recently after the company had acquired Atlantic Resources, an Irish oil exploration company, headed by Tony O'Reilly Snr. Professor Conroy, Arcon's founder and chairman, was temporarily ousted from the board in February by a group of shareholders who thought his company had paid too much for Atlantic. In the event Tony O'Reilly Snr came to the rescue by increasing his stake in Arcon to 20.5 per cent and the professor was reinstated. His son, who has worked for Dillon Read and the corporate finance team of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in New York, plays down the family connection. He says the decision to get involved with Arcon was his idea, not his father's. He had specialised in natural resources at Coopers and had got to know Bill Mulligan, an Arcon director. While Arcon is one of the smallest and least successful of his father's investments, O'Reilly Jnr hopes to turn it into one of the empire's top performers. Arcon has explored only 3 per cent of its 90 square miles and has already discovered a 6m tonne lead/zinc mine at Galmoy. 'We are in a pre-development stage with a world class asset,' says O'Reilly Jnr.</p>

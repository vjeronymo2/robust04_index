Correspondent M. Sarbaa reports:    Military pensioners in Estonia are a stumbling block at the  Russian-Estonian talks it was stated today at a news conference  held at the Estonian Republic Embassy in Moscow on the outcome  of the 16th round of Russian-Estonian talks which ended  yesterday. Estonian Ambassador Juriy Kahn said that the Russian  side had promised to provide a schedule of its troop withdrawal  from Estonian by this round. The problem of military pensioners  could delay the final withdrawal of troops set for 31 August of  this year.    In point of fact, Estonia is demanding the deportation from  the country of approximately 35,000 people, including family  members of pensioners, to which, of course, Russia will never  agree. Because of this, the issues of border demarcation,  Estonia's debt and economic and trade cooperation remain  unresolved.    Work at the talks was carried out by six groups which  discussed a wide range of problems between Estonia and Russia.</p>

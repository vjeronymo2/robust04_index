			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOYOTA-GM PLANT WILL MAKE TRUCKS  </P> <P> New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the joint venture between Toyota and  General Motors, said Tuesday that it will expand operations by producing Toyota  pickup trucks. The joint venture, which dates to 1983, has limited its  production to cars, but the operation has been losing money. Plans call for  producing 100,000 Toyota trucks a year at the Fremont plant starting in the  spring of 1991.  </P> <P> The decision had been long anticipated by industry observers, who expected  Toyota to find a U.S. manufacturing site for trucks soon, partially to avoid a  25% tariff on imported trucks.  </P> <P> The project, which is subject to governmental approval, will add about 700 new  jobs at NUMMI and calls for an investment of more than $200 million to the  Fremont plant, the company said.  </P></p>

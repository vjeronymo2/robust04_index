			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Port-au-Prince Television Nationale  d'Haiti in French at 1635 GMT on 12 June carries a 20-minute  recorded address to the nation by provisional President Emile  Jonassaint. Jonassaint speaks in both French and Creole during  the address.    Jonassaint begins, in French: "Men and women of my country:  I have decided to address the nation tonight. It is a serious  moment. Haiti, our country, is in great danger. Reviled,  ridiculed, humiliated, and strangled, Haiti risks invasion and  occupation."    Jonassaint says that history, the Constitution, and deep  Haitian values prevent him from giving in to threats and that he  is pushed to defend the imperiled fatherland and that it will be  defended.    He calls on the people to mobilize to defend the country: "I  solemnly declare that Haiti will not give in. Haiti will not  submit to orders from foreigners. Haiti will face them. I have  demanded and have obtained the provisional government's word  that it will take all measures to ensure our survival as an  independent and fully sovereign nation. Thus, a state of  emergency [etat d'urgence] is declared. A series of government  measures will go into effect immediately. I order the Haitian  Armed Forces commander in chief to guard against all  possibilities."    Jonassaint then deplores the fact that some Haitians have  demanded that foreigners invade Haiti and calls on the people to  remain calm and attend to their daily affairs. He urges the  people to remain mobilized and alert so that they are united and  determined, "like the ancestors," to struggle to the death in  ensuring the country's defense before the enemies.    He says: "On behalf of the Haitian nation, I thank all those  nations that have refused to give in to the immorality, the  arrogance, and the perfidy of a certain international community,  to those that have relieved us of our misfortunes."    Jonassaint then switches to Creole to deliver the rest of  his  address, saying: "Haitian men and women, I am obliged to appear  before you today to say a few words as the country is in danger."    Jonassaint warns that a giant that can destroy Haiti in five  minutes has declared war on Haiti, while Haiti has done nothing  to provoke it. He suggests this is in response to democracy  coming to Haiti, noting that there has never been democracy in  Haiti.    Referring to President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide --  without actually mentioning Aristide by name -- Jonassaint  explains he was a State Council member during the 1990 election,  that he voted for the candidate whom everybody was voting for,  and that he is now ashamed of having voted for that candidate  because that candidate is now asking those he was always  criticizing to invade Haiti to reduce the country to slavery.  Jonassaint then makes some historical references and criticizes  Aristide -- again, without mentioning Aristide by name -- for  wasting Haiti's money and allowing the United States to use  Haiti while Haitians starve to death.    Jonassaint says that all those who harmed Haiti have  succumbed and speaks of a president who has asked that Haiti be  destroyed. He says that president is now in jail for theft,  adding that others have fallen and that others will fall, that  they have their own problems in their countries, and that they  are no more serious than the Haitians.    Jonassaint concludes by calling on the people to unite and  to  remain mobilized for the defense of the country: "If they  destroy us, we will all die together. Haitians never fear  death. I (?remember) when I went to take the oath at  parliament. I saw the Independence Act. It began: Freedom or  death. Haitians can no longer live in slavery. Either we die,  or we remain free."    At 1655 GMT, Jonassaint ends his address.</p>

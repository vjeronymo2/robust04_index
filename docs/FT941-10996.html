			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Property: In search of the ultimate des-res - A look at the revival of interest and sales in the top tier of the UK property market A 15th-century castle, set among the wooded countryside north of Hereford, near the Welsh border, is proving a bellwether of sentiment among Britain's wealthiest property buyers. Built in 1427 by Sir Rowland Lenthall, who was knighted for gallantry at the battle of Agincourt, the Hampton Court estate boasts 1,000 acres of land, including a Grade I listed castle - with 30 bedrooms, a ballroom, private chapel and banqueting hall - plus a pheasant shoot, deer stalking, trout fishing, a farm house and seven workers' cottages. Even allowing for the hyperbole of the property world, the estate inspires superlatives. It is 'the pinnacle of the property ladder, the epitome of the country house', according to its agent, Mr Tony Morris-Eyton, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. For the past three years, the house has been a poignant reminder of the collapse in demand for grand country mansions. In 1987, James Folkes, director of a Birmingham engineering company, and his wife Xenia bought it for Pounds 1.65m. Three years later, having decided, according to their agent, to move closer to his business, they put it on the market for Pounds 5m. There was no buyer. But when they put it back on the market just before Christmas, with the price slashed to Pounds 2m, the response was overwhelming: more than 60 potential purchasers have arranged to view the property in the past six weeks. The flurry of interest has yet to be translated into a sale. But it adds to a widespread impression that the revival of the British economy, the buoyancy of the UK stock market and lower interest rates are restoring confidence in the top tier of the property market. Agents report a marked upturn in demand for expensive properties - although usually with the caveat that they have to be the ultimate des-res, unspoilt and free of noise pollution. 'Since Christmas, we have had a huge surge in the number of potential buyers,' says Mr Alexander Hunt from the London office of estate agents Strutt &amp; Parker. The first signs of revival were evident in 1993, when at least 10 estates worth more than Pounds 1.75m each were sold, more than double the number sold in 1992. Deals included the purchase for Pounds 12m of the 20,000-acre Tulchan estate in Morayshire, Scotland, by Mr Leon Litchfield, owner of a Midlands-based plastics business; the sale of the Pounds 11m Druids Lodge estate in Wiltshire, and the Pounds 4.25m Fosbury Manor estate, also in Wiltshire, to members of the Guinness family; and the purchase of the Pickenham Hall estate in Norfolk, which includes most of the village of South Pickenham, for Pounds 8m by a German businessman. The pace now appears to be quickening. Already this year the Corby Castle estate in Cumbria, which had been in the Howard family for nearly 400 years, has been sold for Pounds 2m to an Irish-based businessman. A sale has also been agreed on the 1,000-acre Braishfield Manor estate in Hampshire, for which the owners were asking between Pounds 3.25m and Pounds 4.25m. Although reliable figures are not available, demand for such properties still seems a long way short of the heady levels of the late 1980s. Then, sales were fuelled by rising incomes, easy access to loan finance and the new-found wealth of a number of businessmen whose companies had been floated on the stock market. Estate agents report a change in buyers' priorities since then. More consideration is being given to the practicalities - and expense - of running a large country estate. Properties in better condition or with relatively low maintenance and staffing costs are more likely to be sold. 'A lot of people bought very big, unmanageable houses for the status at the end of the 1980s. Now there is a bit of resistance to very big houses that are expensive to maintain,' says Mr John Husband of Humberts estate agents. Underpinning the current activity at the highest reaches of the property market, however, is a continuing supply of wealthy people still attracted by the prestige and sporting pleasures associated with owning a country estate. A further attraction is the tax advantages of investing in farmland. Capital gains from the sale of a business can be rolled over into buying an estate or farm. Since 1992, investment in land farmed by the owner for at least two years can be passed on free of inheritance tax. For overseas buyers, particularly from continental Europe, advantageous exchange rates and the UK's perceived economic and political stability are additional incentives. Indeed, the main problem for this end of the property market appears to be less a lack of buyers than a lack of sellers. The steep fall in property values has largely confined the ranks of would-be sellers to those forced to sell because of debt, death or divorce. Most estate agents estimate that, on average, prices of country estates have fallen about 40 per cent in the early 1990s. Death is becoming a less frequent cause of property sales, as a result of the change in inheritance tax rules in 1992. Financial difficulties, in contrast, have become an increasingly common reason for sales. Losses incurred by some Lloyd's Names, individuals whose assets support the insurance market, have, together with crippling estate repair bills and declining farm incomes, influenced the top end of the market. But the effect of setbacks at Lloyd's may be exaggerated. 'As a firm we have been staggered by how few Lloyd's losses have been converted into (house) sales,' says Mr Hunt of Strutt &amp; Parker. Compared with other residential properties, the market for country estates is more prone to sharp fluctuations. And there has been a number of high-profile property victims. In 1992, for instance, Brympton d'Evercy, a Tudor mansion in Somerset, was sold for just Pounds 850,000; and Pitchford Hall, an Elizabethan house near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, went for Pounds 1m. These low prices underlined the pressures on Britain's landowning families. The indications are, however, that if the recovery in the top end of the housing market is sustained, a number of prestige properties would come on to the market and go some way towards meeting demand. The Historic Houses Association, an association of country house owners, says that many families, who have held estates for centuries, are battling to keep possession of their properties. 'A great many people have made all the sacrifices they can,' says Mr Terence Empson, HHA director-general. The association fears that the new buyers will displace what the late Lord Ridley, the former environment secretary, described as the anciens pauvres and fail to maintain the properties as family homes. 'It never was the case that the nouveaux riches were rushing to buy properties as family homes,' says Mr Empson. In the past, many an entrepreneur has bought an estate with the intention of, for instance, turning the house into a hotel and the grounds into a golf course - as did Asil Nadir, the disgraced businessman, with Burley House, a Palladian mansion in Leicestershire, bought for Pounds 7m in 1990. But some such schemes were abandoned when recession began to take hold, and houses and grounds have been neglected. Of the 460 family seats sold over the past 20 years, at least 105 have already been resold, and further broken up in the process, according to the association. Nevertheless, the recent improvement in demand for estates suggests that individuals are returning to the market in significant numbers. It may be years before the values of large country houses return to the heights of the late 1980s, but it seems that the life of a pheasant-shooting country squire is beginning to attract the property buyer once again.</p>

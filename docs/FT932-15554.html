A premium of 0.2 per cent is to be added to the credit rates when fixing at bid. Interest rates may not be fixed for longer than 120 days. SDR-based rates of interest are the same for all currencies but must be used only for the OECD-defined poor countries. For the period from Jan 15 through July 14, the SDR-based rate will be 7.55 per cent. It replaces the previous rate of 8.10 per cent. The SDR-based rate will again be subject to change on July 15.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

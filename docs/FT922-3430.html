			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Guerrilla chief held in Peru MR Victor Polay Campos, leader of Peru's second-largest guerrilla group, has been captured in a Lima suburb. His arrest is a much-needed boost for the anti-terrorist police and a relief for the government, which this week introduced a night-time traffic curfew in the capital following stepped-up terrorist activity. Mr Polay is head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), a pro-Cuban group which has operated in Peru since the mid-1980s. It has periodically vied with the hard-line Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) for domination of areas of Peru's coca-rich northern jungle. The group was particularly active in Lima during the Gulf war, attacking US-affiliated installations and businesses. Mr Polay was first captured in 1989 but escaped in July 1990.</p>

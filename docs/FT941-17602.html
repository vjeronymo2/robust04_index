			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / This is a prediction-free column: Dominic Lawson does not trust soothsayers. The fun is not knowing what is going to happen The saint who intermediates between myself and the editor of the Weekend FT has sent me a letter. It says that this New Year's Day issue shall be a 'special issue' which 'will lay emphasis on the year ahead, using the loose theme of Boom and Bust. Plenty of top spin and forward bounce.' I think this means that I am being asked to forecast - something along the lines of Old Lawson's Almanack. Can't do it, old chap. Sorry about that but I have extreme difficulty in anticipating what my own mood will be in 15 minutes' time. I couldn't even begin to guess the fortunes of the stock market. My only advice is to remember what the pundits told you would happen to your investments exactly a year ago and then decide whether you want to read more of the same. The forecasters I trust are those whose advice is so generalised as to be almost meaningless. I can see that these writers are troubled souls, painfully aware of their inability to see the future and, being also conscientious, unwilling to pretend that they have a clear glimpse of events beyond the ends of their noses. Such a man is Jonathan Cainer, dubbed - faint praise - 'Britain's most authoritative astrologer' by his employer, the Daily Mail. Jonathan's 1994 forecast for us Sagittarians is a masterful example of his evasive art: 'It may be less easy to maintain a sunny disposition when you find yourself tackling inner doubts that emerge in 1994 as a result of your ruler's continued presence in your 12th Solar house. You may soon begin to question some very fundamental issues and find that this steers you into deep, dark, uncharted waters. Easy answers are not likely to be forthcoming and are not to be trusted . . .' You see? It is impossible to find fault with such vacuity. Jonathan annoys me only when he presumes to deal in facts. How dare he say, as he did earlier this week, that 'your home may not be sumptuous'? Jonathan, sumptuous is exactly what it is. My interior designer would hang you from our highest chandelier if he read your remark about our soft furnishings. These year-end and year-beginning forecasts are based on the idea that the achievement of the earth in making yet another circumnavigation of the sun presages some marked change in our lives. It's not true, of course, although some people attempt to enforce such a change by the adoption of new year resolutions. Soon afterwards they benefit from the fact that it is not an offence to break a contract with oneself. The tedious truth is that, when we have reached a certain age, nothing changes very much in our lives. Our flaws and strengths are all too well defined. Worse, our ability to be happy is a constant, almost entirely unaltered by external circumstances, in which category I include income and career. A miserable old sod is always a miserable old sod. It is only among the very young that one finds a character capable of change and, therefore, progress. I have observed this only by becoming a father, a year and a week ago. For my daughter, a year is a lifetime and every day is a new world, to which her reactions are predictable only in their unpredictability. Some would have it that her character and future are already set in stone. Intuitively, I know that this is not so. This summer, she is due to have a brother or a sister, and I shall spend the next six months futilely forecasting which her sibling shall be, being unwilling to spoil the fun by finding out. That would defeat the point of being in the future. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

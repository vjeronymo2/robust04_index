			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Interest rate cuts fail to boost US property LOWER interest rates provided 'little impetus' for residential and commercial property in July, despite sparking another round of mortgage refinancing, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. In its latest 'Beige Book' assessment of regional trends, the Fed said economic activity had been uneven in recent weeks. Retail sales and manufacturing production had grown weakly in most districts but there was no evidence for the robust recovery predicted by the Bush administration earlier this year. Testifying before the Senate banking committee in Washington yesterday, Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, again criticised the Fed for failing to provide a big enough stimulus to revive the economy. He said he was not satisfied with the growth of M2, a broad measure of money, which has fallen below the bottom of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, Mr Brady applied oblique pressure for further interest rate cuts by expressing support for congressional demands that the Fed be made more accountable to the executive and legislative branches of government. In yesterday's testimony Mr Brady stressed the importance of having an independent central bank, but he indicated that the right of regional Fed presidents to vote on monetary policy decisions might need to be reviewed. The Beige Book survey, which covered the six weeks to July 28, said consumer and business loan demand had strengthened in a few regions but remained generally weak. Lower interest rates had had little impact on either residential or commercial real estate markets, which remained sluggish.</p>

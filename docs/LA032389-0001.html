			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> ?QUE PASA?;  </P> <P> PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P>  When Warner Bros. made only lukewarm efforts to promote Edward James Olmos for  an Oscar nomination, the actor and his friends took matters into their own  hands. They felt Olmos should be a nominee at the March 29 ceremonies for his  portrayal of East Los Angeles math teacher Jaime Escalante in "Stand and  Deliver."  </P> <P> They mounted their own Oscar campaign in the Hollywood trade press. It paid off  as Olmos won a best actor nomination for what Times film critic Sheila Benson  called "his beautifully shaded and unsparing portrait" of Escalante.  </P> <P> While Olmos has his eye on an Oscar, the awards just keep coming for Jaime  Escalante. The California Bicentennial Commission saluted the advanced calculus  teacher by delivering six bronze plaques commemorating the 200th anniversary of  the drafting of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to predominantly Latino  Garfield High.  </P> <P> "Arriba el mariachi," Linda Ronstadt said when "Canciones de Mi Padre," her  Spanish-language "personal project," won a Grammy award in the Mexican-American  category. Carlos Santana took the Rock Instrumental Performance award for  orchestra, group or soloist for his "Blues for Salvador," and Roberto Carlos  won the Latin Pop award for his album, "Roberto Carlos." Ruben Blades y Son del  Solar captured the award in the Tropical Latin category for "Antecedente."  </P> <P> KMEX-TV, Channel 34, has begun airing Spanish-language "movie specials" with  English subtitles for the first time. The films broadcast were "La Historia  Oficial," a painfully personal portrait from Argentina's "Dirty War," and  "Volver a Empezar," the story of a Spanish professor who returns home after 40  years in this country. Both won Academy Awards for best foreign film. EDWARD J.  BOYER  </P></p>

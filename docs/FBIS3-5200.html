After concluding his three-day official visit  to New Zealand, Cetin arrived in Australia on Wednesday.    Speaking to the press on the situation in the Balkans, Cetin  said that any decision which was not based on political will and  power will not be effective. He said that NATO and the U.N.  Security Council should clearly give an ultimatum that further  aggressions will not be tolerated. "The Bosnian tragedy showed  that unless there is a power behind your decisions, no one will  listen to you," he said. "Now, a new world disorder prevails in  our region, instead of a new world order." Cetin stressed that  Europe had failed to maintain peace in the Balkans. "The  agreement reached between the Croats and Bosnians is an  indication which gives us hope," he said. "A solution seems to  be very near if the world applies pressure."    Cetin and his Australian counterpart Gareth Evans held  official talks afterward. An extradition agreement was signed  at the end of the talks. Cetin was received by Australian  governor Bill Hayden and Prime Minister Paul Keating. Evans  hosted a dinner for Cetin in the evening. Cetin was welcomed  with a ceremony befitting heads of states, in Australia.  [passage omitted]</p>

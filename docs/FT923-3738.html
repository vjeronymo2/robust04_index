			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Housing association scheme in Wales Work has started on phase two of an initiative by Gwalia Housing Society which will eventually create 800 replacement homes in a Swansea community. The Pounds 7.7m project is being designed and built by the South Wales region of WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION. When the company finishes its work early in 1994, 185 brick-clad homes will have been created on the estate in Blaenymaes to take the place of concrete post-war housing. All of the properties on the estate were previously owned by the City of Swansea Council. But the Government's squeeze on council spending meant Swansea could not invest the money needed to improve its housing stock. The Council's solution was to demolish the houses and lease the land to Gwalia for development. In its capacity as a housing association, Gwalia obtained grant support from Tai Cymru to carry out the major improvements which are now under way. Wimpey is to carry out the work under a design and build contract. The resulting scheme provides a mix of low-cost housing ranging from one-bedroomed studio apartments to four-bedroomed semi-detached homes.</p>

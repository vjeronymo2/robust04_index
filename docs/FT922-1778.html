			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: WPP's accounts qualified by auditors WPP GROUP, Mr Martin Sorrell's marketing services company, has had its accounts qualified by Arthur Andersen, its auditors, because it is in the middle of a Pounds 500m refinancing. The accounts have been prepared on a 'going concern' basis. The auditor says that this may cease to be appropriate if WPP cannot arrange adequate financing. The group agreed one refinancing in April 1991, but was now close to breaching banking covenants. Bankers say that WPP will 'hit a brick wall' in July if it cannot raise new cash. WPP's accounts show net debt at the financial year end of Pounds 334m but its average debt during the year was Pounds 472m. The group's borrowings peak during the summer months before the autumn marketing campaigns get going. There is a small loan note due for repayment shortly, and WPP has a big interest payment to meet in July. Also the group has to pay up to Pounds 16.5m in cash in 1992 to cover earn-outs on earlier acquisitions. WPP's 28 banks have a deadline of June 30 to agree refinancing proposals, which must also be approved by shareholders. The proposals involve a Pounds 150m issue of new preference shares, convertible directly into ordinary shares, which the banks would subscribe for at 60p a share. The shares closed yesterday at 48p, down 1p. The issue would give the banks more than 50 per cent of the equity, unless shareholders subscribed for the shares through a clawback deal. The proceeds would be used to repay bank borrowings. The banks would also put up Pounds 80m of new cash and extend the term of a Pounds 180m revolving credit from 1993 to 1997. The refinancing plan also involves converting existing preference shares into ordinary shares. Some holders of the preference shares, which were issued when WPP took over the Ogilvy Group in 1989, have appeared reluctant to accept the terms, believing they do not give adequate compensation. WPP's advisers have been making presentations to preference holders, saying that they would be worse off under any circumstances other than the proposal. One banker said: 'There are negative shareholders funds and Pounds 500m of debt. Who do they think is running the company?' The advisers also say that preference shareholders will do better than similarly placed investors in other recent refinancing packages. The preference shares would be converted into ordinary shares at four times the original conversion rate, giving each preference share 0.588 of an ordinary share. The preference shares closed at 36p, up 1p, yesterday implying a price for the ordinary of 61.2p. Preference shareholders at present account for 22.9 per cent of the equity, on the basis of the existing conversion terms, and allowing for shares to be issued through earn-outs at an assumed 60p share price. This would rise to 26.1 per cent if all the proposals went through, and no shareholders took up the clawback offer. WPP's advisers are warning preference holders that under any other solution their shares would probably be worthless. The accounts show that the group's maximum liability to earn-outs is Pounds 70.2m over the next five years. Of this Pounds 31.3m is payable in shares, the rest in cash. At yesterday's closing share price WPP's market value is Pounds 26.2m. Thus, at that price, satisfying the part of the earn-out liability due in shares would involve more than doubling the existing ordinary share capital. The effect of the earn-outs is demonstrated in the accounts which show two employees, Mr Edward Calesa and Mr Thomas Ferguson, each holding stakes of more than 3 per cent. The accounts also reveal that Mr Sorrell's emoluments rose by Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 508,000 after he waived Pounds 145,000 (Pounds 93,000) of his entitlement. He received no pension contributions.

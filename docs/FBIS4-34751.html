			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Today's GRANMA newspaper  confirmed Cuba will not authorize anyone's departure from the  country who forcefully enters an embassy in this capital.    In an editorial on the recent occupations of the Belgian and  German embassies and the Chilean consulate, the official  newspaper of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba stressed the  only solution for the embassy occupiers, who number slightly  more than 100 and want to travel to the United States, "is to  unconditionally withdraw the same way they entered."    The newspaper explains that the Cuban Government has  guaranteed the German and Belgian Governments that the people  involved in the incidents, except those charged with common  crimes, will be granted immunity and returned to their homes.    Recalling the various methods used by different U.S.  Administrations to encourage desertions and proclaim "with noisy  and loud publicity" the need to exterminate the "bad example"  Cuba has set on the continent, the newspaper states there has  been a recent intensification in the encouragement of illegal  escapes and forceful embassy occupations.    To foster these irresponsible actions, GRANMA adds, there  has  been a systematic denial of visas to individuals seeking  immigration. Immigration agreements have been violated, and  although legal obstacles are increasing, the coasts remain open  for well publicized welcomes to individuals who survive the  odyssey. Many people in Miami have made a profitable business  out of trafficking humans, the newspaper states.    If the purpose of this were truly humanitarian, the  editorial  states, it would suffice to grant visas to whomever has  requested one, to ban illegal entries to U.S. territory, and to  offer residency facilities. The newspaper states, however, that  it is "a matter of a promised land that is not granted unless a  person risks his life."    This is the case of the people who are occupying the three  missions, the newspaper says, explaining that among the guests  at the Belgian Embassy are 25 children, among them the youngest  "political refugee" on earth because he is only a few months old.    Also in the group are 25 individuals prosecuted for common  crimes, 34 who have been issued repeated warnings for markedly  antisocial behavior, and 46 have returned to their homes.    The newspaper describes as "much more serious" the fact that  the alleged refugees, who have occupied the Belgian ambassador's  residence, have used it to establish an alleged organization,  distribute propaganda, and put up posters.    The newspaper adds: "We must remember embassies cannot be  used as centers of political activities against their host  countries because to do so would violate the functions for which  they are accredited."    GRANMA states the Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted  responsibly by instructing its ambassador to inform his guests  of the illegality of their action.    We are respectful of every individuals' right to live  wherever he chooses, but we cannot allow ourselves to be taken  in by allowing embassies to classify simple immigrants under  nonexistent categories for personal, familiar, or economic  reasons or simply to seek an adventure, the newspaper stated,  adding "this just goes too far."    It would be easy to clear the way for those who decide to  occupy embassies, adds the newspaper, which then asks the  question, "Who would be harmed by that? Who would be at the  mercy of any intruder seeking the immunity of an embassy's  territory for the purpose of migrating?"    GRANMA also asks what the position of the governments of  these countries would be if the Haitians, who are now being  repatriated en masse, chose instead to break into their  embassies or if the Mexican wetbacks chose to jump the fences of  European or Latin American embassies in Mexico City instead of  risking their lives on the border?    Cuba, the newspaper maintains, is responsible for protecting  the embassies and is duty bound to safeguard the immunity and  inviolateness of their territories and will honor this  commitment to the letter.    The best guarantee for those who represent their countries  in  Cuba, the editorial states, is that the experience of three  decades of resisting blackmail, a blockade, and direct and  indirect aggressions has taught us we cannot yield 1 inch. A  principle surrendered is a principle lost, the newspaper states.    The newspaper asks other questions, including: What do they  expect? The beginning of a new style of obtaining documents in  Cuba to enter a country, different from existing methods in  other capitals? Is it an effort to artificially create a  political situation for purposes suspiciously similar to those  with which the United States has been unsuccessful? Was it an  effort to taint the atmosphere surrounding our country during  the recently concluded Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena  de Indias?    After stressing Cuba will not tolerate pressures regardless  of from where they may come, GRANMA confirmed the Cuban Foreign  Ministry is totally willing to cooperate with accredited  diplomatic missions to sensibly resolve their problem and even  to prevent future difficulties.</p>

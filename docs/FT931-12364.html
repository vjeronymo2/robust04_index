			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: War won in the east Sir, Michael Prowse cannot be serious in his column, 'The greatest years may lie ahead' (January 25), when he compares the US today with Britain in 1815 and then states that the US has '. . .just won a lengthy and debilitating war against communism'. Surely, it was the peoples of eastern Europe who recently overthrew their former overlords (although what they are now making of their 'peace' is of course a separate issue). Since the end of the cold war era, American spending on overthrowing communism has been minimal compared with the sums directed at the third world. Michael Prowse did not mention these burdens, principally carried by the financial sector of the US economy, which have been the main cause of what little debilitation the American economy has actually suffered in the last decade. John Hinze, Molkauerstrasse 8, 0-7124 Holzhausen, Germany</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Market bully or go-ahead enterprise?: Anti-trust charges against Microsoft FOR ALMOST three years, Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company and the dominant supplier of programs for use on personal computers, has been the subject of a 'non public' anti-trust investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission. The investigation has been far from secret, however, with several Microsoft competitors eagerly assisting the FTC, and unnamed agency 'sources' providing regular updates to the computer trade press. As an extraordinarily successful company and an aggressive competitor, Microsoft has more than its share of detractors in the software industry. They allege that Microsoft has used nefarious tactics deliberately to constrain competition and achieve its market leadership. Novell, one of Microsoft's strongest competitors and the leading supplier of personal computer networking software, has spearheaded the attack, hiring Washington lobbyists to raise political support for anti-trust action against Microsoft. 'Ray Noorda, Novell chairman and chief executive, is totally committed to the case as a matter of principle,' says Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of The FTC versus Microsoft: the Inside Story, which is to be published soon. On Monday, she says, 'a team of Novell attorneys gave presentations to the commissioners, hoping that they would restrict Microsoft's practices.' In particular, Novell alleges that Microsoft's system of 'per processor' licences for MS-DOS and Windows, its widely used PC programs, has a serious anti-competitive effect on the software market. Microsoft offers discounts to PC manufacturers that agree to pay a royalty fee for the right to install MS-DOS and Windows on all the computers they sell. Novell claims that this in effect excludes competitors such as itself. Others in the industry charge that Microsoft uses its near monopoly in the operating system software market to gain unfair advantage over competitors in the market for PC applications programs. Microsoft says it is legally constrained from commenting directly on the FTC's deliberations, but has denied wrong-doing and continues to co-operate with the investigation. In February, an FTC vote deadlocked, two for and two against, on whether to seek a court injunction against Microsoft. Today the commission will consider a revised and much narrower case against Microsoft. It is believed to focus upon alleged abuse of product warranties to tie customers' guarantees to use of other Microsoft programs, as well as allegations that Microsoft deliberately and falsely gave users of test versions of Windows the impression that the program would not work properly with competing PC operating systems such as Novell's DR-DOS. Whatever decision the commission reaches today, it is not expected to have an immediate impact upon Microsoft's business. The Commission will not seek 'structural changes,' such as breaking up the company, Ms Goldman Rohm predicts. Nonetheless, the case could have a broad impact on the computer software industry by forcing Microsoft to be more restrained in its competitive tactics, providing other companies with an opportunity to unseat the industry leader. Microsoft has sold about 30m copies of Windows since its launch three years ago and about 100m copies of MS-DOS over the past 12 years. Net income for fiscal year 1992, ending June 1992, was Dollars 708m (Pounds 472m) on revenues of Dollars 2.8bn. If the FTC votes to seek an injunction against Microsoft, it could simply consent and avoid a trial. Were Microsoft to fight the case, it runs the risk of becoming embroiled in a legal battle that could last years, reminiscent of International Business Machines' battles with the Justice Department. The Microsoft case is also being closely watched for clues about the Clinton administration's stand on anti-trust law enforcement after 12 years of Republican rule in the White House during which a 'let the market decide' philosophy toward non-merger anti-trust cases prevailed. Should the FTC again reach deadlock over whether to carry the Microsoft case forward, the US justice department is poised to take over the case, according to Ms Goldman Rohm. For Microsoft, win or lose, the message is that as a big and successful company, it needs to be aware of the anti-trust implications of its business practices. So far, however, Microsoft has been reluctant to accept such constraints, which it believes could be damaging to its competitiveness. While other software companies characterise Microsoft as a bully, Microsoft itself is still battling to stay ahead.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lincoln House to eliminate debt through Pounds 2m placing LINCOLN HOUSE, the USM-traded home furnishing group, is to raise some Pounds 2m net of expenses via a placing and open offer and subscription. The company is issuing 9.07m shares at 25p apiece. Of these, 8.07m have been conditionally placed - subject to the rights of shareholders to apply for their entitlement on a 1-for-2 basis under the open offer - and 1m are to be issued pursuant to the subscription. The proceeds will be used principally to eliminate net borrowings and provide additional working capital. Because the nominal price of the company's shares at 50p exceeds the 25p placing price, to enable it to proceed with the placing and avoid having two separately listed classes of shares, the company proposes a capital reorganisa-tion. The first stage of this will involve a sub-division of its shares into one new ordinary share with a nominal value of 10p and one deferred share with a nominal value of 40p. The resulting new ordinary shares will, for all practical purposes, have the same rights attaching to the issued ordinary shares of 50p each. The deferred shares will be valueless and no share certificates will be issued in respect of them. In the second stage all the deferred shares will be cancelled for no consideration and the share premium account following the fund raising issue will also be cancelled. The amount set free will be used to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account and to create a special capital reserve against which goodwill arising from any future acquisitions may be set off. The company also proposes to adopt a new share option scheme to replace its existing executive scheme.</p>

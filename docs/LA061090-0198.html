			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KENNEDY-CUOMO WEDDING DRAWS CELEBRITIES, SIGHTSEERS;  </P> <P> NUPTIALS: THE CEREMONY INCLUDED A PLEDGE OF COMMITMENT TO THE OPPRESSED. THE  COUPLE WILL SPEND THEIR HONEYMOON IN THE CARIBBEAN.  </P> <P> Kerry Kennedy and Andrew Cuomo were married Saturday in a ceremony that merged  two of America's most powerful political families.  </P> <P> They swore mutual commitment to the oppressed -- "the people who have  disappeared in El Salvador, the children in shelters in New York."  </P> <P> The bride, 30, is the daughter of Ethel Kennedy and the late Sen. Robert F.  Kennedy and is executive director of the human rights center in New York City  that bears his name. The groom, 32, is New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's son and  his chief political adviser. He also heads a Manhattan foundation to help the  homeless.  </P> <P> About 300 people attended the elaborate, closed wedding at the Cathedral of St.  Matthew, a Catholic church about half a mile from the White House. It is the  church where President John F. Kennedy's funeral was held in 1963.  </P> <P> Kerry Kennedy was 8 years old when her father was assassinated in a Los Angeles  hotel shortly after winning the California Democratic presidential primary. She  was the seventh of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children.  </P> <P> The bride walked the aisle alone as the Kennedy clan, including Jacqueline  Kennedy Onassis, and a planeload of Cuomo relatives and intimates looked on.  </P> <P> The guest list was not disclosed, but it included New York Mayor David N.  Dinkins, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, newspaper columnists Jimmy Breslin and  Art Buchwald and dozens of others who occupied a swarm of photographers and  hundreds of sightseers who lined the sidewalk across from the church.  </P> <P> Kerry Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, the groom's father and several brothers  and sisters of both the bride and groom gave readings during the wedding Mass,  celebrated by Father Gerard C. Creedon of County Cork, Ireland, a longtime  Kennedy family friend now performing charity work in nearby Alexandria, Va.  </P> <P> Creedon said the couple affirmed a pledge to uphold "family traditions and  their commitment to human rights and justice." He charged them in the ceremony,  at their request, to always "cherish the people who have disappeared in El  Salvador, the children in shelters in New York."  </P> <P> The bride wore a Scaasi-designed dress of gleaming silk and white satin with a  Basque bodice, a sweetheart neckline, puff sleeves, a voluminous skirt and a  cathedral train. It was ornamented with crystals, silver bugle beads and hearts  of pearl. The groom and his 15-member party wore morning dress.  </P> <P> The maids of honor were the bride's younger sister, Rory, 21, and friend Mary  Richardson, 30. Sisters Courtney Kennedy and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend were  among 13 bridesmaids.  </P> <P> A three-abreast, blocklong fleet of stretch limousines carried the wedding  party and virtually all their guests to a reception at Hickory Hill, the  McLean, Va., home of Ethel Kennedy.  </P> <P> The ceremony blended classical and African-American music and featured Ruth  Brown, the star soloist of Broadway's "Black and Blue."  </P> <P> Both the bride and groom are law school graduates. They had dated for nearly  two years before he offered her a diamond ring last Valentine's Day.  </P> <P> Cuomo has worked for his father's political campaigns since he was a teen-ager  and managed his gubernatorial victories in 1982 and 1986. He plans to run his  father's campaign for reelection this year as well.  </P> <P> Following a six-day honeymoon in the Caribbean, the couple plans to settle in  Queens, N.Y. Andrew Cuomo's current office, as head of HELP, the nonprofit  corporation to build temporary housing for the homeless, is in Manhattan.  </P></p>

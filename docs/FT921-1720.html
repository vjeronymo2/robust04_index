			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Dollar looks strong THE DOLLAR and sterling will again be closely watched in the currency markets this week - although for different reasons. The dollar surprisingly breached the DM1.68 barrier on Friday, after dealers had predicted a consolidative period for a couple of weeks would see it locked in a DM1.6350-DM1.6720 range. Renewed dollar optimism could see it rise again this week, if the figures for durable goods orders on Tuesday, GDP on Thursday, and personal income and consumption on Friday are encouraging. Although it has been largely priced in by the market, the dollar could draw longer-term support from a likely cut in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, expected imminently. Dealers will be watching for sterling's reaction to yesterday's opinion polls, four out of five of which showed the opposition Labour party to be leading the conservatives ahead of the general election on April 9. So far, sterling has held steady, with very little activity at all. Some buying interest whenever it nears its effective floor against the peseta has been enough to underpin it without Bank of England intervention. Dealers say that this might be explained by the belief that, as both the Conservatives and Labour are committed to taking sterling into the narrow band of the ERM at a DM2.95 central rate, sterling has less to fear from an outright victory by either party than it does from a hung parliament and prolonged political uncertainty. They warn that if this scenario looks likely, and domestic investors decide to sell sterling, foreign investors could follow suit. This could still see the UK currency being pushed down towards its absolute ERM floor of DM2.7780.</p>

They agreed that initial successes have been achieved in the  anti-corruption campaign throughout the country.    However, eradication of corruption remains an arduous task  for a long time to come because corruption has infiltrated into  almost all aspects of social life.    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning provincial party  committee, said that the anti-corruption campaign is crucial for  China's economic growth and long-term stability.    "Therefore, we must do everything within our power to make  the campaign a success," he said during a group discussion.    Both NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members  emphasized the importance of viewing the anti-corruption  campaign from the height of correctly handling relations between  reform, development and stability.    Feng Tiyun, a CPPCC National Committee member and  vice-minister of supervision, said that some officials abuse  their power for personal gains through loopholes in legal,  supervisory and managerial systems.    He called these officials "borers of reforms and opening  up,"  noting that they must be punished according to law.    With regard to anti-corruption measures to be taken in the  future, the deputies and members called for efforts to perfect  China's legal system and establish an effective supervisory and  restraint system.    Gu Jinchi made a three-point proposal in that regard:    -- It is necessary to clearly define the duties and  functions  of CPC committees and governments at all levels and establish a  supervisory system;    -- It is imperative to establish and perfect an open and  standardized system regarding the use and management of  personnel, public money and materials, and subject  administrative power holders to supervision by the people; and    -- It is necessary to institute a system under which leading  officials will declare their incomes.    Han Peixin, chairman of the Standing Committee of the  Jiangsu  Provincial People's Congress, said that many corruptive  phenomena have resulted from disciplinary problems in the style  of work of officials.    For this reason, it does not suffice to crack down on  corrupt  officials only in the economic area, he noted.    The eradication of corruption requires the solution of deep-  rooted problems in political life, with the key lying in  perfecting the personnel system, he added.    Li Jinpei, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National  Committee, proposed promoting the anti-corruption campaign by  tightening legal restraints, improving supervisory measures,  increasing civil servants' salary and stepping up ideological  education.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T in damages claim THE battle for market share in America's long-distance communications business has taken a new legal twist with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest long-distance group, asking a federal court to award it damages against three rivals: MCI Communications, Sprint and WilTel. It complained they had undercut AT&amp;T's rates by providing 'secret' contracts to business customers. The action stems from an appeal court ruling in Washington DC last November that all long-distance carriers must publish their prices in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934. AT&amp;T said its damages claim covered 'many millions of dollars.' MCI said AT&amp;T had been stung by a 'a continuing string of losses to MCI among its largest customers,' and it dismissed as 'absurd' the assertion that secret deals had denied customers the benefits of competition.</p>

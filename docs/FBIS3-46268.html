			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Bian Hongwei: "Managerial Wages Based on </F> Profits and Performance"]    [Text] An annuity pilot programme linking income with  performance for directors and managers of State enterprises is  set to begin.    Officials say this is not a simple change of the pay  cycle--from once a month to once a year. But it ties  management's earnings to government wishes to invigorate State  enterprises.    Aside from performance, salary will be decided by individual  enterprises' fixed assets, their tax payment and profit  turnovers to the State as well as local average income level.    The reform aims to separate management payments from  ordinary  workers to promote self-constraint within enterprises, Wang  Chongguang, an official with the Ministry of Labour, told China  Daily.    Directors and general managers of State enterprises will  shoulder more responsibilities and risks with the change.    "The new system encourages managerial staff to work as hard  as they can because the better their performance, the more they  get," said Wang, who is in charge of the distribution division  within enterprises.    The annuity is to be divided into two parts: the basic  salary and the risk income.    According to Wang, the basic wage is about equal to annual  total income under the existing monthly payment system. Risk  income will depend on how much profit directors bring to their  enterprises as well as to the owner--the State.    The new system stipulates that directors can only get their  full basic wage if their enterprises meet annual fiscal goals.    If their enterprises turn over more taxes and profits to the  State, directors' bonuses, or risk income, can be 50 to 200  percent more than their basic salary.    Directors whose firms fail to reach targeted quotas,  however,  will receive lower pay than the basic annuity fixed by the State.    But the Ministry of Labour did not specify the degree of  income reductions.    "The system is formulated on the ground that the average  production cycle usually lasts a relatively longer period than  that for issuing monthly wages," Wang said.    "To judge the performance of a director, one has to know the  enterprise's economic indexes, including the industrial output  value. But the indexes are not available until the end or the  beginning of a year," he added.    The system is waiting for State Council's approval. Once  endorsed, it will be put into effect within a few months and  327,000 directors and general managers of State enterprises will  be affected. For the first year, they will get pre-payments of  their income to cover daily expenditures.    It is hoped that the move can motivate top managers of State  enterprises to improve overall firm performance, Wang said.    Presently, State enterprises play a dominant role in China's  various economic sectors, but an estimated one-third of them are  in the red and their workers lead a comparatively poor life.    The annuity system is a continuation of reforms, not a fresh  move to boost State firms, Labour Ministry officials say.    As early as 1986, the country mapped out reforms to regulate  salaries of management at State enterprises.    That regulation said directors could be paid one- to  three-times higher than common workers depending on profits.    The regulations to a certain degree, motivated directors.  Yet during the implementation, problems cropped up.    Some managers, even those of money-losing enterprises, did  nothing but try to increase their own income. Many directors  received far more than was permitted by the regulations. Common  complaints focused on directors abusing their power to make  profits.    The malpractice was largely checked during the national  anticorruption campaign last year. But the rational parts of  the system, such as more bonuses for managers with outstanding  achievements, have also been dropped in many parts of the  country.    "The annuity system is a concrete step to deepen the reform  on the management of State-owned enterprises," said Xu Yanjun,  also with the Ministry of Labour.    The system is in line with the goal of defining the property  rights of State enterprises.    Under the new practice, directors and managers will serve as  the legal representatives of State assets at their enterprises.  They are responsible for maintaining and increasing the values  of the properties, said Xu.    Previous enterprise reforms have failed to touch the  property  rights of State-owned firms.    The annuity system can help to promote a sound property  relationship within enterprises and speed up the integration of  a modern enterprise system, Xu said.</p>

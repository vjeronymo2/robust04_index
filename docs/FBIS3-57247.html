			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tajik </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Week in Review" program, with program presenter </F> Muborez Nekvarz and Farhod Mumin, political commentator of the  Voice of Free Tajikistan]    [Excerpt] [Nekvarz] Let us review the events of last week.  I think the hot issue of the week was the internal clashes in  Afghanistan.    [Mumim] That is right. However, analysis of the Afghan  internal disagreements is the job of the Afghan brothers  themselves, but here I would like to point out one issue which  is causing concern to us Tajiks and to the world community.  This issue is the bombing of Tajik refugee camps in Afghanistan  by unknown aircraft.    Several points need to be clarified here. First, those who  have resorted to this act, by taking advantage of internal  conflict in Afghanistan, are trying to fulfill their ugly  political aims.    [Nekvarz] Who do you have in mind and to whom do these  aircraft belong?    [Mumim] In my opinion the bombing of the Tajik refugee camps  was planned outside the territory of Afghanistan. In no way  could this action have been organized by the opposing formations  or ethnic groups of Afghanistan. Because from the first days  the charitable Afghan brothers have welcomed Tajik refugees as  their true brothers and sisters and have provided all-round  assistance to them.    Although the Afghan opposing sides have disagreements among  themselves, they all have a good opinion of the Tajik refugees  and we hope, God willing, that this will continue.    In my view, these aircraft either belonged to Uzbekistan or  to Russia and they carried out these attacks by order of the  communist regime of Rakhmanov -- a regime which is used to  attacking its own people with foreign forces.    [Nekvarz] I would like to point out that this incident was  reported by the world's influential media such as REUTER, the  BBC, Radio Liberty, and others.    [Mumim] That is absolutely correct. Analysis of events shows  that the communist government of Tajikistan had a hand in these  conspiracies. The bombing raids against the refugee camps were  carried out two weeks ago following the appeal by Imamali  Rakhmanov to his so-called compatriots abroad. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Beijing's five star tastes China has become one of the world's greatest consumers of expensive French cognac, luxury liquor company Remy Cointreau said yesterday. Managing director Patrick Bompoint, whose company produces champagne and speciality liqueurs, said Remy Cointreau was selling more than FFr1bn (Dollars 190m) of liquor to China each year. Speaking at an informal meeting of bank, stock market and business officials hosted by Paribas Luxembourg, Mr Bompoint said Russia ranked second, after China, in sales for his company. In 1988, the US held top position for expensive liquor sales, and China and Russia did not even appear in the top eight. The Pacific area, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, accounts for 34 per cent of Remy-Cointreau's worldwide sales.</p>

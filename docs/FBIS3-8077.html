			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bosnian Serb authorities are refusing to allow a  convoy of the Dutch United Nations battalion to get through to  the besieged Muslim enclave of Srebrenica. The Serbs are  protesting about the amount of military equipment, especially  ammunition, that the Dutch troops are taking to Srebrenica. The  Serbs are also preventing 180 Canadian troops from leaving the  Muslim enclave.    The Dutch contingent is authorized to relieve the Canadian  blue helmets under an agreement signed by several parties  including the Bosnian Serbs. At first the takeover operation  encountered no resistance, but in the past few days the Serbs  have toughened their stance.</p>

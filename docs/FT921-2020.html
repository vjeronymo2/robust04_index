			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trade still subdued THE UK money market was very subdued again after a large rise in UK jobless figures, and with mixed opinion polls failing to give any clear lead. The resilience of sterling in the face of a deteriorating political outlook was said to be providing some comfort to the market. But the disappointing figures for unemployment, underlying earnings and unit wage costs, and very slow consumer borrowing, were seen as giving more ammunition to the Labour party in the general election battle, and little comfort to the Conservatives. Interbank rates were little changed, but remained on the firm side for a 10 1/2 per cent base rate, and with only the slightest positive tilt to the yield curve. The key three months rate was unchanged at 10 13/16 -10 per cent, although the one year rate was down  1/16 at 10 15/16 -10 7/8 . The June sterling contract opened at 89.07 and slid to a low of 88.99 on brisk early selling, before recovering to 89.05. Day-to-day funding proved more difficult than expected, in spite of the modest shortage forecast of Pounds 550m, as the Bank of England was prepared to offer assistance only in shorter bands. The market was not very interested in taking this up, preferring to sell off longer paper carrying a greater risk. The Bank did not operate until midday, when the shortage was revised upwards to Pounds 600m, and it purchased Pounds 77m band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the forecast fell to Pounds 550m, and the Bank purchased Pounds 76m bank bills in bands 1 and 2. Late assistance of Pounds 250m still left nearly Pounds 150m uncovered. Overnight rates were up to around 11-10 7/8 per cent by midday, and firmed in the afternoon to 11 1/2 per cent to reflect the difficult conditions, before dropping back to 10 1/2 -10 per cent at the close. German call money was stuck at the 9.60 per cent level as heavy March tax payments continued to drain liquidity. The tax payments were putting some banks under pressure yesterday, leading to heavier demand for overnight money, but dealers said supply and demand were balanced. The Bundesbank confounded faint rumours that it might tighten its monetary policy, saying only that its council had discussed economic and monetary topics and European monetary integration at its meeting with Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor.</p>

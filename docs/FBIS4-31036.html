			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Andras Bencsik: "Balkan Dreams"] </F>   [Text] One can interpret the recent elections in many  ways. The first lesson, however, is that Hungary has returned to  the line of former socialist countries after a detour of four  years. Like almost everywhere, the victorious left also  returned to power in Hungary. For the Hungarian voters, the  Balkan way seems to be more feasible than the European way;  however, this does not mean the end of democracy; it only means  a different model.    We can draw at least a similar lesson from the fact that the  Socialists' triumph is accompanied by the fall of all the former  opposition parties. Members of the government coalition have  been automatically replaced and, within the coalition, the  collapse of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] became tragic  at the election finish. The former rallying party with 42  percent of the votes has become a dwarf party with 9.5 percent.  However, the collapse of the other opposition parties is even  more spectacular than the tragic defeat of the MDF. The  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which seemed to be heading  for triumph at the end of the first round, suffered the  third-biggest loss after the losses of the MDF and the  Smallholders Party by the end of the second round and compared  with the 1990 elections. This is a surprising development, and  it is even more surprising that the liberals were unable to get  a single individual candidate in parliament in Budapest  decorated with the party's flags.    I think it is not an exaggeration to say that, indirectly,  the two rival parties -- the SZDSZ and the MDF -- did the most  for the success of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. And  this really gives food for thought. Just like [SZDSZ Chairman]  Ivan Peto's sudden fit of the blues. The chairman of the party  that was running its superstar candidate for the position of  prime minister is now desperately trying to prove that they have  not yet made any clear statements regarding the coalition, and  he is trying to make people understand that the liberals do not  find it at all attractive to join the government.    I believe that it is no longer attractive for them today.  Gabor Kuncze's glory is over. Not only that he will not become  prime minister, but it is hardly questionable whether he could  get a ministry from the few the Socialists might offer to them  in a possible government coalition. However, the issue is more  complex than that. If the SZDSZ decides to remain in  opposition, they will get into a rather special situation,  because remaining in opposition at the cost of shrinking the  party will hardly seem a noble feat of arms to the party  membership divided over the idea of a left-wing coalition.    In addition, in the opposition, the SZDSZ will enter  political quarantine. Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation  of Young Democrats, Fidesz] already said it clearly that the  liberal coalition has ceased to exist. And the relations  between the former coalition parties and the SZDSZ are at least  that clear.    In the opposition, the SZDSZ can become unpleasantly  isolated  and this can lead to the disintegration of the party elite. If  it gets into the government, the SZDSZ will become weightless  and will also lose a considerable number of influential members  and supporters who reject the leftist government.    The coalition will not be an easy one, and the Socialists  are  also aware of this. They now regard both liberal parties as  natural partners, and this formulation also contains a message  to the Fidesz. The Fidesz will also find it difficult to  decide, because this party collapsed into the smallest party,  but they preserved their moral reserves, something that can also  be reduced to nil in a few months at the side of the Socialist  Party with an absolute majority in Parliament.    Logic would dictate today that the Socialists should form a  government alone, but logic is asserted in politics in a rather  complex way. The MDF, which caused a landslide with its tragic  politics, might cleanse itself and strengthen in the opposition,  if it is able to acknowledge its defeat. Although the SZDSZ,  which made complete use of the MDF mistakes, could make their  dreams of power true, they could only do that at a price that  could lead to a total disintegration of the party, because a big  social-democratic party could also be the end of an MSZP-SZDSZ  coalition. A possible liberal-conservative opposition coalition  would completely close the door to the SZDSZ that joined the  government. However, if the SZDSZ gives up its dream of power,  they will have to admit that they also followed a tragic  strategy. And they will not have the cathartic and protecting  force of the experience of government activity behind them.    Today, the SZDSZ has to choose between two bad things. Both  bad things can considerably reduce the party's weight, power,  and credibility. If they win, they will lose. If they join the  loser, they might win. Perhaps in a later round. Whichever  solution they choose, their decision will lead to the emergence  of a new SZDSZ. Paradoxically, the tragedy of the SZDSZ is  identical with that of the MDF. However, the MDF has it easier,  because it no longer has a choice: If it fails to renew itself,  it will cease to exist. However, its political counterpoint does  not yet know which possibility of renewal to choose: To  assimilate or to again deny itself.</p>

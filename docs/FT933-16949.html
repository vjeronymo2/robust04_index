			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / People: Sir Tom steps aside Sir Tom Cowie, one of Britain's longest serving chairmen, is to call it a day. After 45 years as chairman of T Cowie, the Sunderland-based motor dealer, Sir Tom has announced that he plans to step down from the board at the end of the year and take the title of life president. Sir Tom, who will turn 71 in September, founded his business around a motor cycle repair shop in Sunderland and the boardroom still stands on the spot where Sir Tom once repaired motorcycles. He brought his company to the stock market 30 years ago and it has grown into one of Britain's top four motor distributors, employing over 3,500 people, with a turnover in excess of Pounds 800m. Sir Tom only split his role in 1991, appointing Gordon Hodgson, 61, as chief executive. It is unlikely that Hodgson will move up to be chairman and the group is looking to appoint an independent non-executive chairman designate. Lord Elliott of Morpeth, a former Conservative MP, is the company's only non-executive director and the intention is to recruit two more.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Alcan back in black in third quarter Strong US and European demand for fabricated products, better pricing and more rationalisation moved Alcan Aluminium, the Canadian aluminium group, firmly into the black for the third quarter and first nine months, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Third-quarter net profit was USDollars 66m, or 27 cents a common share, against a loss of USDollars 13m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. The quarter included a special after-tax gain of USDollars 27m mainly on the sale of Alcan Australia. Revenues were USDollars 2.2bn, up 21 per cent. Nine months' net profit was USDollars 48m, or 15 cents, against a loss of USDollars 68m, or 37 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were USDollars 6.1bn, up 12 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Olga Garbuzova report: "Law on Civil Service. Bureaucrats </F> To Be Banned From Taking Bribes"]    [Text] Nightmares that haunted Chekhov's protagonists will  apparently soon be understandable for current Russian  bureaucrats. In accordance with the draft Law on the Civil  Service in the Russian Federation, which has been drawn up by  the working group of the State Duma committee on judicial and  legal reform, examinations and assessments of qualifications  will be regularly conducted in the civil service.    The draft law proposes that the obscure titles of the old  Russian Table of Ranks, such as "collegiate assessor" or  "titular counselor," be replaced with less spectacular  "counselor" and "consultant." The draft's authors have also  rejected the trappings that had formerly added luster to this  occupation, such as a civil uniform and strict rules of address:  there will be no Your Honors or simply Your Excellencies.    The draft calls for civil servants to be divided into  politicians and administrators. The politicians, as is the case  now, will be elected, and the administrators will be appointed  via competition.    According to the new table of ranks, each administrative  official will know his place. For them, a number of grades have  been established: top, chief, leading, senior, and junior  officials. In order to begin a climb up the career ladder and  to become a junior official, one needs to have at least  secondary professional education. It is expected that all top  and chief officials in Russia must have a degree. All civil  servants will have special titles conferred on them. For  starters, a civil service consultant; then a civil service  counselor; simply a counselor; and a state counselor. A career  can be crowned with the title of full state counselor first  class. All titles will have the same number of classes -- from  one to three. The transfer from one rung to another will entail  an increase in one's salary by at least 70 percent.    For the sake of all that a civil servant will have to  sacrifice a whole range of rights enjoyed by other citizens.  Bureaucrats may not engage in entrepreneurial activity. No  presents, no bribes (referred to in the draft as "financial  rewards") or other "bones thrown to them" -- even upon  retirement. Civil servants will be banned from calling strikes  and accepting foreign orders without the president's permission.  In order for a civil servant better to realize his  responsibility, he will swear an oath when entering the civil  service.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Yorkshire Food exceeds Pounds 5m Yorkshire Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated last March, yesterday reported an 89 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.1m for its first year as a public company. The shares, placed at 110p in March 1993, dipped 3p to 119p yesterday. Turnover for the 12 months to end-December increased by 51 per cent from Pounds 63.2m to Pounds 95.2m, reflecting a combination of organic growth and the August acquisition of Del Monte's dried fruit business in California. 'Clearly in our first year we can claim to have improved shareholder value,' said Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive. Earnings per share increased from 8.21p to 9.33p. A final dividend of 2.48p is proposed, taking the total to 3.2p, compared with an estimated 2.88p for 1992. The group said the results fully justified the Pounds 16.9m acquisition, which contributed Pounds 15.2m to turnover and Pounds 1.9m to total operating profits of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 3.9m). Yorkshire's sales are now split equally between the US and the UK, where 24 per cent of sales go to supermarkets. The group considered the proportion of its sales going to supermarkets as an advantage because their demands led to efficient business practices, which gave knock-on benefits when dealing with other customers. The results included closure costs of Pounds 502,000, mainly reflecting the group's withdrawal from its baking business. The tax charge for the year rose from 17 to 23 per cent.</p>

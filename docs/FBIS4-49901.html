			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir bin Mohamad on Wednesday offered strong support for the  Chinese government's resistance to western pressure to change  its social and political policies.    "China needs the strong government that it has. It may be  authoritarian, but it is better than anarchy," said Mahathir.  "Business needs order," he declared.    "For the moment the interest of the majority demands an  orderly society," he said in a speech at a two-day international  conference here on the "socialist market economy."    Mahathir advocated controlled development of a market  economy. He said "it is right in not attempting a radical  political about- turn simultaneously" with economic reforms.    The Malaysian premier strongly criticised western countries  and accused them of wanting to weaken China. "This  proselytising for democracy veils only slightly the objective of  eliminating competition before it begins," he said. "They would  like the East Asian democracies to be weak and unstable like  theirs," he said, denouncing proposals by some nations for a  worldwide minimum wage clause in the final text of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Mahathir said he supported a strong China, which he  described  as an "engine of growth firstly for East Asia, including  Southeast Asia, and the world." "Southeast Asia should have no  fear of a wealthy and strong China."</p>

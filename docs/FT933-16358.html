			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Books: Monuments to deception - EH Gombrich enjoys a book that questions the historical evidence we place in past images and buildings HISTORY AND ITS IMAGES: ART AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PAST by Francis Haskell Yale Pounds 29.95, 558 pages FEW READERS contemplating this well-produced tome with about 500 pages of heavily footnoted text and 262 varied illustrations are likely to suspect that beneath its academic surface it carries an explosive charge. For the author is out to challenge a conviction of which he methodically traces the origins and the vicissitudes, the conviction dear to many art historians, that visual evidence surviving from the past in the form of monuments and images must be accorded equal status to written testimonials presented in chronicles, charters or archival documents. It is well known that, in this country at least, this opinion gained ground very slowly. Shortly before the Chair of Art History was established at Oxford University which is held by Francis Haskell with such distinction, I attended a meeting at that University in my temporary role as Slade Professor of Fine Art at which historians were asked whether they would favour such an innovation. Most of them were distinctly lukewarm. One of them suggested that military architecture - the fortifications of mediaeval castles - might present a welcome addition to the history syllabus, but most of them considered the cultivation of art history the job of museum curators and collectors who, of course, counted outstanding specialists among their ranks. It is true that John Ruskin in The Stones of Venice had undertaken long ago to link the rise and fall of the city with the history of its architecture, but this flawed work of genius (splendidly analysed here by Haskell) hardly commended such an approach to hard-headed historians. It may indeed be argued that it was only the arrival from the continent of art historians nurtured in a different tradition that ultimately breached the fortress of higher education. However much these new arrivals may have differed in their methods, most of them were agreed (to use Professor Haskell's words) that 'in principle figurative art could provide some direct insight into the past.' The chapter of the book from which this formulation is taken is headed 'The Deceptive Evidence of Art'. It might have served as a title of the whole book. But anyone familiar with the author's previous publications will hardly go wrong if he locates its germ-cell in the preceding chapter on 'The Historical Significance of Style', more precisely in the pages devoted to Hippolyte Taine's interpretation of Jesuit church interiors as a deliberate effort to dazzle and convert the populace with 'all the sweetmeats of pious confectionary'. Haskell comments tersely that 'modern scholars . . . have invalidated the notion of a politically motivated Jesuit art'. He does not say that quite early in his career he was one of those 'modern scholars'; indeed, his seminal book of 30 years ago on Patrons and Painters which contains much of the evidence is even absent from his bibliography. We may well surmise that Haskell branched out from this base, ingesting the validity of similar conclusions in the centuries before and after Hippolyte Taine. We are reminded in a series of 16 brilliant chapters how, long before art history existed as a branch of learning, numismatics had claimed a similar special relationship to history, as did the budding discipline of antiquarian studies represented by such towering figures as Montfaucon. And on to Winckelmann and such pioneers of cultural history as William Roscoe, the biographer of Lorenzo de Medici. He devotes memorable chapters to Alexandre Lenoir's Musee des Monuments Francais, to Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt, to historians of popular imagery and caricature, notably Champfleury and those visionaries of our own century who even wanted to interpret artistic movements as prophecies of things to come. Haskell concludes his survey surprisingly but convincingly with an account of the great Dutch historian Jan Huizinga, whom he enlists as an ally, since he too was inclined to question the evidential value of the arts which meant so much to him. Let no one fear, however, that in these packed pages he will encounter indigestible lists of names and dates. Everywhere the author excels in his well-proven gift of vividly describing the protagonists of his story as if he had been personally acquainted with them. No-one reading the beautiful last chapter is likely to forget the picture of Courajod, who 'would sit at a green baize table onto which he would sling his sets of photographs as if they were exhibits in some important trial. The oil lamp was so placed that his face remained in darkness and only his hands were brightly lit.' Or his descriptions of James Weale, an Englishman who is familiar to most of us only as a name in the bibliography of early Flemish painting, as 'a lean, tall figure with wide yet stooping shoulders, clad in a grey coat of unfashionable cut, moving with shambling gait on out-turned feet; a full grey beard; and shortsighted eyes peering through spectacles from beneath the widest brim imaginable of a black felt hat.' Here, as in his earlier books, the author puts his conviction to the test 'that to try to follow the emotions and reasoning of particular historians looking at specific works of art offers by far the most rewarding way of coming to terms even with the most abstract ideas that are discussed in this book'. Indeed, he quotes the Comte de Caylus, the great antiquarian, for the opinion that 'the antiquarian should shun every kind of system: I look upon them as an illness of the spirit.' Is it unfair to suspect that Haskell has a good deal of sympathy for this opinion? This might explain the puzzling fact that he all but passes over the highly influential 'system' of G B Vico with which he is of course fully familiar but which he leaves on one side on the grounds that Vico 'was not interested in art'. True, but it was Vico whose New Science replaced the story of individuals by the study of collectives, postulating a law of evolution leading civilisation from primitive stages to the dominance of human reason. Admittedly, it was mainly law and poetry that had to serve him as evidence, but it was soon apparent that the visual arts also fitted snugly into this system. When Vasari or others had described the evolution of art in terms of organic growth and decay they considered the arts in isolation. Now this growth could be seen as yet another symptom of the evolution of mankind. There are traces of this conception in Winckelmann but the varying forms of evolutionism that dominated historiography in the 19th century made it hard to resist the conclusion that 'primitive' styles of art that shared certain characteristics with the art of children betokened the primitive mentality of the 'childhood of mankind.' Most of the historians considered by Haskell subscribed to this dubious 'system.' It may well be argued that not before this fatal link between the theory of evolution and the study of human history is finally broken will it be possible to separate the legitimate use of visual evidence from those beguiling fantasies with which the author has so heroically wrestled in this important book.</p>

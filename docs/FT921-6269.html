			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Lower crude oil prices hit Statoil STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a NKr1.6bn (Dollars 25m) decline in 1991 pre-tax profit to NKr12.8bn, caused by lower crude oil prices, losses in petrochemicals and a big fall in refining profits. The company said it could give no promise of an early recovery in main markets. Net profit for 1991 was boosted to NKr5.4bn from NKr4.3bn in 1990 due to a non-recurring effect of reforms of Norwegian corporate tax. Without the tax change, Statoil's net profit would have been NKr4.2bn. Group operating revenue rose by NKr5.9bn to NKr78.3bn, but operating profit was cut by NKr2.5bn to NKr13.5bn. Statoil anticipates a NKr1.4bn dividend payment to the state, down from NKr1.5bn in 1990. Crude oil production rose by 14m barrels to 138m, helped by strong growth in output from the Gullfaks and Statfjord fields. Statoil noted the price for Brent Blend marker crude averaged Dollars 20 a barrel in 1991 against Dollars 24 a barrel in 1990. Exploration and production experienced a NKr1.5bn fall in operating profit to NKr9.3bn, and the natural gas division increased operating profit to NKr3.6bn from NKr2.9bn, helped by higher gas prices and increased volumes of transported gas. Refining and marketing saw operating profit slide to NKr647m from NKr1.2bn, mainly because of lower crude oil and products prices. Petrochemicals and plastics, the group's worst performer, slid into an operating loss of NKr17m from a profit of NKr718m.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / New top echelon named at IMF The International Monetary Fund has expanded its top level of management, naming three new deputy managing directors to take the place of Mr Richard Erb, the outgoing deputy managing director. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, yesterday appointed Mr Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, along with Mr Alassane Ouattara, former prime minister of Ivory Coast, and Mr Prabhakar Narvekar, an IMF official. Since the IMF's top position is usually held by a European, the deputy's post has been, by tradition, in the gift of the US. In recent weeks, US Treasury officials have been at pains to ensure that they retained this pre-eminence. Mr Fischer was accordingly named first deputy managing director, with broad responsibilities across all the issues facing the IMF. All three deputies have worked for many years in international financial institutions. Mr Fischer used to be chief economist at the World Bank, just across the road from the IMF in Washington, while Mr Narvekar has spent more than 40 years at the IMF. Mr Ouattara, meanwhile, has twice before worked for the IMF. He left in 1988 to become governor of the central bank of the African franc zone and, later, to take charge of the Ivory Coast's economy. The decision to enlarge the IMF's upper hierarchy has been greeted by some suspicion within the organisation. Some IMF officials fear that it will simply add another layer above that of the regional directors, who now report directly to Mr Camdessus. He said yesterday that the reorganisation was the first since a deputy managing director was appointed in 1949, and was necessary to deal with the rapid expansion in the IMF's membership.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Travel agents cut prices by 11% The three largest travel agency chains yesterday signalled the start of a post-Christmas price battle by announcing holiday discounts of 11 per cent. The price-cutting campaign, which starts on Monday, is not likely to last more than a few weeks as the high level of discounting means the chains will be giving away virtually all of their profits. Thomas Cook, the third-largest chain, fired the first shot yesterday by offering 10 per cent off all its summer 1994 holidays. It said it would cut the price of cruises by 15 per cent. Its two larger rivals, Lunn Poly and Going Places, immediately offered discounts of 11 per cent - forcing Thomas Cook to do likewise. Going Places, made up of the former Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel chains, is offering the discounts on its summer holidays only. Lunn Poly, the market leader, is offering the discounts on summer and winter holidays. All three chains stressed that the price campaign would be short. Lunn Poly and Going Places said their campaigns would run for a week. Thomas Cook said its offer would last 'for a limited period only'. If Thomas Cook extends its offer beyond the first week the other two chains will probably be forced to follow suit. As the average commission earned by the large chains is about 11 per cent or 12 per cent on each holiday sold, none of the retailers is keen to see the price cutting develop into a price war. Post-Christmas discounting in the travel industry is part of a pattern which has emerged over the past year. In place of the ruinous price wars of previous years the large chains have started to discount over shorter periods and then return to more profitable price levels. The most recent short discounting campaign took place in August. The retailers' aim is to win market share from one another and encourage holidaymakers to book earlier in the year, so improving the companies' cash flow. They also want to try to disappoint customers who wait until the last moment to book their summer holidays in the hope that retailers will be forced to sell at distressed prices. Thomas Cook said yesterday that hotel beds in Spain for next summer were already difficult to find. It said it might end up selling 'late availability' holidays to Spain at prices 'significantly higher than current brochure rates'.</p>

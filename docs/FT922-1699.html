			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Help at hand - Radio RADIO 1 is the most socially active of all channels. This week, Race through the 90s has dealt with ethnic prejudice. Short recorded complaints were inserted into the programmes where likely to be heard, followed by brief advice. Mark Goodier's 7 o'clock slots interview familiar players who have triumphed over prejudice. (The Irish are included.) There is a helpline, 0800 500 800, and a Commission for Racial Equality booklet is free to those who ask. May it all come off well. I keep in touch with Radio 4's Hospital lest the staff should become cosy familiars. But this week Dr Patel, on duty for 27 hours with only 15 minutes' sleep (no helpline for him]), only addressed his colleagues, staff and patients, and Nick West's liver-transplant was free of extraneous drama, though the replacement organ was a dud. I wonder if the ill-mannered emergency admissions staff knew their voices were being recorded? This obsessive interest in hospital procedure is inexplicable to me, but it has long been around. Science programmes on Radio 3 usually approach us as if we were insiders, but Is it really science? on Wednesday called on philosophy as well as physics. The unanswerable question debated was the one we all ask after reading Stephen Hawking's best-seller: under what laws did the Big Bang become the Big Bang? Bill Newton-Smith (philosophy) and Paul Davies (science) discussed this with Bryan Magee. There must have been laws of something, Newton-Smith held. Just the unchanging laws of science, Davies insisted. Might other laws have existed? No, all laws came under a 'superlaw'. Everything mathematically ordered, Magee quoted, suggests intelligence. We were slipping, albeit modestly, into philosophy, even theology. Consoling myself that more science came on Radio 3 later that evening, I reckoned I must do with that. It was only the second Ecology Debate, though, less interesting now the Earth Summit is over. Radio 3's Sunday play was John Clifford's brilliant Ines de Castro. Ines (Deborah Findlay) is a Spanish girl, lover of the Portuguese prince Pedro, and has born him two children. Spain and Portugal are at war, so Ines is reckoned a spy, and the King reckons she must be put down. He promises Pedro that no such thing will happen, but commissions his agent Pacheco to do this service as soon as Pedro resumes his command at the frontier. Pacheco duly beheads the children and their loyal Nurse, then cuts Ines's throat. Unluckily for him, Pedro wins an unlooked for victory and returns. When the King dies and Pedro assumes the crown, he initiates a dreadful vengeance. Five years buried, Ines's body is dug up and robed as Queen. At a great state banquet, Pacheco is killed, slowly and publicly, while guests are made to hold Ines's decayed hand. Clifford shows no bias between truth and fancy. Supernatural characters seem as natural as the ably-drawn human. Ines is consoled by the Devil (an old woman, Margaret Robertson, great) with talk about the state of Hell. At Ines's funeral service, the people chat about the meat trade, and the tailor measuring he body for her robes moans that he wasn't told whether to use inches or centimetres. The play was commissioned for the Traverse in 1990. The guitar music by Jeremy Taylor has been added for radio, but, with respect to able director Marilyn Imrie, it breaks the continuity of thought too often. Deborah Findlay's calm, pure Ines was perfect.</p>

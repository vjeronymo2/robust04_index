			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the National Statistics Committee, in  January- April the rates of decline in Russian industry made up  25.4 pct - a record index since the start of reforms in the  country.    In the first quarter of this year the rates of decline were  less than 25 pct as compared with the same period last year.    In April average daily industrial production fell by 3.3 pct  against its March level.    The greatest decrease in the volume of production was noted  in the industries requiring investment and in consumer-goods  production. For instance, as compared with the fuel and energy  industry, where the volume of production in the past 4 months  fell by 11 pct, in the food industry it decreased by 21 pct, in  machinebuilding by 45 pct, in chemistry and petrochemistry by 35  pct, and in the consumer-goods industry by 39 pct.    In January-April oil extraction made up 99.3 million tons -  15 pct less than in the same period last year; gas extraction  made up 217 billion cubic meters - 1 pct less.    The output of tractors fell by four-fifths against the same  period last year; the output of cars went down by 28 pct and  that of trucks by 66 pct.    High rates of decline were noted in the production of TV  sets  (31 pct), in the production of washing machines (45 pct) and in  the production of other kinds of household equipment. The  demand for such products fell because of high prices and low -  as compared with the foreign-made analogues - quality.    According to the National Statistics Committee, in the first  four months of this year Russia's Gross National Product  decreased by 17 pct against the same period last year, and made  up 142 trillion rubles.    Official statistics also note greater number of plants and  factories where production was suspended for a long time. In  January there were 3800 such plants, and over 5000 in April.</p>

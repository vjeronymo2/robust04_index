			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 31 March (AFP) -- Hundreds of policemen,  many armed with automatic weapons, stormed into the Georgian  parliament Thursday to protest the nomination of a new interior  minister they claimed was unfit for the job.    Meanwhile some 3,000 supporters of the late Georgian  president Zviad Gamsakhurdia marched down the main avenue of  Tbilisi in a demonstration marking what would have been the  former leader's 55th birthday.    Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze was in the building  during the occupation and convinced General David Zaikidze, the  chief of Tbilisi police who led the occupation, to withdraw his  men from the parliament, officials said.    Zaikidze is a political ally of Shevardnadze and officials  here declined to speculate on his motivation for the protest,  which took everyone inside the building, including an AFP  correspondent, by surprise.    Deputies subsequently confirmed Shevardnadze's nomination of  Shota Kviraya as interior minister and strongly condemned  Zaikidze's action, Marina Mamaladze, a presidential spokeswoman,  told AFP.    ITAR-TASS news agency quoted one of the policemen who  stormed  the building as saying that Kviraya was an "unworthy and  incompetent man suspected of corruption and mafia links," but  gave no further details.    Kviraya was nominated to the post by Shevardnadze earlier  this year and the Georgian leader had on several occasions  called on deputies to approve the appointment.    The protest initially sparked fears of an attempted coup  d'etat, but afterwards more closely resembled one of the many  personality clashes fueled by confrontation between armed groups  that have plagued the Georgian capital for nearly three years.    The tension was defused after Shevardnadze explained to  Zaikidze that his behavior was "incorrect" and persuaded him to  lead his men out of the building.    The parliament was later sealed off.    Marina Mamaladze told AFP that a special parliamentary  commission would be convened to study Thursday's events.    Meanwhile, the pro-Gamsakhurdia protesters, angered by a  sharp fall in living standards and at Shevardnadze's moves  toward closer ties with Russia, shouted calls for "independent  and free Georgia."    There were several tense scuffles during the protest march  and security forces were absent from the streets but the  demonstration went off largely peacefully and later dispersed.    Armed groups loyal to Gamsakhurdia launched an offensive  against Georgian government troops in the west of the country  last autumn following the defeat of Georgian forces in the  separatist republic of Abkhazia.    The pro-Gamsakhurdia rebellion was crushed only after  Shevardnadze appealed for and received military backing from  Russia.    Gamsakhurdia subsequently committed suicide, according to  his  wife.</p>

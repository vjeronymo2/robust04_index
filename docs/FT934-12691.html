			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Commonwealth seeks to push role of reform THE COMMONWEALTH last night moved to carve out a new role for itself as a pressure group for international economic and political reform. In a communique at the end of the five-day biennial summit, the Commonwealth leaders called for urgent trade reform, improved debt relief terms for poor countries and action on human rights. The conference was the first for 30 years not to be dominated by South Africa, and the 50-member body was seeking a new cause. It was also coming to terms with its limitations, acknowledging that its capacity to resolve even its own members' disputes, whether Cyprus or Kashmir, is often slight. South Africa remained high on the agenda, with the conference communique welcoming the fact that the changes undertaken marked the 'irreversible' ending of apartheid, but warning that the transition to a democratic government was 'fragile'. Commonwealth leaders announced plans for a 60-70 strong team to help monitor next April's scheduled general election. Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, together with Mr John Major, his UK counterpart, helped galvanise the Commonwealth into action on the trade issue, with talks dominated by ways of securing a successful end to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks by the mid-December deadline. As a result, a Commonwealth delegation of trade ministers is to tour the world's leading capitals to press the case for agreement. The other key issue was debt relief. Mr Major urged a write-off of up to 80 per cent of official debt of developing countries embracing economic reform programmes endorsed by the World Bank and IMF. The communique also promised renewed emphasis on the need for democracy and respect of human rights among member states, but it resisted suggestions that members should be monitored. Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, invited the Commonwealth to be a watchdog in post-apartheid South Africa but the conference did not follow up his offer. Other inconsistencies remain. A delegation from Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of Nigeria's annulled presidential poll last June, was refused a hearing, while delegates of the military - backed government took their seats. Cameroon's application for membership will be accepted in 1995 provided it has met the Commonwealth's professed standards, yet when existing members such as Sierra Leone flagrantly breach them, they pay no penalty. For all the body's shortcomings however, leaders still think it is worth their time: Ms Benazir Bhutto felt the conference important enough to fly in just 48 hours after her victory in the Pakistan election. Meanwhile, its numbers are growing. When the conference reassembles in 1995 South Africa will have rejoined, Cameroon could be re-admitted and Mozambique will almost certainly have its application on the table. By then the observation of Mr Major will have been put to the test: 'What we cannot do, we should not pretend to do. . . but what we do decide to do, we must do well.' He was talking about the UN, but the words apply with equal force to the Commonwealth.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / IMF expects decline inworld economic growth THE International Monetary Fund yesterday responded to fresh evidence of global economic weakness by sharply revising down its growth projections for next year. Its latest figures show industrial countries growing at only 2 per cent next year, nearly a full percentage point slower than estimates made in September. Most of the downward revision reflects the IMF's growing pessimism about the outlook for Japan and Europe. Japan is now expected to grow by only 2.4 per cent against a previous projection of 3.8 per cent. EC growth has been revised down to 1 per cent from 2.3 per cent. The biggest single revision was for Germany, which is now expected to grow at 0.6 per cent rather than 2.6 per cent. The US remains a bright spot with projected growth of 3 per cent, a reduction of only 0.1 percentage points. Staff said the revisions reflected a reassessment of the negative impact on private spending of falling asset prices, adverse effects of persistent high real interest rates in Europe and Canada, and uncertainty in European exchange markets.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Algerian mosques sealed off THE Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) said one man was killed outside the Attaquwa mosque, near Bab El-Oued mosque yesterday after security forces sealed off the area on the chief weekly prayer day, agencies report from Algiers. At least eight people were wounded, including three by the mosque of Algiers university. The security force action marked a further crackdown on the Islamic movement that three weeks ago was on the brink of winning power. Ambulance sirens could be heard in the streets of the Bab El-Oued neighbourhood, which is a bastion of support for the (FIS). The Front has been defying a crackdown on its demands for an Islamic state. Police also reported that a home-made bomb was thrown into the garden of the US embassy on Thursday, causing minor damage but no injuries. There was no indication who staged the attack.</p>

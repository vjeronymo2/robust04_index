			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Correspondent Xia Ruge (1115 0320 7041): "Who Is </F> Being Courted? Shanghai Offers Large Projects To Attract  Transnational Corporations"]    [Text] Attracting internationally renowned transnational  corporations for completely systematic cooperation with various  industries has become a main goal this year in Shanghai's use of  foreign capital.    Persons concerned have disclosed that Shanghai will offer  about 100 major industrial projects this year to attract more  than $10 million in foreign capital. These offers are in the  petrochemical, metallurgy, complete electric power plant  equipment, telecommunications electronics, motor vehicle tires,  computer, and ball bearing industries. These projects will be  joint ventures or cooperative ventures with major advanced world  business concerns and transnational corporations. They will  include joint ventures that cut across industry lines, and  complete industry joint ventures. They will also break new  ground in the use of technology exchange markets, in investment  scale, in investment methods, and in conditions for setting up  holding companies. The goal is for one-third of the world's top  major corporations to have an investment project in Shanghai  within one year.    People in the economic sector note that the purpose of  Shanghai's active efforts to cooperate with transnational  corporations is formation of a high and new technology  industrial group of substantial size so as to be able to begin  from a high starting point in the development of its own  products. This will enable a "new generation" of Shanghai goods  in entirely new garb to take part in international economic  competition.    Reportedly, Shanghai has some new areas, new approaches, and  new methods for using foreign capital this year. Ten major  projects make up Shanghai's second round of infrastructure  building. They include a power generation project, the Number 2  subway line, the Pudong international airfield, the  circumferential highway around the city, and refuse treatment.  In the attraction of foreign traders, in addition to the use of  Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperation, BOT and other means  of using foreign capital are beginning to be used. Commercial  wholesaling and retailing enterprises will set up joint ventures  and cooperation with foreign chain stores, and will trial  operate Sino-foreign joint venture or sole proprietorship  foreign trade companies. They will trial operate Sino-foreign  joint venture commercial wholesale enterprises, and means of  production retail enterprises. They will, on a trial basis,  operate and develop investment institutions such as various  kinds of funds, investment trusts, and holding companies. They  plan to draw up attractive preferential methods and  concessionary policies to attract foreign finance and banking  institutions, transnational corporations, and noted blocks to  move their headquarters or regional headquarters to Shanghai.  They plan to decontrol, on a limited basis, the renminbi  business of foreign financial institutions. Under prevailing  conditions, foreign financial companies will first be allowed  issue loans to and collect deposits from foreign invested  enterprises and those state enterprises which receive  supplementary renminbi loans along with foreign loans.    Statistics show that so far Shanghai has attracted more than  $13 billion in foreign capital, and has authorized more than  6000 foreign investment projects. One hundred twenty-six world  renowned transnational corporations have invested in Shanghai  enterprises. One-third of the world's 100 largest transnational  industrial corporations have set up shop in Shanghai.</p>

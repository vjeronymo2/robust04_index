			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Probate will be needed MY HUSBAND and I have made identical wills leaving everything to each other and thence to our married daughter. The house is on a tenancy-in-common basis (50/50) to enable the surviving spouse to alter, if required, the terms of the will within two years of a testator's death by a deed of a family arrangement. Does the will have to go to probate should one of us die? Has the 'deed of variation' been abolished? We confirm that the will would have to go to probate. The deed of variation has not been abolished. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward.

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers 1.7%, Shanghai falls on profit-taking A fall in the yen and the overnight advance on Wall Street prompted a rise in the stock futures market, and the Nikkei 225 average rallied 1.7 per cent in low volume on index-linked buying by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index ended 388.78 ahead at 20,660.13 after opening at the day's low of 20,429.29 and setting a high of 20,661.93 just before the close. Buying by investment trusts and dealers also supported share prices in the afternoon. A total of 250m shares changed hands, against 179m on Monday. Small-lot buying also came from public funds, while traders said overseas investors, who have been leading sellers during the past few weeks, remained absent. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 22.78, or 1.4 per cent, at 1,652.60 and the Nikkei 300 rose 4.49 to 300.16, recovering the 300 level for the first time since July 20. Gainers led losers by 871 to 168, with 132 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.54 at 1,346.22. High-technology electricals and other exporters firmed on the rise in the dollar, while consumption-related stocks, including food manufacturers and retailers, gained ground due to the recent recovery in consumer confidence. Drug companies and stocks linked to the Aids theme were purchased ahead of the international Aids conference starting this weekend in Yokohama. Among exporters, Hitachi moved ahead Y41 to Y1,010, Toshiba Y29 to Y776, Honda Motor Y40 to Y1,750 and Sony Y150 to Y6,000. Investors were also encouraged by the prospect that July supermarket sales could rise from a year earlier due to the hot weather, for the first time in 23 months. Retailers firmed, with Daiei rising Y60 to Y1,820 and Isetan Y20 to Y2,040. Reports that Japan Telecom, a telecommunications operator, would be listed in September supported East Japan Railway, which owns a 22.7 per cent stake in the company. JR East advanced Y12,000 to Y527,000, while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y25,000 at Y862,000. Nippon Kayaku, a drugmaker, jumped Y32 to Y816. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 227.96 at 22,911.30 in volume of 60.6m shares. Roundup Profit-taking took its toll in some of the region's markets. SHANGHAI's A share index made a spirited early attempt to build on Monday's 36.1 per cent surge before profit-taking left the market 3.2 per cent down on the day. The index of shares available to local investors lost 14.28 at 433.42, sharply off its intraday high of 499.49. Volume reached a record 920m shares with turnover hitting Yn5.31bn (Dollars 617m), the second highest in history. Analysts commented, however, that the mood remained positive in the wake of Beijing's ban on all new share issues and listings this year, and an announcement yesterday that companies that had published prospectuses would not go ahead with issues. They expected the market to make further upward progress in coming days. Shandong Bohai Group, Monday's star with a 103 per cent gain, was the day's heaviest loser. It dropped 25.9 per cent to Yn4.67 on profit-taking. In Shenzhen, the A index closed 2.24, or 1.8 per cent, down at 125.80 after a day's high of 143.16. In contrast, Shanghai's B index of shares that can be bought by foreigners rose just 0.93 to 73.36 and the Shenzhen B index put on 0.08 at 100.14. HONG KONG finished higher after a day of seesaw trading within a tight range. The Hang Seng Index ended 11.35 per cent up at 9,695.03 in heavy turnover for the time of year of HKDollars 5.6bn. Some blue chips lost ground on profit-taking. Sun Hung Kai Properties shed 50 cents to HKDollars 52.25, China Light 50 cents to HKDollars 41.40 and Wharf 40 cents to HKDollars 32.50. China-based H shares made gains on the back of better than expected economic data and Monday's A share rally in China. Tsingtao Brewery rose 35 cents to HKDollars 6.80. SEOUL saw profit-taking in reaction to rising local interest rates as trading volume fell to its low for the year. The August 12 deadline to redeem part of borrowings by investment trust companies to the central bank also cast gloom on the market. The composite index dipped 5.14 to 927.55 in volume of 16.7m shares. Among recent firm performers, Posco fell Won400 to Won74,400 and Samsung Electronics lost Won1,000 at Won89,000. KUALA LUMPUR was spurred to a five-month high by institutional and retail demand and the composite index rose 18.85, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,075.19. Investors had pushed the index to a day's peak of 1,077.26 as positive corporate earnings reports rekindled interest in blue chips, before some profit-taking pulled prices back from their best levels. SYDNEY failed to build on a strong opening rise and the All Ordinaries index closed just 4.8 firmer at 2,086.9, having seen a 16-point gain early on. Turnover was ADollars 482.1m. BHP closed at a record high, up 8 cents at ADollars 19.52, but below an intraday peak of ADollars 19.70. MANILA dropped back on a bout of profit-taking following a solid rise early in the session brought on by good company results. The composite index, which had risen to an intraday high of 2,905, closed 16.81 down at 2,866.53. Turnover rose to 1.6bn pesos. Manila Electric was the biggest loser among blue chips: its B shares fell 3.4 per cent to 355 pesos. PLDT went against the trend, firming 5 pesos to 1,720 pesos. BANGKOK ended slightly lower, adjusting its support level before breaching the 1,400 psychological resistance. The SET index closed 2.26 easier at 1,399.72 after fluctuating between 1,391.06 and 1,409.40 in high turnover of Bt11.21bn. Bangchak Petroleum, which made its debut, closed at Bt48.50, against its offer price of Bt31, in turnover of Bt2.2bn. TAIPEI built on Monday's gain, with electronics stocks doing well. The weighted index was up 40.54, or 0.6 per cent, at 6,879.56, after touching 6,919.60, in turnover of TDollars 126.6bn. Institutional buying in the electronics sector, which put on nearly 3 per cent, was strong throughout the session: Tatung rose TDollars 5 to TDollars 86.5.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Observer: Career accident No one should feel too sorry for BT chairman Iain Vallance if the questioning turns a bit rough at today's annual meeting. Fate has undeniably been kind to him. He is only 49 and if he plays his cards right, and is still running Britain's biggest company a decade from now, he should have collected a knighthood if not a peerage. Things could have been different. When Vallance joined the old Post Office it was as an assistant postal controller. By contrast, one of his keenest rivals, Bill Cockburn, had started on the telecom side and joined a good five years before Vallance. Indeed, Cockburn, who is two months older than Vallance, was personal assistant to the PO chairman before Vallance held the job. Over the next few years they followed one another in similar financial jobs but some time during the 1970s Vallance moved ahead and after British Telecom split from the PO in 1981, he has never looked back. By contrast Cockburn has only just been promised the chief executive's seat at the PO. Not only is he getting paid a quarter of what Vallance gets, but he is going to have to deal with an unknown new chairman besides undergoing a break-up orientated review of his organisation. And they say the private sector is insecure.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cookson raising Pounds 45m via assets sale COOKSON GROUP, the industrial materials company which launched a Pounds 186m 1-for-4 rights issue earlier this month, is raising another Pounds 45m through the sale of a number of non-core businesses. The move is part of the management's strategy of selective disposals to refocus the group on four product divisions: electronic material, ceramics, engineered products and plastics. Cookson has sold the business, and some manufacturing assets, of its Industrial Precision Castings subsidiary to Charles Baynes. Minneapolis-based Spectrum Colours, which produces colour concentrates for plastics manufacturers, is being sold to Sandoz Chemicals. Agreement has also been reached on the sale of Cookson's 80 per cent stake in IST Laboratories, an engineering design house founded in 1987 which develops specialist integrated circuits. Finally, the group is selling its US speciality plastics compounding businesses, Monmouth Plastics and Texapol to MA Hanna. The businesses being sold had turnover of about Pounds 23m in 1992. After exceptional items, Monmouth, Texapol and Spectrum had combined operating profits of Pounds 2.3m last year, while IPC and IST incurred operating losses after exceptional items of about Pounds 4.1m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emin Pazarci from the "Outlook" column: "Look </F> Out for Nakhichevan!"]    [Text] For days now Turkey has found itself in an election  flurry, the intensity of which is bound to increase.    As the late Menderes [prime minister in the 1950's] would  have said, "we have now entered the uphill election campaign."  The struggle has already gone beyond the limits of local  elections. An atmosphere similar to a general election prevails  in the country.    We will go on talking and thinking about elections for two  more months. Turkey will redirect its attention to the home  front and again be unable to see what is happening around her.    We already lost Azerbaijan, and if things continue like this  we will also lose Nakhichevan from under our very noses.    It was not enough that we lost Azerbaijan; if things  continue  like this Azerbaijan will even start giving Turkey trouble.    There is a newspaper called "SES" in Baku. It is under the  control of President Geydar Aliyev. The paper has almost become  the press organ of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Some  days ago, it pronounced Apo [alias of PKK leader Abdullah  Ocalan] "the great Kurdish hero." Almost every day the paper  advertises Abdullah Ocalan's books.    Could such a paper ever have been published during the  Elchibey period? Of course not. Yet, we not only failed to  come to the support of Elchibey, we even backed Aliyev. During  visits to Turkey, we pressured Elchibey in order to catapult  Aliyev to the forefront. We held Aliyev in esteem. Now, the  result is here for everyone to see. Now, it is useless to be  sorry.    Now efforts are under way to hatch a series of plots in  Nakhichevan, yet, we remain blind to these developments. We  have withdrawn into ourselves so much that we have no idea of  what is going on under our very noses.    Today "an Aliyev terror" is sweeping through Nakhichevan.  The Nakhichevan Assembly has been unable to meet for the last  seven months. It is Geydar Aliyev who prevents the convocation  of the Assembly. There is a total lack of law and order in the  country; this is what Aliyev really wants. He shelved the  Constitution and is running Nakhichevan as he sees fit. Three  deputies are in jail. Most of the members of the People's Front  are under detention. The homes of most of the People's Front  members were either burned down or demolished. The place has  been turned into ruins. Many people are under detention.    More than 200 people applied to the Turkish consulate and  asked for political asylum. The Nakhichevan deputies appealed  to and asked for the help of the Turkish parliament, saying:  "Tell Geydar Aliyev to put an end to this oppression."    In short, Nakhichevan is on fire.    Aliyev's terrorism is continuing with the greatest  intensity.  As always, Turkey has again remained a spectator.    As was done in the case of Azerbaijan, there could be those  who say: "Why should we care about Nakhichevan?" They could  also argue that "Those are Nakhichevan's domestic affairs."    Yes, it is true that these are Nakhichevan's domestic  affairs, but this time around, the situation is radically  different. Nakhichevan is fast becoming a place that might cause  Turkey trouble.    Though 10,000 Kurds lived in Nakhichevan, until now there  was  no "Kurdish movement" there. No problems arose because there  were no instigators around, but now the situation has changed.  The PKK has now laid its hands upon Nakhichevan. It is trying  to sow the seeds of a "Kurdish movement."    The PKK is roaming freely in Nakhichevan. The borders are  porous. They enter and leave the place as they wish. They move  between Armenia and Nakhichevan. They enter from Iran. They  also enter Turkey whenever they like.    This is not all. The PKK even has training camps on  Nakhichevan's borders with Armenia and Iran. Hundreds of PKK  members are being trained in Nakhichevan. Geydar Aliyev's armed  units remain mere spectators.    Nakhichevan is fast becoming the center of a serious threat  to Turkey.    Is Turkey not aware of what is going on?    Of course it is, but no clear policy has been formulated on  Nakhichevan. As in the case of the policy towards Azerbaijan,  Turkey has again remained a mere spectator and has assumed a  wait-and-see attitude. As regards Nakhichevan, we will again do  what we usually do: We will be too late to act and then will be  sorry for the missed opportunity.</p>

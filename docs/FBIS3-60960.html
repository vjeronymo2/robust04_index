			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mr Sadiq al-Musawi: "Beware of Mr Hasan </F> Nasrallah's Wiles"]    [Text] If swindling people, tricking the gullible, and  being hypocritical with the people are among the conditions for  leadership in Lebanon, let us declare that Sayyid Hasan  Nasrallah has outdone the competition in those areas. How else  could a young man under the age of 37 who has not even mastered  the externals of religious subjects move ahead so swiftly?  Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, who has no social assets, has set no  precedent by formulating independent interpretations of  theological questions and has not risen to any level in his  thinking. And yet, he rose swiftly from serving as a group  official in al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party to serving as an  official in the Amal Movement. Then he became Hizballah's  mobilization officer in al-Biqa', served as commander of the  party's fighters against the Amal Movement in Iqlim al-Tuffah,  and [eventually] became the secretary general of Hizballah in  Lebanon. Nasrallah managed to move ahead of outstanding scholars  as well as leading formulators of independent theological  interpretations, masters of thought, and our predecessors in the  quest for Islam. How was he able to move ahead of all these  people so swiftly?    Let us mention the following facts to support our  allegations:    1. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, group official in al-Da'wah  Party,  managed to persuade people that he had never joined the  aforementioned party. Some people in the Islamic Republic of  Iran fell for that ploy and believed him. Sayyid Hasan thus  became the clean man whose personal and social history was  untarnished. It is worth noting that Sayyid Nasrallah's name was  cleared by key figures of al-Da'wah Party who denied his  affiliation with the party because they knew how much the young  people who were fond of Imam Khomeyni's approach, may God be  pleased with him, hated al-Da'wah Party. They hated it because  the party had made fighting Imam Khomeyni's approach its  strategic goal. That had been the party's goal ever since the  Holy Imam Khomeyni arrived in the holy city of al-Najaf  following his exile from Turkey, where he had lived after the  late Shah exiled him from Iran in 1963. By clearing Nasrallah's  name the key figures of al-Da'wah Party were able to set the  stage for Nasrallah to gain access to the decisionmaking  position. Nasrallah would gain such access after gaining the  confidence of sincere young people and after officials in the  Islamic Republic of Iran were persuaded that his background was  spotless.    2. Sayyid Hasan has held in Hizballah, ever since it was  founded, a position from which he could deal directly with the  party's elements. He became the mobilization officer in the  party, and that gave him the opportunity to present himself to  those elements as a humble person and to portray himself as  someone who empathizes with the dispossessed and their concerns.  But it was the cadres of al-Da'wah Party who had penetrated  Hizballah who took part in polishing Sayyid Hasan's image and  presenting it to these gullible youths. Consequently, a large  segment of the party's elements became fond of Sayyid Hasan  because they believed he was a humble man, indifferent to the  objects of this world, and troubled by the concerns of the  toiling classes. Some of these young people even preferred  Sayyid Nasrallah to his professors, the late Sayyid 'Abbas  al-Musawi, may God have mercy on his soul; Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli; and Shaykh Muhammad Yazbak. These were the men who  preceded Nasrallah in associating themselves with the blessed  Islamic Revolution after its victory in 1979. In this regard  suffice it to point out that after Sayyid Nasrallah received a  majority of the votes of the members of the Consultative Council  in the elections, which followed the expiration of Shaykh Subhi  al-Tufayli's term as secretary general, he yielded to the late  Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, claiming humility as his motive.  Nevertheless, he held control of the party's finances and  military matters, thereby restricting the movement of the  secretary general completely and turning himself in to the real  decision maker.    3. Sayyid Nasrallah went to Iqlim al-Tuffah to lead  Hizballah's fighters against the Amal Movement. He assumed an  ultra-extremist position, and he showed so much enthusiasm for  the fighting to continue that he refused to adhere to Ayatollah  Khomeyni's unequivocal order, banning fellow Muslims from  fighting each other. That turned him into a symbol of the  resistance in the eyes of the party's elements who had strong  feelings of hostility for the Amal Movement. In fact, Sayyid  Nasrallah even traveled to Iran after the agreement between the  party and the movement [to express] his objection to stopping  the war between fellow Muslims. But his aim in going to Iran was  to create some distance between himself and the media under the  pretext of seeking knowledge in Qom, the center of learning.  When he was in Iran, however, he tried to project the image of  someone who was in full compliance with the wishes of officials,  and he expressed his willingness to do everything that he was  asked to do. When Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, may God have mercy on  his soul, was killed by the criminal Zionists, everyone acted  quickly so that Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah could be installed  secretary general and Shaykh Na'im Qasim blocked from that  position. Shaykh Na'im Qasim, who served as deputy secretary  general during the lifetime of Sayyid 'Abbas al-Musawi, is known  for his affiliation with al-Da'wah Party. That is how Sayyid  Hasan Nasrallah, a key figure in al-Da'wah Party, got to the  position of secretary general of Hizballah. And yet, it was  generally believed that al-Da'wah Party had actually been driven  out of the primary decisionmaking position in Hizballah.    4. Sayyid Nasrallah vehemently attacked the Lebanese  Maronite  regime in his speeches, and he described it in the ugliest  terms. He got many people to think that he was sincere when he  disavowed the infidel regime, but then he would turn into an  apologist for it and rationalize joining it. When he found no  precedent in Shiite history to justify a person's public  involvement with infidel entities and oppressive governments, he  worked hard in the hope that he might get Ayatollah Khamene'i,  may God protect him, to give him legal cover. When he failed to  do that, he took one sentence from the leader's statement that  dealt strictly with internal Iranian matters, and he published  it in the center of the front page of AL-'AHD Newspaper. That  sentence had nothing to do with the outside world, and it had  nothing to do with the elections in Lebanon. Nasrallah published  that sentence to let people believe that Iranian leaders, acting  according to a fatwa [formal legal opinion] from Imam Khomeyni,  may God sanctify his secret, had pushed him to join the Lebanese  regime. Nasrallah then started making various charges against  those who hesitated to go to the polling stations or those who  did not vote for the candidates he had nominated. After bringing  the matter to a [words indistinct] doing that by blatantly  falsifying the facts right and left, Nasrallah started leaking  information through his mouthpieces, indicating that no one had  been legally commissioned by the Islamic leadership, but that  the decision to participate had been made in the so-called Shura  Council.    5. Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah wants people to forget that he  lied  to them about the parliamentary elections. He wants them to  forget that he forced Muslims to recognize the Lebanese regime  when he became a member of that regime's legislative authority.  Today, Nasrallah is venting his wrath against the government,  loudly proclaiming that, "We will not let the blood of our  martyrs be spilled in vain." According to our information,  however, he is trying hard via numerous and different channels  to get one of his followers accepted as a government minister.  This would be the price for the blood of martyrs who died in  Airport Square. This time too the rationale is reforming the  situation from within.    We are reminding sincere believers who would not consent to  abandoning the provisions of their true religion that the basis  for disavowing infidel and oppressive governments is the same as  that for prayer and fasting. We are reminding those sincere  believers that the unequivocal verses from the Koran and the  sayings which are attributed to the prophet, may God bless him  and grant him salvation, and to the sacrosanct imams, peace be  upon them, forbid dealings of any kind with non-Islamic  entities. No person, not even the most erudite scholar, can make  permissible what God Almighty and His messenger, may God bless  him and grant him salvation, forbade. Accordingly, from now on,  no true Muslim who is a member of Hizballah may obey his leaders  so he can make money or protect a position, because by doing  that, he would be obeying a creature and disobeying the Creator.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Further gains follow favourable inflation data - Market Report Better statistics than expected on domestic inflation, backed up by favourable comments from the Governor of the Bank of England, brought further gains in UK shares yesterday. The confident tone of the market was set early by the strong rise overnight on Wall Street and by an agreed bid of Pounds 478.5m from British Aerospace for VSEL, the UK nuclear submarine manufacturer. Boosted by further strength in stock index futures and government bonds, the FT-SE 100-share Index broke through 3,100 within the first hour of full trading. But the market, although busy, spent the rest of the session jousting with this level, closing a shade under the day's best at 3,100.5 for a net gain of 27.5. The UK stock market has now risen for five successive trading sessions, showing a rise of nearly 5 per cent since the middle of last week. The recovery since the beginning of the final quarter of the year has restimulated confidence that UK equities can move towards the Footsie 3,500 area before the end of December. Excellent trading results this week from leading US companies have highlighted the recovery in global economies. Some traders believed that the market was slowing down at last night's close, as Wall Street shaded off by 3 Dow points in early trading and global markets awaited the US producer price index, due today, and US industrial production and utility capacity utilisation statistics, due on Friday. 'I would expect some kind of consolidation at these levels,' said Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. 'The Footsie's close above 3,100 will be regarded as important.' The announcement of a further dip in both the headline and underlying rates of domestic retail price inflation in September, together with a steady trend in average earnings, strengthened market hopes that base rates can be left unchanged for the rest of the year, thus easing one of the principal concerns felt by investors towards UK equities. Faith in the low inflation outlook was further encouraged when Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, was reported from the US as saying that markets were exaggerating the extent of expected inflationary pressure. The market assumed that the British Aerospace bid for VSEL had been well cleared with all official parties before announcement, and could be safely regarded as a 'done deal'. A sharp gain in GEC shares indicated the stock market's belief that it was unlikely to contest the bid. However, the share price of VSEL, now effectively related to the BAe stock price, which was also strong yesterday, edged above the share exchange offer terms. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index advanced 28.4 to 3,535.3, keeping pace with the blue chip market and suggesting that interest in the second line issues might be returning. Non-Footsie business made up around 56 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 732.4m shares, a welcome improvement from the 662.3m of the previous session. The strong advance in the Footsie index was again achieved without much contribution from the leading oil issues, which have so far refused to be over-excited by the developments on the Kuwait border. Dollar stocks in general remained very firm, although the pace slackened when Wall Street opened the new session on the downside. Short term trends in London are expected to depend on the performance of the New York market over the next two sessions. The insurance sector continued to make progress and the banking and retail areas drew confidence from the calming of interest rate worries. The improved tone on Wall Street and in the UK and continental European securities markets was reflected in a gain in shares of Reuters, the global financial information group.</p>

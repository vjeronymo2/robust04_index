			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL;  </P> <P> HART HOMERS HIGHLIGHT MURRAY MILESTONE  </P> <P> The Hart High baseball team gave Coach Bud Murray an appropriate gift for his  300th career victory Tuesday, smashing three home runs in a 15-4 Foothill  League win at Schurr.  </P> <P> Hart's Robby Davis started the onslaught with a two-run shot to left in the  first inning. David Toledo also homered in the inning, a three-run blast to  left that capped a six-run rally. In the fifth, Casey Burrill hit his sixth  home run, a 400-foot, three-run shot to left.  </P> <P> Keith Halcovich (8-2) allowed one earned run, struck out two and walked two in  five innings as Hart (19-5, 10-4 in league play) defeated Schurr for the sixth  time in a row.  </P> <P> The victory gives Murray, in his third season at Hart, a 17-year record of  300-120.  </P> <P> In another Foothill game:  </P> <P> Burroughs 6, Burbank 1 -- Senior right-hander Chris Westbury threw a  four-hitter, struck out 11, walked one and allowed no earned runs at Burroughs.  </P> <P> Burroughs (14-10, 8-6) turned four walks and a single into a 4-0 lead in the  second inning.  </P> <P> GOLDEN LEAGUE  </P> <P> Saugus 12, Quartz Hill 1 -- Matt Tull was two for four with three runs batted  in and set a school record with his 13th double as Saugus clinched the league  title at Quartz Hill.  </P> <P> Roger Salkeld, J. B. Johnson and Tull all homered for Saugus (18-4-2, 12-2).  Scott Warr (6-2) struck out five and walked two in six innings.  </P> <P> Canyon 12, Palmdale 3 -- Sean Nichols and Eric Rodriguez combined for a  six-hitter and Jason Stanley had three hits and four RBIs to lead Canyon at  Palmdale.  </P> <P> Nichols (5-3) gave up three hits and struck out six in four innings to pick up  the win.

Teammates Nelson Townes, Brian  Smith and Zac Miller each had two hits.  </P> <P> ALPHA LEAGUE  </P> <P> Montclair Prep 6, Village Christian 5 -- Keyaan Cook singled in the tying and  go-ahead runs in the sixth for host Montclair Prep.  </P> <P> With two out in the sixth, Leland Sparks walked, Chad Calabria singled and Shad  Knighton was hit by a pitch to load the bases.

A decision on replacing Cot, in command of the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) since July 1, is up to the United Nations, the  officials said.    Cot is at present on leave in France for family reasons.    He was reprimanded last week by UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali for stepping out of line by urging NATO airstrikes  against Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Known for his plain-speaking, Cot made repeated calls for  special powers to carry out air strikes, whereas under a May  1993 Security Council resolution only Butrus-Ghali has  authority to call on North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air  power.    Last week the secretary-general criticised Cot for his  public  remarks and for pressuring governments so as to be able to call  in air strikes.    Butrus-Ghali has opposed air strikes for fear of reprisals  against UN peacekeepers and of disagreements in the Security  Council where Russia is opposed to any escalation of the  Yugoslav conflict.</p>

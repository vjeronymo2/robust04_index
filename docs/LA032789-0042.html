			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Scattered early returns in elections for thousands of local offices nationwide  showed losses for Turkey's governing Motherland Party and gains for the leftist  and conservative opposition. "The trend for early returns shows that we are no  longer the first party," said Oltan Sungurlu, deputy chairman of the the  Motherland Party. The election did not directly affect the government of Prime  Minister Turgut Ozal, but opponents said the voting was a referendum on his  policies. Ozal has said he may quit if voters favor the opposition. Two people  were killed and 35 injured in violence at polling places in eastern Turkey, the  Anatolia news agency reported.  </P></p>

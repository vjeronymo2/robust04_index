			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEP THE DOOR OPEN AND HOPE ALIVE;  </P> <P> CHINA: TO ENCOURAGE THE FORCES OF DEMOCRACY, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MUST KEEP  PUSHING BEIJING WHILE IGNORING CALLS FOR A RETURN TO A POLICY OF ISOLATION AND  BLOCKADE.  </P> <P> Since Richard Nixon's historic opening of the 1970s, a major change has  occurred in Chinese politics. Forces demanding economic and political reform  have arisen. Although they have suffered a temporary setback, these forces  ultimately will prevail. The United States must fashion a China policy that  acknowledges this reality.  </P> <P> Although a consensus in the United States favors these political and economic  reforms, the current debate on China policy has become mired in criticism of  the Bush Administration's dispatch of two senior officials to meet with the  leadership in Beijing. This is misdirected. The debate should concentrate on  this issue: How can the United States best assist the process of reform?  </P> <P> We call for an active China policy that seeks to retain contact with the  leaders and people of China, and offers strong moral support and fosters  contact with the democratic forces on the mainland and abroad.  </P> <P> President Bush made a mistake when, on June 20, he suspended high-level  official contacts as a sanction against Beijing's suppression of the student  movement. Rather than punishing the Chinese government, that policy constrained  the American government. It limited the President's diplomatic flexibility.  Conservative forces in China would like to see China's door shut and they have  taken measures to cut off the communication with the outside world. Bush's  suspension of high-level contacts served these people's wishes.  </P> <P> Now the Administration finds itself in an embarrassing position, having broken  its own promise while misleading Congress and the American people. Bush should  have the courage to admit publicly that his June 20 decision was a mistake and  that to correct it, he had to violate his own guidelines.  </P> <P> The Administration has made other mistakes. The deference that National  Security Adviser Brent Scowcraft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.  Eagleburger demonstrated toward China's leaders -- emphasizing personal warmth  and clinking glasses at a banquet -- was inappropriate. And their failure to  allude to the Chinese government's suppression of the democracy movement and to  refer to the world's revulsion of its deeds -- as Nixon did during his October  trip -- is regrettable. Further, the secrecy was unnecessary, risking the  bipartisanship so essential to the successful conduct of American policy on  China.  </P> <P> The fundamental issue, however, still is whether Washington should politically  isolate and economically blockade China. Here we part with the Administration's  critics. In the 1950s, the United States pursued a similar policy, hoping to  push China onto the path of freedom. Instead, it drove Beijing into the Soviet  embrace and contributed to its evolution into a Stalinist totalitarian system.  </P> <P> In 1944-45, Mao Tse-tung wanted to follow a very different domestic course. Mao  believed that cooperation with the United States would not only help him defeat  the Japanese invaders, but also allow him to compete with the despotic Chiang  Kai-shek while resisting Josef Stalin's pressures. But the American response  gave Mao little choice but to lean toward the Soviets once Washington let it be  known that it saw Chinese communism as a threat to its interests.  </P> <P> Nixon ended this fruitless policy by opening Sino-American relations in the  1970s. The Carter Administration's decision to establish full diplomatic  relations in 1979, and the economic reform program China initiated the same  year, led to the rapid proliferation of exchanges between China and the West.  These contacts have had a decisive impact on China's political and economic  reforms and have been an important condition for the growth of democratic  forces in China.  </P> <P> But the anti-reform and anti-democratic forces in China immediately saw the  implications of these exchanges. As early as 1982, they were trying to shut  China's door to the outside. On the eve of the 12th National Party Congress in  1982, some senior party officials proposed to stop sending Chinese students to  Western countries and to withdraw all those already there. (They preferred to  hire foreign scholars to teach in China.)  </P> <P> With Sino-American relations in trouble in the early years of the Reagan  Administration, these same people also proposed downgrading the level of  Sino-American relations to that of liaison office -- the level before 1979 --  as a part of the process of normalizing relations with the Soviet Union. And  they let it be known to Moscow that China would be willing to modify the three  conditions it had set for normalization if the Soviet Union would acknowledge  just one of them. However, Leonid Brezhnev refused the overture. The subsequent  success of the Sino-American negotiations over Taiwan arms sales thwarted this  attempt to change Chinese foreign policy.  </P> <P> Now the anti-reform forces have resurrected a slogan -- "fear neither isolation  nor blockade" -- to justify and conceal their real intention of resisting the  worldwide trend of democratization. If the United States repeats its policy of  the 1950s and '60s, isolating and blockading China, the outcome will be no  different. The die-hard forces in China will be the beneficiaries of the new  blockade. In a country as large as China, totalitarian rule cannot be ended  through externally imposed isolation. Sanctions only strengthen the forces of  totalitarianism. This is the unambiguous lesson of history.  </P> <P> In short, the basic objective for America's China policy should be to promote  China's further reform, openness and democratization and to break the  self-isolation favored by the conservative forces in China. This calls for a  three-pronged policy:  </P> <P>  -- Promotion of Sino-American political, commercial, educational, scientific,  artistic and cultural exchanges. In all these areas, the preference for  self-isolation of Chinese conservatives should be challenged.  </P> <P>  -- Contacts should be pursued in ways that directly or indirectly help to  eliminate the violation of human rights in China. This includes constant and  forthright American criticism, issued both in Beijing and in Washington, of any  inhumane treatment of the Chinese people.  </P> <P>  -- Washington should contact and support various democratic forces of China so  long as they adhere to the principles of peacefulness, rationality and  nonviolence as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and the  Declaration of Human Rights. A major deficiency in American policy since June 4  has been the insufficient support of Chinese democratic and reformist forces.  </P> <P> Democratization is the fundamental solution to the human-rights problem in  China. The road leading to democratization with the minimum cost is through a  compromise between the existing Chinese government and various democratic  forces. The progressive forces throughout the world should support and promote  rather than hinder the realization of this process.  </P> <P> The dramatic developments in Eastern Europe forcefully demonstrated that  democratization is an irresistible historical trend. While China differs from  Eastern Europe both historically and culturally, the democratic movements in  Eastern Europe and China nevertheless have close intellectual and popular  connections. There is no reason to believe that China is destined to always be  a totalitarian country.  </P> <P> American policy toward China can be influential. Instead of treating China as a  card to be played in partisan American politics, or resurrecting the bankrupt  policy of isolating the country, we advocate a policy that takes realistic  account of the complexity in promoting reform and progress in China.  </P></p>

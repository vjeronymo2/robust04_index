			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpt of 30 April NHAN DAN Newspaper editorial: "Vietnam </F> and Indonesia Reaffirm Common Aspiration To Strengthen  Traditional Friendly Relations and Multifaceted Cooperation"]    [Text] The official friendship visit to the Republic of  Indonesia by state President Le Duc Anh has concluded  successfully. This important event strongly enhances the  traditional ties of friendship and cooperation between the two  countries for the common prosperity of the two peoples and in  the interest of peace, stability, and cooperation of the entire  region.    High-ranking Vietnamese and Indonesian leaders happily  recalled the efficient implementation of the signed economic,  cultural, education, and science and technology agreements.  They also pointed out that there are many areas left for  further bilateral cooperation such as commerce, navigation,  aviation, tourism, finance, and agriculture.    The two sides agreed to fully exploit potentialities so as  to  bring economic and trade ties to the level of fine political  relations. They held that on the basis of their goodwill,  Vietnam and Indonesia can achieve satisfactory results in their  efforts to settle some bilateral problems left over by history.    The NHAN DAN editorial concludes: After the Malaysian visit  by General Secretary Do Muoi, this visit is new proof that  confirms our country's success in the implementation of the  policies to befriend all nations; to struggle for peace,  independence, and development; and to attach importance to the  enhancement of bilateral and multilateral friendly and  cooperation ties for mutual benefit with all countries in the  region.</p>

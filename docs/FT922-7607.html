			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Canary Wharf tenants unmoved EXISTING and prospective tenants at Canary Wharf were bemused but relatively unmoved yesterday by news of Olympia &amp; York filing for protection from creditors. An executive of one organisation which moved to the development late last year said: 'There was a certain amount of black humour between the staff this morning because we were not thrilled to come here in the first place. But I don't think it's of much direct concern.' Mr Jim Butler, senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm which is shortly to move its training centre and public sector consultancy to One Canada Square, said he was not surprised by O&amp;Y's action. 'As a firm of accountants we always thought there was a strong likelihood this would happen,' he said. 'I strongly belief Canary Wharf will go on. It's the bankers who loaned money who are in trouble.' Mr Robin Warrender, chairman of London Wall Holdings, the insurance company, said: 'Obviously any situation like this causes grave concern.' London Wall has signed a contract to take space in One Canada Square, but has not yet moved there. Mr Warrender added: 'I still believe in the Canary Wharf concept.' The International Sugar Organisation moved into One Canada Square in September on a 25-year lease at Pounds 25 per sq ft. An official said: 'We hope we'll be alright . . . Whatever happens I suppose we'll just carry on as usual.' A number of existing or prospective tenants icily refused to comment on developments, including several which are closely tied to O&amp;Y, such as Lehrer McGovern, construction consultants to the group. Mr Roger Colomb, a managing director at Texaco, which is moving 1,000 staff to Westferry Circus in August, said the company was watching developments carefully, but had not changed its plans. 'Docklands is still developing along the lines that everybody thought it would, although the time scale is slightly different,' he said. 'Certain things haven't happened as quickly as one might have expected if we had been in a boom, boom, boom period, but I still believe they will happen.' A construction company project manager summed up O&amp;Y's problems as 'a classic Catch-22 situation'. He added: 'They need to attract people down here so that they can earn money, but because they've been in the press they can't attract people down here.' Marks and Spencer said it still planned to open a 12,000 sq ft food store in the area. It saw Canary Wharf as 'a business opportunity to be captured'.</p>

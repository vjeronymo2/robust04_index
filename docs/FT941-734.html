			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Challenge to cables is given go-ahead Families with young children yesterday won permission to launch an urgent High Court challenge over the laying of underground electricity cables. The parents, in north-east London, fear the cables could increase the risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers because of the anticipated dangerous strength of the electromagnetic fields. Three children - a young boy and two girls - acting through their fathers, accused Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, of failing properly to regulate the installation of cables to reinforce the north London electricity grid. Mr Graham Read, appearing for the families, said evidence showed that leukaemia and other cancers in children might be linked with strong electromagnetic fields. Mr Justice Schiemann found there was an arguable case and indicated it should be heard quickly. The cables are due to become 'live' this summer. At the full hearing, the parents will seek orders obliging Mr Heseltine to fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct that the electromagnetic fields from the cables do not exceed safe levels. Mr Heseltine was not represented in court yesterday. National Grid plans to install six 275,000 volt electricity cables for six miles in South Woodford, Walthamstow and Chingford.</p>

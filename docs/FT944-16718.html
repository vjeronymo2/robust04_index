			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Management: High cost of feeling down / A look at depression in the office and how to spot it - Health Check Depression can strike anyone, from office cleaner to chief executive. In various degrees, it affects up to 60 per cent of adults at some time in their lives, and at least 50 per cent of these will suffer serious depressive illness. In the UK, the cost to industry of depression - let alone other mental illness - is estimated to be more than Pounds 3bn a year. Most of us know roughly what is meant by depression, but recognising it in others is more difficult. Symptoms of depression can be surprisingly physical, with complaints of headache, aches and pains, lack of energy, insomnia or early-morning wakening, changes in appetite, weight loss (or sometimes gain), constipation, dizziness and loss of libido. All these can be caused by physical illness, and a recent study shows that GPs miss the diagnosis in about 50 per cent of depressed patients at the first consultation. There can, however, be important clues to depression in attitude or mood in the workplace. Depressed colleagues may show less interest in work, have difficulty coping with their usual workload, or become more irritable with others. They may have trouble making decisions, or blame themselves unnecessarily when things go wrong. Depression can be disabling socially too, and anhedonia - inability to experience pleasure - is significant. Perhaps someone in your department has not laughed for a long time or seems unable to relax. There is evidence that depression is partly a biochemical accident. But we are still far from regarding mental illness in the same light as we do diabetes. A MORI survey commissioned last year by the Defeat Depression Campaign suggested that half the population believe depression is not the sort of thing to see the GP about. And many depressed people, including doctors, fear the effect the diagnosis could have on their career. Treatment, however, is what they need. With a few exceptions, depression does not get better on its own or with exhortations to pull oneself together. Treatment falls into two main categories: drug therapy and non-drug therapy. Many favour the former, but there is a drop-out rate of about 30 per cent, which reflects the incidence of side-effects such as dry mouth (newer drugs tend to have fewer), as well as public misconception that antidepressants are addictive. Non-drug treatments are becoming more popular, incuding counselling and cognitive therapy, which is psychological treatment aimed at altering negative patterns of thought leading to depression. Psychological techniques are time-consuming, at least to begin with, and may demand regular time off work. Their exact place in the treatment of depression is uncertain, but they often work best in conjunction with drugs. Untreated, depression can be fatal. In the UK, 5,000 people die through suicide every year. Of these deaths, most are associated with depression, and the toll seems to be rising among men aged between 16 and 30. The government has a target of reducing the overall suicide rate by at least 15 per cent by the year 2000. But the extent to which treatment for depression can influence the suicide rate is uncertain. Some authorities believe treatment is itself a risk factor, particularly with the older types of antidepressants. It is commonly agreed, however, that better diagnosis and management of depression would be an appropriate and cost-effective aim. A leaflet, Depression in the Workplace, is available for 40p from the Defeat Depression Campaign, Royal College of Psychiatrists, 17 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8PG (tel 071 235 2351). * Dr Cooper is a practising GP.</p>

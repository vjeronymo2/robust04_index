			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Racal active again THE MARKET was alive with rumours that a stakebuilder could have been at work in Racal Electronics after a series of exceptionally large lines of Racal stock - including a single block of 6m - traded via the Seaq electronic system. At the close of trading 35m Racal shares had changed hands, way above normal levels of activity. But dealers pointed out that turnover in Racal throughout the week had consistently topped levels regarded as usual in the stock. Yesterday's heavy volume followed 5.7m traded on Monday, 31m on Tuesday, 9.6m on Wednesday and 9m on Thursday, giving an aggregate turnover of just over 90m shares, representing some 10 per cent of Racal's equity. Racal shares settled a shade firmer at 51p. It was said that much of the activity had been generated by a spate of buy recommendations on the stock, principally from County NatWest and James Capel. Nevertheless suspicions remained that a big buyer had been operating in the market, mopping up any stock that came on offer. Williams Holdings retains a 10 per cent stake in Racal, acquired during its unsuccessful bid late last year. Tomkins, said to have been the anonymous bidder offering Pounds 450m for Racal's Chubb division last year, was put forward as a potential predator for the whole group. Tomkins is thought to be anxious to expand, particularly in the security business. Specialists said a stakebuilding exercise, followed by the purchase of Williams' stake, would be a perfect platform to launch a bid for Racal. Steel bought deal British Steel was the second heaviest traded stock in the market with business substantially boosted by a bought deal in the stock carried out by Smith New Court, the securities house. Smith confirmed it had bought a block of around 10m British Steel shares and quickly placed the stock with a number of institutions. The broker declined to reveal details of the trade but the Seaq delayed ticker later revealed that a block of 9.5m British Steel traded at 70p followed, quickly by a block of 1m shares at 71 1/2 p and a block of 9m shares at 71 1/2 p. Sun Alliance down Sun Alliance was the biggest loser in a composite insurance sector suffering from the effects of a further round of forecast loss increases, this time instigated by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Mr Stephen Dias, composite insurance specialist at Goldmans, acknowledged he had sharply increased his estimates of losses at Sun Alliance and at Royal Insurance. Mr Dias said results from the composites, due to commence at the end of this month, 'will be worse than the market expects; we don't like the sector.' He said that damage caused by the recession 'is carrying on into 1992.' He also increased his estimate of Sun Alliance's losses for 1991 from Pounds 437m to Pounds 470m and his estimate of Royal Insurance's losses from Pounds 285m to Pounds 320m. The composite insurers season commences February 26. Sun Alliance shares dropped 10 to 286p on turnover of 2.4m. Royal Insurance dipped 4 to 286p on turnover of 366,000. Bass, the biggest UK brewer, fell 15 to 520p in hefty trading of 6.2 million shares, on news that the company is suing Promus, the Memphis-based company, regarding the terms under which it acquired the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotel chains in 1990. A positive note from Smith New Court lifted Wellcome, the shares rising 6 to 1120p in muted trading. The recommendation focused on Wellcome's long-term prospects, the house being particuarly keen on Wellcome's focus on anti-viral drugs which inspire a bullish outlook for earnings. BP, still buffeted by worries about the dividend cover and a boardroom rift  -although this latter story has been vehemently denied all week, slipped 4 more to 239p; turnover was a thin 3.3m shares. Other oil shares mirrored the market's concern that lines of stock in other oil stocks may be unloaded in the short term. Enterprise, for example, retreated 9 to 426p on turnover approaching 1m. Standard Chartered continued to respond to the recent vague takeover stories, edging up 4 more to 424p, while Midland, also viewed as a potential takeover target, improved the same amount to 234p, albeit in thin trading. Dowty Group eased four to 121p on suggestions the market that Cazenove, the company's brokers, had turned cautious on the stock. The volume was 2.2m. Vickers bounced 3 to 169 3/8 and continued to circulate that dividend worries triggered by Smith New Court downgrading on Thursday, had been overdone . Turnover in Smiths Industries rose to 2.8 , after a large seller appeared leading the shares falling 4 to 275p. Press reports from the Netherlands suggesting that corporation talks between British Airways and KLM, had been delayed by a lack of agreement on BA's financial injection to North West Airlines of the US sent the shares retreating 9 to 221p. Turnover reached 5.9m. BA reports third quarter results on Tuesday and the range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. The prospects of a settlement with its builders helped Eurotunnel harden 10 to 465p. Tomkins eased another 2 to 433p with talks still circulating that the company would soon make an offer for Racal. BTR edged 1p forward to 409 3/8 after Smith New Court found a buyer for a block of 1.6m shares at 407p. Total volume reached 5.6m. A pessimistic assessment of the brewing sector by County NatWest was another factor depressing Bass, apart from news of the company's US law suit. County suggested that Bass and Whitbread are likely to under-perform the sector in the long term, because both are particularly vulnerable to pressure on profit margins when the economy emerges from recession. Whitbread 'A' lost 5 to 448p. On the other hand Grand Metropolitan rose 7 to 919p, recouping some of the week's loss, on receding fears about static pension fund surpluses. Among food retailers Kwik Save fell another 17 to 577p as UBS Phillips and Drew cut its profit forecast to Pounds 108m from Pounds 118m for the current financial year, the lowest figure suggested so far. Kleinwort Benson reduced its profit forecast for the company to Pounds 115m from Pounds 120m and continued to strongly recommend selling the shares. Great Universal continued to disappoint after an acrimonious presentation given for the group by Warburg Securities on Thursday. GUS 'A' fell 9 to 1421p, shrugging off an earlier buy recommendation from company broker Cazenove. After a good run, SmithKline Beecham slipped back, as some buyers took profits and a weak dollar combined to undermine the price. However, Credit Lyonnais Laing is recommending a buy on the drugs group. The shares dropped 8 to 953p. Selling sentiment in the US knocked Glaxo, which fell 13 to 816p. Talk of a Nomura downgrade on ICI left the chemicals group off 20 at 1253p, although the house denied the story. News of Forte plans for raising finance knocked the shares in brisk volume of 2.1m. The shares lost 4 to 219p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (52).

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bellwinch continues recovery with Pounds 0.27m Bellwinch, the home counties house-builder, continued its recovery in the six months to December 31, making pre-tax profits of Pounds 274,000 compared with losses of Pounds 97,000. The share price, in spite of the improvement, slipped 3p to 55p. Turnover, excluding discontinued operations, rose from Pounds 5.44m to Pounds 8.53m. Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p, compared with losses of 0.6p. The company said it sold 89 homes in the half year, a 48 per cent rise. The increase in sales was partly because it was also selling from more development sites. The underlying increase in volume was between a fifth and a quarter, the company said. Average prices had risen from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 82,000 because of a change in sales mix. Margins had improved as the group had begun to use up land acquired more expensively during the late 1980s. The company said it expected to sell nearly 200 (184) homes during the full year. Sales were expected to rise to more than 300 during 1994-95 as the group took advantage of its increased land buying. The number of plots under control with planning permission had risen from 250 to more than 600. Net borrowings stand at Pounds 1.5m compared with shareholders' funds approaching Pounds 11m. Gearing of 4.8 per cent (66.4 per cent) would have been substantially higher but for a Pounds 6.5m share placing last summer.</p>

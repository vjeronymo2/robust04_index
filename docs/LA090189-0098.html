			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS-SALARY BALLOT MEASURE CLEARS SENATE  </P> <P> The Senate unanimously passed wide-ranging ethics legislation Thursday that  would let voters decide whether to ban honorariums and limit gifts for  lawmakers, while setting the stage for a legislative pay raise.  </P> <P> The proposed constitutional amendment, the centerpiece of the Senate's proposal  to upgrade the ethics of the Legislature, would limit legislators' outside  income, toughen conflict-of-interest rules and restrict lobbying by former top  officials.  </P> <P> At the same time, the measure would offer legislators the hope of a substantial  pay raise by setting up a commission to review whether their $40,816 annual  salary and $88-a-day expense allowance amount to adequate compensation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under a Cloud  </P> <P> "We in the Senate are serious about passing major ethics reform," said Senate  President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), the author of the  legislation. "There is a cloud right now hanging over our operations and it is  incumbent upon every one of us to do everything we can to try to remove that  cloud."  </P> <P> The Legislature's image has been seriously eroded during the last year -- in  part because of an ongoing FBI investigation into political corruption. So far,  one legislator has been indicted -- Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) on  extortion and racketeering charges. Montoya joined his colleagues in voting for  Roberti's measure.  </P> <P> The constitutional amendment, approved on a vote of 35 to 0, would be placed  before the voters in June, 1990. It now goes to the Assembly, where legislators  are attempting to reach agreement on their own package of ethics proposals that  in some respects is tougher than the Senate version.  </P> <P> Leaders of both the Assembly and Senate have expressed optimism that the two  houses can agree on a plan and adopt some form of ethics legislation before  Sept. 15, when the Legislature adjourns for the year.  </P> <P> If approved by the Legislature and the voters, Roberti's proposed  constitutional amendment would:  </P> <P> Ban all honorariums for legislators and other elected state officials.  </P> <P> Limit gifts to $250 from a single source per year, with exceptions for gifts  from family members and friends.  </P> <P> Prohibit elected state officials from receiving income from a lobbyist or an  interest group that employs a lobbyist.  </P> <P> Enact separate legislation prohibiting former legislators from lobbying the  Legislature for 12 months after leaving office and prohibiting former top  executive branch officials from lobbying their former agencies for the same  period.  </P> <P> Roberti moved Thursday to strengthen his proposal by requiring that the  Legislature put teeth into its lax conflict-of-interest laws. Under current  law, legislators are prohibited from voting on measures that affect their own  financial interests, but there is no penalty for violations. Roberti's  amendment brings his proposal more in line with the Assembly plan.  </P> <P> In another area, he softened the measure with an amendment removing a limit on  the amount of money legislators could earn in outside income. Under his  original proposal, legislators would have been prohibited from receiving  outside income totaling more than 30% of their salary.  </P> <P> The Senate leader also said he will amend his proposal to prohibit closed-door  meetings of legislative bodies, except for discussions of personnel matters,  security matters or pending litigation. Private meetings of the Democratic and  Republican caucuses of each house also would be permitted.  </P> <P> "We think this legislation, while not perfect, moves a great deal forward in  trying to address many of the issues that the public perceives -- in most cases  quite correctly -- as ethical questions," Roberti told his colleagues.  </P> <P> But it remains to be seen whether the voters care enough about questions of  legislative ethics to pass a constitutional amendment that is likely to give  legislators a hefty pay raise.  </P> <P> Backers of the plan argue that legislators have come to depend on honorariums  and other outside income because they do not receive enough in salary and  expense allowances to maintain residences in both the capital and their  districts. Some legislators say their salary should be more in keeping with  that of Superior Court judges, who receive $84,765 a year.  </P> <P> Roberti contended that it would be a "reform" to remove the Legislature's power  to set its own salary and put it in the hands of an outside commission  appointed by the governor.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 1 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  informally decided on members of an advisory panel to be set up  for revising "the National Defense Program Outline." As an  advisory council directly under the prime minister, the panel  will consist of nine members, including former administrative  officials, business leaders, and experienced scholars. Asahi  Breweries Corp. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi is expected to chair  the panel. The decision on panel members will be officially  made following the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget; and  then, the panel will be inaugurated as early as late February  with its administrative office at the Cabinet Security Affairs  Office. Regarding Japan's defense strategy in this post-Cold  War era, the panel is expected to work out a report which will  become the framework for the new "Outline" before guidelines for  the fiscal 1995 estimate budget requests are decided in August.    In responding to a strong request from business circles,  Hosokawa finally agreed to appointing Higuchi as chairman.  Moreover, what is noteworthy in this informal list is Makoto  Sakuma, former Joint Staff Council chairman and current adviser  to the Defense Agency [DA]. The DA recommended Sakuma and he  will be the first former Self-Defense Force [SDF] senior  official to participate in the panel.    It was decided in September 1993, shortly after the  coalition  government came into power, that the panel on revising defense  policy should be set up. The DA, which first proposed the need  for such a panel, has worked out a list of candidates and the  prime minister has informally agreed to this list. However,  Hosokawa will call DA Director General Kazuo Aichi and DA  Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama to his official  residence for final coordination. Thus, depending on the  results of the coordination, the decision on the list may remain  in a state of fluidity.    What is noteworthy is the fact that experts specializing in  defense issues, except former DA and SDF officials, have been  deliberately excluded from the list. It is said that panel  members are selected on the basis that they are "intellectuals  capable of discussing wide-ranged defense issues from an  international viewpoint," (as stated by a DA source). However,  judging from the selection list, panel discussions will  certainly become DA-oriented.    In addition to Higuchi and Sakuma, others who have been  informally selected as panel members are: (names listed in the  order of the kana syllabary) Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador  to the United States and current Keidanren [the Japan Federation  of Economic Organizations] adviser; Toyoo Gyoten, former deputy  vice minister for financial affairs and current Tokyo Bank  governor; Hiroshi Saito, Keidanren vice chairman and chairman of  Nippon Steel Ltd.; Seiki Nishihiro, former DA administrative  vice minister; Shinji Fukukawa, vice chairman of Kobe Steel  Corp. and former administrative vice minister of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry; Ken Moroi, vice president of  the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations and chairman of  Chichibu Cement Corp.; and Akio Watanabe, professor of Aoyama  Gakuin University and formerly professor of Tokyo University.</p>

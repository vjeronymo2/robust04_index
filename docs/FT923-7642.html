			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Leading Article: A two-horse race in the US IF PRESIDENT George Bush hopes to be re-elected on November 3 he had better make a good speech on Thursday. He will be addressing fellow-Republicans at their convention in Houston, but he will also be watched by most of the American electorate and much of the world outside the United States. He needs to give a convincing answer to a single question - is there a reason why he should be returned to the White House for a second term? Mr Bush was at his best during the Gulf war, but that is long over and President Saddam Hussein is still in charge of Iraq. He has sent a great many bills to Congress - on health, education, energy and other important matters - but he has not been able to persuade the American people of the value of his plans. This may now change. Last week the president confirmed that his old friend, Mr James Baker, would resign as secretary of state and come to the White House as chief of staff. Mr Baker's particular strengths lie in the assembling of deals, and the presentation of the resulting packages as coherent and practical expressions of a logical strategy. Over the past four years he has deployed these skills to great advantage in the Middle East and elsewhere. His task now is to apply the same energy to domestic policy. The first intimations of how he proposes to proceed should appear in Mr Bush's acceptance speech in Houston. Full attention Mr Baker's task may be too much for even him to complete with success. As he leaves for the White House he is taking his entire inner circle of state department advisers and associates with him. It is likely that he will try to run foreign policy with one hand while seeking the re-election of Mr Bush with the other. Unfortunately, both jobs need the full attention of the individual in charge. In the way of these things the probable outcome is that the election campaign will quickly come to demand all of Mr Baker's time, and then some. Only events of domestic electoral significance - such as, say, a fresh provocation by Mr Saddam - will trigger an adequate American response. The rest of the world may have to wait until November 4, if Mr Bush gets back, or January, if, as the polls suggest, Mr Bill Clinton becomes president. This is in part the consequence of a natural US preoccupation with its own internal problems, and in part a reflection of the uncertainty that is felt by foreign policy professionals since the collapse of the Soviet empire. Four years ago such matters were quite simply stated. The Republicans stood as the party of strong defence and staunch anti-communism, the Democrats were damned as unreliable. Now nobody is sure. As Dean Acheson might have said, America has lost an enemy, and has yet to find a role. Positive attributes Yet it is too soon to write Mr Bush off. Mr Clinton leads the president by around 20 points in most recent opinion polls, but the general expectation is that this advantage will slip away quite quickly, especially if this week's convention is a success. Mr Baker can be expected to bring some professionalism and discipline to the Bush campaign team. He should be able to insist on a strategy of projecting two or three positive attributes of the Republican candidate ('Leadership,' and 'trustworthiness' among them) while hammering home the message that Mr Clinton's expenditure plans cannot be put into effect without substantially higher taxation. His difficulty is the recession. It did not exist when Mr Baker helped Mr Bush win in 1988. In that year the president came from behind and trounced Mr Michael Dukakis. A midsummer Democratic lead of 17 points quickly melted away. The US mood was, however, different then. Some of the afterglow of President Reagan's years still existed, to the advantage of Mr Bush. There was not quite so much disenchantment with politicians in general and none with Mr Bush in particular. The candidates are also different. Mr Dukakis was not a first-rate campaigner; so far the strategies adopted by Mr Clinton have been highly successful. The contrast in the contenders for the vice-presidency has been widely noted. In short, Mr Baker may be a great help to Mr Bush, but even if he is, this looks like being a two-horse race, right down to the wire.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL RULES THAT ADULT BOOKSTORE IS BEYOND REACH OF DISTANCE LAW  </P> <P> A Van Nuys adult bookstore, which had been ordered to close because it violated  a Los Angeles ordinance prohibiting such shops within 500 feet of homes, is  instead open for business -- thanks to a change in city measurement policy.  </P> <P> In a unique case, city zoning officials decided that Adult World bookstore in  the 6400 block of Van Nuys Boulevard could remain open because there is enough  space -- 510 feet -- between it and a four-unit apartment complex across a  parking lot. A previous city measurement had showed the distance to be 429  feet.  </P> <P> The Dec. 13 decision has angered representatives of the Van Nuys Homeowners  Assn. They vowed to find a way to change the ruling, although the city  attorney's office said such decisions by the Board of Zoning Appeals are final  and cannot be appealed.  </P> <P> "We will be looking for any way to bring this issue out again," said Don  Shultz, a member of the association's board of directors. "We feel the city  should have ruled in a conservative manner on this case. The community does not  benefit from this type of business."  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the Van Nuys area, is looking into the  decision to determine whether he should introduce an amendment to the city law  clarifying how measurements should be taken, said Renee Weitzer, his land-use  aide.  </P> <P> Buddy Green, owner of Adult World, and his attorney, Roger J. Diamond,  convinced the zoning board that the back wall of the building, which is 510  feet from the apartments, should be used as the marker.  </P> <P> City inspectors had measured the distance from Adult World's property line,  which is 429 feet away. Based on that measurement, the city ordered Green to  close his 4 1/2-year-old business. Green and Diamond appealed the order based  on an ambiguity in the city ordinance that does not state what the points of  measurement between a residence and an adult business must be.  </P> <P> City inspectors had been measuring from the lot line of businesses to the lot  line of homes, said James Carney, chief building inspector. As a result of the  decision, he said, inspectors will now measure from the walls of businesses.  </P> <P> However, that decision will not affect six other city cases in which the owners  of adult entertainment businesses are appealing orders to close because of  their proximity to homes, schools or parks, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm not aware of any cases that are this close," Carney said, referring to the  distance between Adult World and the apartments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Matter of Interpretation  </P> <P> Nikolas Patsaouras, chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals, said the panel  interpreted the 1986 city ordinance to mean that the measurement, in the Adult  World case, should be taken from the building and not the lot line.  </P> <P> "The code says 500 feet away from the establishment," Patsaouras said. "It  doesn't make sense" to measure from the property line because the Adult World  parking lot buffers it from the apartments.  </P> <P> "We did not try to rule on the morality of this," Patsaouras said. "You and I  may be opposed to these kinds of things, but the board considers land-use  matters, not moral matters."  </P> <P> None of the tenants of the apartment complex, along the 6400 block of Sylvan  Street, protested the proximity of Adult World. From their porches, it is  difficult to read Adult World's back-lot sign. One woman said she was not  bothered by the shop and wasn't aware that the apartments were involved in the  dispute.  </P> <P> Green, a member of the Van Nuys Chamber of Commerce, said that he "wants to be  a good neighbor" and will tone down the sign in front of his building by  removing the "XXX" letters and changing "25 cent movie arcade" to "25 cent  movie."  </P> <P> "I run my store like a normal everyday business," Green said. "We are not out  to wave any red flags. We want to cooperate with our neighbors."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai Red Cross Society's AID Programme Director  denied yesterday he had violated the National HIV/AID, Vaccine  Development Plan and planned to continue with vaccine trials on  Thai volunteers.    Dr Praphan Phanuphak said he would give the volunteers a  second dose of the vaccine on July 7.    The first dose was administered to 3 volunteers in the  country's first ever vaccine trial on June 6.    Dr Praphan said the blood from a third of the volunteers was  sent to Chulalongkon University's Medical Department for  testing, a third to United Biomedical Incorporation of the  United States -- the vaccine producer -- for testing, and a  third was being stored at an independent laboratory ready for  dispatch to research places which request it.    "I was one of the members who drafted the National HIV/AIDS  Vaccine Development Plan. Why should I violate the plan?" he  asked.    There were reports last week Dr Praphan had violated the  plan  by not setting up a laboratory as part of the programme to test  the volunteers.    The doctor said reports of HIV infection among seven  volunteers undergoing a similar programme in the United States  should serve as a warning to Thai volunteers that no vaccine has  yet been able to prevent the infection of the disease.    Of the 30 volunteers here, 24 have been given the actual  vaccine while the other six have received a placebo in the form  of glucose and water.    Dr Praphan said he had explained the vaccine to the  volunteers and had warned them to be careful.    The World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS  Research and Intervention Development director Peter Piot, said  WHO was very disappointed with the decision by the United States  not to assess whether vaccines tested at the first and second  phase were effective or not.    "There is an urgent need in the world to have a vaccine and  we will continue the trial programmes throughout the world,  including those being conducted in Thailand, Brazil and Uganda."    Dr Praphan said the decision by the US to postpone the third  phase of the vaccine trials would not affect his own tests.    He said the programme required about $20 million in  financial  support from the Government so the US had decided to observe the  results of vaccine trials in other countries before going ahead  with its third phase.</p>

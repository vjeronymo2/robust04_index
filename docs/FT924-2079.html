			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Owners driven up the wall One year on, Barry Staples, managing director of Staples Group, is still furious about the visits he had from officials from the Health and Safety Executive. The first suggested that he paint the bare breeze blocks which made up the factory wall. More seriously, she noticed unguarded machinery which needed to be protected. She then asked for a chance to talk to the workforce. Staples says he did not sit in on the meeting in the canteen but staff came out apparently fearful that the factory might be closed down. As the official was leaving she told Staples he was lucky that she was not marching him off to magistrates' court. Incensed by what he felt was heavy-handed treatment Staples contacted his MP and also asked for a meeting with a more senior health and safety official. Far from improving matters, this visit enraged Staples further. A request for more advice on complying with the rules, Staples recalls, met with the response that the official's job was to ensure that the law was obeyed by prosecution and not by advice. Staples says he took immediate action to guard the machinery but, less impressed with the need to paint the factory wall, he delayed the work until the next factory shutdown. These visits left him, he says, with some sympathy for companies which avoided the mass of regulation surrounding business by sub-contracting out their manufacturing to low-cost countries. Ironically, Staples had only recently moved into manufacture. For the first 100 years of its existence it was a distribution and marketing company, supplying the clothing industry with a range of accessories including zips, elastics, labels and cutting room supplies. Six years ago the Huddersfield-based company started manufacturing, buying a company making shoulder pads and establishing its own paper converting operation to produce the specialist papers required by the clothing industry. This shift of emphasis - manufacture now accounts for 60 per cent of turnover - brought the company into contact with a new set of regulations. 'You have to become an instant expert,' says Staples who, with his brother, Robert, is the fourth generation of his family to run the business. 'It is impossible for a company to be run legally. I have to know every UK regulation and European Community directive related to manufacturing otherwise I am guilty. You hear of companies giving up manufacturing because of the hassle.' If it were only a question of dealing with the health and safety rules the problem might not be so bad. But the complaint of Staples and many other businessmen is that while individual pieces of legislation might be manageable they have to deal with a welter of different regulations. Staples is currently writing a new software programme to handle the changes to the VAT regulations which take effect on January 1 when the European single market comes into being. He is 60 per cent through the writing of his software programme but says the new system make life difficult for business. He is unable to fill in Customs' Intrastat form, detailing his imports and exports, by pen but must type it in. He cannot use a standard computer print-out but must put the data into a special format. 'It suits them but it doesn't suit business,' comments Staples. 'This is just one of the hundreds of things that we have to get right. 'I work an 18-hour day and I have not had a completely free weekend for over a year. The effort is colossal and it is totally non-productive.' The administrative demands placed on a company with just two directors, one general manager and a workforce of 60 people are completely unreasonable, Staples believes. 'We are still ahead of the game but I am having to leave it to my brother to run the business. When it comes to meeting regulations you can never argue that you cannot afford it.' The Health and Safety Executive said that regulations requiring factory walls to be kept clean by being painted or whitewashed dated back to the Factories Act of 1961. Safety and conditions in factories and offices are governed by three separate pieces of legislation, aspects of which are being superseded by new European Community-inspired regulations which take effect next month. Inspectors provide advice where possible but sometimes encounter business owners who are either not interested in safety issues or are adversarial.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: REAGAN'S SCRIPT HAS SOME HOLES IN IT  </P> <P> It used to be that this nation's heroes said things like, "I only regret that I  have but one life to lose for my country," or "We have just begun to fight," or  "Give me liberty or give me death," or "Remember the Maine."  </P> <P> Nowadays all our heroes can come up with is, "I don't remember."  </P> <P> Here, purportedly, are the video outtakes of the recent deposition of Ronald  Reagan, which were given for the Adm. Poindexter trial.  </P> <P> "Mr. President, could you please tell us exactly what you knew and when you  knew it with regard to the Iran-Contra affair?"  </P> <P> "I . . . I . . . I don't remember knowing anything about the Iran-Contra thing.  This is the first I've heard of it."  </P> <P> "Well, let me try your memory on something else. Do you recall working for  Warner Brothers as an actor before you went into politics?"  </P> <P> "Of course. I came from Radio Station WHO in Des Moines, where I was a  sportscaster, and I covered the Northwestern football games. Northwestern beat  Michigan 24 to 12 when Myron Hoffsteder fumbled on the 3-yard line. After that,  I went to Southern California with the Chicago Cubs for spring training and did  a screen test for Bill Meiklejohn at Warner Brothers. Luckily, I was hired  because the cab fare came to $10.33."  </P> <P> "OK, Mr. President, can we get back to the illegal sale of arms to Iran and the  laundering of money for the Nicaraguan rebels?"  </P> <P> "That was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about that. A President  can't remember everything he did."  </P> <P> "But you do recall 'Knute Rockne -- All-American.' "  </P> <P> "It was my favorite movie. I remember going to the commissary one day with Pat  O'Brien. It was 1:20 p.m. and Pat had a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich on  toasted rye and a glass of buttermilk, and I had a cream cheese and smoked  salmon on pumpernickel, with a bag of potato chips and iced tea. We sat at this  back table against the wall that had a picture of Bette Davis and Humphrey  Bogart. She was in a domino print dress and he wore a striped suit with no tie.  Pat said to me, 'Don't you love the movie business?' "  </P> <P> "Mr. President, did you know that Lt. Col. North was going to lie to Congress?"  </P> <P> "How could I know that when I didn't know anything. North, South, East, West --  when you've seen one National Security aide you've seen them all."  </P> <P> "Then you maintain that you don't know who Col. North was?"  </P> <P> "I can't recall the gentleman -- I tried not to remember names when I was in  the White House."  </P> <P> "Can you remember 'Bedtime for Bonzo?' "  </P> <P> "Who can forget 'Bedtime for Bonzo?' I didn't like the chimp very much because  he used to bite me on the knuckles, and he tried to steal the picture from me.  He smelled a lot and only ate green bananas, which, in those days, cost 8 cents  each. I used to buy them for him at the Fairfax Farmers Market -- bananas were  always in Row D, Aisle 6."  </P> <P> "You seem to have a good memory, Mr. President, except for the Iran-Contra  affair."  </P> <P> "I'm wracking my brain to help you, but it's all a blank. I'm sure Iran had  something to do with something, but I don't know what."  </P> <P> "Maybe you lost your memory when you were informed that you had violated the  law."  </P> <P> "Right. That's why I'm calling my new book: 'Where Is the Rest of Me?' "  </P></p>

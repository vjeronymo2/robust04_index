			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RENT-CONTROL ISSUE  </P> <P> The City Council tonight will consider a rent-control measure that would reduce  rents at Anaheim mobile home parks to 1988 levels and limit future increases.  </P> <P> Rent control advocates have collected more than 22,000 signatures in support of  placing the measure before voters.  </P> <P> A similar 1987 measure never made it to the ballot because the city attorney  decided the wording of the petitions was improper.  </P> <P> The new measure would limit annual increases in mobile home rents to 75% of the  increase in the consumer price index, an annual assessment by the federal  government of increases in the cost of living. Under the measure, a monthly  rent of $350 could increase no more than $10.50 in a year in which the cost of  living went up 4%.  </P> <P> The council has three options: immediately approve the measure, place it before  voters in a special election, or study the issue further. According to the city  clerk, a special election would cost the city between $100,000 and $150,000.  </P> <P> Proponents of the plan say rents are being increased unfairly, gouging longtime  residents, especially senior citizens on fixed incomes. They say the rent  increases prevent mobile home owners from selling their homes because potential  buyers will not pay such high rents.  </P> <P> Park owners, however, say increases are warranted because park property is  increasing in value and the cost of living continues to rise.LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

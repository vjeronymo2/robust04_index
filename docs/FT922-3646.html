			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Delors: exposed but likely to last - EC states, are unlikely to risk making him a scapegoat MR Jacques Delors, the mercurial president of the European Commission, is arguably the man most exposed by the crisis brought upon the European Community by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. Yet he is probably at the same time unassailable. At their Lisbon summit in two-weeks' time, the EC's 12 heads of government will decide whether to reappoint him for 1993-95. Quite apart from his considerable record, there are two imperative reasons why the member states will probably stick with Mr Delors: There is no obvious replacement who would get the nod now from the 12 as a whole at a moment when they need to demonstrate that they are indeed a whole. Many community governments would risk undermining their European policy even more were they to dramatise the treaty crisis by trying to make a scapegoat of Mr Delors. Inside Denmark, and across the EC, the two most common misgivings about Maastricht seem to be: That it goes too far towards supranational government, And, in equal or greater measure, that it does not go far enough towards European integration, particularly because it leaks away national sovereignty without putting in place adequate mechanisms to hold to account the 12's acting together, let alone the Commission. Sacking Delors would risk putting the collective finger on both problems at once. There is also no evidence to suggest Mr Delors has lost the confidence of EC leaders. For most of them, he serves simultaneously as lightning rod for Euro-sceptics and as a bank of ideas and generator of momentum on Europe's future (upon which, nevertheless, only the 12 can decide). Moreover, and pace the prevalent sub-Napoleonic caricatures of him, Mr Delors is increasingly a restraint on Euro-meddling in national affairs. He finishes his second four-year term at the end of this year. What he will probably be offered in Lisbon is an extension until 1995. Then, a new commission would be appointed, probably for five years, to synchronise with a newly elected European Parliament which would have the right to confirm it. All this assumes that Maastricht is adopted. The 12, including the Danish government, last week decided to press on with the European Union treaty, in the hope that Danish voters will have second thoughts. Continuing with Mr Delors appears part of the strategy, even for the Danes who blame him in part for their referendum result. Remarks attributed to Delors aides, suggesting that the role of small member-states would have to be down-graded once the EC takes in up to 20 new members, are said to have cost two percentage points in the Danish referendum. There is practically nothing in commission documents and minutes on EC enlargement and institutional reform which could not have been produced by a suitably programmed computer. It was an exercise in logic, which acquired sinister connotations through a process of Chinese whispers, underlining, as much as anything else, the community's presentational problems. The two most mooted candidates to succeed Mr Delors are unlikely to be available for the interim 1993-95 term. They are Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister of Spain. Both have terms at home they are likely to want to complete, and neither, say officials from both countries, would volunteer as a stop-gap. Mr Lubbers is understood to be interested in a full term after 1995, and Mr Gonzalez may well be too. It is the Spanish premier who appears to command most Euro-consensus. He has the support of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who is no fan of the Dutch leader. But all this is almost certainly for the future. The question now is Mr Delors. The former French finance minister is one of those people who excites immoderate praise or abuse. But what most sets him apart from his fellow leaders is his consistent ability to think long-term, while remaining immersed in the morass of EC detail. Before the EC can get properly started on the future it needs a careful amalgam of vision and pragmatism, and Mr Delors has been reasonably prodigal in both. Workaholic and temperamental, with narrow, steely eyes as likely to reflect amusement as anger from behind his spectacles, he is a social democrat who, if he were not French, would be a Christian Democrat. He combines a formidable intellect with the common-sense of the autodidact. His achievements have come not so much through the relative power vested in his office as through his own projection. He can claim to have relaunched the EC by settling the budget wrangles of the early 1980s, and pushing through the Single Market programme. Typically, this was but one of four ideas (another was more co-operation on defence) he ran by EC leaders before coming to Brussels in 1985. Before the Maastricht summit, Mr Delors denounced impassionedly the shortcomings of the treaty. Yet when 10 of the 12 threw out the Netherlands presidency's attempt to bring new foreign and home affairs policies partially into community decision-making, and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek was said by aides to be 'in shock,' it was Mr Delors who persuaded him to concede immediately. Mr Delors has read the community flow pretty well up to now. He, along with his peers, may have taken too much for granted about the mood of Europe's citizens. But, sinking or swimming together, it looks very much as though he and they can still do business.</p>

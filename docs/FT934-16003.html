			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook Tiphook's sunny disposition has let it down once more. Less than six months ago the company was cheerily brushing away worries that it might breach its banking covenants. Now those limits stand at risk and gearing is likely to exceed the level allowed by the company's articles of association. Nor are its constraints particularly conservative. Tiphook's main covenants are set at 1.25 times interest cover and gearing is already permitted to rise to 500 per cent. Loading up the truck with debt has certainly exacerbated the company's difficulties, but its high capital spending is not just a thing of the past. Tiphook recently committed itself to buying Pounds 378m of trailers over the next five years. From now on, cash flow rather than reported profits will determine the company's fate. Banks may decide that renegotiating the loan agreements is preferable to more drastic action, but a much less expansive management style will be needed to contain the situation. Working off Tiphook's mountain of debt will also need the kind of recovery in Europe which is all too clearly absent at present. In the near term the dividend must look vulnerable, removing one prop from the share price. The net assets per share are an apparent comfort, though the prospect of selling large numbers of trailers and containers in the current market is hardly appealing. There is a good business inside Tiphook, but there remains a risk that the weight of debt will break its axle.</p>

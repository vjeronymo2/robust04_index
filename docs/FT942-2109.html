			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: IT will end generations of exclusion for deaf Sir, Your excellent supplement on Telecommunications in Business (June 15) omits to mention one group of citizens who have more than most to benefit from the information technology revolution. Britain's 7.5m deaf and hard of hearing people stand to profit from a great break through in communications, especially as video-phone technology becomes common-place in the home and office. For deaf people  - whose first language is British sign language - video phones allow independent access to the telephone network for the first time, as current trials at the RNID are proving. The IT revolution, which is changing all of our lives, will end generations of exclusion and second-class status for deaf people in Britain. Stuart Etherington, Chief Executive, Royal National Institute for Deaf People, 105 Gower Street, London WC1E 6AH</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Court told of pact on Iraqi deal THE FOREIGN Office at one point opposed the granting of export licences to Matrix Churchill, the machine tool maker, to sell equipment to Iraq because of concern about the Iraqi defence procurement programme and publicity given to the Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro (BNL) affair in the US, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Ministers from the Department of Trade and Industry persuaded the Foreign Office to agree to the export of the machine tools by the Iraqi-owned company provided the DTI handled any publicity problems, the court was told. In his second day giving evidence, Mr Eric Beston, an assistant secretary at the DTI, said that in mid-1989 the Foreign Office opposed granting the licences for three reasons: There was a lot of publicity about the Atlanta branch of BNL being a front for the Iraqi defence procurement programme. Iraq was trying at the time to take over Learfan, a company involved in the production of composite materials for defence use. The Foreign Office had conclusive evidence that previous shipments from Matrix Churchill had gone to factories involved in munitions production. Mr Beston agreed under cross-examination by Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC that the DTI disagreed with the Foreign Office, saying the equipment to be exported was for general industrial use and that foreign companies would win the order other-wise. However, at a meeting between Mr Alan Clark and Lord Trefgarne, trade ministers, and Mr William Waldegrave, the Foreign Office minister, it was agreed to grant the export licences provided the DTI handled 'presentational prob-lems'. Earlier the court heard that US Senator Jesse Helms contacted the DTI and threatened to name Matrix Churchill in the Senate and accuse it of breaching UK export regulations. Mr Beston had warned him that if he did so, it would be followed by a sharp response from the British government. Mr Paul Henderson, a former Matrix Churchill managing director, Mr Trevor Abraham, a former commercial director with the company and Mr Peter Allen, a former sales director, all deny breaching export regulations. The prosecution alleges they deceived the DTI by pretending the equipment was for civilian, not military use. The trial will continue today.</p>

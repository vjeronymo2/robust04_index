			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RINGWALD HOPING TO GET CAREER BACK ON TRACK  </P> <P> Molly Ringwald, 22, finds herself in a supporting role for the first time in  years in "Betsy's Wedding."  </P> <P> It's an important distinction at this point in her career because she is a Star  with a capital S.  </P> <P> But her recent films suggest she has been the victim of poor advice and  victimized by less than inspired choices of scripts, directors and co-stars.  </P> <P> Until recently, she had been one of Hollywood's hottest young acting talents,  brilliant in a trio of John Hughes films, "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink"  and "The Breakfast Club," stunning in her revelations of the minds and hearts  of adolescent females.  </P> <P> The pert and poignant redhead, who has lost her innocence on screen more often  than any star since Mary Pickford, marches to the altar in her current movie,  "Betsy's Wedding," a fact that brings a smile to her freckled face.  </P> <P> Until now, Ringwald has managed to escape the coming-of-age or rite-of-passage  film in which a post-pubescent girl enters adulthood with all the ramifications  such transitions imply, at least in movies.  </P> <P> An accomplished actress who looks and photographs a half-dozen years younger  than she is -- which makes a big difference when a woman is 22 -- Ringwald  chose to abandon her familiar metier.  </P> <P> And why not? She's an adult, even though she still looks like a teen-ager.  </P> <P> Ringwald made her first movie at 13 in "Tempest," a comedy based on  Shakespeare's play. She was astonishingly good, winning a Golden Globe Award  for best new actress.  </P> <P> She had an equal impact in the TV movie "Surviving," dealing with teen-age  suicide. And her reviews in the Hughes films were glowing.  </P> <P> But Ringwald felt it was time to move on.  </P> <P> Her recent films, however, have been less than successful at the box-office.  </P> <P> "The Pick-up Artist" with Robert Downey Jr. was a disappointment, both to its  producers and the young actress. "For Keeps," in which she played a pregnant  teen-ager, failed to thrill anyone. "Fresh Horses," co-starring Andrew  McCarthy, was a rehash of "Pretty in Pink" and never got out of the barn.  </P> <P> She flew to France to co-star with Robert Lindsay and John Gielgud in the  British film "Strike it Rich," which didn't.  </P> <P> She tried new directions, playing Cordelia in Jean-Luc Godard's stage  presentation of "King Lear" and in the New York stage production of Horton  Foote's "Lily Dale."  </P> <P> In "Betsy's Wedding," Ringwald is back on familiar terrain, playing a girl  whose wedding touches off a series of family crises. She plays an off-beat  bride in the comedy directed by Alan Alda, who also portrays her father.  </P> <P> Ringwald plays the title role, but she is not the star. Alda is.  </P> <P> "I suppose I've come full circle," Ringwald said in an interview. "I did this  picture because I wanted to work with Alan Alda. I liked the script. It made me  laugh. I liked the prospect of doing an ensemble film again.  </P> <P> "I kept telling myself my family would never be like this, getting upset over  such silly things. I wouldn't let my family control me like the parents do in  the movie.  </P> <P> "Then my sister Elizabeth decided on a formal wedding and in essence we're  doing this movie. It's amazing what problems a family gets into over a wedding.  There's something about the tradition and the ceremony that makes people crazy.  You argue about everything -- invitations, music, refreshments, the church,  clothes, the reception."  </P> <P> Ringwald, who began her career singing with her father's Great Pacific Jazz  Band when she was 4, is a thoughtful young woman who has no matrimonial plans  herself.  </P> <P> Her first priority is her career.  </P> <P> "Marriage is a long way off for me," she said, "but you never know. I think  I'll have a small wedding with just family and a few friends.  </P> <P> "Times have changed from my mother's generation. They got married early,  sometimes right out of high school. Mom married when she was 19.  </P> <P> "I've changed so much in the past five years -- I'm practically a different  person every year. It would be a huge risk for me to marry now. I won't be the  same person in 10 years.  </P> <P> "Today a lot of women my age don't want to make marriage their career. It's a  hard balancing act to have children and an acting career. But it's possible.  Women are doing it every day. Compromises have to be made.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco rises to Dollars 182m in third period LOWER interest charges more than compensated for falling domestic tobacco profits at RJR Nabisco in the third quarter of 1992, helping the large US cigarette and food group to post after-tax profits of Dollars 182m, up from Dollars 123m in the same period a year earlier. At the operating level, RJR Nabisco - the subject of a Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989 - reported static results. Operating profits in the three months to end-September were Dollars 763m, compared with Dollars 762m in 1991, although total sales rose to Dollars 4.02bn from Dollars 3.76bn. This reflected increased earnings from the international tobacco operations, where profits rose to Dollars 159m from Dollars 135m, but a dip on the domestic side, with profits slipping to Dollars 553m from Dollars 578m. On the latter front, RJR said domestic sales volume was up by 6 per cent, with growth in the discount sector more than offsetting the decline in full-priced brands. However, in spite of the higher volumes and some price rises, increased marketing expenditures produced the profit decline. On the food side, sales rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn, but operating profits were little changed during the quarter at Dollars 232m compared with Dollars 228m. RJR said there had been strong sales growth in Latin America, but progress in North America had been restrained by the weakness in consumer spending. On the financial front, RJR Nabisco has continued the restructuring of its balance sheet, and yesterday Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman, noted that Dollars 2.8bn of debt had been refinanced since the start of the year. In the third quarter, RJR repurchased and retired Dollars 100m of payment-in-kind debentures, plus another Dollars 412m of other debt securities. This helped cash and non-cash interest expenses to fall from Dollars 500m in the third quarter of 1991, to Dollars 345m this time. The latest figures mean that in the first nine months of the year, RJR has reported after-tax profits of Dollars 254m, compared with Dollars 207m in the same period of 1991.</p>

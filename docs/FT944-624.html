			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: In the steps of Stevenson IN SEARCH OF TUSITALA by Gavin Bell Picador Pounds 15.99, 333 pages THE TELLER OF TALES by Hunter Davies Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.99, 290 pages Robert Louis Stevenson died 100 years ago this month, so it is no surprise that this year has brought a batch of books by and for fans of the great man. Two of the latest are first-person travel books 'in the steps of' Louis, as he was called; this is certainly not a new genre, but one of the pair - Gavin Bell's In Search of Tusitala - is almost entirely successful in a modest, unpretentious way. Bell is a Times foreign correspondent who took a handshake from Murdoch and went off to the Oceania for eight months to track down the last years of his fellow Scot. He simply tells the story of what happened to him as he zig-zagged around the Pacific, following as precisely as possible the route of the two South Seas voyages of RLS, his wife Fanny, his stepson and his mother: from San Francisco to the Marquesas, the Tuamotus, Tahiti, Hawaii, the Republic of Kiribati (which used to be called the Gilbert Islands) and, in the end, Samoa. 'The 20th century, by and large, has not been kind to Oceania,' writes Bell  -he had been there before and was not expecting a tropical paradise - but he seems to have had a happy and occasionally dramatic time, which included an erupting volcano, a visit to Father Damien's leper settlement, and a terrifying underwater encounter with a 13-foot silver-tip shark. He recalls, and agrees with, Stevenson's comment that among these islands he had drunk 'that warm. light vin du pays of human affection . . .' He finishes, as all disciples must, at Vailima, the grand house (complete with a seldom-used Scottish fireplace) where RLS spent his final three-and-a-half years. It was derelict, forlorn, unmagical, and about to be restored by three Mormons. Hunter Davies gives a fuller, slightly more recent picture of Vailima, but in other respects The Teller of Tales is a less satisfying book. He follows Stevenson not just in the South Seas but round the world and makes a stab at a distinctly chatty biography, while not claiming to have any particular revelations. This style encourages him to embark on speculation, often of a sexual bent, which rarely seems helpful: what were the marital relations of Mr and Mrs Stevenson senior? Did 'intimacy' occur between the young boy and his beloved nanny, Cummy (what an outrageous notion)? Did he sleep with Fanny Sitwell? Was the second Fanny - his American wife - mad or just menopausal? (or both, or neither?) But the root mistake is to interleave the biographical chapters with Davies's own 'Letters to Louis' - 'I'm writing these present-day letters because I thought it might amuse you to hear what's been happening to some of the places you once knew so well . . .' It is a device no doubt intended to allow Davies to write about his own travels, but the tone is so matey, in contrast with the sparkling brilliance of Stevenson's own letters, that it is surely a gimmick from which his publisher might have deterred him.</p>

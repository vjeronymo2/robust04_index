			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Carrier awaits decision on rescue package THE CANADIAN government is facing a tough decision over whether to support a rescue package for ailing Canadian Airlines International. Ministers are torn between rival commercial and regional interests. Their decision is likely to be a key factor in determining the outcome of the increasingly desperate battle for survival between the country's two leading airlines, Calgary-based Canadian and Air Canada of Montreal. A group of Canadian Airlines employees, backed by management and regional interest groups in western Canada, has asked Ottawa and various provincial governments to guarantee up to CDollars 290m (USDollars 241.6m) in loans to the airline. The loans are required to meet conditions set by American Airlines for an alliance with Canadian, which would include a minority stake for the US carrier. The American investment, which would be combined with a partial buy-out by Canadian's employees, appears to be the loss-making carrier's last hope. Merger talks between Canadian and Air Canada collapsed last week. Canadian has warned if talks with American fail, it will have little choice but to file for bankruptcy protection. Canadian's requests for government support are opposed by Air Canada, which is losing about CDollars 1m a day. Air Canada's chairman Mr Claude Taylor said his airline should also receive a bail-out, if one is offered to its competitor. Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems, the Canadian reservations system, has filed a CDollars 1bn lawsuit against PWA, alleging 'breach of its fiduciary responsibilities as a partner in Gemini'. It also filed a CDollars 500m suit against PWA, its Canadian Airlines unit, AMR, and AMR's American Airline subsidiary, claiming 'unlawful interference with Gemini's economic interests'.</p>

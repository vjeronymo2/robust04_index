			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Chris Whitfield] </F>   [Excerpts] Chilling intelligence reports predicting a sharp  increase in KwaZulu/Natal violence fatalities as the election  approached finally persuaded President de Klerk to declare a  state of emergency in the region, according to Government  sources. The reports -- some of which are understood to have  referred to a tenfold increase in deaths prior to the election  -- came shortly after the Independent Electoral Commission's  blunt and decisive call for political intervention in the  crisis-torn province.    One source described the intelligence reports presented to  De  Klerk as "hair-raising" and said they had indicated a massive  potential for increased violence as the election approached.  The sources declined to comment on whether specific campaigns  of violence were planned. They believed gravest threat to  stability lay in already volatile areas on the ground where  violence was expected to break out and spread to other, more  stables areas.    Troops began to arrive in KwaZulu/Natal yesterday as  security  chiefs gathered to plot how the tough state of emergency  regulations proclaimed by De Klerk would be applied on the  ground.    There was no immediate indication from the KwaZulu  government  or the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] on whether there would be  active resistance to the imposition of the emergency  regulations, but it was clear that there was considerable  unhappiness in Ulundi.    It is evident from the proclamation in the Government  Gazette  that steps have been taken to directly inhibit the continued  training of Inkatha "self-defence units" and the carrying of  "cultural" weapons in public. Both steps were met with anger by  senior Inkatha members yesterday. The organisation's national  chairman Dr Frank Mdlalose said: "No doubt, training people  out of the country in Uganda is exonerated. But the small,  little training at Umfolozi must be punished." It is estimated  that some 5,000 self-defence unit members have undergone limited  training at a camp in Umfolozi.    It has been widely speculated that the imposition of the  regulations might scupper the summit that would have bought King  Goodwill Zwelithini, IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC  President Nelson Mandela and De Klerk together in the next few  days.    However, SAPA reports that Buthelezi said yesterday the  meeting appeared to be on, and he held out some hope for it --  otherwise I wouldn't be going". But he added that if it went  ahead it would be in a "sour atmosphere" because of De Klerk's  "appalling and shameful" declaration of the state of emergency  and Mandela's remarks that the KwaZulu Police (KZP) would be  confined to barracks.    The emergency regulations contain no reference to the KZP  being confined to barracks.    Senior KZP officers were present at day-long discussions  with  the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF [South African  Defense Force] in Durban yesterday to plans security operations  under the state of emergency.    One of three additional companies of SADF troops that are to  be deployed in KwaZulu/Natal arrived in the region yesterday.  The remaining two companies of between 100 and 150 members each  are expected today or tomorrow. [passage omitted]</p>

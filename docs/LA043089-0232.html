			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE FROM MORELAND;  </P> <P> WHEN HE LEFT SAN DIEGO FOR THE DETROIT TIGERS, HE DID NOT GO QUIETLY  </P> <P> Keith Moreland, San Diego's favorite ex-Padre, returned last week to the land  he says made him goofy: Southern California.  </P> <P> He was toting a blue duffel bag that said "Detroit Tigers." He stood in Anaheim  Stadium, about 100 miles north of San Diego, where he was previously employed  by the Padres.  </P> <P> "I've played 11 years in the big leagues now," he said, "and one in the minor  leagues in between. And that was in San Diego."  </P> <P> It has been six months since Moreland and Chris Brown were traded for pitcher  Walt Terrell. In that time, Moreland's soft, Texas drawl has uttered some of  the most acerbic lines about San Diego this side of Chicago Tribune columnist  Mike Royko.  </P> <P> The day Moreland was traded to Detroit, he said he was "going back to the big  leagues." This spring, he told columnist Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press  that walking into San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium was "like walking into a spring  training B game."  </P> <P> And Moreland, 34, hasn't stopped swinging despite the fact that he swung  himself right out of Detroit's everyday lineup with an embarrassing spring  training. His spring batting average (.119) turned him into a platoon  designated hitter.  </P> <P> "I was ecstatic to be traded from San Diego," Moreland reiterated. "I did not  want to be there, I didn't like it from the start, and I do not like it now."  </P> <P> Moreland hasn't hit anything hard yet this season (11 singles, one extra-base  hit), but he was swinging hard now. On the subject of San Diego, he went for  the cycle -- hitting the city, the fans, the organization and even Yuma, Ariz.,  the Padre spring training home.  </P> <P> "It's just not conducive to good baseball," Moreland said of San Diego.  "There's too much to do. The fans are not into it, and the organization itself  doesn't know anything about the game of baseball. I hated it."  </P> <P> The organization?  </P> <P> "Anybody who would have the top management they had when I was there," Moreland  said. "Chub Feeney . . . it was amazing. It's not oriented around a winning  tradition. It's just, 'Hey, we're a big league team, we're going to go out and  play ball.'  </P> <P> "And the fans are rooting for the other team. Everybody down there is a  transplant. The Mets come in, and there are 20,000 people rooting for the Mets.  It seemed like we were on the road all the time."  </P> <P> Obviously, Moreland does not hesitate to say what's on his mind. He already has  said that if Detroit isn't planning on playing him every day, he wishes they'd  "get me out of here."  </P> <P> "Oh, sure, I'd much rather be in a situation where I could play every day, but  I'm not going to scream and holler about it," he said. "I'd much rather be  someplace where I'm playing, either the field or DH, every day. But I don't  make the decisions, and I'm not upset at anybody. I just want to play."  </P> <P> He is not playing largely because of what happened this spring, a time when he  raised eyebrows around the Tiger camp in Lakeland, Fla., for all the wrong  reasons -- the .119 average (seven for 51), the two doubles without a home run  and the three runs batted in.  </P> <P> "He had a dead spring, to be honest," said Vada Pinson, Detroit's batting  coach. "Rigor mortis had set in. Quite a few people were concerned. I know I  was. I just didn't see him being aggressive."  </P> <P> The point where concern seeped into conversation, and conversation turned into  action, came one morning about the fourth week of spring training. A handful of  Tigers were on the bench before a B game, and Pinson and Moreland started  talking.  </P> <P> "There comes a time when you say, 'OK, it's time to turn it on now.' We were  sitting on the bench, and I asked him about things," Pinson recalled. "He had a  blank stare like he was confused.  </P> <P> "Now I'm looking at you when I talk to you, looking for eye contact. I didn't  get any. He was staring out at the field. He admitted he didn't know what he  was doing."  </P> <P> After that game, Pinson and Moreland made the first of two trips to the batting  cage. The second came later in the week. Pinson was standing by the clubhouse  when he heard someone call out his name. It was Moreland.  </P> <P> "He was standing flat-footed at the plate," Pinson said. "You use your hips to  guide the ball."  </P> <P> Moreland said he tried to do some things differently in spring training. He  also said his shoulder, which he injured last year, was still tender.  </P> <P> He experimented with standing in different locations in the batter's box and  trying to do various things with the ball.  </P> <P> "I guess you shouldn't mess with success or try to change anything you've done,  but once in a while you try to see if something different might work for you,"  Moreland said. "I lost my idea of how to approach hitting."  </P> <P> By the time Moreland's swing and shoulder were fixed, he had been supplanted at  first base by rookie Torey Lovullo, a 1987 All-American at UCLA. Thus, Moreland  became the first major leaguer to be replaced by a guy whose father was the  producer of the old television series "Hee Haw."  </P> <P> Manager Sparky Anderson was enamored with Lovullo and told Moreland and Dave  Bergman that they wouldn't be getting as much action at first base as they  would like.  </P> <P> "I've been honest with both of them," Anderson said. "That's the only way to do  it."  </P> <P> So Moreland has been sharing the designated hitter duties with Bergman and Pat  Sheridan. Although he's hitting .273 (12 for 44), he has 11 singles, one double  and just two RBIs. And he has more stolen bases (two) this season than extra  base hits (one). Not much power for a power kind of guy.  </P> <P> "I just haven't had the right situations," Moreland said. "I've hit some balls  good, but we've been in cold weather. Our whole team has been hitting the ball  extremely hard. We played a whole series in Milwaukee (April 21-23) where we  could have had a bunch of extra-base hits. Playing in a place like California,  some of those balls would have been extra-base hits."  </P> <P> Ah, California. The place where Moreland dropped from a career-high 27 home  runs in 1987 with the Cubs to five for the Padres in 1988. He finished the year  batting .256 with 64 RBIs. He went 67 games, from June 2 through Sept. 5,  without a homer. When he finally hit one in San Francisco, he turned a  cartwheel.  </P> <P> "It was just stupidity on my part," Moreland said. "I've never done anything  and never will again to show up another team. It had just been 200 and some  at-bats without a home run, and it was like, 'Hey, I finally hit a home run.'  </P> <P> "It was a freak of nature that playing down there will get you into."  </P> <P> Playing down there in San Diego, where it's like a spring training B game?  </P> <P> "Exactly," Moreland said. "That's exactly the way it is. There was nobody (in  the stadium), and the people who were there didn't know what was going on. It  was pretty much a case of putting in your three hours and getting the hell out  of Dodge. That's all it is down there, and all it's ever going to be as far as  I'm concerned.  </P> <P> "There may be people who think it's a great organization, and that's great for  them. But I personally couldn't stand it. It started in Yuma, Ariz. Anybody who  has to go to Yuma can figure out that it's going to be a rather rough  situation. And it progressively gets worse. I was elated to leave. They were  probably elated to get rid of me."  </P> <P> San Diego might be out of Moreland's sight, but it's certainly not out of his  mind. He admits to reading the papers to follow the team -- or, at least, some  of the team.  </P> <P> "I follow Randy Ready and John Kruk," Moreland said. "They are two really good  guys. I've looked in the box scores every day to see how they've done. I wish  both of them the very best. As far as the other end of it, I could care less."  </P></p>

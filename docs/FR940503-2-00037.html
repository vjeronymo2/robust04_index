			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Acceptance of up to 409 spent fuel elements would allow the foreign research reactors to ship full casks, and would not force the two reactors that can ship spent fuel to Scotland for reprocessing to do so. (Acceptance of 359 spent fuel elements, i.e., shipment in partially full casks, also would not force these two reactors to reprocess.) In proposing to accept full casks, DOE took note of the fact that there is no significant difference in the environmental impacts between shipping full and partially full casks. Further, shipping full casks is the customary shipping procedure, and more cost-effective. Accordingly, proposing to accept full casks appeared to be a prudent course to encourage the continued participation of foreign research reactors in the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Ports of Entry: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Environmental Assessment also evaluated the impacts of shipping 409 spent fuel elements through alternate commercial and military ports using two assumptions: (1) No intermediate port stops and eight casks per vessel; and (2) three intermediate port stops and one cask per vessel. Dose to handlers and port workers would be essentially the same from port to port. During ocean transport, dose to the ship's crew would be generally the same regardless of the port of entry. However, dose to the truck's crew showed some slight variation consistent with the distance of travel, i.e., slightly higher doses are associated with greater distances traveled. The dose to the ship's crew and the dose to the truck crew would be well below the 100 millirem limit for nonradiation workers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the alternate ports appeared as advantageous for the proposed receipt of spent fuel as the five proposed ports based on the application of screening criteria drawn from the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, and additional criteria recommended by a panel of maritime experts at a DOE-sponsored workshop on port selection criteria for shipments of spent fuel. While there are comparative advantages and disadvantages among the five proposed ports, all five of the proposed ports appear comparatively more advantageous than other United States seaports for the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Modes of Overland Transport: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The spent nuclear fuel could be transported by rail from the port of entry to the Savannah River Site. The incident-free dose to spent fuel cask handlers would depend on how the casks were handled in port. If two casks are shipped per rail car, the handler would continue to receive a small dose from the first loaded cask as the second cask is loaded. Dose would also be influenced by the number of cargo transfers required. For example, if the spent fuel cask cannot be off-loaded directly from the ship to a rail car, spent fuel cask handlers would receive an additional small dose during the transport by truck to the rail car and from the transfer of the cask from the truck to the rail car. In addition, rail cargo is inspected after loading and prior to off-loading. As a result, transport by rail would result in a slightly higher dose to port handlers/inspectors and rail crew than transport by truck. Dose to the public, however, would be generally lower, partly because rail stops would normally occur in rail yards (removed from the general population). For example, rail transport from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site would result in an annual dose of 0.16 person-rem total to port handlers/inspectors, other port workers and rail crew, and in a dose of 0.0017 person-rem to members of the public. Truck transport of the spent fuel from Sunny Point to the Savannah River Site would result in an annual dose of 0.08 person-rem to port handlers/inspectors, other port workers and truck crew and a dose of 0.067 person-rem to members of the public. Neither mode of transport would result in a significant health effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reprocessing Abroad and Transport of Low or Highly Enriched Uranium to the United States: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The potential environmental impact of transporting low enriched uranium by ship to the United States after reprocessing the spent fuel abroad was analyzed in detail in two recently issued Environmental Assessments prepared by the United States Enrichment Corporation. Low enriched uranium was found to be a common commercial product that has been shipped safely around the world in large quantities by air, water, and land transport modes for over 30 years without significant impact. Consequently, if the spent nuclear fuel elements were reprocessed in Europe (i.e., at Dounreay, Scotland), blended down to low enriched uranium, and the low enriched uranium was returned to the United States, no significant impacts would be expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the spent fuel were reprocessed in Scotland, but not blended down, then highly enriched uranium could be transported from Scotland to the United States for blending. The shipment of highly enriched uranium would require extensive security activities and would involve the use of military assets for protection and safety. The military has had considerable experience in shipment of highly enriched uranium and has safely transported such materials throughout the world without significant impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These options, however, would not serve the nonproliferation interests of the United States. As discussed above and in greater detail in the Environmental Assessment, reprocessing would likely result in reactor operators postponing conversion from highly enriched uranium fuel, or reverting back to its use if conversion has already been completed. This is because the only current reprocessor of highly enriched uranium does not reprocess low enriched uranium fuel, and reactor operators have only limited capacity to store spent fuel generated as a result of operating. Thus, to continue operating, research reactors would have to continue to use highly enriched uranium fuels. In addition, for those reactors for which United States consent is not required for reprocessing to occur, there is no mechanism to implement or to enforce a blending requirement by the reactor operators or reprocessors. Consequently, reactor operators could elect to have their fuel reprocessed, but not blended. This would result in the continued use of highly enriched uranium fuel by research reactors, contrary to United States nonproliferation policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Speculation grows of further Bundesbank interest rate cut THE solidarity pact concluded last weekend between the German federal and state governments and the opposition ought to provide a fillip to the German economy and help prevent a spiral of decline, Prof Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank policy-making council, said yesterday. Mr Jochimsen, president of the central bank for the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, told an investment symposium in Dusseldorf he was relieved that policy-makers had at last taken important decisions as to how the country should proceed. Consensus had been renewed despite a 'confrontation of interests' which posed 'unprecedented challenges' to the German democratic system. His remarks will fuel speculation that the Bundesbank will cut its official short-term interest rates after the council meeting today. Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, said this week the prospect for rate cuts had improved since the pact was concluded. Mr Jochimsen would not comment in detail on today's meeting. He qualified his favourable assessment of the pact by saying the agreement left many important details unresolved. He said the pact took 'the path of least resistance', meaning higher taxation and no substantial cuts in state spending. He said it was easier to agree what expenditure should be continued and on new sources of revenue than on cuts. He added: 'The government has moved decisively, though not yet sufficiently.' Summing up the Bundesbank's position on interest rates, he said the council found itself walking a tightrope between pressure to ease monetary policy and the need to safeguard the value of the D-Mark. He said the scale of Germany's economic downturn combined with international exchange rate pressures called for interest rates to be cut as soon and as much as possible. But the risks to price stability had yet to be dispelled, he said. His views are more favourable to a rate cut than those of Mr Otmar Issing, another member of the Bundesbank's policy-making directorate. Mr Issing said on Tuesday that monetary developments remained the main basis for decisions on interest rates. Despite inflation running at 4.2 per cent in February, many economists hope the Bundesbank will today cut at least 0.25 percentage points off the Lombard and discount rates, now 9 and 8 per cent.</p>

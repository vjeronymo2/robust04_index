			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Tourists see a cleaner Britain TOURISTS regard the UK and London as being cleaner than two years ago, although a large number still see room for improvement in public toilets, public transport and the capital's streets, according to the British Tourist Authority's overseas visitor survey published today, Michael Skapinker writes. London streets were described as clean by 56 per cent, a sharp improvement on the 1990 figure of 44 per cent. Public toilets in the UK were described as clean by 55 per cent, compared with 52 per cent in 1990. The cleanliness of public transport won approval from 54 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in 1990. The survey found that Britain was successful in attracting repeat visitors, with 71 per cent of those interviewed saying they had been before. Repeat visitors in 1992 had made an average of three previous holiday trips.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. Rated R.  An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets' Society" and "Witness," this one  is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish while on a  school outing.  </P> <P> A psychedelic/supernatural story supposedly based on an actual account.  </P> <P> "Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among  the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that  of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly  receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an  hour away. "The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No  rating. This ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just  about everything a scary movie should, without fake decapitations and gallons  of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb  black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and  Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

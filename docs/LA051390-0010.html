			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HUSBAND IS THE PAST TENSE OF DADDY AND OTHER DISPATCHES  FROM THE FRONT LINES OF MOTHERHOOD BY TERYL ZARNOW (ADDISON-WESLEY: $15.95; 221  PP.)  </P> <P> The title of Teryl Zarnow's collection, published in time for Mother's Day,  speaks for itself.  </P> <P> These pieces from her syndicated Knight-Ridder column, "Color Me Mommy,"  maintain a humorous character while serving up the undercurrent of  self-conscious "what have I done?" lament popular in the new genre of parenting  literature. When Zarnow writes, "Rules have civilized us; they have created  order out of chaos. I am Ayatollah the Mommy; my rulings come swift and  merciless," the reader can be sure there are some laughs in this collection  that will be appreciated only by those whose normal sleeping patterns have been  irretrievably disturbed by night feedings.

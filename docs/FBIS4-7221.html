			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] No one knows when Prince Kromluong [Norodom]  Yuveakneat will leave the monkhood.    According to unofficial sources, Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat  wished to enter the Buddhist priesthood for just two days, but  until now he has not yet left.    Before returning to the United States, a daughter of Prince  Kromluong Yuveakneat told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA at Unalaom  Monastery that her father will not return to the United States  but will stay on in Cambodia. She and her mother will leave for  the United States on 22 April. [passage omitted]    His majesty the king has been very pleased with the  ordination of Prince Kromluong Yuveakneat, who is his elder son.    Whether this ordination will be for the short or long term,  the Prince Kromluong will be fulfilling his wish to show his  gratitude to his father, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman,  king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, who is the father of the nation.    Since his first return to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the  Prince  Kromluong has paid great attention to improving and solving the  difficult livelihood of children in orphanages. He has also  given love and care to the children living and studying in  temples.    Analysts say that his simple manner could make him the  successor to the throne. It is not known what role is the  Prince Kromluong playing in Cambodia.</p>

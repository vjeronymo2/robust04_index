			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Growth at Portuguese telecoms operators Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, Portugal's intercontinental telecommunications operator, posted a 52.2 per cent increase in net profits to Es4.72bn (Dollars 37.2m) for the first nine months of 1994 compared with the same period last year, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon. Marconi, which is 51 per cent state-owned, attributed the rise to the beneficial effects of tariff reductions, cost-cutting and returns on international investments. Meanwhile, Portugal Telecom (PT), the state-owned global operator formed from a merger of three companies in July, reported a a first-half net profit of Es8.1bn on a turnover of Es155.9bn. Marconi is to be integrated into PT by the end of the year, before the partial privation of the new group in 1995. The government has not yet made clear how Marconi's private shareholders, mainly US and UK institutional investors, are to be compensated.</p>

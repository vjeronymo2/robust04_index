			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Ruffling diplomatic feathers - Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general Nine months after his controversial appointment as United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali could be forgiven for occasionally feeling self-satisfied at the way he has confounded those who questioned his suitability for the job. The conventional wisdom in many western government circles was that, notwithstanding his long diplomatic experience and his distinguished career as an academic lawyer, this archetypal Egyptian civil servant lacked the dynamism and imagination to lead the UN in the post-Cold War era. Yet it is because he has proved to be independent and outspoken that some national noses have been put out of joint. He has already ruffled many feathers - mainly those of diplomats - and achieved much more than was generally expected. Quite apart from the international problems he has had to deal with, Mr Boutros Ghali has made a good start on restructuring the UN's overblown bureaucracy. He has also proposed an imaginative 'agenda for peace' calling for the creation of permanent standby peace-keeping forces on which the UN could call at 24 hours' notice, and a system of 'preventive diplomacy' designed to nip potential conflicts in the bud. During an interview in his oak-panelled suite on the 38th floor of the UN headquarters in New York, the secretary-general made no attempt to deny diplomats' complaints that he sometimes goes over their heads and deals directly with their governments. 'Mea culpa, maxima culpa. Yes it is true. But if I have to wait a week to have an answer and the foreign minister or prime minister is an old friend, it would be counter-productive not to talk directly to them. I am doing this every day, otherwise I would not be able to finish all my work.' Mr Boutros Ghali certainly has a lot on his plate. Yet he speaks about his job with passion and without trepidation. Though he is the first to concede that the end of the Cold War and the subsequent spirit of co-operation between the US and Russia has given the UN a new lease of life, he is convinced that the secretary-general's job has become infinitely more demanding. 'My role is becoming more difficult, not because of the absence of co-operation between the five permanent members of the Security Council, or because of the absence of political will on their part, but because of the multiplication of problems: Yugoslavia, Salvador, Cambodia, Somalia, Angola, South Africa and, soon, Mozambique. The UN never had to deal with six or seven big problems at the same time.' The UN is currently running 12 peace-keeping operations in various parts of the world. This involves some 40,000 military personnel under UN command at an estimated cost of nearly Dollars 3bn over the present 12-month period - more than four times the previous highest annual figure. Yet there is not nearly enough money in the UN kitty to pay for all these activities. 'The member states owe the UN Dollars 1.8bn and only 52 out of a total of 179 have paid their contributions,' he complained. Both US President George Bush, whose country is the worst offender with an outstanding debt to the UN of Dollars 733m, and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the next biggest debtor, have promised to pay up in instalments. 'But I am still waiting.' Several proposals have been put before the General Assembly, currently meeting in New York, to deal with this cash-flow problem. These include charging interest on contributions not paid in time, the establishment of a temporary Dollars 50m reserve fund to meet the initial cost of peace-keeping operations and authorisation for the secretary-general to borrow on the money markets. The failure of member states to recognise the UN's cash problems was at least partially behind the widely-publicised row last July between Mr Boutros Ghali and Lord Carrington, the European Community's former chief peace negotiator on Yugoslavia. The very undiplomatic tiff erupted over the secretary-general's criticism of the Security Council for endorsing the EC's proposal that the UN should supervise all heavy weapons in Bosnia. Though pique at being presented with a fait accompli by the Security Council and at being ordered around by a 'regional' organisation like the EC certainly contributed to the ill-feeling, Mr Boutros Ghali now has a much more rational explanation for his sharp reactions at the time. 'It is useless to take decisions or adopt resolutions in the Security Council when you know that you do not have the capacity to implement them. My advisers had told me that it would take two to three months to find the additional forces, money and equipment to carry out such a monitoring operation (in Bosnia). But the Europeans could have done it in something like three days. What was the interest, therefore, in asking the UN to undertake the operation instead of the EC member states? That was the reason for my confrontation.' The secretary-general believes the compromise reached at the subsequent London conference on Yugoslavia in August was acceptable. 'What I obtained at that conference is the agreement of the Europeans to contribute to additional peace-keeping forces (for Bosnia) and that the cost of this operation would be paid directly by EC members. They wanted these forces to operate under the UN flag, and I accepted this.' Though acknowledging that this agreement raises the issue of UN control over future peace-keeping missions, Mr Boutros Ghali emphasises that it is a sui generis arrangement which will not be repeated elsewhere. The secretary-general remains unperturbed when reminded of his description last summer of the Yugoslav conflict as 'the rich man's war'. He did not repeat the phrase in the interview, but he stressed that he sees his task as secretary-general as maintaining some kind of equilibrium between the richer and poorer nations. 'The rapprochement between east and west must not be at the expense of the relations between north and south.' Similarly, he does not agree with the widespread impression that the UN is dominated by the US. 'I say no, honestly. After nine months in this house, I can assure you that it is a very democratic system. The members spend weeks trying to obtain a consensus. This I would call democracy.' Because of the UN's increasingly heavy workload, Mr Boutros Ghali is anxious that specialised international agencies and regional organisations should play their full part in ensuring international peace and security, in co-operation with the UN. 'We are no longer asked only to undertake peace-keeping operations. We are asked to present a comprehensive approach, which embraces the return of millions of refugees to their former homes, rehabilitation, the reform of national administrations, the integration of armies of former enemies and much more besides. We are not able to cope with this comprehensive approach by ourselves and we need the assistance of different international specialised agencies.' These increasing demands on the UN have prompted Mr Boutros Ghali to order a thorough study of how the work of the organisation and the autonomously functioning agencies can be better co-ordinated. At 69, which some considered too old for the job only nine months ago, Mr Boutros Ghali appears to be in excellent health and full of life. Though he makes deprecating noises when asked whether he is enjoying his job - 'I was an elder statesman in Egypt who could have his Turkish coffee twice a day and choose whatever trips abroad he wanted to go on' - there can be no doubt of his enthusiasm for the UN, a subject with which he has long been familiar as a professor of international law. For all his enthusiasm, Mr Boutros Ghali has no intention of seeking a second mandate. 'I am protected by my age (he will be 74 when his term expires). At a certain age you have to write your memoirs or go to the Cote d'Azur to admire the girls.' PERSONAL FILE 1922 Born in Cairo. Bachelor of law degree, Cairo university 1946. Ph.

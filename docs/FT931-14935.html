			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: Ignorance that makes 'Christian west' fear militant Islam Sir, Isn't it depressing? Day after day we read about 'militant Islam' ('Cold war warmed over: Militant Islam has become the west's new evil empire', January 13), but what is depressing is not so much the perceived spread of Islamic militancy but the west's inability to understand the causes or to make any rational judgment about the future. Edward Mortimer is, unfortunately, quite right in believing Islam has become the bogey of the west. One should clarify this and say 'the Christian west' because there is no doubt a strong hint of religious prejudice in its reaction. Added to that is the age-old fear of the great-unwashed taking their destinies into their own hands. For sure, this all leads, temporarily, to chaos and turmoil in the countries concerned but why should anyone else care? Is it a burning morality, with the west wanting to uphold the rights of individuals? Algeria's experience would suggest not. So what is it that causes the west to fear the so-called Islamic revival? I would venture to say little more than ignorance and prejudice. The Islamic movements are merely expressions of the common people against corruption, exploitation and oppression. In Latin America, the same people have turned to the Catholic church. In eastern Europe, they once turned to communism. These are simply conduits - the vast majority have little real understanding of any of these ideologies but they find them a good frame of reference. They are comfortable with them. Islam is not really what is important to the Islamic movements. When the other aims are achieved, the momentum behind the movements will dissipate. The west, by opposing these movements, simply strengthens them. Instead, it should learn to keep its nose out of other peoples' troubles.

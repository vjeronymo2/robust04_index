			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Scots get investment warning CALLS for civil disobedience and industrial action in support of Scottish constitutional change risk undermining inward investment, according to one of Scotland's leading industrialists, James Buxton writes. Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, said that calls by senior figures in the Labour party at last week's Scottish Trade Union Congress conference for civil disobedience and industrial action were 'despicable, given the problems young people are having in finding work'. Mr Garrick was alluding to the heavily reported remarks of Mr Charles Gray, Labour leader of Strathclyde regional council, who called for 'civil disobedience within the law', as well as mass demonstrations and strikes, and did not rule out 'civil disobedience outside the law', in pursuit of a devolved Scottish parliament. Mr Garrick said that if that happened, Scotland would become a graveyard for investment. Mr Gray cancelled a planned appearance at Sunday's rally in Glasgow of Scotland United, a grouping campaigning for a referendum on Scotland's constitutional future, on grounds of work and ill health.</p>

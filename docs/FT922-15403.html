			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: FT election share index SHARES that might benefit from a Labour victory suffered one of their steepest drops of the campaign as the 'Labour gainers' section of the index slid a full point. Eight of the 10 shares fell and two were unchanged. 'Conservative gainers' did less badly, dropping by only a  1/4 of a point - a decline that was only half that suffered by the FT-SE index of big-company stocks. The FT Election Share index is based on closing prices on March 11, the day the election was called. Since then Labour gainers have dropped by 2 points, and Conservative gainers by 6 1/2 points.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Technology: Tackling insider dealing with fuzzy logic Fraud investigators at the London Stock Exchange are testing pioneering 'intelligent' technology in an attempt to crack insider dealing rings. The exchange recently conducted a pilot study with an automated insider dealing detection system, codenamed Monitars (Monitoring Insider Trading and Regulatory Surveillance), installed by SearchSpace, a company that uses University College London's research in intelligent systems. The aim is to detect dealing rings of several individuals, or one individual with several accounts. The problem, which is extremely difficult to solve using conventional techniques, such as statistical analysis, involves spotting the 'signature' of certain traders from a vast amount of electronic camouflage, explains Jason Kingdon, a UCL researcher. It is an example of a pattern recognition problem that can be skilfully handed by a neural network, a computing device which has similarities with the structure and function of nerve cells in the brain. The neural network is used in conjunction with several other 'intelligent' techniques. For example, it uses fuzzy logic, a mechanism for dealing with imprecise information, in order to be able to cope with some inconsistencies in the patterns picked out. It also uses genetic algorithms, which use mechanisms inspired by biological evolution to search very large data sets. In the Monitars systems, a genetic algorithm is used to allocate resources by working out which lines of inquiry seem most promising. The machine is adaptable in that it starts with very precise criteria of what it should look for, which it gradually relaxes over time. It is also capable of working autonomously, since it can set its own objectives. The London Stock Exchange has yet to decide whether to install the system permanently. 'It is one of several means of analysing share movements which we are looking at to strengthen our regulatory operations here.'</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A new deal for Cuba The tightening of the US economic embargo on Cuba, announced this weekend, is a step in precisely the wrong direction. By further isolating its neighbour, the US is intensifying economic misery in Cuba. This will increase the flood of refugees attempting to leave the island, which will make further difficulties for the Clinton administration. It will also allow Fidel Castro to deflect blame for the country's dire economic circumstances from himself, where it belongs, to Washington. The present exodus from Cuba should show him that fundamental change must come soon. His dictatorship of 35 years is an anachronism in a continent of elected governments. He has succeeded in extending literacy and reducing infant mortality. Yet in the absence of eastern bloc subsidies and trade, the failures of Cuba's centrally planned economy have become painfully clear. National income has almost halved during the last three years. An aid agency recently estimated that the average Cuban eats about 1,000 fewer calories per day than in 1989, pushing many towards starvation. Hardship and repression have caused rising discontent. During recent protests, the worst in the regime's history, demonstrators chanted 'freedom' and 'down with Fidel'. Civil unrest The question is no longer whether change will come to Cuba, but how. There is little cause for complacency on the part of the Clinton administration. Deteriorating conditions will produce increasing civil unrest and a worsening exodus to the US. Presumably, the US sees itself as tightening the economic noose around Castro's neck, creating the conditions for his overthrow. But given the country's lack of democratic tradition, there are no guarantees that a change of regime will mean the advent of democracy. Already this year, more than 6,000 Cuban refugees have entered the US, twice the number in 1993. Ideological protestation aside, the US is no more interested in absorbing refugees from post-communist turmoil in the western hemisphere than is the EU in accepting refugees from eastern Europe. The White House has responded to Castro's apparent decision to let Cubans leave with a virtual blockade around Florida. Rather than encouraging a violent outcome to the Cuban crisis, the US should end its blanket isolation of the Castro regime and offer a series of incentives for economic and political liberalisation. Cuba has taken halting and inadequate steps towards economic reform. The dollar has been reluctantly legalised, and some private enterprise is now allowed. Greater communication with the island would strengthen this liberalisation process. For example, Cuba has granted several US telecommunication companies the right to link the two countries, but they still await the Clinton administration's approval. Cold war regulations restricting Cuban journalists in the US should also be repealed. Encouraging reformers Reformers within the government must be encouraged. The US should end embargoes on food and medicine, and if reform continues, it should permit Cuba's entrance into the World Bank and IMF. Liberalisation needs to yield results, otherwise Castro may be able to blame the reformers for Cuba's economic misery. US policy is unlikely to change without corresponding movement within the Cuban-American community, long the primary force behind America's uncompromising stance. Although the most powerful Cuban-American organisation, the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), still supports the embargo, alternative voices are emerging. The newly-formed Cuban Committee for Democracy supports the recently introduced Free Trade with Cuba Act. The Clinton administration's first nominee for under-secretary for Inter-American Affairs, Afro-Cuban exile Mario Baeza, was blocked by CANF because he appeared too open to dialogue with the Castro regime. The stand-off between Cuba and the US remains one of the cold war's most painful legacies. The past's scars, however, must not prevent a pragmatic assessment the present predicament. For Cuba, that means reforms to arrest its political and economic slide. For the US, it means encouraging that to happen.</p>

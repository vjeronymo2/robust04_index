			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Quiet debut for new China market: Trading volumes light on foreign exchange's first official day of operation China's interbank currency market made a quiet debut yesterday on its first official day of trading, with the yuan exchange rate fluctuating in a narrow band and eventually closing at Yn8.69 to the dollar. Trading volumes were light, said an official of the Shanghai-based National Foreign Exchange Trading Centre, which has been operating experimentally since early March. Foreign bankers said they were still seeking details of ground-rules for the operations of the new market, including its relationship with the some 100 currency 'swap centres' countrywide that it was meant to replace. Bankers were critical of what they regarded as a step back from the currency reforms announced in late December. These foreshadowed the early phasing out of the swap markets used by joint venture companies to exchange local and foreign currency. Chinese banking officials described the retention of the swap market system as 'transitional' until the national interbank market was fully operational. This may take some time since a national electronic dealing network is far from complete. The new Shanghai market, which is designed to facilitate moves towards full convertibility of the yuan, is linked to exchanges in five larger cities - Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hangzhou. A foreign banker in Shanghai said that the new interbank market was effectively a 'three-in-one' market. It would serve for the time being as a 'swap centre' for joint ventures, an interbank market for Chinese institutions and as a market for foreign banks restricted to selling foreign currency on behalf of Chinese customers. Joint venture customers are being confined to swap centre trading for the time being in an apparent attempt to lessen pressures on the market in its early phase. Bankers praised moves towards a genuine market. 'The most important thing is that the People's Bank of China (China's central bank) has decided to allow the yuan to fluctuate - to find its true value,' said one. Bankers are predicting a possible depreciation of about 10 per cent in the value of the Chinese currency to Yn9.5 to the dollar by the end of the year. But they also warn that if efforts fail to dampen inflation, currently running at more than 20 per cent in the larger cities, the yuan may well depreciate by a larger amount. China unified its rates of exchange at the beginning of this year, abolishing its official managed exchange rate of about Yn5.7 to the dollar. It adopted the prevailing swap market rate of about Yn8.7 to the dollar as the new rate. The authorities, in the initial phase of the new interbank market, are restricting fluctuations to 2.5 to 3 per 1000 to counter a possible sharp depreciation. They say this step will be temporary. Rates applying in the swap centre will track the weighted average in the interbank market. This follows objections by bankers to an initial Chinese proposal that the rate applied to swaps should be that prevailing at the close of trading on the previous day.</p>

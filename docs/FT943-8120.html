			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Yeltsin decree muddies the waters: New soft credits could set stage for political battle For the Russian government, the country's mounting debt crisis represents a political and economic Rubicon. If Russia's leaders take the potentially explosive decision to force factory managers into bankruptcy, there will, for this government, be no turning back from market reforms. This week Mr Oleg Soskovets, deputy prime minister and chairman of the special government commission convened to resolve the debt crisis, warned the nation in a television address that the government may be preparing to do just that. He said the state could not afford to bail out factories, no matter how large or important, that had through mismanagement or corruption accumulated a mountain of unpaid bills. It is not yet clear whether Mr Soskovets' hard line will become government policy. A contradictory signal came a few days earlier from Russian President Boris Yeltsin who late last week quietly announced that he would grant Rbs3,500bn - later increased to Rbs4,200bn - worth of soft credits to the defence sector and for investment. The decision, made with so little fanfare that it seemed almost clandestine, threatens to jeopardise the agreement Russia made with the International Monetary Fund earlier this year and trigger a new round of inflation. 'The Russian government has two options,' a prominent Russian private businessman said, 'either to continue with its fiscal and monetary rectitude or to again turn on the printing presses and trigger a fresh wave of inflation. Mr Yeltsin's decision is a signal that the government has chosen to turn the printing presses back on.' Officials from western financial institutions, first informed of Mr Yeltsin's decree by journalists, were equally concerned. 'It is very disconcerting,' an official said. 'They are breaking the rules of the game established with Mr (Michel) Camdessus (IMF managing director) this spring.' Russian officials insisted that the new soft loans would not push Russia over the budgetary limits agreed with the IMF. But Mr Sergei Ignatiev, a deputy minister of the economy, did predict that the new expenditures would push inflation up to 10 per cent a month by October. However, Mr Yeltsin's move represented only the first volley in a battle which observers believe will determine the fate of Russia's fragile economic reforms. As Mr Soskovets' television address suggests advocates of initially painful market reforms, who fiercely opposed the president's decision, are still fighting to introduce a series of measures which would force factory managers to bear responsibility for the mounting debt that threatens the whole economy. The debt crisis, which officials say is at the top of the government's agenda, is the first decisive test of the Kremlin's commitment to market reforms. The stringent monetary and fiscal policies which Russia adopted at the insistence of the IMF this spring cut off the soft credits which were the traditional life-blood of Russia's inefficient industries. But factory directors have managed to soften the blow by extending credits to one another. This practice, which at first shielded Russian industry from the pain of economic restructuring, is now bringing the nation's economy to a halt and factory directors are turning to the government for a bail-out. Officials from western financial institutions speculate that Mr Yeltsin, who has taken care to distance himself from the government's most painful economic decisions, 'is playing good cop to prime minister (Victor) Chernomyrdin's bad cop'. Mr Yeltsin's decision to extend soft credits, which the central bank - recently converted to fiscal orthodoxy - fiercely opposed, was made on the eve of the president's tour of Russia's industrial heartland. While he cruised down the Volga river the president was a captive audience for cash-squeezed factory directors, like the managers of the Avtovaz car plant who lobbied the president for tax breaks and more soft loans when he visited their factory. Because of the debt crisis, Avtovaz is four weeks behind in paying wages to its employees. Carmakers are not the only industrialists campaigning for an end to the government's painful economic rigour. This week the fiscal squeeze hit the sector which is Russia's greatest source of solace and one area in which Moscow rightly feels it makes a world-beating product: vodka. The Kristall factory, makers of Stolichnaya, one of the world's best vodkas, has been declared insolvent by the Federal Bankruptcy Agency. But like the carmakers, the director of Kristall is fighting back in a very public campaign to force the government to reverse its decision. He and other factory directors will be appeased by an increased flow of soft credits and an end to the state's new tough policing of fiscal mismanagement. Indeed, if Mr Soskovets' televised speech was a signal of a new government approach rather than a rhetorical testing of the waters, the Kremlin should brace itself for a fierce and public battle with the factory directors' lobby. If Mr Soskovets' tough line - rather than Mr Yeltsin's quiet granting of soft loans - is to be the new rule in Russian economic policy, then Russia could be poised for one of the most serious political battles it has yet faced.</p>

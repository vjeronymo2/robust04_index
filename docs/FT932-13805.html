			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / China's MFN status 'not linked' to Hong Kong MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, yesterday urged the US not to link renewal of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status for China to his dispute with Beijing, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. 'Please don't' bind the two issues, Mr Patten said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in the colony. 'Hong Kong would like China's MFN rights renewed this year.' US President Bill Clinton must make a decision about renewing China's preferential tariff treatment by June 3.</p>

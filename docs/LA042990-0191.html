			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUKE ELLINGTON'S MUSIC STILL SWEETLY THUNDERS  </P> <P> Edward Kennedy (Duke) Ellington would have been 91 today.  </P> <P> In a very real sense, however, the Duke lives on today through his music as it  resounds in some 50 compact discs, in hundreds of tribute albums, and in  concerts by the still-splendid orchestra that Mercer Ellington took over when  his father died in May, 1974.  </P> <P> Ellington's admirers have worked to elevate his image from that of a popular  songwriter to a more significant role as composer/arranger of orchestral works,  from three-minute masterpieces such as "Ko-Ko" and "Harlem Airshaft" to  extended pieces such as "Black, Brown &amp; Beige," "A Tone Parallel to  Harlem," "The Far East Suite" and "Night Creature" (this last recorded by the  band in tandem with the Stockholm and Paris symphonies).  </P> <P> "He is respected more than ever today; this has a lot to do with the increased  awareness of the greatness of black artists in general -- musicians, painters,  writers," says jazz composer, arranger and band leader Toshiko Akiyoshi. "The  jazz community always recognized him, but now there is more understanding of  the contribution of black artists to society.  </P> <P> "After his death, I suddenly realized that he was very proud of his race, and  some of his music was an expression of that pride."  </P> <P> "In 20th-Century music, Duke Ellington is finally recognized as one of the  half-dozen greatest masters of our time," says composer and historian Gunther  Schuller.  </P> <P> While San Francisco is staging the jazz world's major event of the day, other  celebrations are planned in New York and elsewhere. In Los Angeles, the local  branch of the Ellington Society will hold its annual birthday meeting while in  Washington, Ellington's natal town, members of a jazz ensemble from the city's  Duke Ellington School of the Arts will offer a brief program of his music at  his birth site, now known as the Duke Ellington Building.  </P> <P> San Francisco: McHenry Boatwright will be one of the singers at Grace Cathedral  when the Ellington Orchestra today celebrates the 25th anniversary of Duke's  first sacred recital.  </P> <P> Reached in Copenhagen, where he lives when not touring with the orchestra,  Mercer Ellington said: "This will be similar to the concert Pop gave when Dean  Bartlett invited him to Grace Cathedral in 1965. We'll have some of the same  artists -- Bunny Briggs, the singer and dancer, and narration by Brock Peters.  Lil Greenwood, who sang with the band in the '60s, will be back, and we'll  revive 'New World A-Comin', a piano concerto, which Pop played originally. It  will be performed by someone Ruth discovered -- Lillianne Questel, a classical  pianist from Haiti."  </P> <P> The sacred concerts fell far short of the critical acclaim for which their  composer had hoped. Some observers felt they were overloaded with vocals and  that lyric writing was not Duke's forte. Still, these presentations were  central to Ellington's thoughts in his final decade. There were three sets of  religious works, two of which were performed in many houses of prayer; the  third, completed when Duke was terminally ill with cancer, was presented at  Westminster Abbey exactly seven months before his death.  </P> <P> New York: "We'll have several observances here," said Ruth Ellington  Boatwright, Duke's sister. "As always, Pastor John Gensel will preside over the  Jazz Vespers at St. Peter's Church." (Gensel, a close friend of Duke and  longtime pastor to the jazz community, was the subject of an Ellington  composition, "The Shepherd Who Watches Over the Night Flock.")  </P> <P> Following the Vespers, the New York chapter of the Duke Ellington Society will  present a program of his music by Joe Temperley, the Scots-born musician who  took over the late Harry Carney's chair with Ellington in 1974. (Carney, the  preeminent baritone saxophonist, was in the band for 47 years, loyal to the  end.)  </P> <P> One tribute to the maestro is literally monumental. A 20-foot tall bronze  sculpture, topped off by a life-size Ellington standing at a grand piano, has  been completed and is awaiting placement in its designated site at the  northeast entrance to Central Park in Manhattan.  </P> <P> The statue was a dream of Bobby Short, the singer and pianist who over the past  few years, as president of the Duke Ellington Memorial Fund, has organized a  series of fund-raisers to pay the million-dollar fee to sculptor Robert Graham.  "It's in his studio now," Short said in a call from New York. "That area of the  park is being completely renovated and relandscaped. We have Mayor Dinkins on  our side, helping to expedite it, and we hope to have the statue in place by  the end of this year -- or at least by Duke's next birthday."  </P> <P> Ottawa: From May 17-20, the eighth annual Duke Ellington Conference will be  held at the Chateau Laurier Hotel in Ottawa. Former Ellingtonians will  reminisce about Duke and his perennial associate Billy Strayhorn (composer of  the band's theme, "Take the A Train," and close collaborator from 1939 until  his death in 1967). Alice Babs, the Swedish diva who sang and many Ellington  concerts, will come out of retirement. Harold Ashby will be there, as will  Ellington educator Kenny Burrell.  </P></p>

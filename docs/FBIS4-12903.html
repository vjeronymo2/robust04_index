			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 13 Apr (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has revealed the organization's  readiness to bolster and support Jordan's stance on lifting the  international boycott on the Port of al-'Aqabah. This boycott  is threatening the Jordanian economy. However, he added that  the Arab League has so far not received a request from Jordan on  this issue.    In a statement he made today, 'Abd-al-Majid asked the  Security Council and the United States to review this stance,  which is affecting Jordan's economy, to achieve peace and  stability in the region.</p>

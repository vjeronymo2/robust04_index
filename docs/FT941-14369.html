			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Record close as weak earnings news ignored Wall Street US equities jumped to new highs just before the close yesterday, shrugging off a string of weak earnings reports which had earlier dragged down share prices, writes Richard Waters in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average see-sawed during the day before ending at a record peak of 3,884.37 for a net rise of 14.08. It had briefly reached this level in mid-morning, before poor 1993 results from a number of companies knocked it down nearly 20 points. The market recovered briefly after lunchtime with the release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', which reported an acceleration of economic growth in some sectors, and the more positive tone continued through to the close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 followed a similar pattern, finishing 0.05 up at 474.30. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 311.4m shares. Computer and drugs stocks led the slide during the morning as leading companies in both sectors reported poor results, while banking issues continued the sell-off which has followed a recent run-up in share prices. The bad news for computer issues was delivered by Intel, the electronic chip maker, which announced figures after the markets had closed on Tuesday, and Digital Equipment, which reported a loss of 53 cents a share in its most recent quarter and cautioned about the outlook for the first half of 1994. Digital dropped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 on 2.84m shares traded and Intel surrendered Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 62 1/2 . The weakness in technology stocks helped to depress the Nasdaq stock index, which has a higher weighting towards technology companies. The index had lost 3.74 at 789.28 by the close, down from a record peak the previous day. Drugs shares were battered after Pfizer, seen as one of the stars of the industry, reported a marked slowdown in sales in the final three months of 1993. The stock plunged Dollars 5 to Dollars 62 7/8 on the day, in the process dragging down other pharmaceutical issues. Among the industry leaders, Merck shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 7/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 58 3/4 . Schering-Plough was among the biggest losers, falling Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 . Leading banks continued the retreat which has followed a strong results season. Citicorp, in spite of its recent strong earnings news, lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 1/4 . BankAmerica, the only leading bank to announce figures yesterday, dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 , as the US's second largest bank continued to feel the effects of the weak Californian economy. BancOne fell Dollars 1 1/4 on heavy trading of 3.36m shares on an analyst's report that its earnings will come under pressure, taking it to Dollars 35 5/8 , around its low for the past 12 months. Canada Toronto stocks finished on a mixed note but the TSE 300 index managed a sixth consecutive all-time closing peak, gaining 1.0 at 4,562.9, after touching 4,574.3 during the session. Volume was a brisk 96m shares valued at CDollars 1.3bn. Strong pipeline, energy and media stocks were offset by sagging gold and banking issues hit by profit-taking.</p>

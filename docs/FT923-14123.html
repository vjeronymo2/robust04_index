			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Saudis may join EFA, claims US plane maker THE US aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas yesterday intensified its efforts to get US government support to sell 72 of its F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia, claiming that indecision in Washington could prompt the Saudis to join the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme as an equity partner. McDonnell Douglas, which is financially stretched and faces a sharp decline in US defence contract work, is anxious to keep its F-15 production line open past 1994, when it will finish its last jet for the US Defence Department. But the Bush administration has been putting off a decision on the Saudi sale, which would raise controversy in Congress. In a paper published yesterday, McDonnell Douglas said that the recent German withdrawal from the EFA, along with US government indecision, 'sets the stage for Saudi Arabia to join Britain, Italy and Spain as an equity partner in a restructured European warplane project'. The paper cited various newspaper articles to support this contention. Even so, there seems to have been no official suggestion of Saudi equity involvement, although British Aerospace has indicated that Saudi Arabia might buy EFAs.</p>

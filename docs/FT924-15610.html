			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bonds turmoil batters the fixed-rate savings market - John Authers assesses the impact for private investors BONDS TURNED upside-down last month. Events in this complicated market often seem obscure compared with the impact of currencies and equities. But Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism will have profound and long-lasting effects on the fixed rates which investors can receive. Two products - annuities and guaranteed income bonds - are almost wholly reliant on the gilts market. After the last two weeks, the rates you can get from both these products could be radically different. In future, it might be better to look for security from a new range of products which rely on complex derivatives, like futures and options. So what has happened to gilts? As the graph shows, there is a steady long-term relationship between the yields on long-dated and short-dated gilts, and the bank base rate. Short-dated gilts (with five years or less until they mature) have been priced so that they offer a higher yield than long-dated gilts (with 15 years or more before the government buys them back). Yields on both have fallen generally in line with base rates. But once sterling was devalued, 'long' yields overtook those of shorts, for the first time in years. This was because of inflation expectations. Marketeers thought inflation would increase and erode the value of long-dated bonds by the time they matured. So they cut the price accordingly. That meant the yield, or income, available from them increased as a proportion of their price. Meanwhile, the prices of short-dated gilts rose, because base rates had been reduced. Cash deposit alternatives were less attractive, so dealers were prepared to pay more for short-dated gilts. Inflation is less important when pricing these gilts because there is so little time before they mature. Days earlier, the market had anticipated low inflation and high base rates. Suddenly, dealers acted on the assumption of the opposite - and the impact was soon to be felt on products available to savers. ANNUITIES Annuities guarantee to pay you a fixed annual sum until you die. You normally buy them with the proceeds of a pension fund, but they can also make sense for people a few years into their retirement who have more savings which they want to convert into income - the tax position will be better than if they are bought as part of a pension. As a rule it is best to wait before taking an annuity because rates improve as you get older. The graph below, prepared by Sage Financial Consultants, shows annuities come down in response to gilt yields, but not necessarily in response to base rate cuts. So pensioners might actually do well out of the turmoil in gilts. Brokers report that annuity rates have not increased in the last two weeks, but neither have they declined. If long-dated yields stay at their current levels, as many analysts are predicting, then annuity rates should increase. People disagree about this. William Burrows, of Sage, says: 'Annuity rates are going down. There's a lot of uncertainty, but the pressure is without doubt downwards.' Clive Scott-Hopkins, of Towry Law, thinks it best for investors to lock into annuities now. With base rates falling and annuities steady, he can see a window of opportunity. But a Norex Pensions adviser says: 'Anyone who agrees that inflation is likely to increase over the coming year need not rush to buy an annuity  - unless they want an RPI linked annuity.' The income from index-linked annuities increases with inflation. Their initial income is lower and they invest mostly in index-linked gilts. Prices for these have risen because of worries about inflation, so index-linked annuities could soon be dearer. It pays to shop around. Sage says the difference between the best and worst rates on offer can be as much as 15 per cent. GUARANTEED CAPITAL BONDS Where are guaranteed returns to be found now? The answer could be from a new product which has been made possible by advances in the derivatives market. Derivatives - futures and options - have a reputation for being risky, and if you deal in them on your own, they probably are. But they exist as a risk limitation instrument for large investors and dealers. For example, index futures allow you to protect against the risk of the FT index failing to reach a particular level. Advances in the sophistication of the market, coupled with horror on the part of investors as they watched the market turmoil last month, have led to a flood of new products for private investors. The basic concept is to allow you to freeze an advance in a market index over a certain period. Once this rise has been awarded, it cannot be taken away. Meanwhile, the funds guarantee that they will not go down in value. This allows you equity 'upside', without risking losing money. This sounds like a modernised version of 'with-profits' investments, which also aim to offer a guarantee against falls in value, combined with steady growth which once awarded cannot be taken away. But with-profits bonds have bonuses and surrender values set at the discretion of actuaries, and can fall in value. The charm of guaranteed capital bonds is that you can find out the current value of the investment just by looking up the index. Current offers come from Laurentian Life, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Dunbar Bank, Citibank Life and Scottish Provident. It is important to take financial advice on these products before investing as their flexibility varies - some lock you in for five years while others allow earlier withdrawals - and some are liable to basic rate tax. What of the future? According to Robert Benson, of Midland Montagu, who has helped design several of the products, the next development will be to introduce guaranteed pension funds of this kind and to allow regular premium savings. After that, he suggests that it could be possible to offer index-linking, links to more than one index, or currency protection.</p>

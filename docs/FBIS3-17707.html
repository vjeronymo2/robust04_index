Appearance of `Dark Horse' Unlikely"]    [Text] In an interview that Boris Yeltsin gave IZVESTIYA  late last week, the head of state confirmed his determination to  hold national presidential elections in 1996. One can conclude  from what he said that the Russian president only sees himself  taking part in these elections as a voter. Thus, there is every  reason to conclude that last Friday [25 March], B. Yeltsin  effectively announced the start of a two-year presidential race.    At the same time other, albeit less important, events last  week make it possible to speak of a new political situation that  is developing in the country today and in which the election  campaign will most likely be held, and also to talk about the  most likely favorites.    These events include the continuing scandal over the  anonymous coup d'etat scenario, A. Shokhin's appointment to  oversee the economy [kurator ekonomiki], the developing squabble  over the new customs duties on imported agricultural produce,  and the State Duma's proposal to stage a vote of no-confidence  in the government,    Analysis of all these and other events gives grounds for the  following conclusion: The structurization of the main political  forces is coming to an end in Russia. It is not the clash of  individual political figures' personal interests and ambitions  that is starting to have overwhelming importance in politics  (although that does still happen), but the clash of group  interests, and it is only as a result that conflicts arise  between the politicians that voice these interests.    For instance, the Moscow mayor's continuing attacks on the  government do not mean that Yu. Luzhkov personally cannot bear  A. Zaveryukha. There has been an obvious clash of interests on  the one hand between the agrarian lobby led by the vice premier  and national commercial capital on the other led by the Moscow  mayor.    Things are roughly the same regarding the scandal over the  coup scenario. For some reason, observers who have discussed  this subject have failed to notice a strange coincidence: The  scandal precisely coincided not only with the president's  vacation, but also with the end of the work to finalize the  draft federal budget. Although you might recall that it was the  president's refusal to sign the proinflationary budget law  adopted by the former Supreme Soviet that preceded his decision  to sign Edict 1400. As you know, the current draft federal  budget severely infringes the interests of the  military-industrial complex and a considerable proportion of the  processing industry. Reports from informed sources indicate  that serious conflicts have arisen over this between V.  Chernomyrdin, who champions, as you know, the interests of the  fuel and energy complex, and O. Soskovets and Yu. Skokov.  Although in the past V. Chernomyrdin had put forward O.  Soskovets for first vice prime minister. All these names  feature among the coup scenario's top men. It is therefore  logical to at least conclude that the appearance of the  provocative pamphlets was highly opportune.    A. Shokhin's appointment late last week to head the economy,  a post vacant following Ye. Gaydar's resignation, must obviously  be regarded as the final round of the squabble. An effective  counterbalance has been created in the person of the minister of  the economy to the first vice premier who voices the interests  of the industrial and military-industrial lobby, interests that  are incompatible with those of the oil and gas lobby.    Presumably following the president's announcement opening  the election campaign, the fighting over the budget will worsen  still further since some of the money that has been channeled  into economic sectors as a result will be used by rival groups  to conduct the presidential campaign.    The impressive force of Russian banking capital did not stay  aloof from political life last week either. The "12 December"  parliamentary group, which voices the interests of some banking  circles, declared B. Fedorov as its leader. Its former leaders  -- A. Braginskiy and I. Khakamada -- have become the group's  deputy leaders. Here, too, we can see that interests are being  structurally formulated.    It is thus easy to conclude that a new stage of development  is starting for Russian postcommunist society. Society is  becoming increasingly structured. The lone politicians whose  personal abilities recently enabled them to soar to the Russian  political heights are becoming a thing of the past, giving way  to figures backing the interests of departments, economic  sectors, and, lastly, major social strata. In this respect it  is no accident that we are seeing many political "stars" wane.  It is not individuals, but political-economic groups that have  joined the fight for power and are forming society's political  infrastructure.    At the moment this struggle is not being conducted in an  entirely civilized manner. Not by means of rivalry between  parliamentary parties and the formation of a coalition  government, but rather by lobbying, by putting pressure on top  state officials. To make up for it the first positive factor in  this new stage for Russia, where everything is always  unpredictable, seems indisputable: The actions of leaders  trying to influence the choice of the country's political and  economic course are becoming predictable. Since the interests  of the groups behind them are predictable. The time of  political intriguers seems to be passing for Russia and the time  of serious politicians is coming. And this in turn means that  it is unlikely that a "dark horse" will appear among the group  of favorites in the presidential race.    In effect, this very group of favorites can already be said  to have formed today. The central figure there is undoubtedly  V. Chernomyrdin, who is backed not only by the major Russian oil  and gas companies which bring the country around 80 percent of  its export revenue, but also the executive apparatus. Yu.  Luzhkov, who has the backing of a considerable proportion of our  national commercial and banking capital, has taken up position  slightly to the right of the former. With B. Fedorov most  likely on the very far right.    The situation on the opposite, left side of the starting  line, where heavy industry, the military-industrial complex, and  structures engaged in arms exports, are to set their  participants, is more complex. The strongest candidate here is  Yu. Skokov. However, he has little chance of reaching the  finishing line first, primarily owing to his characteristic  style as an "inaccessible" [zakrytyy] politician. The "Zemskiy  Sobor" scenario that Deputy V. Isakov proposed in the past would  be more promising for Yu. Skokov. But judging by B. Yeltsin's  interview with IZVESITYA, that is ruled out. Thus, the  "military-industrial complex team" will most likely have to  choose between two politicians who have expressed a desire to  defend its colors. Namely V. Zhirinovskiy and A. Rutskoy. The  final choice will presumably fall on the person who most  convincingly proves his loyalty to the team, as well as his  manageability and predictability.    Amid this group of favorites V. Chernomyrdin looks the main  contender for victory. If only because experience of all manner  of elections and referendums held in Russia over the last two  years shows that contests are won by the man who is able to rely  on the state apparatus and has budget funds at his disposal.  But two major factors will work against the premier. First, he  will be constantly threatened with the possibility of the Duma's  staging a vote of no-confidence in the government. The first  proposal of this kind by I. Muravyev, member of the "New  Regional Policy" faction, last week was just a trial shot. Such  attempts should be expected to increase in the future  particularly if the other participants in the contest agree  among themselves to join forces in toppling their most dangerous  rival.    But an even more serious factor that may effectively work  against the prime minister will of course be the state of the  Russian economy on the eve of the elections. One is bound to  bear in mind the specific nature of Russian voters, who, as the  results of the 12 December elections showed, vote "against"  rather than "for." So if the economic situation has not  improved by the time the elections are held, one should not rule  out the idea that most voters will vote against V. Chernomyrdin  and the existing regime and vote for A. Rutskoy or V.  Zhirinovskiy, otherwise, they will vote against the threat of  war and political instability.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Astanin, chairman of the Board of </F> Directors of the Russian Selling House, by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA  correspondent Mikhail Volkov in Volgograd; date not given: "The  Russian Selling House Is a Truly Unique Finance Company in  Russia"]    [Text] Why so? Everything is quite simple. The  Russian Selling House is perhaps the only private finance  company for now which makes it possible for you, my dear reader,  to get rid of the fear of having things stolen on a train or  plane, at a railway terminal, and so on.    For example, you live in Vladivostok, and you are about  to travel to Moscow. How much money does one need for the trip?  Certainly a full wallet.... However, you will not have this  problem at all if you become a depositor of the Russian Selling  House. That is to say, you will pay in the money to its  Vladivostok office, and as soon as tomorrow, or a month or a  year from now--whenever you need--you can withdraw all or some  of your money, but certainly with interest, in Moscow, St.  Petersburg, or dozens of other cities in Russia and even  Ukraine....    Aleksandr Astanin, chairman of the Board of Directors of the  Russian Selling House, began our conversation by saying: "For  now, only Ukraine outside of Russia. However, we are planning to  open branches, first throughout nearby foreign countries and  then in many distant foreign countries.    [Volkov] Do you mean to say that you will work with the  currencies of the former Union republics?    [Astanin] Precisely. Potential depositors, for example, in  Kazakhstan will be given an opportunity to deposit their  tenge-denominated savings at our local branch and withdraw  rubles in Russia--naturally, at the exchange rate we set.    [Volkov] Aleksandr Valentinovich, it appears to me that you  yourself are not aware of the full significance of this project.  I for one am from the so-called near abroad and, as the saying  goes, have learned the hard way about the problems of the  segment of the local population which some silly politician  named "Russian-speaking." Some 30 million Russians who remained  after the disintegration of the Union in its former republics  were, in essence, robbed once again after the introduction of  national currencies. When they leave these states, the money is  exchanged for them with a lot of friction, or the exchange is  rejected outright, with references made to a lack of Russian  rubles. The exchange frequently occurs at locally set,  unrealistic, extortionate rates. If you succeed in carrying out  your project, millions of Russians will be forever grateful to  you.    [Astanin] It is no accident that our house is called  Russian.... However, one would think that this project would be  advantageous in every sense for the authorities of nearby  foreign countries, too. First of all, we will relieve them of  some of the problems of conversion; the population will be  happy; what else do the authorities need?    [Volkov] How do you manage to attract depositors?    [Astanin] By absolute trust and the ever present desire to  comply with the will of our clients. For example, a client  brings his money to us today, but tomorrow changes his mind and  wants it back. We will give him the money back right away, but  with interest for the day. Who else, apart from us, will add the  daily dividend for him? Incidentally, we have never promised  people fabulous profits. However, our depositors have always  known that each 1,000 of their rubles "gains" 3 rubles [R] per  day, and effective 1 March of this year we "threw in" another R2  on our own. From now on, each R1,000 invested yields R5 per day  to our clients. I will stress--it is R5 per day, with a  100-percent guarantee of receipt of the invested funds in full  and with interest immediately upon demand in virtually any city  in Russia.    [Volkov] In Volgograd, the "cradle" of the Russian Selling  House, the company has not, so to say, always been in the  clover....    [Astanin] Correct. At first they looked askance at us; some  members of officialdom viewed us disapprovingly: What if the  leaders of the company "make tracks" for foreign lands with the  cherished attache case? However, the Russian Selling House has  never intended to swindle anyone. On the contrary, in April of  last year we indexed the deposits of the population by 30  percent at once. The house invested and is still investing its  spare funds in real estate and many other things that will not  be carried abroad in any manner. I will now divulge just one  commercial secret: We own real estate throughout Russia on a far  greater scale than some companies that specialize in this. It  appears that something is afoot in Volgograd, too.    [Volkov] Indeed, at a recent press conference the governor  of  the oblast stated that he is not against selling to your company  an unfinished hotel building downtown--the sickening  construction project without an end.    [Astanin] We will be happy to buy this "masterpiece" of  Soviet industry and turn it into a "dandy." Of course, it is  nonetheless quite offensive, in human terms, that they took so  long to accommodate us, and what did this result in? A few days  ago two well-known soccer teams played at the local stadium, the  Rotor and the Uralmash.... Who would you have us root for? For  our Rotor from Volgograd, or for the visitor Uralmash, which our  company bought not so long ago?    [Volkov] Nonetheless, as you put it, something is afoot in  Volgograd. But what about other regions?    [Astanin] We find good shelter almost everywhere. They know  about us, and local leaders very frequently facilitate our  "acclimation" in every way possible. Difficulties with the  central departments continue. To this day we have been unable to  get a license in Moscow. The Central Bank passes off all our  letters to the Ministry of Finance, and the latter passes them  off to the Central Bank. We intend to finally break the vicious  circle. We will take the matter to the courts. Besides, we will  open several banks at once in the large cities of Russia.    [Volkov] Are these the immediate prospects?    [Astanin] The most immediate. At the same time, we resolved  to invest funds in establishing powerful facilities in the  construction industry (we are projecting a construction "boom"  by the end of the 1990's), the development of communications,  transportation, and many other economically advantageous  projects.    [Volkov] Therefore, you plan your operations, do you not?    [Astanin] Definitely. This is a guarantee of success and the  necessary condition for founders, who are young and energetic.  S. Gruzin and A. Solomadin were there at the outset of the  Russian Selling House, and at present they are the originators  of most if not all fruitful ideas that sustain the company. I am  not afraid to say that it is precisely due to planning our work,  both in the long run and on a daily basis, that we have more  than 1 million depositors and a wonderful infrastructure all  over Russia, that we are establishing contacts with various  countries, and that we have provided jobs for 10,000 people. To  be sure, we are not the trailblazers in this area: Japanese and  American businessmen have always planned their operations....</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WAYNE DESCRIBES ATTACK, COURT FIGHT FOR DAUGHTER  </P> <P> Aissa Wayne took the witness stand Wednesday at the trial of her ex-husband,  Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, to describe for jurors the beating she and a boyfriend  suffered two years ago in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> But once that short narration ended, Wayne, the daughter of John Wayne, spent  the next two hours immersed in cross-examination about the bitter battle that  she fought with Gionis over custody of their daughter, who was almost 2 years  old at the time of the assault.  </P> <P> Prosecutors say it was because of that custody fight that Gionis ordered the  attack on his former wife. His alleged motive was to have Wayne "taught a  lesson."  </P> <P> "Everything I did, there was controversy," Wayne testified. "They were  constantly coming up with stuff."  </P> <P> Gionis, 37, hired private detective Dan Gal to spy on Wayne to see if she was  spending time with the child with the intent of using the information as  evidence at a custody hearing. But on Oct. 3, 1988, Gal sent two henchmen onto  the grounds of the Roger W. Luby estate in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Wayne and Luby, her boyfriend at the time, had just returned from a health  club. One of the two assailants beat them up -- Luby's right Achilles' tendon  was cut and Wayne's face was smashed into the concrete several times -- and  then tied their hands behind their backs with tape in Luby's garage.  </P> <P> Gal and the two assailants have all admitted their roles in the assault. The  man who beat them, Jerrel Hintergardt, has already been convicted at a separate  trial and is serving an eight-year prison sentence. Gal and the other  assailant, Jeffrey K. Bouey, are awaiting trial, but Bouey is expected to be  permitted to plea-bargain in exchange for his testimony.  </P> <P> "(Hintergardt) was calm, deliberate, but loud," Wayne said in describing the  attack. "He took control immediately." After the beatings, Wayne said, she  yelled for Luby's "houseman," who got a knife and cut the tape on their wrists.  </P> <P> Gionis and his attorneys claim that Gal acted on his own and that the doctor  was unaware anything but legitimate surveillance was going on.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Gionis was worried that he was losing the custody  battle and wanted to intimidate Wayne with the rough treatment. But Gionis  attorney John D. Barnett contends that Gionis was actually winning the custody  fight, so he had no reason to want Wayne injured.  </P> <P> To delve into that issue, Barnett has shown jurors monthly charts that depict  Gal's surveillance of Wayne from March through September, 1988. Gal's reports  show Wayne spending very little time with the child.  </P> <P> "I dispute that," Wayne said.  </P> <P> "So Dan Gal is just a liar?" Barnett asked her.  </P> <P> "I know he is," she replied.  </P> <P> Those were welcome words to Barnett. In a pretrial hearing, he acknowledged to  the court that a major part of the Gionis defense will be to cast doubt on  Gal's credibility. Gal has told authorities that Gionis instructed him to  organize the assault.  </P> <P> Wayne lost the custody hearing that followed the assault. But she did regain  custody after Gionis' arrest. Gionis now has court-monitored visitation rights  with his daughter, who will be 4 on Valentine's Day.  </P> <P> One controversy is whether Wayne should have taken the girl on a vacation to  Sedona, Ariz., without the doctor's permission two months before the beating  incident. It was almost immediately after that incident, prosecutors contend,  that Gionis decided to teach Wayne a lesson. Wayne insists she thought that the  vacation was permitted under the court's rules.  </P> <P> Wayne made a public statement complaining that Gionis, who had custody of their  daughter Tuesday, had the girl in the courthouse hallway. She called it "vulgar  and inappropriate." She also complained that Gionis was not accompanied by the  court-appointed monitor who was supposed to be with him and the girl.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Gionis responded to her criticisms, saying only: "She knows I'm  not going anywhere. She can get a court order about it if she wants."  </P></p>

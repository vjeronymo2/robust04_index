			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION FEARS NEW DICTATORSHIP;  </P> <P> KREMLIN: RADICAL LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE A PLAN TO ELECT GORBACHEV PRESIDENT WITH  EXPANDED POWERS. EVEN LENIN IS ATTACKED FOR ABUSING POWER.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bid for greater powers to overcome the Soviet  Union's deepening economic crisis drew sharp criticism Monday from opposition  members of Parliament, who warned he could quickly become a dictator.  </P> <P> Calling the move to amend the constitution and elect Gorbachev to the new post  a "gross and grave mistake," radical historian Yuri N. Afanasyev said the  Inter-Regional Group of Deputies believes that fundamental constitutional  reforms should be undertaken first to ensure the country's democratic  development.  </P> <P> The group, which has the support of more than 400 members of the Congress of  People's Deputies, is threatening to vote against the amendments or simply  boycott a vote today, thereby endangering adoption of the measure by the  required two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies.  </P> <P> Passage of the amendments would be followed today or Wednesday by Gorbachev's  election by the deputies to an initial four-year term. In the future,  presidents will be chosen directly in nationwide elections for five-year terms.  </P> <P> "What we are doing now is in reality legitimizing the personal power of a  specific man, Mikhail Gorbachev," Afanasyev told the Congress, the Soviet  Union's national Parliament. "Do we need this? Does the country need this? Does  he himself need this? Our current difficulties are not due to a lack of power  but to a lack of trust in it."  </P> <P> The Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, which has come to function as a virtual  opposition party in the Parliament, wants the Soviet constitution rewritten  entirely before a strengthened presidency is created. It also believes that  Parliament's powers must be increased as a check on the executive and that the  new federal structure be developed to assure the rights of the country's  constituent republics.  </P> <P> Afanasyev went further, however, arguing that the abuse of power by previous  Soviet leaders -- V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik who founded the Soviet state, as  well as dictator Josef Stalin, who succeeded him -- should be a warning against  the creation of a strong presidency.  </P> <P> "If our leader and founder laid the foundations of anything," Afanasyev said,  shouting over the objections of other deputies in a rare public attack on  Lenin, "it was the institutionalization of a policy of mass violence and  terror. He also initiated the rule of lawlessness as state policy. This was  true throughout the Stalin period. It brought many victims."  </P> <P> But other reformers, who were the first to propose that a "strong hand" guide  the nation through its current multiple crises, supported the constitutional  amendments as the only way to ensure action, particularly on economic issues.  </P> <P> "The economy is simply going to the dogs," Nikolai P. Shmelev, a prominent  liberal economist, told other deputies. "We are now living in a lunatic asylum,  and we are living by its rules."  </P> <P> Shmelev, who again called for bold government actions such as encouragement of  private enterprise and extensive foreign borrowings to reverse the country's  downward economic spiral, dismissed arguments that the new presidency would be  too powerful; the proposed legislation contains guarantees against  dictatorship, he said, and the Congress itself would remain the ultimate  authority.  </P> <P> The case for the new presidency, which will give Gorbachev powers roughly akin  to those of the U.S. and French presidents, was made largely on the basis of  what Sergei S. Alexeyev, chairman of the Committee for Constitutional  Compliance, called "a paralysis of power" in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Due to the withdrawal of the Communist Party from day-to-day management of the  government and the economy as well as its broad loss of authority, the  traditional political structures have lost most of their power -- and state  bodies have not yet acquired it, Alexeyev said.  </P> <P> "In these conditions, the presidency is the only effective measure to transfer  power from the party structures to state bodies," he said.  </P> <P> Anatoly I. Lukyanov, Gorbachev's deputy, sought to reassure the deputies on how  much power the Soviet leader would have and what checks there would be on it.  </P> <P> "There are no grounds whatsoever for the suspicions, kindled by some people,  that the institution of the post of president allegedly leads to the  establishment of authoritarian personal power," he said. "The proposed bill  contains a whole system of guarantees against trends of this kind."  </P></p>

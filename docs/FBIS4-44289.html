			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Larserik Haggman, editor in chief of Nordic </F> Council magazine NORDISK KONTAKT: "The Nordic Region and the EU"]    [Text] Following the 1980's, in which there was a lack of  intellectual interest in Nordic affairs and often justified  criticism of official Nordic cooperation, the 1990's dawned,  bringing with them a new attitude.    Researchers who had not managed to seriously devote  themselves to the static Nordic Region discovered a new interest  after the end of the Cold War and saw it as a duty to study the  challenges facing the Nordic countries and the Nordic Region as  a whole.    Denmark saw a chance to get the other Nordic countries into  the European Union EU and went about it so zealously as to cause  irritation on the part of its neighbors.    In Norway, the experience of 1972 awoke in many leading  politicians a fear of losing Nordic cooperation as well if  Sweden and Finland joined the EU.    When Sweden, with no advance warning, announced its  intention  to apply for membership, its action clearly upset the Finnish  and Norwegian timetables, but it obviously also left the Finnish  establishment with no choice.    Naturally, as far as Sweden was concerned, this was mainly a  matter of trying to protect its own primarily economic but also  political interests in the rolling integration process, but it  is very likely that there was also some thought of the  possibility of heading up a Nordic group in a larger context.    Finland was in more or less the same position as Norway  (except for the petroleum). Psychologically, it seemed obviously  impossible that the EU's border might run through the Aland Sea,  especially since as far as Finland in general is concerned, the  Nordic Region is almost synonymous with Sweden.    The Nordic argument in favor of EU membership went furthest  in Norway, where it began to be said that the path to the Nordic  Region led through Europe. But in Sweden and Finland as well,  the nationally deep-rooted and innocently positive attitude  toward the Nordic Region was assiduously taken up as an argument  in favor of EU membership.    The new prime ministers, Carl Bildt and Esko Aho--both  Nordic  supporters and former members of the Nordic Council--shared an  obvious frustration, dating from the 1980's, with the  ineffectiveness of Nordic cooperation. That feeling was  expressed in many contexts, and it also colored the Nordic  reform efforts undertaken by the two prime ministers along with  their colleagues in Denmark, Iceland, and Norway.    At the same time, that same frustration and the picture of  Nordic affairs that was being presented in the media undermined  some of the credibility of the no side's arguments in favor of a  Nordic Region as an alternative to the EU.    The common feature in work to reorganize the Nordic Council  has been an effort to remove everything that will be handled by  the EEA [European Economic Area]/EU, emphasize Nordic culture  and identity, and, lastly, take the step from formal cooperation  to informal consultation.    There is a lot that can be said about the probability of a  common Nordic front in the EU, especially in light of the number  of Nordic failures in "major" political areas, but the  "official" viewpoint has come to be that the EU will benefit  Nordic affairs and that Nordic cooperation can be successful  only within the EU, provided that it takes the form of  consultation.    But here we come up against a problem. So far, Nordic  affairs  have been a matter of interplay between popular opinion and  direct, natural contact on the one hand and, on the other,  permanent dialogue between members of parliament and governments.    But if the major (EU) issues are removed from cooperative  dialogue and replaced by quick and frequent consultations, what  will distinguish Nordic affairs from general international  affairs? Is direct, practical, and somewhat elusive Nordic  cooperation to be replaced by intrinsically and obviously  intensive top-level contacts? And how will the link with popular  organizations and civic organizations--or broader expressions of  Nordic political opinion--be handled?    Regardless of which solutions the Nordic countries choose in  this fall's referendums on the EU, there is reason to begin a  debate, sometime before the overall picture emerges, regarding  the entire many-faceted Nordic issue, high-level support for the  policy, the channels of communications from the bottom up, and  the various institutional alternatives that may exist.    The Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish EU negotiations gave no  impression of any broader Nordic teamwork beyond consultation  and the exchange of information. And the EU is skilled at  playing one country off against another. This supports the  opinion that Nordic affairs have had their day and that the  issue now is Europe. But if that is so, there will have to be  support for that decision--or else.</p>

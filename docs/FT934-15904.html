			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith steady The strength in WH Smith shares continued, yesterday's unchanged 461p giving them a 5.2 per cent rise this week. The stock has been lifted by press reports that Smith and Boots will soon announce a rationalisation of their loss-making Do It All home improvement business. It is estimated that around 60 sites may face the axe. But there is growing speculation that the companies may have found buyers for a good proportion of those sites facing closure and that the exit costs will be less than some analysts had feared. Boots shares edged forward a penny to 483p. Good results from Etam were spoiled by a cautious sales statement and the shares fell 11 to 258p. Lloyds Chemist included a dividend boost with its results and the shares appreciated 15 to 284p. Among food stocks, Dalgety was wanted on dividend considerations, the shares climbing 12 to 496p. BZW was said to be recommending Northern Foods, up 6 to 259p. Commercial Union firmed 2 to 637p, after it said its enhanced scrip dividend alternative is to be priced at 630.7p. BZW was reported to have downgraded several stocks in the sector. These included Willis Corroon which lost 8 to 206p, and Sedgwick, where the shares gave up 7 to 168p. Among banks, Royal Bank of Scotland succumbed to profit-taking and the shares ended 6 down at 342p. A 'buy' recommendation from NatWest Securities boosted MB-Caradon and the shares moved 7 ahead to 334p. Worries about its Pounds 250m proposed joint venture with Taiwan continued to overhang British Aerospace and the shares closed 6 lower at 393p, with dealers suggesting that 390p had proved a support level. BAe shares were said to have been in heavy demand in after-hours trading following an announcement after the market closed that it was to sell Ballast, its Dutch based construction and international contracting business, for Pounds 175m. Dealers said IMI had suffered from a profits downgrade from Smith New Court and the shares shed 3 to 292p. US buyers were reported for British Steel and the shares hardened 3 to 128p, in trade of 6.6m. Profit-taking after the recent strong performance from TI Group saw the shares relinquish 11 to 360p. Engineering group FKI continued to find support ahead of an analysts visit to the US begining this weekend. The shares put on another 3 1/2 to 171 1/2 p. The departure of Rothmans from the FT-SE 100 sent its stock tumbling 21 to 623p. Growing interest in next week's presentation in Paris by paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins saw a climb of 5 in its stock to 229p in strong volume of 3m. A rise of 7 was mustered by ICI to take its price to 735p although that was achieved in very weak volume. One analyst said that such thin turnover was a sign that the much-talked about interest from US buyers was perhaps not as strong as may have been thought. Activity in BOC was substantial and the shares climbed 5 to 631p with 1.7m shares traded. BTP continued its steady rise of recent days with a gain of 4 to 285p. The stock has benefited from a recent buy note from Hoare Govett. Lucas Industries firmed 2 to 157p, ahead of figures next week and continued talk of a new chief executive. The retaining of its FT-SE 100 status by SmithKline Beecham helped the stock rise 3 to 370p, as did a buy note from Strauss Turnbull. Glaxo, after a moderate run lately on the back of generally positive sentiment about the company, fell victim to some profit-taking and retreated 4 to 654p. Wellcome bounced on a recommendation by Kleinwort Benson to buy and ended the day 10 up at 708p. Following good results on Wednesday, Manchester United rallied 38 to 580p. Ladbroke weakened 4 to 176p. The company announced after the market closed that it had reached agreement with the Mail on Sunday over the newspaper not repeating certain allegations.</p>

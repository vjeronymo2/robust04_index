			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIME -- WARNER DEAL;  </P> <P> ROSS CELEBRATES VICTORY BY MAKING PLANS FOR EUROPE  </P> <P> Once again, happiness is at Steve Ross' fingertips.  </P> <P> The longtime Warner Communications chairman came to Los Angeles on the wings of  victory and a corporate jet Monday night for a party at record producer Quincy  Jones' house, following the Delaware court ruling that cleared the way for  Warner's acquisition by Time Inc.  </P> <P> He spent Tuesday, his first full day as co-chairman and co-chief executive of  Time Warner Inc., in meetings in a Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow, and on the  spur of the moment granted an interview.  </P> <P> Sporting a "Batman" pin on his lapel, to honor Warner Bros.' blockbuster film  that has grossed $190 million at the box office, the 61-year-old executive had  every reason to exult. But he talked most about competing in Europe, and he  urged other American industrial leaders to follow the Time-Warner example in  merging.  </P> <P> "The most exciting thing to come out of the Delaware court is that companies  really have the right to combine . . . (and manage their businesses) for the  long term, because without that, American companies are down the tube," Ross  said.  </P> <P> Seven grueling weeks have passed since Paramount Communications launched its  surprise attack on the Time-Warner deal, threatening to undo Ross' most patient  handiwork. He had spent 2 1/2 years putting together a stock-swap merger with  Time, which appeared certain to win shareholder approval until Paramount made  its hostile bid for Time on June 6.  </P> <P> The Paramount bid forced Time and Warner to regroup. The two companies  abandoned the stock swap for Time's $14-billion acquisition of Warner, which  would not require a shareholder vote. The maneuver outraged some Time  shareholders but survived the courts, which ruled that directors have a right  to manage corporations for long-term goals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Laden With Debt  </P> <P> Under the revised deal, Warner is now a 58%-owned subsidiary, with the  remaining shares expected to be acquired in the next three or four months once  a formula of cash, stock or debt is negotiated.  </P> <P> The deal leaves Time Warner laden with debt that Ross would have preferred  using for acquisitions, but on Tuesday he declared: "We'll just have to do it  in different ways, that's all."  </P> <P> Hollywood and Wall Street wags say Ross has every reason to rejoice. His old  Warner employment contract entitles him to a $180-million payout, and he has  been guaranteed the chairman's title of the new company for the next decade.  </P> <P> But close associates insist that the deal means more than title and money to  Ross, who built Warner into a glittering entertainment conglomerate from the  unlikely origins of his in-laws' funeral parlor business.  </P> <P> True, Ross is a product of Brooklyn who loves hobnobbing with Hollywood talent,  but he has earned Wall Street's respect for his business acumen. Ross steered  Warner through severe losses in the early 1980s, when the video game industry  collapsed, and repeatedly outwitted his largest and most dissident shareholder,  Chris-Craft Industries, in the board room.  </P> <P> Ross demonstrated Tuesday that his solicitous attitude toward performers and  producers won't change, taking pains to explain that Quincy Jones' party was  not held in Ross' honor but was instead a surprise birthday party for Jones'  close friend, Verna Harrah.  </P> <P> And Ross was cautious about outlining any plans for Europe, where he traveled  recently as his lawyers girded for the Delaware battle.  </P> <P> "I don't want to warn our own competition by saying: 'This is what we're going  to do here,' and 'This is what we're going to do here.' "  </P> <P> But boosting Time Warner's overseas revenue is clearly a major objective.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bleakest Moment  </P> <P> "You must be situated in Europe by 1992, because you're going to have one  country for all intents and purposes . . . (and) because in any industry,  there'll be a Bertelsmann," Ross said, alluding to the West German publishing  giant and 12 countries' plan to form a single European market.  </P> <P> The Time Warner deal "puts us 50% larger than Bertelsmann, which is great,"  Ross said.  </P> <P> As he reflected upon the events leading up to the merger, Ross said his  bleakest moment occurred when Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis telephoned his  decision to make a cash bid for Time Inc.  </P> <P> "The sweetest moment was when we concluded the initial deal," Ross said, with  some wistfulness for the stock swap that would have avoided debt. (Ever the  diplomat, he later added both the lower and appellate court decisions, as well  as "today, because of the exciting future of Time Warner.")  </P> <P> And there were funny moments, such as Monday, when Cable News Network lost its  audio signal just as the Delaware Supreme Court panel announced its decision.  Ross, who was watching the televised proceeding at his New York headquarters,  said he held his breath, waiting to see which legal team would begin hearty,  congratulatory handshakes.  </P> <P> His did.  </P></p>

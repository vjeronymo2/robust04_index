"My first step will be the creation of an authoritative  delegation which would go to Moscow to conclude a close economic  and cultural union with Russia", he said in an interview with  the business "VEK" (CENTURY) newspaper on Friday.    The Crimea was handed over to Ukraine by former Soviet  communist leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, but Meshkov believes  the people of the peninsula remained a part of the Russian  people.    "As far as the Russian people are concerned -- I believe  that  before and after 1954 the people of the Crimea were a part of  the Russian people. I hope the restoration of unity,  unification is an issue of the near future", he stressed.    Meshkov who was inaugurated on Friday insists that the  Crimea  should hold a referendum on independence despite the ban of  Ukrainian authorities.    "The acting ban of Kiev on holding the referendum has no  grounds", he said adding that enough signatures had been  collected in the Crimea in favour of holding the plebiscite.    "The talk is about the right of the Crimea to independently  determine the contents and forms of its relations with  neighbouring states", Meshkov said.    The president also said that the Black Sea Fleet which is  disputed between Russia and Ukraine should not be split and  should remain Russian. However, he added that the fleet should  help create the Ukrainian Navy.</p>

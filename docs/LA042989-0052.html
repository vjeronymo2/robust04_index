			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S RULING PARTY IGNORES FOES, OKS BUDGET  </P> <P> The ruling Liberal Democratic Party overrode an opposition boycott Friday to  ensure final enactment of Japan's budget by May 28, raising confrontation in  Parliament to a new peak.  </P> <P> At the same time, the prospects for swift selection of a successor to outgoing  Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita grew more clouded as the consensus choice,  Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party's Executive Board, called a news  conference to reiterate his refusal to take the job.  </P> <P> The ruling conservatives rammed the budget for the 1989 fiscal year that began  April 1 through the House of Representatives, fixing May 28 or shortly  thereafter as a deadline for Takeshita to submit an official resignation. The  prime minister repeated Friday his Tuesday declaration that he would resign  after the budget is enacted because of his implication in the Recruit Co.  influence-peddling scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effective Automatically  </P> <P> Although the budget was sent to the House of Councilors, a constitutional  provision ensures that it will go into effect automatically 30 days from now  even without a vote in the ceremonial upper house.  </P> <P> It was the first time that the lower house had ever passed the budget without  any opposition party members attending.  </P> <P> Struggling through mobs of shouting opposition members who tried unsuccessfully  to block his passage, Speaker Kenzaburo Hara made his way to the main chamber  of the lower house with the help of parliamentary guards. After a pro forma  12-minute committee report, 281 representatives voted for the budget.  </P> <P> One unaffiliated member cast a negative vote and another unaffiliated member  voted for the budget. Three ruling party members said they stayed away to  express their disapproval of the unilateral action and 13 other members were  also absent. The ruling party holds 296 seats in the 512-member chamber.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders charged that the unilateral vote was designed to cover up  details of the scandal focused on Recruit, an information and real estate  conglomerate accused of trying to buy influence with political contributions  and stock profits.  </P> <P> Takeshita, who received $1.12 million in stock profits and contributions from  the firm, said he was resigning to assume responsibility for the scandal.  Opposition parties, however, continued to insist that former Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone be forced to testify under oath about profits his aides made  from insider trading in stocks of a Recruit subsidiary.  </P> <P> Takeshita's decision to assume responsibility for the scandal represented the  limit of concessions that the ruling party was willing to offer the opposition  to end its eight-week boycott, conservative leaders said.  </P> <P> Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialist Party, the main opposition party, said  it would "continue fighting until the lower house is dissolved for a general  election."  </P> <P> Socialist Shinnen Tagaya, deputy speaker of the lower house, resigned the  chamber's No. 2 post in protest.  </P> <P> Assuming responsibility for the confrontation, Toshio Yamaguchi, the Liberal  Democrats' lower house steering committee chairman, also resigned, a lead that  Hara, the Speaker, was expected to follow.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ito, the man who ruling party leaders, including Takeshita,  reportedly had agreed should lead the party and the nation, rejected a request  by Shintaro Abe, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, that he succeed  Takeshita.  </P> <P> Ito told reporters after meeting Abe that his "resolve to decline the offer is  extremely strong."  </P> <P> "If I became (the leader), it would lead to a situation creating trouble for  both the party and the nation," Ito, 75, said in what appeared to be a  reference to his health. He suffers from diabetes and reportedly has also  developed heart trouble.  </P> <P> "A young person should be chosen to carry out political reforms. I won't do  it," he had said earlier.  </P> <P> The former foreign minister also complained about moves to select a new lineup  of party and Cabinet officials before the selection of a new party president,  who will become prime minister.  </P> <P> Those moves, "although an insult (to the new leader), are not the reason for my  refusal," he said Friday. "I said I would decline even before personnel moves  began."  </P> <P> Ito said the party also should firm up a commitment to political reform before  selecting Takeshita's successor.  </P> <P> Ito and Abe, however, agreed to Takeshita's request for a suspension in  selection activity until after Takeshita returns May 7 from a nine-day trip to  five Southeast Asian nations. He is to leave this afternoon for his first stop,  Bangkok, Thailand.  </P> <P> Analysts remained divided over whether Ito will ultimately reject a formal  request, which would come from Takeshita himself. But they noted that Ito, who  has a reputation for standing by his word, has repeated his disavowals for four  straight days.  </P> <P> If Ito sticks to his refusal, the ruling party faces a succession crisis. All  of its major leaders have been tainted by the Recruit scandal, and the only  other untainted "dark horse" available, Masaharu Gotoda, is reported to be  unpopular among fellow conservatives.  </P> <P> Gotoda also has rejected suggestions that he replace Takeshita.  </P></p>

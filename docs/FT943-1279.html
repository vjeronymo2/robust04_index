			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Music as a fashion statement The South Bank's International Chamber Music season, which opened with a concert by the Endellion String Quartet and guests at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday, has been image-brightened. One knew this from the orange, blue and pink spotlighting and the dim house-lighting. One knew it, too, from the players' studiously informal attire. It was made explicit in a programme-note, and its fatal consequences were sensed when Andrew Watkinson, the first violinist, stood up before the account of Beethoven's Op. 127 quartet to tell us what a privilege it was to be able to perform such great music. This mawkish spiel had the insidious effect of making us hear the Endellions being privileged rather than Beethoven's direct utterance. The hall was full and people surely had not come to have Beethoven sold to them. Not surprisingly, it was hard to assess the Endellions' interpretation of this piece. Extremely skilful, certainly, but not very startling or deep. Their account of Britten's early Three Divertimenti had been far more impressive, if only because a dazzlingly virtuosic handling of its wonderfully bare and simple textures is 'all' that this music demands. Interestingly, the violist, Garfield Jackson, was playing the same instrument used in the premiere of the work's original version as Alla Quartetto Serioso in 1933. This we learned from a chatty piece in the programme book, where the players gave their thoughts on the evening's music to Anthony Burton, and which confirmed one's impression that the concert and concert-series have been thoroughly Radio Three-d, which is to say, Classic FM'd. The appearance of Jean-Yves Thibaudet, pianist for Schubert's Trout Quintet (the double bassist was Duncan McTier), confirmed one's impression that music-making is becoming just another kind of fashion statement. His bejewelled suede slippers and seriously red socks threatened to draw attention entirely away from what his hands were doing; though his limber and very speedy dexterity in the gorgeous fourth movement - the famous bird-twittering, fish-leaping Theme and Variations - was a wholly musical adornment to the work; and the performance was altogether stylish, energetic and enjoyable.</p>

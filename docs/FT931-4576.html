			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: The Pru leads the charge as bondholders join battle - Nikki Tait reports on the furore surrounding Marriott's demerger plans THE SIGHT of The Prudential, one of Britain's largest institutional investors, rampaging through the UK corporate arena is familiar enough. It features less frequently on the US stage. But a furore over plans by Marriott Corporation of the US to divide itself into two separately-quoted companies has pushed the Pru - via PPM America, its Chicago-based fund management arm - into the limelight. The battle lines were drawn last October, shortly after the Maryland-based lodging and food services group had announced plans to spin off its financially-healthy hotel operations from its troubled property business. Under this 'demerger' scheme, Marriott would place its lodging business, together with its food and facilities management operations, in a new company, to be called Marriott International. Shareholders would receive shares in the new company pro rata to their existing holdings in Marriott Corp, and Marriott International would be quoted in New York. This would leave the existing company - to be renamed Host Marriott - holding most of the group's property assets and its airport and toll-road concessions. Host Marriott would also be saddled with the bulk of the group's long-term debt, totalling about Dollars 3bn. From the company's viewpoint, the scheme's advantages were plain. Marriott's management businesses, freed from the debt burden and the overhang of property assets which had proved hard to sell, could power ahead more aggressively as the recession ended. Not surprisingly, Marriott Corp's shares took heart. Having fluctuated around Dollars 15 to Dollars 17 for much of 1992, the stock rose by more than Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 1/4 on the news, and closed yesterday at Dollars 26. But if shareholders - who still include the Marriott family with about a quarter of the equity - had reason to smile, Marriott Corp bondholders were less fortunate. Analysts noted that Host Marriott would have debt of Dollars 2.9bn and a debt-capital ratio of 92 per cent. It would hold unsold property assets, the value of which could be affected by the vagaries of the US property market. The adequacy of the cash-flow coverage at Host Marriott was also questioned. Credit-rating agencies shivered. Moody's moved Marriott's existing debt securities from investment to non-investment grade rating, and Standard &amp; Poor's put them on 'credit-watch'. Bond prices plunged. In December, some of the bondholders - led by PPM - sued. Their action related directly to a Dollars 400m sale of debt securities by Marriott in early 1992, and alleged the company knew the spin-off plan was being prepared even as it was selling the new notes. Apart from PPM America - acting on behalf of Jackson National Life Company, the Pru's US life-insurance subsidiary - 14 institutions were named as plaintiffs. Together, they claimed 'the market value of the shareholdings of the Marriott family increased more than Dollars 47m,' as a result of the plan, 'while the aggregate value of the plaintiffs' notes declined in excess of Dollars 35m'. Then, in late-December, Marriott announced it was talking to several bondholders, represented by Goldman Sachs, in the hope of 'advancing the company's objectives' while making the deal more attractive to investors. It is these talks which Marriott now says are close to a resolution. Details of the impending agreement have not been released, but it seems likely the pact would involve shifting a larger portion of the debt to Marriott International and, perhaps, enlarging the Dollars 600m credit facility that Marriott International would provide to Host Marriott. The problem is that the lengthy negotiations have resulted in a split in bondholders' ranks. While the 'Goldman' bondholders have been negotiating with Marriott, the PPM America group has been preparing to litigate over the demerger scheme - and, so far, the 'litigating' bondholders do not like what they have heard about the proposed deal. 'Without being specifically aware of the proposed settlement terms, my general understanding is that it doesn't respond to our requirements,' says Mr John Stark, PPM America's general counsel. Mr Stark is quite clear what PPM wants. First, it is seeking to restore the bonds' credit quality; second, it wants the bonds to return to their 'full trading value'. For the latter demand to be satisfied, Mr Stark claims the bonds would need to trade at around 113; the likely Marriott-Goldman deal, he argues, would barely return them to par. Meanwhile, S&amp;P's made clear on Monday that although a transfer of between Dollars 350m and Dollars 700m of debt from Host Marriott to Marriott International might improve the bond ratings, it would be unlikely to lift them from a 'low to mid-speculative grade'. PPM has a broader point to make, arguing that dangerous precedents, eroding bondholders' protection, are being set, and this could be part of a worrying trend. It points to recent prospectuses for debt offering from Lockheed and Tiphook. These included a clause saying the company's covenants to bondholders might have 'limited, if any applicability, in the event of a highly-leveraged transaction or leveraged buy-out initiated or supported by the company.' Such language, PPM notes, is either new in investment grade offerings or, at the very least, more prominently presented. The Securities and Exchange Commission says it knows of no recent rule change which might have triggered the new language, although full disclosure is an age-old policy. Posturing is a familiar feature of US corporate wrangles. But, so far, everyone is sticking to their guns. PPM America says it plans to file an expanded suit against Marriott this week, alleging fraudulent conveyance. Marriott is seeking to have the litigation dismissed next month, and is sticking to its mid-1993 timetable for the demerger. Battle has been joined.</p>

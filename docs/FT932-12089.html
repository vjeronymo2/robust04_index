			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Observer: Pizza-work It was daughters' day-out yesterday. Ms Foundation, a women's rights group in the US, was promoting the nation's first 'take your daughter to work day'. So in the spirit of the times, Geoffrey Dennis, New York head of research for London brokers James Capel, took 10-year-old Katie first as a fellow-traveller on his commuter train and then to watch him at work. The idea was to give the girls greater confidence in pursuing a career, but, lest general ennui should be the result, many companies laid on presentations for the 9-15 year-old schoolgirls: at IBM, a panel discussion; at Newsweek, lessons in magazine production; and at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a pizza futures trading session. Let's hope the dough was for physical delivery.</p>

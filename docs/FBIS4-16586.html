			<p>BFN     [Text] The Second Congress of Russian Cinema Workers opened  in Moscow on Saturday. A message from President Yeltsin to its  participants stresses that "the unique potential of Russian  cinema must be preserved at all costs."    On Friday, he signed a decree on a protectionist state  policy  in the national cinema art. Support for cinema is recognized in  this document as crucial to the government's cultural  development plans. The decree obliges the cabinet to set aside  funds for the national motion-picture industry and submit a bill  on national cinema to the Federal Assembly within three months.    There are nearly 300 film-makers at the forum in Moscow.  Secretary of Russia's Cinematographic Union Sergey Solovyev, a  film director, spoke about the Russian cinema's plight and ways  to overcome it. The congress will last two days.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Given the enormity  and monstrousness of the Hebron mosque massacre, it was only  natural for the Arab delegations to suspend the Washington  bilateral talks to protest the massacre and demonstrate  solidarity with the Palestinian Arab people.    The paper adds: It is illogical for the negotiating process  to remain at Israel's mercy, and hostage to its bloody crimes.  Likewise, it should be unreasonable for the Arabs to continue to  conduct the negotiations on the basis of commitment to the peace  process when the Israelis are free of any obligations or  commitments.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In its open war, Israel has been  engaged in programmed terrorism, in a war of extermination and  destruction in the name of peace. The Arabs are always asked  not to protest to avoid inflaming emotions, and so that the  peace process may not be undermined. To put it bluntly, the  Arabs alone are asked to show flexibility, exercise restraint,  and receive blows to maintain the momentum in the peace process  as if the Arabs alone are the party concerned with this process.  The Arabs are perceived as the party that must reward Israel  and make concessions that consecrate the usurpation of Arab  territories and rights, as well as submission to Israeli  dictates and domination.    The paper says: Had Israel been in the Arabs' shoes; namely,  had it been the victim receiving blows and the target of daily  air raids and shelling, in which the most sophisticated weapons  are used, and had the massacre struck a Jewish synagogue instead  of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque or the Sayyidat al-Najat Church,  certainly the reaction of the West, and the United States in  particular, would not have been so timid or confined to  condemnation and denunciation. Had this been the case, the Arabs  would have become the target of a sweeping campaign.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the  shocking and horrendous Hebron massacre has turned many concepts  upside down and changed many things. Thanks to this massacre,  it has become difficult to continue the bilateral talks, or  resume them as if nothing has happened. Salvaging the peace  process and the stalled peace talks requires the application of  all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it honor the relevant  international legitimacy resolutions and conventions, respect  human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm settlers, and return  to the Arabs all their territories and rights.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Observer: Dust to dust Powell Duffryn's interest in bidding for British Coal's South Wales operations has the kind of historic ring that would surround, for example, attempts to rehabilitate descendants of the tsars in Russia. After all, Powell Duffryn was the biggest British coal company controlling more than 60 pits and employing more than 32,000 miners before the industry was nationalised in 1946. The company was detested, not least for its decision to 'encourage' miners to dig bigger lumps of coal by equipping them with tools resembling pitchforks rather than shovels. Like Russia's monarchists, though, the company has durable roots. About 150 years ago, its founder, Thomas Powell, introduced the first locomotives to the Welsh coalfields and founded a coal-shipping business which, to this day, is one of its main activities. Its influence persisted even after nationalisation - the National Coal Board's first chairman was Lord Hyndley, the company's former managing director, and another PD man was the NCB's first director for marketing. Subsequently, it formed a joint international mining consultancy with the Coal Board and even opened a travel agency which served the Coal Board's staff. There will be those in south Wales who will view its return with as much enthusiasm as the Russian serfs would welcome a tsarist revival.</p>

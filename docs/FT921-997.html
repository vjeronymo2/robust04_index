			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil to state coffee pact stance THE BRAZILIAN government is expected to make an official statement today to reveal a position favourable to the establishment of quotas by exporting countries in the negotiations on the International Coffee Agreement, which begin in London on April 6. Mr Oswaldo Aranha Neto, president of the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (Febec) confirmed that 'a clear consensus exists' to back economic clauses based on quotas. Febec had originally favoured a buffer stock scheme instead of quotas. The National Coffee Council, a producers group, had been lobbying hard for a return to a quota system. Officials in both the economy ministry and the foreign ministry continue to refuse to comment about the likely Brazilian position. Mr Francisco Rezek, the foreign minister, is reported to have discussed the Brazilian position in the negotiations with President Fernando Collor de Mello at a meeting yesterday. London traders said coffee prices reached the day's highs on news that the Brazilian government was set to announce its official position on the coffee pact, reports Reuter. But prices soon drifted lower again, with May closing Dollars 1 down at Dollars 873 a tonne. In the morning it touched a low of Dollars 866 a tone. 'The market is not taking seriously anymore these comments that are coming out of producing countries,' said one trader.</p>

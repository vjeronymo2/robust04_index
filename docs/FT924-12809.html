			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ptarmigan takes first step into engineering for the second time this year - at 2p on Friday, pending shareholders' approval of a reorganisation. The group, which operates hotels, makes artificial flowers and children's hats, publishes illustrated books on cookery, crafts and cake decoration, has taken the first step in a complete change of activity. It is currently valued at Pounds 300,000. It has conditionally agreed to acquire three engineering companies - Thomas Eaves, HA Birch and Airmatic Engineering - from Prospect Industries for Pounds 6.5m nominal of 4 per cent (gross) convertible redeemable secured loan stock. The plan is to dispose of the existing Ptarmigan businesses and acquire engineering companies in niche markets. Ptarmigan also unveiled reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 735,000 (Pounds 2.67m restated and after Pounds 1.95m amortisation of goodwill) and losses per share of 5.07p (22.92p) for the year to June 30. Turnover was Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 4.52m) and operating losses came to Pounds 444,000 (Pounds 169,000). Mr Philip Wilbraham, chief executive of Prospect and its chairman since June 8 when Mr Richard Richardson resigned and was appointed executive chairman of Ptarmigan, said the three companies were 'peripheral' to his company's core. The disposal - subject to the approval of both sets of shareholders - would reduce Prospect's borrowings by Pounds 800,000. He said full conversion of the loan stock would give Prospect 52m Ptarmigan shares, or 77.99 per cent of its equity. In that case the Takeover Panel would waive the obligation on Prospect to make a general offer. Mr Wilbraham was non-executive chairman of Ptarmigan until June 8, when Mr Richardson arrived. On the same date Mr Colin Davies, chief executive and finance director of Ptarmigan, resigned as non-executive director of Prospect. Ptarmigan's statement said: 'The acquisition agreement does not contain the usual level of warranties and indemnities that a purchaser would expect to obtain when purchasing a private group of companies. However . . . the necessary conditions for continued bank support of Ptarmigan may not be fulfilled and facilities not made available should the acquisitions not be completed and, as a consequence, the company may be unable to continue trading.'</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / UK Gilts: Sun still shines on the long end JUST when you think it is time to get out of the water, the sun comes out again. So it has been with the UK government bond market. The rally that had extended for the past three months taking long-dated maturities to record highs was, by the early part of last week, beginning to look slightly waterlogged. Dealers at some UK investment houses said overseas investors, particularly from the Middle East, were pocketing profits. Overseas buyers have been one of the mainstays of the rally with gilts seemingly offering a way into a strengthening pound plus an economy growing with low inflation. Thus it had begun to look comparatively chilly for long gilts even before the German Bundesbank's decision to leave its discount rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. Economists had expected a cut of at least a quarter percentage point which would have given an opportunity for hard-pressed European economies, such as France, Belgium and Denmark, to cut rates. In the event UK gilts were sidelined after the news but sterling jumped sharply and the FT-SE 100 index hit record highs. Then, on Friday, the sun came out again with a 1.25 point surge in 10-year gilts and heavier gains at the ultra-long end of the curve. Part of those gains represented position taking before the long bank holiday weekend but there was also a view that if ERM interest rate cuts are being pushed further back a UK cut is also less likely. The receding prospects for monetary easing encouraged investors to move assets towards the long end of the yield curve, which reflects the prospects for low inflation. The question that continues to hover over the long-dated end of the curve is whether gilts are nearing the end of their bull run. UK institutional investors, used to years of domestic boom-bust economics, have been particularly wary of the argument that low inflation is here to stay. However, Mr George Magnus, of SG Warburg, believes that long yields have further to fall and could break through 7 per cent before the end of the year. 'We are revising our forecasts for yields of all the long-dated maturities. As people become more accustomed to the idea of low inflation yield curves will continue to flatten,' he says. He views both domestic and global factors as perpetuating the rise and the main four reasons he cites for a continuation of the trend are: The subdued outlook for UK inflation The possibility of fiscal tightening at the November budget A downgrading of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement forecasts The generally favourable environment for longer dated bonds. Ms Jane Sargent, Hoare Govett's head of fixed interest research, agrees that any weakness in the gilts market will be short-lived and cites the strong demand for BT's Pounds 500m Eurosterling issue last week as underlining the seemingly insatiable appetite of overseas investors for sterling bonds. The Bank of England took advantage of Friday's gilts surge to announce Pounds 800m worth of taps consisting of Pounds 400m of 9 per cent conversion stock maturing in 2000 and Pounds 400m of 8 per cent Treasury stock expiring in 2009. Even Mr John Shepperd, of Yamaichi, who takes a pessimistic view on the future of the UK government bond market, acknowledged that the overseas buyers were back in force on Friday. However, he says their impact was exaggerated because dealers were unwilling to upset their books before the weekend and consequently prices were squeezed higher than the buying would normally have taken them. Much depends on whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, is prepared to cut base rates again within the next few months. Whatever the outcome Mr Shepperd feels that the sunshine is unlikely to continue and long yields have fallen as far as they can. 'A base rate cut has already been discounted,' he says. 'We are at the bottom of the inflationary cycle and although PSBR pressures have been reduced, that reduction has already been taken on board. 'Also the government won't tighten fiscal policy and we are in a fairly robust recovery which is bound to have some impact on the inflation rate.' Yamaichi has lowered its current long yield forecast to take into account what it sees as the short-term move to long gilts following Germany's discount rate stance. However, the revised figure is 7.7 per cent, some 40 basis points higher than current levels. Over the week, 10-year gilts saw a fall in yields of about 13 basis points to 6.84 per cent. Further out, the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 2017 was quoted at 116 5/32, yielding 7.3 per cent compared with 115 3/8. Index-linked gilts also rose sharply.</p>

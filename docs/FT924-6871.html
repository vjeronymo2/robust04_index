			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont leads Tories' retreat from pay policy THE government yesterday appeared to draw further back from the idea of a national pay policy as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted that the 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector was necessary, but failed to repeat ministerial encouragement to the private sector to follow suit. Opening the two-day Commons debate on last week's Autumn Statement, Mr Lamont emphasised the critical role of a tight control on public spending in restoring economic confidence and hastening recovery. The need to protect capital programmes and invest in education and health had made it essential to adopt 'a firm stance' on public-sector pay in order to control public spending without restraining the growth of services. Instead of echoing Mr John Major's urging of similar pay restraint in industry and business on Monday, however, Mr Lamont contrasted the public and private sectors, pointing out that many private-sector employees had had pay cuts and that settlements were at a 25-year low. The earlier invitation to pay restraint in the private sector drew a sharp attack from a former Tory cabinet minister. Mr John Biffen criticised the government for 'wheeling out the wayside pulpit', and said that if wealth creation meant anything, it meant 'rewards for success'. While Mr Lamont repeated the exhortation to business to take advantage of the Autumn Statement measures for sectors such as the housing and motor industries, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, warned that such moves were costly and would not yield the expected benefits. They did not measure up to the scale of the task. He pointed out that the proposals made by the chancellor were of a scale the Tories had derided when Labour had made similar suggestions before the election as part of a national recovery programme. Under pressure from Tory backbenchers and from Mr Lamont to explain how he would finance the extra measures he thought necessary, Mr Brown said that one possibility was a tax on the utilities. But his central argument was that people would not have the confidence to begin spending and investing until the fear of unemployment had receded, and so an employment policy was a vital element in government efforts to assist recovery, which even Tories now seemed to accept was necessary. The government itself was now 'an obstacle to recovery', he added, because people had no knowledge from week to week of its policy, and no faith that it would keep to it. Running through the economic 'experimentation' of the 1980s, Mr Brown mocked the government's economic policy now as simply being based on Mr Lamont's judgment. 'Every day is judgment day - Norman's wisdom,' he said. Like Mr Brown, Mr Alan Beith, for the Liberal Democrats, complained that the chancellor, having accepted the case for fiscal stimulus, had not done the job properly.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CRACKS DOWN ON ILLEGAL WINE IMPORTS;  </P> <P> CRIME: SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF 14 SMUGGLING AND LABEL FRAUD CASES HAS  RESULTED IN MORE THAN $200,000 IN PENALTIES.  </P> <P> The federal government said last Thursday that fraud and smuggling of imported  wine is on the rise and that it has successfully prosecuted 14 cases and has 70  more cases under active investigation.  </P> <P> "Our recent investigations have shown a definite increase in illegal activities  in wine imports and we intend to take all steps possible under the law to stop  it," said Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms.  </P> <P> Candace Moberly, chief of the special programs branch of the ATF, said ATF  recently concluded 14 cases that resulted in more than $200,000 in penalties  and taxes.  </P> <P> In addition, she said, ATF has 70 ongoing investigations of label fraud and 23  more cases targeted for investigation. In those actions, some 17,000 cases of  alcoholic beverages have been detained at ports of entry, she said.  </P> <P> Moberly said most of the products discovered to be fraudulently shipped to the  United States are small shipments "aimed at ethnic communities."  </P> <P> She gave only one example of an "ethnic product" -- a Portuguese brandy that  was labeled as wine to avoid paying a higher excise tax.  </P> <P> "We're looking more particularly at ethnic areas because there are certain  products that people are accustomed to drinking that they may not be able to  get domestically in the United States," she said.  </P> <P> "The most common practice is manipulating the label and submitting false  documents to customs to avoid the proper tax classification." She said ATF,  which has about 650 field inspectors, has found some products being smuggled  into the country uncaught by customs inspectors.  </P> <P> She said this is possible because "Customs officers are overwhelmed and they  tell us they can only check something like 10% of the containers that come in.  </P> <P> "So they'll open the door of a container and what they see is what they check  against their manifest. If something (illegal) is buried in the middle of the  container, chances are unlikely it will be caught."  </P> <P> She said in one case, an ATF inspector "picked up a Portuguese product in our  market basket sampling and saw there was a problem," and then tracked the item  back to the importer. She said investigators recently have "picked up a steady  stream of problems, and in some cases it isn't just mislabeling; in some cases  it's outright fraud."  </P> <P> She said some importers bring in products that ATF, the branch of the Treasury  Department that regulates alcoholic beverages, has prohibited for various  reasons. "Or they are simply lazy, and they stick on an old label that does not  represent the product."  </P> <P> In one case recently settled, she said, a company paid $130,000 in offers in  compromise and criminal fines, plus tax penalties and interest, after pleading  guilty to felony smuggling and label fraud.  </P> <P> Two companies that have paid fines for infractions are Hoffman Imports of  Carlstadt, N.J., and Chapon Wine Merchants doing business as Chapon Imports in  White Plains, N.Y., Moberly said.  </P></p>

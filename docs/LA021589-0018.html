			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOUNTAIN PARK  </P> <P> Thank you for your evocative editorial ("A Park in the Balance," Jan. 25)  saluting the federal-state partnership in the Santa Monica Mountains. We are  very proud of the role we played in transferring Circle X Ranch and Campground  to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area.  </P> <P> In the last few years over 65,000 acres have been acquired in public trust in  the scenic Santa Monica Mountains. In addition, the conservancy has fostered  volunteerism in the Santa Monica Mountains. In 1988 the estimated value of  volunteer effort exceeds $1 million. With over 40 million visitors to the parks  and beaches of the Santa Monica Mountains, your editorial set forth the  outstanding recreational opportunity and public resources the mountains offer  the Southland.  </P> <P> RORIE SKEI  </P> <P> Chair, Santa Monica  </P> <P> Mountains Conservancy  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

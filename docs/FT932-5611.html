			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Belize PM calls snap general election MR George Price, prime minister of Belize, has called a general election for June 30, 15 months before it was constitutionally due. The announcement came a few hours after the resignation of Mr Jorge Serrano as president of neighbouring Guatemala. He and Mr Price had reached an accord to end Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim on the former British colony in Central America. The Belizean opposition is claiming that the government has no plans to defend the country against any invasion by Guatemala. Britain announced last month that it is to withdraw its 1,400-strong garrison in Belize. British troops had been stationed there to deter Guatemala from military action to pursue its claim. Mr Price's People's United party has a comfortable parliamentary majority, and the election is expected to keep it in power at the expense of the main opposition United Democratic party.</p>

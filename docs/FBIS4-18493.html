			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lyon court dealing with internal disputes in the  French civil service ruled on 6 April in favor of rescinding the  deportation order of two young Algerians arrested during a  demonstration in Lyon.    Contrary to what the interior minister [Charles Pasqua] has  argued, their deportation was not an absolute necessity, the  judges said.    Abdelhakim Youbi, 20 years old, and Mouloud Madaci, 18 years  of age, were deported on 23 March.    The two young men are to be repatriated soon.</p>

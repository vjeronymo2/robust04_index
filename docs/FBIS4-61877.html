			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakh and American Government delegations failed to  reach mutually acceptable agreements on ways to dismantle  missile-launching installations in Kazakhstan, First Deputy  Defence Minister Alikbek Kasymov told INTERFAX on Tuesday.    According to him, a major issue at their talks concluded in  Almaty on Saturday was the fixing of terms on a tender for the  work of dismantling the silos, and the participation of Kazakh  firms in the tender. However, a mutually acceptable solution  failed to be reached.    Kazakhstan believes that though the tender submitted by the  U.S. Government is "open, because of its stringent conditions  the participation of Kazakh firms in it is problematic,"  Kasymov said.    Those who intend to take part in the tender are the  joint-stock company Katep (Kazakh nuclear energy industry), and  two holding companies -- Special Installations and Construction.  The talks are to be continued, Kasymov said.</p>

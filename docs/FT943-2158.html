			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: 'Bloody fight' for emerging markets Mr Jeffrey Garten, US commerce undersecretary responsible for international trade, yesterday predicted that large emerging markets, such as China, Indonesia and India, will be the battlefield for 'a bloody fight' as companies from industrialised countries vie for markets and government contracts. In a speech prepared for delivery yesterday in Chicago, Mr Garten said the aggressive commercial policy adopted by the Commerce Department is being integrated into US foreign policy 'as never before'. The US will continue to champion human rights, but it has now accepted business's contention that commercial engagement furthers human rights goals. Mr Garten, who has become the chief interpreter of Clinton administration trade policy, outlined Washington's mobilisation of both government financing and resources for the US assault on 10 'big emerging markets'. These BEMs also include Brazil, Argentina, South Korea, South Africa, Poland, Turkey and Mexico. Export promotion, he said had 'moved out of the shadows' to the centre of trade policy. This has been demonstrated by the significant deregulation of export controls, expansion of trade financing facilities, and the establishment of export assistance centres around the US and commercial centres abroad. The aggressive US strategy deploys the president, cabinet members and other senior officials in a co-ordinated pursuit of business. President Clinton, for example, contacted the Brazilian president, Mr Itamar Franco, to push a successful Raytheon bid for a Dollars 1.5bn environmental technology project. Mrs Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, is due to arrive in Pakistan today with more than 50 US business executives 'to support Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's plans to boost Pakistan's electricity supply'. US government and business leaders meet frequently to co-ordinate business strategies and government policy. The US plans to expand training of foreign managers and technicians, who would be be 'inclined to buy American goods and services,' Mr Garten said. 'Stronger bilateral links between Washington and each of the BEMs are critical,' Mr Garten said. In the Cold War, US linkages were often through military exchanges and training programmes: 'Now and in the future, the most important links will not be men in uniform carrying weapons, but men and women in blue suits carrying laptops.' Mr Garten said the BEMs must feel the new World Trade Organisation is sensitive to their interests. 'Because they have such large internal markets, they have more of an option of slowing their integration into the world economy with protectionist measures than do smaller nations,' he said.</p>

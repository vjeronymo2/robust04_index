			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Gyula Horn [chairman of the Hungarian  Socialist Party -- MSZP], coalition talks should start as early  as next week, providing both the MSZP and the SZDSZ [Alliance of  Free Democrats] agree to cooperate. This was said by the MSZP  chairman in Hungarian TV's "Napkelte" [Sunrise] program.    Speaking about relations with the unions, Horn said that if  the new government fails to reach an agreement with the  organizations representing the interests of those living on  wages and salaries, there will be no social peace, and in that  case no self-moderation by the principal protagonists in  political and social life could be expected, despite the fact  that this is overwhelmingly necessary.    If trade unions experience, as they have in the past four  years, that agreements which they sign are subsequently kicked  aside by the government, then whatever the composition of the  new government, confrontation will inevitably arise between the  unions and the government, Gyula Horn warned. He added that  Sandor Nagy [chairman of the National Federation of Hungarian  Trade Unions] also believes that an economic and social  agreement should be reached as soon as possible. In the  framework of the agreement they would handle the crisis in a way  contrary to the method used by the previous government, which  would permit an improvement for those living on wages and  salaries.</p>

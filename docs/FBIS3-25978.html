			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren and Wing Kay Po: "Mainland No To Funds for </F> Airport"]    [Text] China has rejected the Government's latest airport  funding proposals despite enormous concessions offered by the  administration. A New China News Agency (Xinhua) official has  snubbed the offer on the grounds that it falls short of China's  demands. The Xinhua official said Beijing still insists that  the maximum debts for the Special Administrative Region (SAR)  government should not exceed $20bn. The latest funding  proposals would leave the SAR government between $20bn and $30bn  in debt.    The official maintained that the Government is still  breaking  the Memorandum of Understanding which stipulates that Government  borrowing should not exceed $5bn without China's blessing. The  Executive Council yesterday approved a new funding proposal  which involves an equity injection of about $60bn into the  Provisional Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway  Corporation.    China has been angered further by the Governor, Chris  Patten,  calling the concessions a "new year present". The official,  obviously upset by the Governor's remarks, said: "It is not his  present. The money belongs to Hong Kong people."    There was an indication that China may be willing to soften  its stand, despite its initial harsh reaction to the proposals.  The Xinhua official welcomed the Government's overtures,  hinting Beijing may be willing to negotiate on the latest offer  at a reconvened airport committee meeting. There has been no  airport committee meeting under the Joint Liaison Group since  last August. Beijing may also be willing to be more flexible on  the sale of land along the airport railway.    A spokesman from the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land  Commission was cautious in his reaction. "The disposition of  the airport-related land is part of the overall funding package  of the new airport," he said. As long as the Government can  assure China that the 62 hectares of land over the airport rail  link stations will be sold in phases over the next three years,  Beijing would not insist that it should be included in the  annual land sale programme.    China's official reaction has been echoed by Tam Yiuchung, a  Pro-China legislator and the chairman of the Democratic Alliance  for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). He said that the  Government's proposal would still not satisfy China. "Sixty  billion might sound a lot, but it's only $15bn more than the  Government had already agreed to inject into the airport in its  last proposal," he said. DAB proposed last week that the  Government provide a total of $89.2bn for the $99.2bn airport  and related railway project.    The Government is likely to face an uphill battle in getting  Legislative Council support for the new airport funding  proposals. The United Democrats' spokesman on the airport,  Albert Chan, said his party will not accept a $60bn equity  injection into the airport unless the proceeds from land sales  are included. Chan said that this equity should not come  entirely from the Hong Kong government, but also from the SAR  government. Chan said that he felt that China's demands were  "unreasonable" and that the Government had been "weak" in  complying with China's wishes.    Howard Young, a Liberal Party legislator, said his party  would only approve a financial package affordable to Hong Kong.  "We will examine very carefully if the amount of equity  injection would have an adverse impact on social expenditure and  public works," Young said. "We'll look at any plan in the  context of Hong Kong's overall financial situation, its  surpluses and reserves," he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China should protect  its cultural legacy, particularly cultural relics, when it  pushes ahead with its modernization program.    This call for the protection of relics was made by many  members of the national committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at its current session.    Bi Keguan, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of  Arts, said that it is a common understanding of Chinese at home  and abroad not to destroy, over one morning, cultural legacies  left over by their ancestors.    Referring to the Three Gorges Dam Project in particular, Bi  said the government should adopt proper policies and put in  enough funds to rescue cultural relics in the area before a huge  reservoir begins to emerge behind the dam.    He cited for protection such cultural sites in the area as  an  ape-man fossils site, stone-age ruins and residential buildings  of the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368-1911).    He urged relevant departments to try every means to detect  relics still buried underground.    Relevant departments should also seek financial aids from  Chinese people at home and abroad and from the international  community.    Jin Shangyi, professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts  and a noted oil painter, pointed out that the smuggling of  antiquities is running rampant on the mainland and so is ancient  tomb robbery. In some areas, he added, people even used  explosives in tomb robbery and some workers charged with legacy  protection even took part in such criminal activities.    He called on all social sectors to make joint efforts to  curb  such evils which, on the part of some people, result from  poverty, ignorance and lack of scientific knowledge.    Jin suggested the building of a national art museum as a way  to protect cultural relics.    Bi Keguan said, however, that at present museums on the  mainland are afflicted with fund shortages. For instance, due  to a lack of money, he said, the China Arts and Crafts Gallery  which cost 200 million yuan to build was leased to a foreign  company after two years of operation.    Wu Guanzhong, a noted painter, said that in recent years  some  areas paid no attention to the protection of relics, but spent  huge sums of money constructing replicas of ancient buildings.    "We should draw on the successful experience of foreign  countries in building museums and protecting cultural legacy,"  Wu said.</p>

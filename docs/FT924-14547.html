			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: New indices for specialist investors THE NEW stock market indices recognise a growing demand from investors for a wider range of real-time benchmarks against which to develop investment strategies and judge their performance. In recent years the FT-SE 100 and the FT-A All Share Index of 653 stocks have been challenged by fund management firms which have designed their own proprietary indices to measure the performance of key market segments. Hoare Govett's Smaller Companies Index has been matched by a similar one from County NatWest, and James Capel has developed its own 'Tootsie' index of the 100 companies ranking just below the FT-SE 100 in terms of market capitalisation. Now, the creation of new indices bearing the FT-SE imprimatur, which focus on medium-sized and smaller companies are expected to provide a boost to specialised fund management. 'There is a growing move towards specialisation in the fund management business,' said Mr David Twiss, general manager of MAP Securities, a fund management firm specialising in quantitative techniques. 'You will now have recognised benchmarks to measure performance against.' While clients such as pension fund trustees may once have handed their portfolio to a single manager to run a balanced fund, the new benchmarks may encourage trustees to break up their portfolios, handing a part to a smaller companies expert or one specialising in the new FT-SE Actuaries 350. Moreover, says Mr Robert Brown, head of the structured equity group at County NatWest, the existence of new indices is likely to raise investor consciousness about passive management techniques, in which portfolios mimic the components of a single index. While more than half the domestic equity funds in the US are managed in this fashion - for far lower fees than those charged by active managers - it is estimated that no more than 12 to 15 per cent of the UK market is managed in this way. The creation of a new, widely-accepted index may well encourage clients to examine more closely the performance of market segments relative to each other, says Mr Brown. For instance, at times of great volatility in the FT-SE 100 index, share prices in the next 250 companies may move relatively little. And for the first nine months of 1992, the FT-SE 100 has produced a return of 6.2 per cent, compared with a return of 5.6 per cent for the FT-A All Share Index and a negative return of 9.5 per cent for the CNW Smaller Companies Index, CNW's own proprietary index. In explaining the disparate performances of the FT-SE 100 and the All Share indices, fund managers point to the significance of the 10 per cent of smaller companies in the broader index. Mr James Woodlock, head of quantitative investment management at BZW Investment Management, noted that the returns generated by small companies differ by as much as 30 to 40 per cent when compared with those of large companies. Thus, the extent to which small companies are represented in a portfolio could significantly affect returns. Meanwhile, the creation of the new indices is likely to spur the creation of new retail investment products, said Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Combined Actuarial Performance Services, which measures pension fund returns. 'The very fact that additional indices are being created will encourage fund managers to devise funds to track them,' he said. But the extent to which the new indices, however effective as benchmarks, become widely accepted by investors may well depend on the development of hedging tools. 'These new benchmarks will be successful as and when new derivative contracts based on them take off,' said Mr Andrew Threadgold, chief executive of PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund and its largest internally managed index fund. Such derivatives are likely to be over-the-counter products developed by individual banks, rather than exchange-traded instruments, at least in the short term. The London International Financial Futures Exchange said yesterday it had no plans yet to launch any futures or options contracts, though it would watch the development of the new indices carefully. Two factors will determine whether an active derivative market builds up around the indices. One is the extent to which institutional investors use the indices; if they take up the FT-SE Mid 250, for instance, then a futures contract would provide a way of reducing or extending exposure to the sector quickly without trading the underlying stock. Investor interest takes time to build, though, and is not enough on its own. The ill-fated futures contract based on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 of continental European stocks was withdrawn after it failed to gain enough momentum, despite the Stock Exchange's claims that the index has developed a good following among investors. The second ingredient is the active involvement of investment banks and others willing to trade the contracts - for instance by arbitraging between the futures and the underlying market. Such arbitrage in the case of stocks outside the FT-SE 100 could prove difficult, though. The 'touch' (the difference between the best buy and sell prices) of Mid 250 stocks is almost double that on the FT-SE 100, reflecting the relative lack of liquidity in these stocks. Experience elsewhere suggests that smaller company indices, and the derivatives based on them, pass in and out of favour very rapidly. In the US in the first three months of 1991, for instance, small and medium-sized stocks that were not in the S&amp;P 500 index saw a 35 per cent price appreciation, while the larger stocks were barely breaking double-digits. Institutional traders, not wanting to miss the action, looked around for an easy way to trade the smaller equities, and persuaded Standard and Poors to construct a 'Midcap' index. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched futures on the Midcap 400 in February, about a year after the 1991 small-stock rally began. The contract caught the tail-end of the excitement, but volume faded along with hopes for a strong economic recovery. The Midcap 400 futures now trade about 525 contracts per day, and anaemic turnover compared with the S&amp;P 500 futures' robust 57,000. At the American Stock Exchange, where options on the Midcap are traded, volume is larger, with daily figures hovering around 4,000 contracts. Equity traders say the Midcap was generated by the whims of the market, and has suffered with the overall market weakness this year. The S&amp;P 500 index return is flat so far in 1992, and the Midcap 400 has underperformed the S&amp;P 500. 'Bottom line,' one trader says of the Midcap futures, 'this thing is struggling, its not dead.'</p>

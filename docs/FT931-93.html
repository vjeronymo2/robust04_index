			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Siemens plans shake-up of nuclear power business SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics engineering group, is to restructure its nuclear power business. A factory at Bergisch Gladbach will be closed, accounting for 930 of the 1,100 jobs scheduled to go in the nuclear sector. A further 700 jobs will be cut elsewhere in the group's power generation and distribution arm, KWU. Siemens' nuclear division, which last year contributed around DM1bn (Dollars 600m) to KWU's DM6.6bn turnover, is to be split into nine independent profit centres. 'We must continually improve our cost situation, the better to resist international competition in the long-term,' said Mr Adolf Huttl, the Siemens main board director responsible for KWU. Dresdner Bank yesterday announced an unchanged DM12-a-share dividend for 1992 and a DM350 price for its planned two-for-19 share issue, Reuter reports.</p>

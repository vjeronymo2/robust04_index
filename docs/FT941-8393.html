			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Go Baltic while there's time - John Westbrooke finds that western influence is affecting Russia's former satellites For a few months, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were on the front pages, pulling out of the crumbling Soviet Union on a last-in-first-out basis . . . then they were gone again, their news value usurped by bloodier conflicts. So, the three new Baltic nations were reborn quietly; few people were aware of them before, and few are now. Go there and you will seldom see another tourist: just rolling farmland, birch forests and unexpectedly fine cities. Tallinn, Estonia's capital, is the most picturesque, with medieval alleys winding up Toompea hill, heart of the Old Town, its skyline punctuated by slender church spires and stout defensive towers: Arrow Sharpener Tower, Fat Margaret Tower, Peek into the Kitchens Tower. If you do not feel like walking, a little blue tourist train called Toomas will carry you. From the top you can see out over the town, or across the Gulf of Finland towards Helsinki. The Finns and Estonians are related and so are their languages, which specialise in double letters (the television in our hotell offered erootic films). The locals claim to be sober, hard-working Lutherans. Our guidebook informed us, sagely that 'an Estonian knows that 'more people drown in a glass of spirits than in the sea' and that 'an inn is the Devil's chapel'. Interesting, if true. They would be the only teetotallers north of Watford. We found them polite and helpful although few spoke English. In the post-Soviet economic confusion, crime has spread alarmingly. 'Not all you read (about safety) in the Financial Times . . . should be taken too seriously,' cautions Tallinn's City Paper, only to admit a few pages later that its murder rate is higher than Detroit's. Take comfort, though: it is mostly gangsters killing one another. Riga, capital of Latvia, is much bigger. With nearly 1m people, most of them Russians, it was a major Soviet port. At ground level, it feels a solid city full of worthy stone edifices recalling 19th century bourgeois respectability. There are even some old Zeppelin hangars, now housing the town market. The delight is in the details: this is an art nouveau city to equal Prague or Vienna, and some 800 buildings reflect Jugendstil in big ways or small. Many were designed by Mikhail Eisenstein, father of film director Sergei - Rigans both. If Riga seems a bit run down after years of Soviet neglect, this has spared it the wholesale destruction of historic areas visited on western towns. It still has a big-city bustle. We watched in surprise one evening as two drunks fought to a standstill while a police car trundled up. The next day in Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, another drunken brawl; this time, the loser was pushed through a shop window. Something must be wrong here: 15 years in London and I have never seen a real punch-up; in the Baltics, two in two days. We should not read too much into anecdote and coincidence, no doubt, but it is hard not to suspect a great deal of anger and bewilderment under the surface as people wonder where their countries go next. There are memorials outside Vilnius's parliament to those who died in a last-gasp Soviet attack in 1991; but since the euphoria of independence wore off, politics has reflected the same disorientation, with voters seemingly torn between desire for reform and nostalgia for the good old, safe old days of Soviet hegemony. Having been Europe's last pagans, until 1386, the Lithuanians are now mostly Catholics, like the Poles to the south rather than their fellow Balts. Under Moscow's rule, most of Vilnius's baroque churches were re-assigned. St John's, the handsome university church, became a museum of scientific thought. The domed St Casimir's, dedicated to the country's patron saint, was a museum of atheism. The neoclassical cathedral - dating from 1387, on a site devoted only a year earlier to the thunder god Perkunas - became an art gallery. Symbolically, it was the first one reconsecrated. Modern Vilnius, a green and pleasant town, can have changed little in the past 200 years and is being rebuilt energetically. It even offers what is reputed to be the best restaurant in the Baltics, Stikliai. Like the other capitals, though, it still looks Soviet-poor: half-empty shops, half-deserted roads. Outside town, the motorway passes log cabins, horse-drawn ploughs and head-scarved women working in the fields. None of the Baltic states is ready for mass tourism. Intourist, the Soviet state operator, used to be king. Its hotels - graceless 20-storey slabs - are still there. Their views are splendid, partly because they are the only places in town from which you cannot see the Intourist hotels. But they are now run locally and Intourist is just another client. Sometimes, the same unhelpful staff have lingered on, saying nyet to everything. All you can do is mutter, and give up. But the rooms are comfortable and the food filling and the Lietuva was said to have the only hot water in Vilnius. Our Intourist chaperon was a pleasant chap, but he spoke none of the languages and had not been there since independence. So, it was without his help that we spent an entertaining morning watching folk dancing at an open-air museum outside Tallinn - brassy music and colourful costumes, all done for their own pleasure and not for non-existent tourists. Baltic guidebooks are scarce: a colourful Insight guide and a chunk of Lonely Planet's Scandinavia book seemed best. Maps are available locally; so is Vilnius in Your Pocket, a sardonically chatty bi-monthly full of arcane advice (police are tough on drink-driving, but the town's only breath analyser has no mouthpiece). As in Russia itself, streets are reverting to pre-socialist names. Local languages, always important to the nationalist movements, are being re-asserted; Lithuanian, close to Latvian, is said by some philologists to be Sanskrit's nearest living relative. New currencies have arrived: the lats, the litas and the Estonian kroon, a hard currency tied to the D-Mark. The Russians themselves are still there, a source of continuing friction. Estonian and Latvian attempts to disenfranchise the thousands of settlers who do not speak the local tongue have not gone down well in Moscow. But Russian displeasure no longer means tanks in the high street next day. In their own ways, the Baltics are heading westward. Best see them now, before they get there. Operators offering Baltic tours include Intourist (tel. 071-538 3202); Instone (081-983 0204); Finlandia (071-409 7334) and Regent (0272-211711).</p>

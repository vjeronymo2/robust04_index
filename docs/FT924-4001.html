			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Management: New breed on board - The Cadbury Committee's emphasis on the role of non-executive directors A ticking timebomb was placed under the tables of corporate boardrooms across Britain this week with the publication of the final report of the committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury. At the heart of the report is a series of guidelines which will require fundamental change in the significance and responsibilities of non-executive directors. But while many businesses and professional bodies welcomed the conclusions, some are beginning to question whether implementation of the recommendations will be more evolutionary than explosive. The Cadbury report places great emphasis on the influence that needs to be exerted by independent, non-executive directors. If all goes to plan, the days of sinecure appointments will be banished, as will the era of directors appearing once a year for a comfortable doze in the boardroom after lunch. Perhaps the most serious concern about non-executives which is raised by the Cadbury Committee is whether there is an adequate supply of qualified, independent people. Colin St Johnston, managing director of Pro-Ned, an organisation which promotes the role of non-executives, estimates that 95 per cent of quoted companies now have non-executives on the board, against 50 per cent 10 years ago. Theoretically, there is no shortage of supply of non-executives. Pro-Ned maintains a list of some 1,600 potential candidates. A number of executive search firms also fill gaps in the market. But there is a question over the quality of these candidates. St Johnston says that while financial skills are well represented, those with marketing experience or foreign language skills and overseas experience are limited. More important is the fact that few companies are turning to external sources to recruit. A recent study by Pro-Ned and the Stock Exchange showed that most are still appointed via what Pro-Ned disapprovingly called the 'Old Boy Network'. Only about 30 per cent use a formal search process to identify candidates and as few as 23 per cent have a written job profile to help in selection. The more demanding the calls on non-executive directors, the smaller the pool from which to draw will be. Sir Adrian is confident that there are many outside the well-trawled members of main boards who could be employed, including those who sit on divisional boards and individuals drawn from the public and the non-profit sectors. Yet many names have remained, unused, on Pro-Ned's lists for years. This may indicate a disappointingly low turnover of non-executives, a reluctance to use more objective selection procedures, or a lack of quality of those currently available. The Cadbury recommendations clarify the roles of such directors, but a distinction must be drawn between different parts of the report. One section gives a code of 'best practice'. All quoted companies will be required to make a statement in their annual accounts that they comply with the code, or identify and explain any areas with which they do not. The code requires non-executives 'of sufficient calibre and number' to provide significant weight in the boardroom. They should be independent of management, appointed for specified terms and selected through a formal process. But many of the stringent Cadbury recommendations fall into a separate series of supplementary recommendations on 'good practice'. These include the much-publicised suggestion that there should be a minimum of three non-executives on every board. They also include a number of important points, such as the need for at least one meeting of the audit committee each year with the auditors and without any executives present, to discuss unresolved issues of concern. While some aspects of the formal code will be scrutinised by a company's auditor to reassure shareholders that they are being followed, many of the more subjective parts of the code, and none of the good practice guidance, will come under the auditor's gaze. That is not to say that many of the recommendations will not be followed. The code has been designed to reflect existing best practice. A number of companies are already responding to the heightened interest in the subject. But one of the most revealing aspects of the final Cadbury report is the changes which distinguish it from the draft issued in May. The press release accompanying the report listed a number of changes introduced as a result of consultation in the last six months, but some important dilutions were given less emphasis. Sir Adrian talks about a 'clarification' of the role of non-executive directors, particularly regarding suggestions that they might be creating a 'two-tier board', rather than forming part of a single, unified structure. That came in response to complaints from the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors about casting non-executives divisively in the role of policemen of the board. In fact, there is a substantial diminution of the role and status of non-executives. Gone from the final version is mention of the need for a non-executive representing shareholders' interest, for instance. It is true that all directors have the same liability under the law. But equally the non-executives are intended to provide some degree of independent scrutiny. That has to imply the existance of a two-tier structure and may be no bad thing, as a submission to the Cadbury Committee from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland pointed out. Without this additional responsibility attached to non-executives, the only external scrutiny comes directly from shareholders - particularly the institutions - who have been widely criticised for their lack of activism up till now. All this suggests it will be many years before Cadbury's recommendations are in place in the majority of British companies.</p>

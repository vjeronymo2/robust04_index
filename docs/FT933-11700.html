			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Spring Ram gives Rooney a reprieve MR BILL Rooney is to continue as chief executive of Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group he co-founded - at least for the time being. That was the unexpected outcome yesterday of a two-week stand-off between the board of the Yorkshire company and its institutional investors, led by the Prudential Corporation. Spring Ram announced that Mr Rooney's role as executive chairman will be taken by Mr Roger Regan, a building industry veteran who was approached by institutions after Spring Ram issued three profit warnings within eight months, causing a collapse in its share price. Mr Regan, 50, spent three years as managing director of AG Stanley until its takeover by the Ward White Group in 1988. He is chairman of the recently floated Fine Decor Group. Mr Regan will be joined on the board by Mr Martin Towers, who has been appointed finance director, and Mr Richard Fortin, a non-executive director. Mr Regan said the new board's immediate task would be to review the report being prepared for the interim results announcement on September 22. One option will be to bring in a new firm of accountants to check the work of Spring Ram's existing auditors, Arthur Andersen, which signed off the annual accounts without qualification. Asked if it was not likely that any review would make extensive provisions, one large shareholder said: 'At least that would give us a solid basis to go forward from. This company was not built by acquisition or debt - we believe there is a solid underlying business.' The new executive chairman said he would have responsibility for corporate and executive matters, while Mr Rooney would concentrate on developing sales. Mr Regan said it would be best if the new board could continue to harness Mr Rooney's 'great entrepreneurial talents'. One source said if Mr Regan could not work with the chief executive, then the new board had the votes to sack Mr Rooney.</p>

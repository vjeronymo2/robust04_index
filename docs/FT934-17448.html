			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Chinese airliner hijacked to Taiwan A CHINESE man accompanied by his wife and their six-year-old son hijacked a Chinese airliner carrying 69 people to Taiwan yesterday, the fourth such hijacking in six months, Reuter reports from Taipei. The man, armed with a knife and carrying two bottles of ink which he claimed were explosives, hijacked the Sichuan Airlines jet while it was on a domestic flight from China's northeastern city of Jinan to Guangzhou. The couple and their son, saying they wanted asylum in Taiwan, surrendered to police soon after the airliner landed at Taipei's international airport. Mr Jason Hu, Taiwan government spokesman, rejecting a request by Beijing that the hijacker be returned to China immediately, said he would be tried for air piracy in Taiwan. Chinese aviation officials have accused Taiwan of indirectly encouraging the hijackings by its refusal to send the hijackers back to China, where they would probably face the death penalty. Mr Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwanese justice minister, indicated yesterday that the island might eventually agree to repatriate hijackers in order to deter future incidents.</p>

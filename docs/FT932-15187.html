			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Nations rival each other in Moscow aid BEFORE Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, began negotiating with his Group of Seven partners in Tokyo yesterday on the future of Russia, he noted that nowadays the group is not as concerned with 'the balance of power as with the balance sheet'. Apart from agreement that, by international accounting standards, the Russian balance sheet is definitely in poor shape, several of the G7 members were ready to find fault with each other's reckoning of bilateral contributions to the Russian cause. 'It has become a numbers game,' a Canadian official lamented. Mr Bentsen himself observed that a Dollars 1.82bn (Pounds 1.2bn) Japanese package for Russia announced yesterday was heavy on trade insurance, while Japanese officials insisted the weighting of the aid stood comparison with that of fellow members. 'Some commitments (by G7 members) are new and some commitments are not. When you compare the Japanese commitment it is not as miserable as you might think,' one said. Out of the Dollars 1.82bn, Japan is providing direct grants of Dollars 320m for food, medical equipment and technical help and Dollars 1.1bn in trade insurance and a Dollars 400m loan facility. The US is also expected to announce a package of around Dollars 1.8bn at the meeting, which ends tomorrow. This will include Dollars 500m towards a Dollars 4bn privatisation fund for Russian industry. US officials proposed the fund yesterday, but they are dependent on other G7 members mustering another Dollars 1.5bn and international agencies, in particular the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, supplying about Dollars 2bn. Japan had planned to announce only Dollars 1.2bn in assistance this week, but apparently increased the figure to ensure favourable comparison with the US. German officials said they felt under no obligation to announce another headline-grabbing figure, as the country's contributions account for an estimated 67 per cent of the bilateral aid promised by G7 members over the past two years and about 75 per cent of that already disbursed. Italian representatives explained that the country is prepared to consider future assistance, but would like Russia to remember that it has yet to repay two outstanding commercial bank loans. French officials said the focus should be on multilateral assistance, rather than bilateral figures. The UK was generous in applauding the Japanese package as 'welcome, excellent and a major contribution', though, as Mr Bentsen would say, Britain's extra Dollars 600m package announced yesterday was also heavy on export credits, which account for Dollars 500m. The European Commission wanted to emphasise that its Dollars 3bn in already announced assistance has been listed in its budget. A spokesperson said the Commission put the stress on strategic technical assistance. 'We notice that the Japanese package does contain technical assistance,' the EC said. However, another US official said that comparing the respective packages of the members was as difficult as 'comparing apples to oranges'.</p>

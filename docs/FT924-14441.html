			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cairn Energy placing to raise Pounds 6.1m CAIRN ENERGY, the UK ind-ependent oil and gas company, plans to raise a net Pounds 6.1m through a placing and open offer to shareholders. It hopes to use Pounds 1.2m of the proceeds from the issue of 24.3m new ordinary shares at 27p each to expand interests in its Palmers Wood, Storrington and Albury onshore UK gas fields. It has a conditional agreement to purchase further interests in these fields from Arco British. About Pounds 1.9m will be used to repay debt, while the rest will boost working capital. Proposed investment includes Pounds 600,000 to develop the recently-discovered Ngatoro gas field in New Zealand. Cairn reduced its after-tax loss from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 161,000 for the first half of 1992. Turnover fell from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 5.7m. The loss per share was 0.66p (5.04p). Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the sharp upturn in US gas prices promised a better second-half result.</p>

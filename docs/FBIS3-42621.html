Smirnov, by EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN  correspondent B. Rachkov: "Russia Will Be Reborn Through  Entrepreneurship"]    [Text] On the occasion of the new year, Stanislav  Alekseyevich Smirnov, president of the Russian Federation  Chamber of Commerce and Industry [TPP], talked with our  EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN correspondent. The conversation began with the  most important event to occur in the life of the Russian Chamber  this past year.    [Smirnov] This important event was, of course, the  establishment of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as  a public organization representing entrpreneurship in our  country. Public, not state, as it essentially had been before.  An organization expressing and defending the interests of  entrepreneurs of all forms of property, not exclusively state  property, as in the past.    At the same time we are not repudiating everything positive  accomplished by the former union chamber and its structural  subdivisions. I want to emphasize, however, that under  conditions of transition to the market, even the best of the  former chamber has nearly always been turned into its opposite  and has yielded to bureaucratic turnpikes on the new roads to  initiative and independence. On the other hand, any independent  energy and initiative from new market structures cowered before  the shadow cast by the old official grandeur of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry. The chamber's former administrative skill  had to be placed firmly in the service of the enterprise being  born among us. Enterprise in all its forms, from large, medium,  and small enterprises, from juridical and physical persons, from  the leaders of state industrial giants to private entrepreneur  just starting out.    Bear in mind that the first stage in the establishment of  the  chamber came about in a legislative vacuum. Many factors  hindered the actual legislation of the Russian chamber's new  functions, which are the same as those generally accepted  throughout the civilized world. The tension of the political  struggle around economic transformations in Russia also took its  toll on the reforming of public entrepreneurial organizations,  the highest link of which are the chambers of commerce and  industry. Actually, sticks have been thrust into the wheels of  reform frequently just out of ordinary incompetence and  sloppiness. Otherwise, how can we explain the impartial facts of  looting and pilfering--if not by local authorities then by local  "bosses"--of the bulk of what was created by the union chamber.    By March 1993, however, the presidential edict "On the  Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation" had  put a great deal in place. It not only put a stop to anarchy in  the interpretation of the federal chamber's role under market  conditions, it also defined the chamber's new functions as an  important public entrepreneurial organization. The edict  stimulated the passage of an even more necessary document, the  corresponding law, which was also drafted under rather  contradictory circumstances. Without going into depth, I will  cite one telling detail: the bill's opponent, representing  primarily the interests of yesterday's command system, unable to  block passage of the law in parliament, actually drafted a  presidential veto. It didn't work out, though. The law "On the  Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation" laid  down precise legal bases for all lines of activity of the main  public union for our country's entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, a  new law was drafted "On International Commercial Arbitration,"  which, along with the first law, lent Russia's system of  chambers of commerce and trade and their functions new meaning,  like that generally accepted in world practice.    [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Stanislav Alekseyevich, the difficult  path and the drama of initiating the activities of the Russian  TPP are similar to what is going on in general in our country's  economy. What do you think, will the chamber in its new capacity  be able to introduce any kind of organizing principle into the  rebirth of the Russian economy?    [Smirnov] Yes, we are not functioning in isolation from the  country's economy. We are experiencing along with it and the  people as a whole the same economic successes, losses, and  failures. The definite advance toward a civilized market is our  success as well. The colossal drop in production and foreign  trade circulation for the country has had a negative effect on  our activities as well. Most Russian Federation TPP members and  many of its foreign partners agree that "shock therapy" has  proved itself an inadequate means for pulling the economy out of  its stagnation, that it did not take into consideration the  country's social, ethnic, and cultural characteristics. Under  these conditions, we see our chief task as introducing more  common sense and social principles into the reforming of the  economy. We are striving to do this on all levels--locally, in  the various regions of Russia through the more than 60  territorial chambers of commerce and trade, and also at the  highest level, in the capital, using our own legislative  initiative, entrusted to us by the law, and also using our  authorization to participate in the activities of the structures  of executive power.    Most importantly, we are directing our main efforts toward  protecting and representing the interests of our country's  entrepreneurship in the center and in the locales, in our own  country and abroad. For the federal and territorial chambers,  there are no higher interests than the interests of  entrepreneurship in general and of each entrepreneur in  particular.    Our work has been complicated by continuing attempts to push  the chamber away from economic creation, to nudge it onto the  path of political confrontations. No farther back than at the  recent session of the Russian Federation TPP, in December 1993,  another attempt was made to draw entrepreneurs into a harsh  political struggle. A corresponding resolution was even  introduced.    [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Yes, that was a dramatic episode toward  the end of the congress. We journalists waited with impatience  and alarm for your reaction to the next political maneuver  within your representative forum for business people. After all,  this was happening at the height of the Russia-wide election  battles for the Duma and the Federal Assembly.    [Smirnov] The chamber's administration and I as its  president  recognize full well how important it is for Russia to have  effective legislative organs. That is why when it came to  supporting candidates for the new parliament we bore in mind not  so much their party affiliation as their potential ability to  adopt a balanced reformist position and actively facilitate the  development of Russian entrepreneurship. Nor did the TPP stand  on the sidelines during the pre-election struggle. We held  meetings with leaders from several blocs and parties, as a  result of which we were able to clarify for ourselves the  illnesses and tasks of young Russian business. In other words,  our chamber is scarcely an apolitical organization.    The only thing we are against is extremism, not only in the  economy but also in politics. Extremism in any form is  contraindicated for entrepreneurship. History teaches us this,  too.    [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Our weekly, and you are well aware of  this, regularly and from time to time sheds detailed light on  the specific lines of activity of the federal and territorial  chambers of trade and commerce. I would like to take advantage  of this conversation with you and report to the more than  half-million subscribers to EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN your opinion on  several other problems.    [Smirnov] I think that none of us have any common problem  more important than achieving Russia's rebirth. I am deeply  convinced that this rebirth lies through the normal development  of our country's entrepreneurship. For the time being,  specifically through the development and logical shaping and  organization of modern, competitive structures, and then through  them prospering.    An understanding of this mission permeates all links of the  Russian Federation TPP, the territorial chambers, and our member  organizations. It is gratifying that their number is constantly  growing. Today the chamber comprises about 20 Russia-wide branch  associations of entrepreneurs and nearly 90 local unions and  associations of business people.    If we were to talk about the most critical problems shared  by  all entrepreneurs, then they are obvious. The main problem is  that the reforms carried out so far have not created auspicious  conditions for the development of our country's  entrepreneurship. Due to the pressure of taxation, our  undeveloped legal base, and the miscalculations of privatization  and stock distribution, our country's productive and  scientific-technical potential are being undermined.  Entrepreneurs have been forced to concentrate their activities  in the sphere of circulation and are not risking investment in  production with a long cycle or in the infrastructure. The  permit-ridden, very complicated system for opening new objects  of economic life is fettering entrepreneurial initiative and  simultaneously expanding the ground for corruption and graft.  Isn't the high inflation, the lack of advances in structural  perestroika, and the looming unemployment that threatens to turn  not 5 million but 15-20 million Russians into unemployed even  more alarming?    The committees and commissions of the Russian Federation TPP  and the scientific, industrial, financial, and other economic  institutions that are collaborating closely with them are  actively involved in resolving those critical problems cited  here as well as others. I assure you, this work is not  pointless. Our proposals and drafts are always awaiting the  attention of the legislative and executive structures now  forming. So that our work does not find itself out in the cold  with legislative institutions again, we are acquiring the ways  of civilized lobbying as we go--naturally, in the interests of  our country's entrepreneurship.    [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Earlier you touched on the problem of  employment. It's somehow unusual to associate this problem with  the activities of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    [Smirnov] You are not the only one to think that. This is  one  more stereotype bequeathed to us from the times when employment  here was given out as a per capita statistic, and so there was  no one and no reason to worry about unemployment, especially for  the chamber. In a developed modern market society, though,  successful entrepreneurship and robust employment are two sides  of the same coin. You can't have one without the other, as many  chambers of commerce and industry in the West have clarified for  themselves long since. Anyone in the know is aware that in  Japan, Germany, Italy, Austria, and many other states, economic  prosperity and civil stability are grounded specifically in a  literate social partnership, which is significantly ensured by  the well-regulated cooperation of the chambers of the trade  unions, entrepreneurs, and the state.    This is why our chamber's representatives are taking an  increasingly active part in the activities of the Russian  Trilateral Commission's working group on the regulation of  social-labor disputes.    [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] We have not had time to touch on several  other lines of activity specific to the chambers. But your  affairs are just unfolding, and the year has only begun. I look  forward to meeting with you again.    [Smirnov] I am always happy to get together with the readers  of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, who, as I have been told, together with  subscribers total more than 3 million. One has to assume that  these are all people of business and primarily "decisionmaking,"  as people say nowadays, in economic life. It is a worthwhile  audience for representatives of the chambers of commerce and  industry.</p>

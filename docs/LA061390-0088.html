			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Studios Postpone Fin/Syn Talks: Hollywood studios asked the television networks  with which they are negotiating to postpone the final round of their talks on  financial interest and syndication rules.  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission has set Thursday as the deadline for the  sides to reach agreement. The networks and studios were supposed to meet  Tuesday at Warner Bros. in Burbank, but Jack Valenti, president of the Motion  Picture Assn. of America, said the studios needed more time to prepare their  90-page filing with the FCC. The studios are expected to argue against the  networks being allowed to enter the lucrative TV re-run business. Final  negotiations are scheduled for 9 a.m. today. Chances of a settlement appear  remote.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTEL TO REORGANIZE, TRIM ITS WORK FORCE BY 600 JOBS  </P> <P> Contel of California, the state's third-largest local phone company, said  Wednesday that it will close a regional billing center in Bakersfield but beef  up its headquarters in Victorville to cover operations in eight Western states.  </P> <P> The moves are part of a national reorganization and consolidation announced in  Atlanta by the company's corporate parent, Contel Corp. Among other things, the  changes will trim the national work force by 4%, or about 600 jobs.  </P> <P> How many California jobs will be affected has yet to be determined, the company  said.  </P> <P> Contel said the change will combine telephone operations from the present three  regions and 12 divisions into six multi-state operating groups reporting  directly to Atlanta.  </P> <P> Contel provides local phone service in 30 states. In California, where it  serves communities in the fast-growing high desert and the mountain resorts of  Big Bear and Mammoth Lakes, Contel employs 1,800 to serve about 300,000  customers. Under the reorganization, Victorville will become headquarters for  local telephone operations in California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,  Idaho, Washington and Oregon.  </P> <P> Al Sabsavitz, spokesman for the California unit, said the reorganization, which  will eliminate one layer of management, is an effort to make the company more  responsive to customers and to the growing competition in telecommunications.  The reduction in jobs also reflects improved telephone technology that requires  less maintenance and operating personnel.  </P> <P> It is the firm's first organizational overhaul in 18 years, Sabsavitz said.  </P></p>

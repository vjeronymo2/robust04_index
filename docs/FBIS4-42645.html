			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the first meeting of the newly  installed RAI [Italian Radio and Television] parliamentary  oversight committee took place in Piazza San Macuto. RAI  Director General Gianni Locatelli was also at the meeting. At  the top of the agenda was the initiative by the Marco Taradash,  chairman of the committee who yesterday handed over a number of  documents that cast doubt on the legality of some of the  management methods at the public broadcaster to the Rome  prosecutor's office. Donato Bendicenti reports:    [Bendicenti] San Macuto the day after the storm. Marco  Taradash, the newly elected chairman of the RAI oversight  committee, arrived first and he appeared to be in good spirits.  He had called a meeting of the committee at 1030 and one of the  possible topics for discussion was the visit that he paid  yesterday morning -- just a few hours after his election -- to  the Rome prosecutor, Michele Coiro. Taradash handed over a  number of documents to the prosecutor which concerned the  management of RAI. According to the new chairman of the  overisght committee, these documents show how the company failed  to fulfill its public service duties, and was instead used by  the political parties. Taradash has asked if there are grounds  for bringing prosecutions, and of course his visit has managed  to make front-page headlines. The opposition parties are vying  with each other to see which will make the harshest criticism.    In fact, this morning Passiglia, a deputy from the  Democratic  Alliance, lodged a complaint at the prosecutor's office against  Taradash. Passiglia said that if Taradash knew of illegal  episodes taking place then he ought to have visited the judge  immediately without waiting to be elected as committee chairman.    How will the matter end? Fabrizio del Noce, who is the man  in charge of Forza Italia's press communications, is skeptical.  He said that, if behind gestures such as Taradash's there was  the desire to break up the public broadcaster, then he would  play no part in it. This is also the position of Forza Italia.    The position of Francesco Storacce, who is from the National  Alliance and deputy chairman of the committee, is much more  hard-line. He said that serious things had happened at RAI, if  not in the legal sense then certainly in the moral sense.  Storacce added that he wanted to dismantle the party politics  at the network and proposed that a subcommittee be set up to  review the executive appointments made at RAI since last August.</p>

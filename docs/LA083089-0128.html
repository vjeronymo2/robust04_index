Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HEFNER, NEW WIFE EXPECTING IN APRIL  </P> <P> Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, 63, who ended 30 years of bachelorhood last month  to marry model Kimberley Conrad, will become a father again in April, a Playboy  spokesman said today.  </P> <P> "For those who wondered how we spent our honeymoon, the answer will be in  April," the spokesman, Bill Farley, quoted Hefner as telling friends.  </P> <P> Hefner, who for years preached that marriage kills romance, married 26-year-old  Conrad, a magazine Playmate of the Year, in front of a wishing well at Playboy  Mansion West on July 1.  </P> <P> It was the second marriage for Hefner, one of the world's best-known bachelors.  He has two children by his first marriage -- Christie, president of Playboy  Enterprises, and David. Hefner's first marriage, to Mildred Williams, ended in  divorce in 1959.  </P></p>

The support came at a meeting of a U.N. working group  deliberating the reforms, including the question of expansion of  Security Council permanent membership.    It is believed to be the first time that Britain has cited  Germany and Japan by name in supporting an expansion of  permanent members beyond the current five -- Britain, China,  France, Russia and the U.S.    The sources said France also indicated support for Germany  and Japan by saying permanent membership should be offered to  countries that have considerable influence globally and a will  to maintain international security.    Aside from the five permanent members, representatives of  some 10 other countries made statements on the question of  restructuring the Security Council.    The working group, which held its first meeting last month,  is scheduled to submit an interim report on its deliberations to  the General Assembly's regular session beginning in the third  week of September.</p>

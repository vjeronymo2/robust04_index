The Department invites interested agencies, organizations, and the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public to provide comments on the Assumptions and Methodology Document.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments on the Assumptions and Methodology Document are due by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 30, 1994.

In the process, substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of spent nuclear fuel were generated. The Department must manage that spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear fuel, and a much smaller amount that will be generated over the next 40 years, until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final decisions about its ultimate disposition are made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In June 1994, the Department issued the Department of Energy Programmatic Spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Restoration and Waste Management Programs Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SNF &amp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> INEL EIS) (DOE/EIS&hyph;0203&hyph;D) for review and comment. A Notice of Availability was issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on June 24, 1994 (59 FR 32688). The SNF &amp; INEL EIS evaluates potential environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts that may occur under several different alternatives for managing spent nuclear fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the next 40 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potential monetary costs associated with implementing the spent nuclear fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management alternatives will be considered in the Department's decision-making on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives identified in the EIS. The Cost Evaluation Report will also contain other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information (for example, estimated costs of disposal in a geologic repository) which will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful in the Department's efforts to establish baseline estimates for life-cycle program costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such information is relevant to the Department's environmental restoration and waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management responsibilities and is being consolidated into the Baseline Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management Report to be issued later this year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Evaluation Report <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is seeking public input on the Assumptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Methodology Document, which is to be used in preparing the Cost Evaluation Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cost Evaluation Report will be made available to the public before the EIS Record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decision is issued in June 1995. Portions of this evaluation are among the many factors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be considered by the Department when preparing the EIS Record of Decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Cost Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Assumptions and Methodology Document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presents the approach to be used in developing the cost evaluation, which has two primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes: to compare the monetary costs of the alternatives discussed in the SNF and INEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIS and to explore estimated life-cycle costs to be used as relevant information to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's environmental restoration and waste management responsibilities. The Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation Report will address a reasonable range of potential spent nuclear fuel management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project expenses, which (depending upon the alternative) include potential costs for research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and development, plant and equipment, operations and maintenance, capital/construction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decommissioning and decontamination, and potential costs associated with disposal. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spent nuclear fuel management decisions may not be made for several years. Future selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of technologies or decisions on how to prepare some fuels for storage or disposition, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, may significantly affect cost. Therefore, only relative predictions of these costs can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: STILL MUCH HYPE OVER THE QUALITY OF BURGUNDIES  </P> <P> Any wine lover who has tasted a sip of a great red or white Burgundy swoons at  the thought of repeating the act.  </P> <P> There is little like it -- the sublime spice and richness of the Chardonnay,  the intense decadence of clove-scented cherries in the Pinot Noir. This is the  essence of great Burgundy and it's what makes these wines so desirable and so  elusive.  </P> <P> And yet it is with great sadness that I report my own disenchantment with  Burgundy in the last decade. I know it can be great wine. I know it can offer  some of the greatest and most expansive flavors and tastes the human body can  grasp. And yet more and more I come away from tastings of young Burgundies with  a growing feeling that there is a tad of prestidigitation going on here.  </P> <P> No, it is not fraud. No one is intentionally putting anything over on us. It's  just that after all the hype I have heard for some of the latest vintages of  French Burgundy, I have been expecting nirvana-like exploitation of my palate.  And what I have seen, in recent tastings, is some merely exceptionally good  wine.  </P> <P> I'm not angry about this, just wistfully sad that what I anticipate from  Burgundy is rarely what I get. This is not true of Bordeaux. I had heard of the  greatness of the 1986 Bordeaux and I tasted anticipating greatness. By and  large, I got it.  </P> <P> It reminded me of my feeling about the pre-Super Bowl hype, people talking  about the greatness of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. I knew there was a chance  both would flop in the Big Game, just as I knew the hype for the '86 Bordeaux  might be overstating the case. But right on schedule, the '49ers and the '86  Bordeaux both delivered.  </P> <P> Burgundy? Well, that's another story. I have been mildly disappointed with what  I have seen in the last few years. The wines are good to excellent, no question  about it, but a lot of them lack a certain je ne sais quoi and leave me asking  "Is that all there is?"  </P> <P> Then comes the second half of my disappointment, which is best left for the tag  line to the following story:  </P> <P> Jean-Francois Bouchard came to town the other day to show off some of the  acclaimed 1989 Burgundies.  </P> <P> Among the four white wines he poured was one I found wonderful -- 1989 Bouchard  Chevalier-Montrachet, which has a magnificent textured aroma of earth/chalk,  spice nuances and oak tones. It is rich and mouth-filling; and though it didn't  remind me as much of a Chevalier-Montrachet as a Meursault with a trace of  Chablis, it is appealing and rewarding.  </P> <P> I didn't know the price of the wine while evaluating it; I guessed it would be  expensive, perhaps $50 to $75 a bottle.  </P> <P> The press kit said suggested retail is $91. A bottle.  </P> <P> What's going on here, of course, is high worldwide demand for a product that is  always in short supply. Not every Burgundy is this high in price, of course,  but demand for all Burgundy is so high that virtually everything is priced  higher than it ought to be based on quality alone, and too expensive for me to  recommend for all but defrocked Wall Street brokers.  </P> <P> Now, I may be accused of having the dreaded California Palate, but a lot of  what I tasted in the last few weeks of French Burgundy reminded me of the  better California Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs, which sell for a fraction of the  price. Examples abound.  </P> <P>  -- A lovely Beaune I had at a tasting recently that retails for $30 a bottle  reminded me of the Pinot Noir from Saintsbury in the Napa Valley -- reminding  me also of Saintsbury's wonderful slogan "Beaune in the U.S.A."  </P> <P>  -- The '89 Chevalier-Montrachet mentioned above was superb, but I asked myself  if it was that much better than the wines of Kistler or Chalone or Hanzell or  Kalin or Sanford or Sterling or Ferrari-Carano or Babcock or Flora Springs --  wines that run less than a third of the price of the Bouchard wine.  </P> <P> Red Burgundy causes a weakening of connoisseurs' knees, and the debate these  days is not high pricing but merely whether 1988 or 1989 is a greater vintage.  (It's fortunate for the French that they have this "problem" to deal with  rather than the real question of high price.)  </P> <P> Dale Sharp, wine buyer for Red Carpet Wine &amp; Spirits in Glendale, thinks  the debate is a chance for buyers to find the excellent and "well priced"  1987s, which he said are "very good and may get lost in the rush to get the  '88s and '89s." Yet that phrase "well-priced" is only relative; the wines are  still mighty dear.  </P> <P> Sharp said the French may be trying to recoup for a number of mediocre  vintages. He said 1985 was a great year in Burgundy, but, "You have to go all  the way back to '78 before you get to a substantial vintage," said Sharp, so  the French may be trying to recoup a bit after lower prices in the years 1979  through 1984.  </P> <P> He noted that after the high prices for the '85s, prices for the hard 1986s  dropped only 10%. "That means that the '86s were too high," he said.  </P> <P> Mike Lynch, wine buyer for Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco, joked about high  prices for Burgundy: "We do a direct deposit with a lot of our customers. They  send us their paychecks, we send them Burgundy."  </P> <P> Dave Breitstein of the Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park said: "I can't keep up  with the French Burgundies because the prices are simply too high. I used to  sell a lot of them when they were priced between $20 and $35. Now most of these  wines are priced between $40 and $100 and our customers are not in the mood to  spend these kinds of prices."  </P> <P> He said today's high prices for Burgundy are a result of short supply, to be  sure, but also due to a four-tier marketing system -- one tier more than the  traditional three-tier system of the past.  </P> <P> "This fourth tier is the national marketing company," said Breitstein. "For  instance, Joseph Drouhin is being represented by Dreyfus Ashby. So you have the  exporter, the importer, the marketing company and the wholesaler between us and  the wine, and that means that a wine that's $10 FOB becomes $40 by the time it  gets to the retail shelf."  </P> <P> Sharp added, "The Japanese yen is so strong against the other currencies of the  world, and the Japanese have all this extra disposable income and they are  having a major impact on the supply of wines, to the detriment of the American  consumer. They're buying wines that they never did ten years ago."  </P> <P> Steve Wallace of Wally's in West Los Angeles sells a great deal of Burgundy,  but he's nervous about the prices he must charge.  </P> <P> "I've taken a pretty strong position in '88 red Burgundies, and I'm concerned  because the gamble is on the retailer," said Wallace. "The (West Coast)  wholesaler will not take a strong position unless he pre-sells the wine. But on  the East Coast, the wholesaler will take a position by keeping inventories in  stock, and you can find the 'hot' wines after the first few weeks.  </P> <P> "Burgundy is a real gamble. You never know what they're going to taste like,  and even after you taste them you don't know what's going to happen in the  bottle."  </P> <P> Sharp said, additionally, that prices for French Burgundies are lower on the  East Coast than they are in the West: "My biggest complaint as a retailer is  that I get newsletters from (wine shops) in the east and they get stuff and  sell them for prices we can't even buy the wines for," said Sharp.  </P> <P> Wallace said the East Coast is a better and thus more competitive Burgundy  market "because it was there first and people understand it better. Our lack of  experience has hurt our knowledge of it, and that hurts the price."  </P> <P> I asked Wallace what he thought about lower prices for French Burgundies (and  Bordeaux) on the East Coast.  </P> <P> "I get real irritated when I see that. I asked Ab Simon (president of Seagram's  Chateau and Estate division) why I pay more for the same wines than they do in  the east, and he said he had to be more competitive back there.  </P> <P> "But the real reason is that they can deal pretty much directly with the  retailers, and here we have another 25% markup -- the wholesaler. Some of my  potential buyers are actually buying wine back east and shipping it out here --  even though it's illegal to do that."  </P> <P> Some small Burgundy producers do not deal through a major national house and  thus prices for them are more consistent from coast to coast.  </P> <P> Lynch of Pacific Wine Co. estimated that about 30% of the good Burgundies sell  in California and New York at the same (or similar) prices.  </P> <P> "But any of the national items, like stuff from Kobrand and Chateau and Estate,  seems to be cheaper on the East Coast," said Lynch, "so we don't have much of  that stuff in our inventory."  </P> <P> A number of merchants interviewed said smaller wholesale houses such as Grape  Expectations of Emeryville, Kermit Lynch of Berkeley and Martine Saunier of San  Rafael do a marvelous job of importing fine Burgundies and keeping prices  relatively reasonable. Martine's catalogue, in particular, shows a number of  wines from respected wine makers at prices 10% to 20% lower than major-house  wines from the same French districts.  </P> <P> The difference is that some of these producers are not well known.  </P> <P> Lynch said West Coast merchants face another problem in marketing Burgundy:  supply. "Chateau and Estate makes sure their buddies on the East Coast get  first pick. Their allocations are bigger than ours," said Lynch.  </P> <P> He added that retailers who take a strong position in a wine are risking a lot.  "We are at the mercy of the wine press, because if they are lukewarm to a  vintage and you have taken a position in it, well, when you're talking about  wines that are $30 to $40 a bottle and you can't sell them. . . .  </P> <P> Breitstein of Duke of Bourbon noted too that because of a greater competition  and a greater volume of sales in major East Coast cities, many shops in the  East buy huge amounts of wine at a time, getting a bigger discount.  </P> <P> "There is almost no store in L.A. that's buying a container-load of wine to get  a lower price, but every major store in New York is buying container-loads of  wine," said Breitstein. "Our store is selling about 50% more wine this year  than two years ago, yet we're selling virtually no Burgundy and two years ago  it represented 20% of our business."  </P> <P> Breitstein added, "The wine business is healthy, but if the producers and  suppliers are not careful, they will lose certain segments of the market."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Sharp pointed out that some buyers are always optimistic  about Burgundy: "I'm a Burgundy fanatic and I've been disappointed more times  than I have been excited," said Sharp. "but the times I've been pleased make up  for all the times I've been disappointed."  </P> <P> A final word on the French Burgundies. At the Bouchard tasting the other day, I  sat with a man who was chatting about the greatness of a new California  Chardonnay. He raved about the superb qualities of the wine and said it was  magnificent.  </P> <P> Then he said, "Unfortunately, they are charging a lot for it -- $24."  </P> <P> I replied, "But you don't think $91 is too much for Chevalier-Montrachet?"  </P> <P> He replied, "Oh, but that's Burgundy."  </P> <P> Wine of the Week: 1988 Jaboulet St. Joseph ($15) -- At a tasting of Burgundies  a week ago, I sampled the line of Rhone wines from Jaboulet. Every wine was not  only well made but well priced, and this Hermitage-like red wine is deep,  richly fruity and brawny enough to mature nicely in a cellar. But it also is so  appealing now it can be enjoyed immediately. A merchant at the tasting  complained that St. Joseph had risen in price too fast. "I remember when I  could sell St. Joseph for eight bucks," he said. True, but consider: Jaboulet's  fabulous 1988 Hermitage La Chapelle sells for about $50 a bottle and this wine  is a close approximation of it, making it a good value.  </P></p>

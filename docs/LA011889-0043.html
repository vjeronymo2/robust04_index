			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURROUGHS OUTLASTS HART, 88-79;  </P> <P> EJECTIONS AND FOULS MAR HEATED FOOTHILL LEAGUE SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> Two players were ejected and 4 fouled out Tuesday night as Hart High and  Burroughs scratched and clawed their way toward the Foothill League summit.  </P> <P> Elbows were thrown, shirts grabbed and words exchanged in a frenzied fourth  quarter as the Indians from Burroughs (12-5, 4-0 in league play) held off the  Indians from Hart, 88-79, at Burroughs to grab sole possession of first place  and the inside track for their first league championship since 1968.  </P> <P> "It's been so long since we've been off to a 4-0 start," said Burroughs' Dan  Murphy, who scored 31 points.  </P> <P> Murphy's 13 second-quarter points gave Burroughs a 45-37 halftime lead. The  senior forward also was a cool and collective 6 of 6 from the free-throw line  during the final-period pandemonium.  </P> <P> Have your score books ready?  </P> <P> Burroughs forward Tom Clemons was ejected with 3 minutes to play after being  called for a flagrant foul against Hart's Chad Fotheringham. Two minutes later,  Fotheringham was ejected after a scuffle with Marnie Calderon.  </P> <P> Hart's Brett Wilson (team-high 31 points) and Craig Gorski, and Burroughs' John  Yim and Al Podrasky all fouled out.  </P> <P> And through it all, the officials still had the breath to whistle Fotheringham  and Hart Coach Greg Herrick for technical fouls.  </P> <P> "It's Hart and Burroughs," Burroughs Coach Ira Sollod said. "They're always  kind of at each other's throats."  </P> <P> Said Murphy: "It kind of got out of hand. We don't like anyone trying to push  us around. They tried to intimidate us."  </P> <P> It almost worked. Hart (9-8, 3-1) fell behind, 9-1, in the first quarter and  spent the rest of the game trying to get even. After a quarter, Burroughs led,  23-15, and appeared to have the game iced after Murphy's second-quarter  performance.  </P> <P> But Wilson scored 7 unanswered points to open the second half. Hart cut the gap  to 1 point 4 times before Wilson's 3-point play with 4:26 remaining knotted the  score, 69-69.  </P> <P> Hart, however, never led and made only 4 of 10 free throws in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Burroughs made 15 of 19 free throws in the final quarter. Calderon, who buried  4 3-point baskets -- for a season total of 33 -- and finished with 19 points,  scored 7 fourth-quarter points to check Wilson's 9-point effort.  </P> <P> "We didn't make our free throws and we turned the ball over," Herrick said.  "That's the story of the game. I don't need to say anymore."  </P></p>

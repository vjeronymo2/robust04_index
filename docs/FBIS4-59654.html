			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 15 (AFP) -- Most of Egypt's 180,000  lawyers went on strike Sunday [15 May] to protest the death of a  jailed lawyer who was allegedly tortured. 'Abd-al-Harith Madani  died the day after being arrested on April 26 on charges that he  had acted as a go-between for imprisoned members of the Islamic  militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and those abroad.    The Egyptian lawyers, who normally work on Sundays, also  plan  a protest march on a palace of President Husni Mubarak on  Tuesday. They have demanded the release of 34 lawyers held  without charge and to take part in an inquiry into Madani's  death.    The prosecutor's office said Thursday that an initial  autopsy  showed the lawyer had died after being tortured. But the  Interior Ministry said two days later that Madani had died from  an asthma attack before even being questioned.  It said his asthma attack had started at his home where he had  been taken by security services and that Madani was immediately  brought to hospital where he later died. But his family was  only told of his death on May 6.    The ministry said Madani had been a "terrorist leader" of  al-Jama'ah, which has waged a two-year-long campaign of violence  against the government, and that it had documents to prove the  allegation.    Mukhtar Nuh, a member of the bar association, rejected the  explanation that Madani had died of natural causes, saying if  that were true "the security services would not have waited nine  days to inform his family."    "Even if he was accused of belonging to an armed group, that  doesn't give the state the right to kill him," added Nuh, whose  association is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

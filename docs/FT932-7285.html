			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Nursery school class size increases THE SIZE of classes at state-maintained nursery schools in England rose last year, education department figures showed yesterday. There were 25 pupils for every teacher last year compared with 24.2 in 1991 and 23 in 1983. If nursery assistants are taken into account, the ratio last year was 11 children for every staff member, which was similar to 1991. The figure in 1983 was 10.4. The total take-up of education by children below compulsory school age increased by one percentage point to 49 per cent. If the 52,000 pupils aged less than five who went to independent schools are included, the total participation rate in education before it becomes compulsory is 53 per cent. The number of maintained nursery schools in England fell from 566 in 1991 to 560 last year. In 1983 there were 575, but the number of primary schools with nursery classes was 4,874 last year compared with 4,815 in 1991 and 3,764 in 1983. The department revealed wide regional variations in nursery provision. For example, 19 local education authorities have no nursery schools.</p>

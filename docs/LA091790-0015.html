			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN LAWS AND VIOLENT CRIME  </P> <P> I have two suggestions in response to your editorial. First, mandate gun safety  courses in schools to teach safe and responsible use of guns.  </P> <P> As a shock lesson, show films of the real damage that can be inflicted with a  gun. Second, restrict the use of guns and the distorted portrayal of their  effects on television and in movies.  </P> <P> The answer is in gun education, not gun legislation.  </P> <P> ARDEN L.

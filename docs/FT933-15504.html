			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare to raise Pounds 33m for nursing homes CRESTACARE is raising Pounds 33.3m through a placing to finance acquisitions in its core nursing homes business. The group, where Mr Andrew Taee was appointed chief executive in March, also announced yesterday the sale of some of its non-core properties and the appointment of a new chairman. Mr Brian O'Connor is retiring as chairman, having, Mr Taee said, been the architect of CrestaCare's new strategy. Mr Graeme Hart, deputy chairman, is stepping up. The placing and two acquisitions announced yesterday, totalling Pounds 15.1m, are subject to approval at a special meeting of shareholders on July 30. The placing is at 40p and the shares rose 2p to close at 45p yesterday. Mr Taee said further acquisitions were under negotiation but that shareholders would not be asked to put up more new equity. CrestaCare said that since the introduction of the Care in the Community Act in April it had held occupancy rates above 90 per cent. Downward pressure on fee rates was offset by an increasing proportion of privately funded residents. Yesterday's acquisitions are of two businesses, each operating four nursing homes. Together they have 515 beds and made an operating profit of Pounds 2.57m in the year to end-March. CrestaCare is paying Pounds 14.1m in cash and the balance through the issue of 2.375m shares. The vendors in both cases will continue to develop new homes for CrestaCare to its specifications. It will only take these homes on to its balance sheet when they are fully built and reach a certain occupancy level. As well as the shares issued to the vendors, the placing involves 83.23m shares, with investors able to clawback shares on a 1-for-1 basis. It will raise Pounds 31.6m net of expenses. Directors are taking up their entitlement under the placing. As well as doubling his stake of 333,000 shares, Mr Hart is acting as a placee for a further 2m shares. Of the placing proceeds, Pounds 7m will go to buying four homes which CrestaCare currently leases. Three are leased from Grosvenor House Group in which Mr Taee has a 10 per cent stake. Mr Taee said that after the placing net debt would be about Pounds 8m. In its last accounts CrestaCare had properties for sale with written down values of Pounds 9.4m. All but Pounds 2.8m of these have been sold, although there has been a Pounds 1m loss on the sales.</p>

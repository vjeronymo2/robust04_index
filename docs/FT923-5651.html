			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Somali attack on UN observers TWO United Nations military observers were wounded yesterday, one seriously, when an armed Somali gang attacked their unarmed vehicle in Mogadishu, Reuter reports. Witnesses said several jeeps converged on the UN vehicle and opened fire, injuring an Egyptian colonel and another UN observer. The attack coincided with the unanimous agreement by the UN Security Council, last night, to deploy up to 3,500 UN troops in Somalia, writes Michael Littlejohns from New York. At present, there are only 50 UN military observers in Somalia, with a further 500-strong Pakistani battalion due there shortly. The cost of the expanded UN operation is estimated at Dollars 129.2m (Pounds 64.9m) for an initial six months.</p>

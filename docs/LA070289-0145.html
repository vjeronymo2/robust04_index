			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN;  </P> <P> CANSECO, SCHMIDT NOT ONLY ALL-STAR VOTING ABSURDITIES  </P> <P> Just because a retired player leads the National League All-Star voting at  third base and a player who hasn't appeared in a major league game this year is  among the American League's top three outfielders doesn't mean there should be  another appeal to take the vote away from the fans.  </P> <P> Actually, this year's results only border on the annual absurdity produced by  the paying electorate.  </P> <P> With the voting scheduled to end today and the final week's ballots still to be  tabulated, the probable results don't appear that far out of line, even with  the retired Mike Schmidt winning the National League's third base nod and the  injured Jose Canseco being selected to the American League outfield.  </P> <P> Based on 1989 performance, here's the way it should have gone, with the fan  leaders in parentheses:  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE  </P> <P> FIRST BASE (Mark McGwire): There is no position with more legitimate  candidates, including McGwire, Alvin Davis, Don Mattingly, Fred McGriff and  Rafael Palmeiro. They are virtually impossible to separate, but the nod here  would be to Mattingly, who has come on in all categories to regain his Hit Man  identification.  </P> <P> SECOND BASE (Steve Sax): The former Dodger is having a big year, but Julio  Franco, No. 2 in the voting, is having a bigger year and should have been an  obvious choice.  </P> <P> SHORTSTOP (Cal Ripken Jr.): No argument.  </P> <P> THIRD BASE (Wade Boggs): Boggs has overcome all the distractions to make  another run at a batting title, but the pick should have been Gary Gaetti, who  is among the league leaders in home runs and runs batted in, carrying the  Minnesota Twins back into the race.  </P> <P> OUTFIELD (Bo Jackson, Kirby Puckett and Canseco): Jackson and Puckett are  legitimate picks, but Canseco is a joke. Is this the 1988 or 1989 All-Star  team? It's an insult to Ruben Sierra, who is No. 7 in the voting and should be  No. 1.  </P> <P> CATCHER (Terry Steinbach): The MVP of last year's All-Star game isn't a bad  pick, but Mickey Tettleton deserves the edge based on power, production and his  impact on the Baltimore Orioles.  </P> <P> PITCHERS: The fans have no voice in the selection of the pitching staff.  Manager Tony La Russa couldn't go wrong with Dave Stewart, Roger Clemens, Greg  Swindell, Chuck Finley, Jeff Ballard and relievers Tom Gordon, Jeff Russell and  Doug Jones.  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE  </P> <P> FIRST BASE (Will Clark): An obvious pick, though Pedro Guerrero is having a  fine year as well.  </P> <P> SECOND BASE (Ryne Sandberg): No argument here either.  </P> <P> SHORTSTOP (Ozzie Smith): The fans voted without thinking. Barry Larkin is now  the league's premier shortstop in every way.  </P> <P> THIRD BASE (Schmidt): A nice honor for Schmidt, but this is supposed to be the  1989 All-Star team. Howard Johnson, sixth in the voting, should be first.  </P> <P> OUTFIELD (Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry and Tony Gwynn): Mitchell and Gwynn  are bona fide picks. Strawberry might have been if he hadn't been sidelined  recently by injuries. The third outfielder should be Vince Coleman or Eric  Davis, with Davis having compiled legitimate statistics despite ongoing leg  problems.  </P> <P> CATCHER (Benito Santiago): In a league where no catcher has distinguished  himself offensively, Tony Pena probably is the half-year All-Star, though  Santiago has begun to hit some after a horrendous start.  </P> <P> PITCHERS: Manager Tom Lasorda would be wise to select Rick Reuschel, Mike  Scott, Dennis Martinez, Orel Hershiser and four relievers: John Franco, Mark  Davis, Mitch Williams and Jay Howell.  </P> <P> Lonnie Smith, having staged a remarkable comeback from the drug problems that  took him to the minors and threatened his career, had 10 home runs and a .325  average through Friday and figured to be the Atlanta Braves' All-Star  representative.  </P> <P> But Smith says he isn't sure he will accept, citing a tender ankle that  recently put him on the disabled list and his dislike for Lasorda.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be the first guy not to play for Tommy," he said.  </P> <P> Did Pete Rose regularly call other managers to determine the physical status of  their teams before betting on them, as Paul Janszen testified in baseball's  investigation into Rose's alleged gambling habits?  </P> <P> Twelve managers contacted by The Times failed to confirm that. "I'm not saying  that I've never talked to Pete on the phone," said an American League manager  who requested anonymity. "But it would be highly unusual and suspicious for any  manager to call another on a regular basis to ask about injuries and the status  of a pitcher. And Pete never did that, to my knowledge at least. It seems like  someone has it in for him, on this count anyway."  </P> <P> Texas Rangers coach Davey Lopes, who set a major league record by stealing 38  consecutive bases without being caught as a Dodger in 1975, wasn't overly  thrilled to see the St. Louis Cardinals' Vince Coleman break his mark.  </P> <P> Coleman began a weekend series against San Diego with 40 consecutive steals, 34  this year.  </P> <P> "I always thought that once a season terminated, it terminated what you had  accomplished," Lopes said. "They don't carry over batting average and  earned-run average. I'm sure he could do it in one year and that's the way it  should be counted."  </P> <P> Lopes also couldn't resist a needle when asked his opinion of Coleman's success  rate.  </P> <P> "I guess he's picking better situations," Lopes said.  </P> <P> Better situations?  </P> <P> "When I stole 47 of 49 (51 really) with the Cubs at age 40, Coleman said anyone  could do it if they picked the right situations," Lopes said with a smile. "I  guess he's picking the right situations."  </P> <P> In Coleman's view, no situation is better than another.  </P> <P> "Everyone in the park knows I'm going," he said. "I'm going against the whole  park. I hope I get a hundred in a row."  </P> <P> Montreal Expos Manager Buck Rodgers, in his sixth full season as a major league  manager, registered his 500th victory Tuesday night and said:  </P> <P> "Five hundred doesn't mean as much to me as having a career record -- 502-450  through Saturday -- over .500. I think the number of years you're over .500 is  a good batting average for a manager."  </P> <P> After a struggling start linked to the uncertainty of his contract talks with  the Twins, Frank Viola has pitched 17 consecutive scoreless innings, including  a 2-0 victory over Dave Stewart and the Oakland A's Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Viola is 6-8 while Stewart is 12-4, but he had a message for the A's ace. "Tell  him I'm back, if he asks," Viola said.  </P> <P> Stewart won't ask and doesn't have to be told.  </P> <P> "If I had to pitch against Frank Viola every four days, it would eventually  cause me mental strain and a nervous breakdown," he said.  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson has been on a roll since returning to the A's, but the team  began has a 4-5 record since Henderson arrived. The A's have been hurt by the  continued absence of relief ace Dennis Eckersley and diminished bullpen depth  stemming from the departure of Eric Plunk and Greg Cadaret in trade for  Henderson.  </P> <P> Eckersley, sidelined by a shoulder strain since May 27, may return next  weekend. The bullpen has a 1-7 record and four blown saves in 14 chances since  he went out.  </P> <P> And the bullpen's earned-run average since Plunk and Cadaret were traded was  4.84 through Thursday, compared to 2.03 previously.  </P> <P> What does it portend for the race in the AL West to have Texas only 2 1/2 games  out before a weekend series with Seattle despite a combined 10-16 record and  5.54 ERA by two pitchers who will eventually do better, Charlie Hough and Bobby  Witt?  </P> <P> Although the Dodgers have been calling Pittsburgh about the availability of  Barry Bonds, it hasn't been with the persistance that General Manager Syd  Thrift of the New York Yankees has been displaying in regard to third baseman  Bobby Bonilla, whom Thrift originally signed for the Pirates.  </P> <P> "Syd wants Bonilla bad, but I won't trade him," Pirate General Manager Larry  Doughty said. "If I trade him, I'll go out and buy the rope for the city of  Pittsburgh to put around my neck."  </P> <P> Baseball's worst statistical line may belong to pitcher Bill Bene, the Dodgers'  No. 1 draft choice in 1988 from Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Recently demoted from Class-A Bakersfield to a rookie league team at Salem,  Ore., Bene has pitched 16 1/3 innings this year with 17 hits, 19 earned runs,  36 walks, four hit batters, 10 wild pitches and 16 strikeouts.  </P> <P> Which raises a question: Why, in an era when college players are jumping  directly to the majors or requiring only a year or two in the minors, would the  Dodgers use their top pick on a project who may require four or five years --  even if he had the best arm in the draft, as the Dodgers claim?  </P> <P> McGwire had 99 home runs in 1,389 at-bats through Friday and figures to reach  100 quicker than anyone in history except for Ralph Kiner, who did it in 1,351  at-bats. Jim Gentile did it in 1,419, and Harmon Killebrew in 1,420.  </P> <P> From Pittsburgh Pirates broadcaster Steve Blass: "I went in and saw the movie,  Batman, last night. It was good, but I liked the book better."  </P></p>

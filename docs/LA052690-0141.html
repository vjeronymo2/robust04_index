			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCCJ WILL ASK SUPREME COURT TO RECONSIDER PEYOTE RULING  </P> <P> The National Conference of Christians and Jews has publicly aligned itself with  an appeal in the U.S. judicial system for the first time in its 62-year  history.  </P> <P> The organization has announced that it will support an effort asking the U.S.  Supreme Court to reconsider its April 17 decision in a dispute over whether the  First Amendment protects the religious use of the drug peyote.  </P> <P> On May 10, a diverse coalition of religious and civil liberties organizations,  joined by 55 constitutional law scholars, had filed a petition urging the court  to re-examine its ruling, which limits the application of a "compelling state  interest" test in free exercise of religion cases.  </P> <P> In a statement, national conference board Chairman Ira A. Lipman and President  Jacqueline G. Wexler said they would back the petition because they "are not  convinced the court has given sufficient consideration to the ways in which the  decision may limit valid expressions of religious liberty."  </P> <P> They said they "are not questioning the power of states to regulate the use of  peyote but are distressed by the constitutional argument put forth by the court  majority in the case. . . ."  </P></p>

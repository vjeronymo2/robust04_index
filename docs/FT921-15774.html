			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Opposition to Dunkel's solution for Uruguay Round grows THE US pharmaceutical industry yesterday denounced the latest proposals for ending the Gatt Uruguay Round talks as 'an enormous break for the biggest pirates in the world', Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. The industry's trade association joined a growing list of groups and companies opposed to proposals made by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, on December 20 last year. The 10-year grace period on intellectual property rights provided for developing countries such as India and Thailand was 'an unacceptable proposition,' Dr Harvey Bale, senior vice-president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said. Industry support for settling the Round is seen as the key to getting congressional approval for it. Like other opponents of the Dunkel text, Dr Bale seemed unwilling to lose all hope for the Round and said he would seek changes in the proposed text. Gatt was the subject of meetings all over Washington yesterday as groups sought to stake out their positions. US and EC textile leaders also denounced the Dunkel text. No US groups appear willing to accept it as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Mrs Hills has said she will seek changes. Other US officials are having trouble summoning enthusiasm; one senior trade official said that if the text was unalterable, he would rather 'leave it'. Mr Abe Katz, head of the US Council for International Business, said it would be 'misleading' to assert that US business was totally negative, because the Dunkel paper had many positive proposals. 'We are trying to limit the number and extent of changes necessary' to keep the whole agreement from unravelling,' he declared. The MTN Coalition, a group of multinational companies and groups backing the Round, was also in conference yesterday. Its executive director, Mr Harry Freeman, said: 'There is no way we can take a position until we see what happens on tariffs and services liberalisation. 'We're saying: 'Run ahead with these negotiations as fast as possible; otherwise the nay-sayers can work the (Capitol) Hill for a number of months and create a hostile atmosphere there'.' Chief among the 'nay-sayers' were the the American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI), the American Apparel Manufacturers Association and a number of EC apparel and textile groups who flew to Washington to express their opposition. 'Countries which have cavalierly disregarded the most fundamental rules of international trade, are notorious dumpers, subsidisers and polluters and have built insurmountable tariff protections, will be the main beneficiaries of this plan,' Mr Neil Hightower, ATMI president, said. The groups sought a 15-year phase-out of the Multifibre Arrangement, against the 10 years in the Dunkel proposals, and said all countries should set up strong verification procedures to ensure pacts to open markets were honoured. Central to US industry objections is the proposed new multilateral dumping code. Mr Michael Coursey, a Washington lawyer advising the US Chamber of Commerce, said the proposed code was unacceptable to US business.</p>

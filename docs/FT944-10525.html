			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / People: Reuters' Sanderson takes on the States Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news company, has promoted Michael Sanderson, chief executive officer of Instinet, its fast-growing, US-based equity brokerage service. From January 1, he will become chairman of Reuters America Holdings, which oversees all the group's activities in the Americas. Sanderson, 51, who will continue as Instinet's chief executive, will report in both roles to Andre Villeneuve, an executive director of the London-based group who currently chairs Reuters America Holdings. Instinet, Reuters America - responsible for the group's financial information and media activities - and Reuters NewMedia, which has recently made a series of small multimedia acquisitions in the US, will continue to operate as separate entities. Brian Vaughan, president of Reuters America, and Buford Smith, president of Reuters NewMedia, will report to Sanderson. Villeneuve said the appointment was an important stage in the development of the group's activities in the Americas. Including revenue from Instinet, the US now outweighs the City of London as the group's biggest single market. Sanderson joined Instinet as president and CEO in 1990. Before that he was with Merrill Lynch, where he started in 1967 as an investment executive, rising ultimately to the position of chairman and ceo of Merrill-Lynch Canada.</p>

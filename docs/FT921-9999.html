			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The Week Ahead British Petroleum is likely to report sharply lower pre-tax profits for its fourth quarter on Thursday, following the steep decline in oil prices late last year. Analysts' estimates go as low as Pounds 48m, although this is expected to be boosted to just over Pounds 100m by gains from asset sales. This compares with a fourth quarter profit of Pounds 456m for 1990. Full-year profits for 1991 are also likely to be down on the previous year by about 10 per cent to just under Pounds 1bn. All sectors are expected to have shown a decline, including refining and nutrition. Interest in Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news group, will focus on Wednesday not so much on its annual results, but on how trials are going of the long-delayed second phase of Dealing 2000, its automated trading system for foreign exchange, and of Globex, which will provide screen-based trading of futures and options. Their success is likely to be key to the future growth of Reuters, which has had to cope with retrenchment in the world's financial centres. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 334m to the end of December, compared with Pounds 320m. Amstrad, the consumer electronics group headed by Alan Sugar, is expected to announce an interim pre-tax loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m on Tuesday. In a PC market disrupted by oversupply and weak consumer demand, Amstrad has had to cut prices to combat competition from the likes of IBM and Philips. The first half is traditionally the better half for Amstrad as Christmas boosts sales, but this past season children bought Nintendos instead and the company described sales in the run-up to Christmas as dramatically down on the previous year. The one promising area, satellite dishes, has also been weakening. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to report its first yearly quarter fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its results on Thursday. Forecasts for the three months to the end of December range from Pounds 220m to Pounds 240m. Last year Hanson reported a 7 per cent increase in taxable profits to Pounds 241m.</p>

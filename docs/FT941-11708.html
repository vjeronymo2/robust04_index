			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / CBI warns Labour on tax The Labour party was warned by the Confederation of British Industry last night that its plans to close tax loopholes would have damaging consequences for investment, growth and employment. Mr Howard Davies, CBI president, said measures proposed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, would raise an additional Pounds 3.6bn from business over two years. That would represent an increase of almost 25 per cent in the current corporation tax yield, which Labour would use for higher public spending or lower personal taxes. In CBI News, Mr Howard added: 'That kind of switch is precisely what the economy does not need at a time when investment is historically low, and consumption, both personal and public, correspondingly high.' Mr Davies added that many of the measures proposed by Labour were also individually objectionable. It would remove carry-forward and carry-back provisions and reverse the introduction of the foreign income dividends scheme. In addition the proposed windfall tax on privatised utilities' profits would probably push up charges to business users and also lead to cut-backs in investment programmes.</p>

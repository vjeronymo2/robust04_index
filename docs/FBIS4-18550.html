			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation is very confused in Kigali. This is  why the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels reacted very cautiously:    [Ambassador] I am deeply shocked by this barbaric act which  took the lives of Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, president  of the Rwandan Republic; Mr Cyprien Ntaryamira, president of the  Republic of Burundi; and their aides who were accompanying them.  I am very worried about the situation and I would like to  express my indignation. I also want to say that I hope the  Rwandan people will be able to overcome the hardship they are  experiencing now.    [Announcer] The Rwandan ambassador in Brussels was  interviewed a few minutes ago by Francois Vouarnac.</p>

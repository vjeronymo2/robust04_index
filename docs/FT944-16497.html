			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Old ideas on jobless benefit given new suit of clothes: David Goodhart on cynicism over an allowance unveiled to the Tory faithful The Jobseeker's Allowance, the new benefit which will combine Unemployment Benefit and Income Support, was yesterday being paraded around the Conservative party conference. But in the Jobcentres there is confusion about what it will mean, and a certain cynicism about how much of the proposal is new. Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, both stressed yesterday that the allowance was part of a tough new contract between the unemployed person and the state. Mr Portillo told the Tory faithful: 'We shall ask those seeking a job to make a bargain with the taxpayer: to commit themselves to follow a solid programme of action directed towards getting work. They must agree to apply for jobs, go to interviews, attend courses, (and) get re-trained.' This emphasis on the contract and on the fact that an unemployed person can turn down a job offer or a training place only if he or she has very good reason is the closest Britain gets to the idea of working for benefit, or workfare. But Mrs Margaret Walker, manager of 12 Jobcentres in south-east London, points out that her officials can already, after 13 weeks, take away benefit from people who are turning down jobs or making insufficient effort to find work. Taking away benefits happens relatively seldom. Mrs Walker said that only nine people in her area - which includes some of the highest levels of unemployment in Britain - had been refused benefit for turning down a job offer this year out of 53,000 unemployed. The number is small not because staff are 'soft' - the figures are similar all over the country - but because of the relatively long procedures and the fact that few claimants will allow the process to get to the final stage. The idea of the contract between claimant and the state is a development of an existing idea. Mr Robin Smith of Greenwich Jobcentre in south-east London said: 'We already have back-to-work plans that a claimant must sign, so we are a bit puzzled about what all the fuss is about.' These back-to-work plans are tailored by staff to each individual claimant. They may, for example, require a claimant to visit a Jobcentre twice a week and to make a certain number of job inquiries. The cynicism of Jobcentre staff towards the more political aspects of the allowance does not mean they are opposed to it. Mrs Walker said: 'It has been causing some anxiety because so few details have been released so far.' That should end next month when a white paper is published, with a view to the new benefit starting in April 1996. Anything that brings the Benefits Agency closer to the Jobcentres - part of the Employment Service - is welcomed. Jobcentres are now responsible for Unemployment Benefit, which is about Pounds 44 per week. Jobcentres also act as agents for the Benefits Agency in paying the most important benefit, Income Support. This is complex and governed by different rules to Unemployment Benefit, and claimants often have difficulties that Jobcentre staff cannot solve. The new allowance will mean more Benefits Agency staff in Jobcentres. Merging the benefits will be a relief to most claimants and staff. But it is a long-overdue technical reform, which cannot stand the weight of political rhetoric being placed upon it. Conference reports, Page 12</p>

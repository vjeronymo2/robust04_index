			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Borrowing rules for public bodies may ease SCHOOLS and hospitals could be allowed to borrow against their assets if government plans for finding new ways of involving private finance in public projects are implemented. The Treasury believes that the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Home Office are among areas with the most scope for the government's private finance initiative to move beyond the transport infrastructure. All three departments are also in the first round of the longer-term public spending review announced earlier this week, and so have a particular incentive to find ways of stretching their budgets. Extending the ability to borrow would build on the move announced in the Autumn Statement, when the rule preventing universities from borrowing against Exchequer-funded assets was ended. The old universities have made little use of the power so far, but many new universities - formerly polytechnics - which have had a similar ability for a few years, have taken more advantage of the change. 'We need to think whether the model applies elsewhere,' one minister said yesterday. Proposals are unlikely to be far enough advanced for inclusion in next month's Budget, but could be ready in time for the first unified Budget and spending statement in December. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, is to use a series of meetings with all Whitehall departments over the next few months to discuss ideas for pressing ahead with the private finance initiative. He will outline the government's plans to the cross-party Treasury committee next week. Private involvement in transport projects - where the cost can be passed on to the user through charges - has seen the greatest advance in the initiative so far. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is to publish a consultation paper after Easter on introducing tolls on motorways, and there is already discussion of how the rules on funding for roads might be adapted to rail projects. Ministers believe that the private sector has a valuable role to play in upgrading public-sector capital stock. Large sums could be at stake. While there are no precise figures for capital spending on schools and hospitals in 1992-93, capital investment in health, excluding trust hospitals, is estimated at Pounds 1.43bn, and in education, by local government, at Pounds 1.08bn. Giving the private sector a greater role would not necessarily mean that the public sector would withdraw from providing capital in these spheres, ministers say. However if private finance proved a better way of providing capital for a particular type of asset, they say, then the public spending priorities would be bound to change.</p>

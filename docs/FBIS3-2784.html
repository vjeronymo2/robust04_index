In the meeting, both of them stressed the common interests  the two countries have in global, regional, and bilateral  matters, Christopher told a press conference, which was held  here today at the end of his four-day official visit to China.    "He (Qian) stressed, as I had, that China wants a broad and  solid relationship with the United States," Christopher said.    "In an overall sense, I find the differences between China  and the U.S. are narrowing somewhat," he added.    He noted that China and the United States concluded here  this  morning the statement on cooperation in implementing the  memorandum of understanding on prohibiting import and export  trade in prison labor products.    In addition to the human rights and most-favored-nation  issues, he and Qian also discussed a number of other matters,  including regional security matters, the forthcoming APEC  conference, various trade issues, defense conversion and other  military issues, Christopher said.</p>

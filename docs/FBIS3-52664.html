Andreatta, who arrived here last night from his two-day  official visit to India, is also slated to meet with Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa who will brief him on Cairo's efforts  to mediate between the Israel and Palestinians as well as the  divisions within the Palestine Liberation Organization, where  opposition is strong against Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's  negotiating with Tel Aviv.    Among the economic projects Italy is ready to work on in  favor of Middle East peace is the three-way projects between the  European Union, Arab nations and Israel to build a 500 kilometer  gas pipeline from Port Said, in Egypt's Nile Delta, to Sidon,  through the Eguptian desert and the Gaza Strip, with an eventual  extension to Tel Aviv.    Italy has been active in Egypt for some time through its  national fuel companies ENI [National Hydrocarbons Agency] and  Agip and has almost completed a feasibility study on the  pipeline which will be then presented to the World Bank, the  European Union and interested Arab countries. The plan deals  with both the technical and financial aspects of building the  pipeline which will initially pump two billion cubic meters per  year, to later be expanded to six billion cubic meters.    Rome has been working for some time on this so-called  "pipeline for peace" and it was recently discussed in Tunis  during the encounter between Italian Head of State Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro and 'Arafat. The project is viewed as a concrete  example of the determination of nations most interested in peace  and stability in the Mediterranean and which are ready to  support, even economically, the peace process begun last year  with the reciprocal recognition between the PLO and Israel, on  the condition that it succeed.    The current obstacles to the peace process included border  controls between the Palestinian autonomous regions and Jordan  and Egypt, the security of Israeli settlements and the expansion  of the Palestinian-controlled area of Jericho, which Israel  intends as the city, alone, while the PLO wants to control the  entire province.    The Palestinians also must deal with the problem of how to  finance their administration of the autonomous areas and pay for  a police force of between seven to fifteen thousand men.</p>

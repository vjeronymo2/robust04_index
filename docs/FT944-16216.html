			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: What a Performance - Theatre Some things pass away forever, leaving not a wrack nor even a half-way decent video behind. It seems, for instance, that the performing greatness of comedian Sid Field now lives only in the memory of the second world war generation. His films were flops. He died - from a heart attack in 1950 at the tragically young age of 45 - before the rise of television; but by all accounts his was an act that relied on sheer presence. Illustrious commentators - Peter Ustinov, John Osborne, Chaplin himself - agree that Field was the funniest clown of all. From such of his scripts as survive and from the facts of his brief life, William Humble has put together an agreeable portrait-show called What a Performance, directed by Roger Redfarn and designed by Paul Farnsworth, which searches for the secret of Field's greatness. David Suchet takes the main role and first of all we see him in his own person in a dressing-room set surrounded by the blackness of the bare stage, as he puts on his wig and recites those brief facts: obscure birth in Birmingham, childhood on the stage, quarter-century yoked by rotten contracts to the provincial circuit, six explosive years as the biggest star in the West End with an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance, then burn-out and transformation into a legend, the last of the great music-hall comedians. Bewigged and sparkling, a cheekie chappie with a Brum accent, Suchet stays in role from now on, as a sequence of biographical vignettes unfolds with set-piece comic routines and songs interpolated. We see little Sid's primal scene of instruction: a suburban tea-table at which his iron-willed theatrical mother is holding forth while the lad pours tea in a long stream down to a cup held on the floor by his Dad (Clive Panto), a redundant whip-maker with a relentless sense of humour who chooses to live under the table. Soon widowed, Marilyn Cutt's Bertha follows her son around the country, organising his career like an implacable Mary Poppins with richly rolled Birmingham 'r's. It is as a mother-fixated son, a timid negotiator of contracts, a husband turning his ear against responsibility like his ostrich-father, that we are shown the Sid Field behind the gags. But the gags keep coming in again, and they get Sid to heaven, at any rate, in this not very deeply pondered exploration of his soul. Those gags were always valued for not being 'questionable' - and one does derive from the show a sense of the innocent gutsy humour of a bygone year - but they must have been quite camp if Suchet's performance is accurate. He is forever slipping into his pansy voice and does not, indeed, stop short of the questionable innuendo. But he wins the day with his skilful patter and athletic slapstick. He flies back and forth across the stage, beautifully avoiding a strategic banana in the palsied butler sketch (done as a lurid caricature worthy of Spitting Image) and one is lost in admiration for the slick acting ability of his tongue in the wide-mouthed frog routine. The interesting irony of What a Performance, which is all about the theatre and guys the kind of West-End first night that we were actually attending, is that even if the comedy routines went wrong, it would only be part of the play. Given Suchet's virtuosity and the dry brilliance of Christopher Godwin's splendidly lean, tall, straight man, Jerry Desmonde, there is little danger of that. Queen's Theatre, W1 (071 494 5040).</p>

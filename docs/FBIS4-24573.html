			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Weekly commentary" by Kung Yao-wen (7895 5069 2429): "The </F> Favorable New Conditions Created for Sino-U.S. Economic and  Trade Cooperation"]    [Text] Clinton "Changes His Stand"    The most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, which had  complicated Sino-U.S. ties for a long time, reached a decisive  period this week and became the focus of the Asia-Pacific region  and the world at large. As a matter of fact, many people had  already predicted before U.S. President Clinton's formal  announcement that he would inevitably reverse what he said last  year. Clinton had to "change his stand" because he did not have  many options. In the face of political, economic, and even  strategic realities, the United States simply cannot revoke  China's MFN trading status at this moment and wage a trade war  with China. But the U.S. political leadership refuses to  acknowledge the improvements that China's socialist  modernization program has brought to the people's livelihood and  democratic rights. As a result, Clinton extended China's MFN  for another year, even though he said that the situation of  China's human rights had not met the requirement of "overall  progress" that he set last year. Meanwhile, Clinton also stated  that human rights will be delinked from MFN in future annual  assessments.    Clinton's policy readjustment has been welcomed by the  Chinese and American people. The industrial and commercial  circles in Hong Kong and the surrounding areas can have a  breathing spell. If Sino-U.S. mutual benefit and cooperation  are harmed by problems other than trade, it will have a  far-reaching influence. When the interference of the  controversy over human rights is removed from Sino-U.S. economic  and trade relations in the future, it will be conducive to the  steady development and cooperation between the two countries as  well as to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.    In consideration of its own national interests, the U.S.  Administration eventually gave up the mistaken policy of linking  MFN with human rights. Figures from various quarters, including  those from Hong Kong, convincingly lobbied the U.S.  Administration, which helped effect the change in its stand.  Fundamentally speaking, the "linkage policy" was doomed to  failure. The United States had to squarely face China's  economic strength and potential development.  <H5>  The Removal of Additional Conditions </H5>   When reviewing this change in the future, historians may  judge this to mark the end of an era. "MFN" was actually a  historic term first raised by the Americans in dealing with  China. It was Britain that first used cannons and vessels to  break through China's gates in the 19th century, which was  followed by the U.S. request for "MFN." In other words, the  United States wanted to share the privileges enjoyed by the big  powers through the unequal treaties. Naturally, this was a  one-sided approach. China, which was subject to aggression and  humiliation, could not enjoy any privileges in the United  States. All the unequal treaties were abolished only after the  success of the Chinese revolution.    Today, MFN trading status is reciprocal and does not  represent a special favor. It is granted by the two sides to  enable them to normally conduct trade and avoid discriminatory  tariffs. After the foundation of the PRC, the United States  implemented the policy of encircling and embargoing China.  Thanks to the later normalization of ties between the two  countries, the United States granted MFN trading status to  China, but with the condition of human rights attached, which  continued to constitute pressure. It was China that persisted  in economic construction, upheld the policy of reform and  opening up, continuously enhanced its strength, and withstood  U.S. pressure. From breaking through the blockade and  encirclement in the past to the periodic victory won today, the  United States had to admit that bilateral economic and trade  cooperation can only be carried out on the basis of equality and  mutual benefit. Just imagine, if China had not maintained  stability or had no ability to fight back economically, the  United States could continue to regard trade as a favor with  which it could menace and threaten China.  <H5>  Reduce Troubles and Promote Cooperation </H5>   Over the years, the MFN issue had to be argued about every  year in the United States, which drove Sino-U.S. trade ties to  the edge and also upset the Hong Kong business circles.  Although these misgivings have been dispelled, there are still  problems in Sino-U.S. ties. Objectively speaking, the United  States will not let Sino-U.S. ties deteriorate. Viewed from the  current conditions, it is unlikely that the United States will  rapidly improve its ties with China.    First, the United States has continued to unreasonably  criticize China's human rights record. It is quite natural for  China and the United States, with different traditions of  historical, cultural, and social development, to have different  views on human rights, which can be exchanged on the basis of  equality and mutual respect and can be improved with concerted  efforts. China's human rights situation has continuously  improved along with the country's economic development and  political reform. There is also room for the United States to  improve its human rights. However, the United States has  stubbornly insisted on imposing its values on China and meddling  in China's internal affairs under such an excuse. This is  absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese, who have national pride.    Second, in bilateral economic and trade ties, the United  States is used to blaming the other side rather than improving  itself. Now that the MFN issue has been settled, there are some  people in the United States who want to target China with the  "Super 301" provisions. All these problems must be  appropriately resolved.    Moreover, the principles laid down in the three joint  communiques between the two countries need to be strictly  observed. There are some people in the United States who always  try to make an issue of the Taiwan and Tibet problems to  infringe upon China's sovereignty.    The Chinese side is sincere in developing its cooperation  with the United States. Both China and the United States are  two major powers in the Asia-Pacific region which are  economically complementary. Cooperation will benefit each side.  Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed the following remarks  on Sino-U.S. ties: Increase trust, reduce disagreements, develop  cooperation, and keep from confronting one another. We have  reason to believe that Sino-U.S. relations will continue to  advance and improve as long as China can maintain its political  situation and economic growth. As stated by Singapore's Lee  Kuan-yew earlier this year, as MFN was renewed last year, it  cannot be revoked this year, because the interests of the United  States cannot be separated from China's cooperation year in and  year out. This has become an irresistible trend.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Overseas operations and life side lift AIG AMERICAN International Group, one of the largest US composite insurers, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 425.6m in the three months to end-June, a 6.1 per cent improvement on the same period a year earlier. The result takes profits for the first six months of 1992 to Dollars 839.5m, against Dollars 776.4m in the previous year. The figures are scored after realised investment gains of Dollars 26.5m (against Dollars 31m a year ago) in the second quarter, and Dollars 54.5m (Dollars 54.6m) for the six months. Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, said the second quarter had been 'reasonably good' for the company overall. The US property-casualty market continued to be 'very competitive in most lines of business other than the specialty classes', and catastrophe losses had been particularly heavy. But life operations and sizeable overseas operations 'provided a counterbalance'. General insurance operations made an underwriting loss of Dollars 15.9m in the six months, compared with a profit of Dollars 41.8m a year earlier. But higher investment income meant that operating profit fell only 1.5 per cent to Dollars 599.8m (Dollars 608.8m). Net premiums were Dollars 4.63bn against Dollars 4.62bn. The life operations, by contrast, pushed up operating profits by 16 per cent in the first half, to Dollars 295.2m (Dollars 254.5m). Premium income rose to Dollars 2.26bn from Dollars 1.91bn. Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group planning to divest its property-casualty insurance operations, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 60.3m for the quarter to end-June against Dollars 55.1m a year ago. Profits from the businesses which will form the continuing group rose from Dollars 43m to Dollars 97.5m. Half-year after-tax profits stand at Dollars 143.9m (Dollars 63m).</p>

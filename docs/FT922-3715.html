			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Der fliegende Hollander - Opera On Monday a new Dutchman launched the 21st season of week-long Midland Bank Proms at the Royal Opera House. It went off with a bang: a lively, purposeful staging of an opera which, for all its sanctified position as the first great Wagner music-drama, so often goes dull and purposeless in the theatre. At Covent Garden the full resources of contemporary stage technology are used to 'do the piece', not to re-invent it in the high-concept terms that have become fashionable in recent years. (The 1986 Royal Opera production, with its factory sets and blue-jeaned Senta, was an unloved and short-lived example of the latter trend.) The producer and set-designer of this latest London Dutchman, Ian Judge and John Gunter, have gone for spectacle which modernises the stagecraft of the libretto while leaving its dramatic properties essentially unscathed. A great pivoted wooden platform spins and dips and rears up to serve the shipboard scene of the first part and the dockside of the last (the opera is given in single-act form). Contrasts of local and supernatural, elemental outdoors and cosy indoors, are neatly achieved with the raising and dropping of sails and sea-front facades, the sharp-eyed detail of Deirdre Clancy's costumes, the sudden blazing or dimming of lights. The production looks at once complex and simple, spectacular and practical. Big effects are swiftly and surely worked up. The drama whizzes along. Mr Judge, director of (among many others) the celebrated ENO Faust, Opera North Show Boat and Boris Godunov, and RSC Wizard of Oz and Comedy of Errors, almost always comes up with a terrific show, and does so once more in his first Covent Garden venture. My own feelings of deep disappointment at the showbiz superficiality of it all  - the limited poetic horizons and stunted humanity of the treatment, the patina of 'efficiency' that lies on the opera like a thick cosmetic cover - will not be widely shared, will indeed appear the grossest ingratitude. One person on stage, however, wakens the performance to the high-Romantic thrill to which it otherwise seems so strangely and resoundingly impervious. This is Julia Varady, an artist in the full bloom of glorious maturity, whose every note, every word, every action quickens with 'felt life', with passionate spontaneity and musicianly and dramatic warmth. The very vibrancy in the timbre removes this soprano from the realm of Northern-myth Sentas: the sfumature of Miss Varady's singing, with its loving legato and portamento phrasing, are generally thought of as belonging to the world of Italian opera, though of course Wagner (himself a connoisseur of fine Italianate singing) blossoms in such vocal conditions. She is not a dramatic-soprano Senta, not limitless in stamina; while from that small frame (set in particular relief by the presence of so many tall male principals) some remarkable and fearless utterances are thrown out, the climaxes of the duet with the Dutchman tax all her resources. Yet this too humanises the portrayal, and with it the notion of redemptive self-sacrifice, into something utterly fresh and vital - Miss Varady is neither the icon-Senta of past Wagnerian treatment nor the nut-case-Senta of recent years, but a flesh-and-blood creature upon whom the whole emotional and poetic drama can properly be fastened. Ideally, she needs to play opposite a Dutchman of similar vitality, similar quickness of response. James Morris's Heldenbariton is well known in this theatre; and though on Monday he started the evening in unwontedly dry, hollow-voiced form, hooking and lifting up into the notes, the large sounds and securely-shaped phrases soon came into focus. I feel about Mr Morris's performance the same dastardly ingratitude as I do about the show as a whole: admiration for his bigness and security of vocal craft, weariness at the sheer predictability and externalised effects-making of his characterisation. The Swede Thomas Sunnegardh is a personable, slightly shallow-voiced Erik, Neill Archer an alert and agreeably lyrical young Steersman (he also dances notably well), Anne Wilkens a pleasantly tough, unfussy Mary. Gwynne Howell's first Covent Garden Daland, though he too started the evening in rough voice, is no cartoon capitalist but a rounded human being - Mr Howell's gift for understated but sharply observed comedy, too little employed, makes a welcome re-appearance. The conductor is Christoph von Dohnanyi. Fine playing and singing from the much-improved chorus, a forward-moving impulse to the solos and duets, a clear and authoritative eye on the big climaxes, an exciting sweep to the finale: the performance has all the now-familiar Dohnanyi virtues and many others besides. What it lacks is genuine grandeur, ripe affection for the picturesque musical elements (the sailor jollifications lose their rhythmic bounce by being too evenly accented), richness and variety of atmosphere. In a sense, conducting and production are all of a piece. Sponsored by Royal Opera House Trust; in repertory until July 1</p>

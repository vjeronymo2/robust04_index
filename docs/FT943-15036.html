			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Speaker considering cash for questions inquiry The nature of an inquiry into claims that two Conservative MPs were willing to accept money for tabling parliamentary questions remained in doubt last night after Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said she was considering the matter, David Owen writes. Her comments came just 24 hours after the two MPs - Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - were suspended as junior ministerial aides. This followed newspaper allegations that they had been willing to table official questions in the Commons in return for Pounds 1,000 each. Downing Street said their suspension was pending the outcome of 'any inquiry which may be instituted by the committee of privileges'. If there was no privileges committee inquiry, an internal party probe would be conducted by the whips. Mr John Major yesterday threw his weight behind 'clear and appropriate' rules on MPs' conduct, letting it be known he was 'very concerned' to ensure that high standards in public life were maintained. But Downing Street emphasised it was not yet clear that the two men - who both deny wrongdoing  -had a case to answer. Mr Riddick backed an inquiry, saying it would enable him to make clear he had done 'nothing illegal or improper'.</p>

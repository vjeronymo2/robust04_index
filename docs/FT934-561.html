			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Yeltsin sets opposing courses: The two main tasks handed to the government are incompatible President Boris Yeltsin has set himself and his government two important - and incompatible - tasks. At a news conference in the Kremlin on Monday, a slow and halting Russian president said economic reform would continue despite the reformers' poor showing in the elections two weeks ago. Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and the man most associated with reform, would remain in the cabinet. 'Gaidar stays,' said Mr Yeltsin, 'and that means the course which he has brought in with the president and the government stays.' Yet, the reform course Mr Gaidar has set in motion is not the one he really wants to pursue. Nor is it the policy that many Russians blame him for. Since returning to office in September, Mr Gaidar, in overall charge of the government's economic departments, has punctured his predecessor Mr Oleg Lobov's attempt to reinstate the economics ministry as a kind of revamped Gosplan. However, only at times has he been able to dam the flow of credits to state industries and he has completely failed to produce a strategy which might let some of those industries collapse. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, made clear last week that he blames Mr Gaidar's reforms for the reformers' defeat in the polls and that he must 'think again'. Mr Gaidar himself, in off-the-cuff remarks, seems inclined to agree, commenting that higher investment and an end to falling production are now priorities. At his news conference President Yeltsin also commended a 'more socially oriented' course for the government. If inflation continued to fall social spending should rise, he said, and warned that economic reforms had to be made 'strictly in accordance with the constitution'. The latter is a grab-bag of commitments, but insofar as they are economic, they lay down that Russia 'shall be a social state' and that the state shall ensure 'a guaranteed minimum wage, state support for the family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood, and also support for the disabled and for elderly citizens, develop a system of social services and establish government pensions, benefits and other social security guarantees'. The Gaidar reform course, however, insofar as that is defined as a monetary-based strategy aimed at stabilising the economy, is simply incompatible with any greatly increased social spending in the short term. The International Monetary Fund, which has made known that it too wants to see more social spending, must attempt early next year to come to an agreement with a government with contradictory aims - having failed to do so this year with a government supposedly set on a radical reform course. The new government will inherit a budget deficit of Rbs6 trillion (million million) - that is, budgetary expenditure delayed from this year to keep the deficit within 10 per cent of gross national product, but which must be paid. The second incompatibility is more directly political. Mr Yeltsin said he wanted his government (albeit smaller) to stay, that it would not be a coalition, and that he would seek to work with parliament and with a 'constructive' opposition, in which he included Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats. The government is already a coalition. Some of its ministers stood on Mr Gaidar's Russia's Choice ticket, others on that of the Party of Unity and Accord. Others scorned both. As the past week has shown, the cabinet is now a group of openly quarrelling individuals. If, however, a reform team is kept together, it will be heavily opposed by the largest part of the parliamentary parties. Though Russia's Choice, with over 100 seats claimed, is the biggest group in the lower house, or State Duma, the two other reformist parties only bring the total up to 155-160. The anti-reformers are likely to be able to count on over 200. To be sure, Mr Zhirinovsky's LDP is regarded with some doubt by the Communists and their allies. But Mr Genady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, has made clear he does not regard the LDP as fascist and wants to explore co-operation. The opposition groups will thus fight for the allegiance of the independent and other small party votes from a position of strength. Government is thus likely to continue against a parliamentary background of opposition.</p>

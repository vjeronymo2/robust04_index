			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of the second concept would be coordinated through the national Operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lifesaver headquarters office located in Alexandria, Virginia. This second concept would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate individual recruitment of National Service volunteers at the local level and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide participants with opportunities to provide service to their local communities and states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to participate in the development of viable transportation safety programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.4.2&blank;Goals and Priorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program addresses the following national priorities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Education_Participants will be exposed to a variety of project specific tasks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and general job skills that could prepare participants for future employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Public Safety_Operation Lifesaver assists in promoting public awareness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dangers associated with rail crossings, trespassing on railroad properties, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improper use of motor vehicles around rail facilities. Further, it will bring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audiences into contact with local police and other law enforcement agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will open the lines of communication and create opportunities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Human Needs_This Program will stimulate awareness of rail and highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety-related problems within local and State communities and bring people  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together to address them. The programs will also provide safety training to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wide audience, ranging in age from pre-schoolers to senior citizens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Environment_Operation Lifesaver has been successful in reducing community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental hazards associated with rail crossings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.4.3&blank; Anticipated Outcomes and Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. The utilization of a community service organization would result in benefits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the local communities and provide needed public education in the area of rail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety to the specifically targeted audiences and the general public. As past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records have shown, there should be a downward trend in accidents, injuries,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and trespasser violations in conjunction with the Operation Lifesaver Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statistics developed would be readily available for program evaluation, cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, and community acceptance and adoption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The hiring and placement of assistant administrative coordinators throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation Lifesaver system would result in better coordination of the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with railroad companies, law enforcement agencies, local and state governments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the various informational media and the general population. The opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function within an established program would enhance the job skills and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal marketability for the participants for future endeavors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both concepts will expose the participants to the opportunity to perform community service, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhance the development of personal qualities, educational values and positive work ethics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.4.4&blank;Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOT intends to apply for funding for program costs, including living allowances, educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awards, health insurance, and child care costs, from the National Service Corporation. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgetary review is ongoing at this time to seek other sources of funding within DOT. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National and Community Service Act will be an item in the Fiscal Year 1996 budget submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Federal Railroad Administration, and it is anticipated that direct funding for national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service involvement in the Operation Lifesaver program may be available from DOT in future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.4.5&blank;DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Operation Lifesaver and adjunct trespasser programs are addressed by several of the DOT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modal administrations, specifically the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Highway Administration (FHWA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.4.6&blank;DOT Contacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Gordon J.

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Rome shows its warm smile in winter - Even after an ordeal by traffic chaos, Tom Fort is enchanted by the golden and ancient beauty of Italy's capital From the balcony on the top of the palazzo, the Roman morning had a golden tranquillity. The sun had risen beside the absurd bulk of the monument to Victor Emanuel, making the curved tiles on the roofs below me glow, and touching the ochre and apricot walls of the ancient buildings around. Looking from left to right, I could see the Campidoglio, then the solemn and severe Jesuit church of Gesu, the grandiose church of San Carlo ai Catinari, and the shining dome of Sant' Andrea Della Valle. Garibaldi on his horse frowned from the distant shadows of the Janiculum. But the pale spiral above Sant' Ivo's church restored light and gaiety, while across the river rose St Peter's, with the grey, professorial mass of the Collegio Romano in the foreground to my right. At ground level, peace gave way to mechanised bedlam. It was the last week before Christmas, and Rome was going about its business in characteristic style. I was there to assist a brother whose business is supplying smoked salmon. I was thrown the keys of the car, piled high with packages for delivery, and told to be on my way. With my map-reading guide, a Scottish lady of noble birth, thoroughly Romanised and highly diverting company, I set off, palms damp, mouth dry, heart quaking. Up the Via della Gatta we went, with the soaring walls of the palazzo above, then round to the Piazza Venezia, where all Roman journeys seem to begin and end. There the ordeal by fire is faced. From a dozen directions the streams of traffic flood, bouncing over the cobbles, weaving, swerving, tacking, darting, while a policeman on a pedestal seeks to restrain chaos from turning into warfare. I trust it is not xenophobia which suggests that the manners of the Roman motorist are atrocious. No one lets anyone through, or says thank you. The grateful wave is unknown; manual gestures are for impugning virility or parentage. The dominant characteristic is a tense, vigilant aggression, underpinned by contempt for all other road users and a finely tuned, instinctive sense of timing. The most dangerous drivers, they say, are nuns, who are inhibited by Christian charity from observing the unwritten rules. I watched a sister attempting to steer a Fiat Uno full of fellow sisters into a space big enough for a two-ton truck. Three times they all got out to examine the nature of the problem, while behind them an almighty snarl developed. At last patience was exhausted. A horn sounded, triggering a cacophony, as the black habits jumped aboard and the little car edged forward. Though I never learned to drive alla Romana, I acquired the disregard for others necessary for survival. And I began to enjoy being a delivery boy. The pre-Christmas period is one of frenzied labour for my brother. Far and wide we journeyed, Caroline and I: to hideous hotels, where cocky jobsworths tried in vain to duck paying; to friendly bars, where a cappuccino and sticky bun were gladly given; to a princess who demanded a startling discount and would not back down; to a smart restaurant where the head waiter rebuked us for arriving when customers were present; to the elegant Cafe Greco, where no such snobbery prevailed; and to a score of flats and villas in suburbs posh and tatty. It was not all work, though. On the Sunday before Christmas, in sunshine warm enough for May, I set off towards the river. I strolled through the prettiest square in Rome, the Piazza San Ignazio, which is built like an opera set, and where at any moment you expect the shutters behind the balconies to fly open and a Cavaradossi or Floria Tosca to appear. I passed by the Pantheon, skirted the Piazza Navona and wandered past the antique shops of the Via dei Coronari, until I came to the Ponte San Angelo, with the squat, cocoa-coloured fortress of San Angelo beyond. Beneath the Bernini figures on the bridge, a man with a ponytail was fishing. Miracle of miracles, he caught something, a roach or chub or its Roman equivalent, which must have weighed 1 lb or so. It kicked and glinted in the sunlight, until he thrust it into a plastic bag full of water, in which it floated belly up. I watched him for a time, hoping in vain for a repeat performance. Then I joined the crowds ebbing toward St Peter's. As midday sounded on the great bells, the Pope appeared in cream robes at a distant window of the Vatican. As his homily boomed over the loudspeakers, the throng below half-listened and chattered. A Dutchman resembling Samuel Beckett approached me. Billy Graham is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he confided. 'I am afraid I do not agree,' I replied. He looked mad enough to have a weapon under his raincoat, so I drifted away, grinning amiably. My brother took me to lunch at a resplendent villa near the Coliseum. I was introduced as the fishing correspondent of the Weekend FT, and told the hostess of my Rome exclusive: how I had seen a fish being caught in the Tiber. She seemed impressed; in the main, though, the talk was not of fish but, as so often during my stay, of the remorseless exposure of the cancerous corruption of Italian public life. Politically rudderless, Italy is sunk in recession. Trade in the smart shops was sluggish and the restaurants were quiet. Other aspects of life were blessedly unchanged. The market in the Campo dei Fiori pulsed with life and colour, and the ice-creams at Giolitti's  - visciole, fragola, myrtillo, mora - were as mouth-watering as ever. It was nine years since I had been in Rome, and I had forgotten how lovely the city is; lovelier still in winter than in the heat-soaked, tourist-infested frenzy of summer, and friendlier.</p>

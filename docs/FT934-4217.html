			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: New issues rush to beat the deadline  -Business expansion scheme / The Budget and You With less than a month before the business expansion scheme is extinguished, new issues are appearing with ever increasing urgency. Close Brothers has launched a second issue of BESSA RBS for the Royal Bank of Scotland to raise Pounds 20m. The BES will buy repossessed properties from the bank to be let on assured tenancies. While the first issue, launched in September, offered a fixed return of 120p for every 100p invested, the exit price on the second issue is 125p after five years, equating to a net annual return of 14.3 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. Alternatively, investors can choose a 60p fixed return plus 2.6p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 index, subject to a maximum of 150p (FT-SE growth of 34.6 per cent). There are lock-ins when the Footsie has grown by enough to give a return of 125p and 150p. RBS is providing a guaranteeing covenant and Best BES Advice, published by the Allenbridge Group, says this represents 'excellent security.' Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and investors can put money in both schemes. Pilgrims Assured Homes, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance and supported by the Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association, aims to raise Pounds 5m to provide subsidised accommodation for low-income families. The contracted exit price of 128p equates to 14.3 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer (the calculation of returns depend on a number of factors, such as when tax relief can be claimed). Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Foundation 30 is a new type of arranged exit scheme from Capital Ventures to give investors returns over 30 years. The money is being raised for the College of St Mark and St John in Devon, which is affiliated to the University of Exeter. Investors will get tax relief on their initial investment, and a return after five years of 35p for every 100p invested. They will sell a fixed proportion of their remaining shares each year to get an annual and rising tax-free return for the following 25. This is envisaged at an initial 6.29p, increasing by 4 per cent a year. BESt Investment, which analyses schemes, says the college should be able to meet its buyback commitments given the ground rent and fees earned by the college and says the scheme has merit for those about to retire or planning school fees. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Northern Counties Homemaker, sponsored by MMI, aims to provide newly-built homes in Rochdale and Wakefield for those on local authority waiting lists. MMI says the exit price of 124p equates to 14.6 per cent compound annual growth after five years for a higher-rate taxpayer. Schemes which do not have an arranged exit include the Glasgow Student Village Companies, which will buy properties in Glasgow to let to students. The scheme should pay a regular dividend based on the rental yield. Cirencester Properties Four will buy properties to let on assured tenancies in the West Country, while Luxury Family Homes, sponsored by MMI, will buy hotels to cater for adults and children. Minimum investment in all three schemes is Pounds 1,000. Addington Equestrian Centre is to raise money to save the centre, based near Buckingham. Directors include Lady Zinnia Judd and David Broome, the showjumper. Minimum investment is Pounds 500. Best BES Advice (071-409 1111); BESt Investment (071-936 2037).</p>

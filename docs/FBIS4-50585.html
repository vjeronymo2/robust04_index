			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Xiaohui (3769 2556 2547): "'Green Paper' </F> Calls For Augmenting Financial Support to China's Agriculture"]    [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The 1993-94  China Rural Economy Development Yearbook, which is also called  the economic "Green Paper," was published here recently. Apart  from presenting an analysis and forecast, the "Green Paper"  calls for more financial support for agriculture.    This second economic "Green Paper" presented by the rural  economy annual analysis project group jointly run by the  Institute of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences and the Statistical Department of Rural Economy of the  State Statistical Bureau provides descriptions, analyses, and  relevant comparisons, rendered in the most objective manner  possible, of all aspects of the Chinese rural economy last year,  and a brief forecast of this year's development.    The report holds that the year 1993 saw quite rapid growth  in  the general level of agricultural production, and the  agricultural output composition experienced another remarkable  adjustment. The growth rate of nonagricultural sectors in rural  areas reached unprecedented heights.    Over the past year, industry and tertiary industry's share  of  the output value and labor force of rural areas continued to  increase. The major regions of East, Central, and West China  generally matched each other in terms of the high growth rate of  township and town enterprises, whereas the gap between different  regions continued to widen in the per-capita income of the  peasants. The consumer goods sales volume on the rural market  grew at a relatively low and stable rate, while commodity prices  soared rapidly, input in agriculture dropped, rural areas were  faced with a shortage of funds, and the macroeconomic regulation  and control of agriculture was less effective...    The "Green Paper" discloses that the state's financial  outlay  on agriculture was more than 43 billion yuan last year, an  increase of more than 7 percent over the previous year. Of this  outlay, about 13 billion yuan was spent on agricultural capital  construction, an increase of 16.4 percent over the previous  year, but this turned out to be a negative growth with the  inflation factor taken into account.    Therefore, increasing financial support for agriculture has  now been placed on the important agenda. A stronger appeal was  made by some high-ranking officials and experts present at  today's "Green Paper" symposium, co-sponsored by the Institute  of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,  the YAO BAO [6008 1032; IMPORTANT NEWS] editorial department,  and the Statistical Department of Rural Economy of the State  Statistical Bureau.    Forecasting this year's gross agricultural output value, the  "Green Paper" says the growth rate of the gross agricultural  output value will range from 3.5 to 6.5 percent, depending on  how good the harvest is this year. The gross output value  contributed by township and town enterprises and the gross  output value of rural areas will range from 25 to 30 percent and  from 15 to 20 percent respectively, varying from place to place  and depending on local macroeconomic development conditions.  The real growth in the per-capita income of peasants is  expected to be 3 to 4 percent.    Referring to this year's rural economic development, the  "Green Paper" says grain production may experience fluctuation,  the growth in the peasants' income will still be quite low, and  the output-employment flexibility [chan chu jiu ye tan xing 3934  0427 1432 2814 1734 1840] for nonagricultural sectors will still  be very low.    The "Green Paper" maintains that apart from giving more  financial support to agriculture, it is also necessary to  maintain a stable farming technique promotion team; minimize the  impact of inflation on the peasants' income; expedite the  comprehensive development of tertiary industry and small towns  in rural areas; and stabilize agricultural production.    The "Green Paper" holds that, in the next 10 years or more,  only by making efforts in four aspects--developing good-quality  high- return agriculture, speeding up the urbanization process,  expediting the development of tertiary industry in rural areas,  and building up regional composite networks for production,  processing, and marketing of good-quality high-return  agricultural products--will China be able to gradually solve the  two problems of low relative profitability of agriculture and  low relative fluidity of the agricultural labor force, and thus  begin, in the second decade of the next century, the process of  a substantial and continuous decrease in the agricultural  population.</p>

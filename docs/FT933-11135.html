			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (4): A community created from the slag heaps / Profile of Victoria THE Ebbw Fawr valley, on the edge of Ebbw Vale in Gwent, was within living memory a Hades of a steelmaking mill, collieries, slag heaps and railway tracks, crossing a land contaminated with red furnace dust, writes Roland Adburgham. The steelmaking ended in 1978; the collieries closed, and the land was reclaimed, at a cost of Pounds 20m, for last year's national garden festival. The festival, the last in a series of five in the UK, attracted 2m visitors and encouraged those who came from outside Wales to realise that the old image of the valleys was outdated. The big question, though, was what should happen after the festival closed last October. Would the steeply sloped site, with its thousands of planted trees and shrubs, be allowed to decay into an unkempt wilderness? Instead, the area was planned to have a full 'after use', with the parkland retained and a village named Victoria, with business and industrial units providing local jobs. To achieve this, the Victoria Partnership has been established - a joint venture between the Welsh Development Agency, Blaenau Gwent borough council and Gwent county council. Today, construction equipment is making access roads, and the first of 500 homes have been completed and sold by Redrow. Meanwhile, gardeners look after the festival's tropical plant house, the lake and 60 acres of ornamental gardens and woodland. Mr Robert Croydon, of King Sturge, property consultants to the partnership, says: 'There were three objectives: to arrest migration from the heads of the valleys, with people moving away because there were no quality homes, environment or jobs; to bring back people who had already moved away to the coastal belt; and to encourage people to come who had no prior connection with the area.' Nealon Tannon, a Bristol firm of architects, was chosen to design the village centre of Victoria Green with small shops and a family pub. Around it will be a mixture of houses for rent and sale and, nearby, self-build homes. There may be sheltered accommodation and a nursing home. 'We are trying to get a balance between young and single people and the elderly,' says Mr Croydon. Sculptures and four of the festival pavilions have been kept for such uses as a church and a village hall. To provide jobs, there are business and technology parks, alongside the recently built regional headquarters of Welsh Brewers. The festival at its peak employed 2,000 people, some of them redundant miners and steelworkers. Long-term, it is hoped there may be about 1,000 jobs created by the shops and business parks. Victoria is due to be completed by the year 2000, when it should be possible to judge whether a genuine new community has been created out of the slagheaps of the past.</p>

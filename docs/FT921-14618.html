			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan submits bid for troubled NY thrift CHASE Manhattan, the US money centre bank, has submitted a bid to acquire insolvent Crossland Savings, a troubled New York thrift, said Mr Michael Esposito Chase, chief financial officer, Reuter reports. 'We have submitted a bid,' he said. 'It would be a pick-up of core deposits if we are successful.' Last summer, regulators said they were trying to sell Crossland, and a deal is expected to be announced soon. Republic New York has said it would be interested but has not said if it has bid for Crossland, which was hurt by real estate loans. Turning to the bank's performance, he said that, over the next quarter or two, Chase would 'probably run a fairly high provision' for loan losses, but he hoped there would be some tapering-off after that. Mr Esposito said he hoped the provisions for loan losses would not be in excess of the fourth quarter's Dollars 315m. He stressed that problem commercial real estate continued to be a drag on Chase's earnings. In the fourth quarter, he said, Chase saw the first decline in commercial real estate problems in six quarters. 'We have seen quite a bit of moderation here. It looks like we are working through this difficult situation . . . we're starting to think we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.' Mr Esposito said that Chase had strong trading revenues in the fourth quarter and sees those continuing into the first quarter. In foreign exchange trading and trade in such instruments as derivatives, Chase had a 'very good' quarter, 'and that is continuing into the first quarter'. Mr Esposito said Chase's consumer banking operations earned Dollars 450m in 1991, and 'we are looking for an improvement in all our consumer businesses in 1992'. He added that among the consumer areas that ought to have better results in 1992 were credit cards and mortgage servicing. Private banking is also expected to do better.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter also requested that EPA accept certification by California or Europe in lieu of federal certification for reasons of economy. EPA's on-highway certification program requires that every vehicle sold in the United States be covered by a federal certificate of conformity. On-highway manufacturers are permitted to ``carry across'' emission data from testing performed to demonstrate compliance with California regulations to satisfy federal requirements. This is possible because the test procedures are identical. For the nonroad certification program, EPA envisions that similar certification and carryover/carry across policies will be in effect, which will allow manufacturers to use the test data from a test performed for European or California certification to satisfy federal requirements as long as the manufacturer provides evidence that the procedures used comply with the federal regulations. It is EPA's responsibility to assure compliance with federal regulations. Manufacturers should be assured, however, that the consistency and quality of the California certification program is such that engine families certified by California will very likely receive federal certification. At this time, European regulations are not final, so EPA cannot yet officially harmonize its requirements with Europe. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its proposal to require an annual federal certificate for each engine family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Technical Certification Test Procedure Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were provided on subparts D and E of the regulatory language, dealing with certification test equipment and test procedures. In some cases, the comments were corrections of typographical errors or inconsistencies within the regulatory language. In other cases, EPA was requested to modify technical aspects of its proposed procedure. EPA adopted some, but not all of, the requested changes. These are discussed in the Response to Comments Document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Implementation Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is adopting the implementation schedule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental and state organizations commented that EPA should shorten the total implementation period, stating that staggering implementation up to the year 2000 would delay important emissions benefits. On the other hand, engine manufacturers asked for one to two years additional time, citing costs and facility constraints. Equipment manufacturers also asked for one year to eighteen months to implement necessary equipment changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing state and environmental concerns, EPA considered a number of factors in its phase-in schedule determination. First, the category of engines to be regulated in 1996 represents about 30 percent of the total population. This first group includes engines similar to existing on-highway engines which can directly utilize the on-highway emission control strategies and will produce a substantial early benefit. The other three categories of engines belong to a manufacturing segment of the nonroad industry that has, for the most part, not previously been subject to EPA emission standards. Manufacturers of these categories of engines have neither the facilities in place to collect required information nor staff with experience in the certification process. Further, the phase-in schedule was designed to allow time for the technical development which will be needed for the category of smaller-sized engines to comply with the standards. Finally, over 95 percent of the total engine population to be regulated will be in compliance by the 1998 model year. The final category (in the year 2000, engines at or above 560 kW) represents a small percentage of the yearly sales population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that engine and equipment manufacturers have been provided enough flexibility in this rule (through such features as ABT for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and staggered schedules) to allow enough lead time for them to make any necessary changes or modifications by the implementation date. Engine manufacturers have stated that they intend to use the flexibilities of this rule to minimize the impact of these regulations on their equipment manufacturer customers. EPA designed the phase-in schedule so that smaller engines, which will be more difficult to control to the adopted NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard, and equipment using these engines, which may require the most modification due to tighter packaging constraints, have an additional one to two years for development before regulation. Furthermore, early banking allows manufacturers to selectively forego modifying specific models by collecting credits one year in advance of implementation from engines that have been made to comply with the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standards before the implementation date of the standard. Finally, ABT provides to manufacturers of that small percentage of engines requiring extensive modification the ongoing option to avoid situations where high cost or tight time constraints make modifications unreasonable. Therefore, EPA is retaining the implementation schedule as proposed. No additional time is being granted to engine, vehicle or equipment manufacturers. However, EPA will allow vehicle and equipment manufacturers a reasonable amount of time after the implementation dates for the different engine categories so that the equipment and vehicle manufacturers can clear their inventory of unregulated engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. In-use Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed an in-use recall program which included testing of in-use engines. EPA believes that a critical element in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines that continue to meet emission standards beyond the certification and production stages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the adopted regulations, EPA has the authority to recall engines which do not comply with emission standards in-use. As proposed, the in-use testing liability period will be up to seven years or 6,000 hours, whichever occurs first. This represents 70 to 75 percent of the nonroad engine average expected useful life. The repair period for which a manufacturer must remedy nonconformities would not be limited by actual years or hours; thus any resulting recall may be required to be applied to all engines of the recall family, regardless of the years or hours of an individual engine. In-use compliance with emission standards will be determined based on test results using the same test procedure as that used in certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed concern that EPA's recall program carefully select in-use engines which have been properly maintained and used and that are representative of engines in-use. EPA acknowledges the concern of this commenter. The Agency conducts its on-highway recall program with careful attention to compliance with the requirements of the CAA concerning proper maintenance and use, and will continue to do so for the nonroad program, although differences between uses for on-highway and nonroad equipment may require certain deviations from the on-highway program. EPA is modeling its large nonroad CI engine recall program after section 207 of the CAA and therefore the Administrator may require manufacturers to recall applicable engines if a substantial number of properly maintained and used engines are found to be out of conformity with the regulations issued under section 213 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

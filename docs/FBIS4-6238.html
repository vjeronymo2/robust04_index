			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "War Commotions Expanded Step by Step"] </F>   [Text] Recently, the heads of U.S. military circles have  increased their military threats against us.    Some time ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry let loose  outbursts that our nuclear development should be stopped even at  the risk of another war on the Korean peninsula, that the United  States will not rule out a preemptive strike against us, and  that it will make military preparations against war.    At the same time, the U.S. military circles are taking  actions, such as bringing in massive military equipment,  including Patriot missiles, to South Korea; concentrating its  Naval force in the waters around our country; and frequently  staging military exercises with the South Korean puppets.    The outward escalation [nogoljogin hwaktae] of the U.S.  military circles' military actions are extremely dangerous  provocative acts designed to carry into practice the war  scenario which they had rounded off through the Team Spirit  exercises with the purpose of crushing [apsal] our socialism  with force [him].    As it has been widely known, the Team Spirit joint military  exercise is a test nuclear war and a preliminary war opposing  us. The goal of such exercise is aimed at not only threatening  us militarily but also rounding off their preparations to  unleash a new Korean war. Now, the U.S. military circles  attempt to carry their provocative war plan into practice.    The step-by-step escalation of the U.S. military circles'  military actions opposing our republic is an expression of the  strategy of the expansion of arms market which had been worked  out through back-door dealings [maghuhungjong] between the U.S.  Administration and the U.S. war industry monopolies. The U.S.  war industry monopolies try to aggravate the situation by all  means in order to make enormous profits by manufacturing more  weapons. However, with the end of the Cold War, it became more  difficult for them to sell lethal weapons.    The U.S. administration officials are, without exception,  servants of big monopolies, especially munitions industry  monopolies. Hence, they try to unleash a war on the Korean  peninsula to fatten the munitions industry monopolies.    In the meantime, the South Korean puppet clique, which tries  to sustain its filthy life through outside dependence, maneuvers  to massively bring in U.S. weapons to give enormous profits to  the U.S. war industry monopolies and drive its fellow countrymen  into a whirlpool of war.    Stemming from these political goal and economic interests,  the U.S. military circles have set themselves onto the stage of  raising the curtain of the already-plotted Korean war scenario  and buckling down to promote it on a full scale.    Taking advantage of the reckless military actions taken by  the United States, the South Korean puppets made public their  war plan to invade the North, the New Operation Plan No. 5027,  and issued a special alert on the puppet Army. In this  connection, the puppet Armed Forces are fully prepared to kindle  a war at any time.    Currently, a very grave situation is being created on the  Korean peninsula in which the flames of war may flare up even  over a trivial and accidental element. This kind of situation  was born wholly because the United States and the South Korean  puppets have already entered a stage of actual military action  to provoke a new war.    It is brazen-faced for the U.S. military to depict such  reckless antirepublic military action as if it were for its  self-defense while talking about a diplomatic resolution through  patience.    It is a well known fact that historically, before attacking  another country, the United States has used the method of  advocating a diplomatic resolution and then justifying a  military action. In the past, when committing armed invasion  toward countries such as Grenada and Panama, the U.S. ruling  class hung the seemingly signboard of protecting the U.S.  citizens, the antidrug struggle, and so on.    The active and tolerant diplomatic resolution which they are  professing toward us constitutes war diplomacy to yield and gain  supremacy over us through armed invasion. Also, their so-called  defense is nothing but a smokescreen to hide their bellicose  nature and aggressiveness.    What is absurd is that some members of the U.S. ruling class  are spreading falsehoods by saying things as if we were taking  some kind of military action first, and are attempting to  justify their military adventurous maneuver. This is a  defilement of our peace- loving position and a nasty act which  is to damage the self- defensive character our revolutionary  armed force possesses.    The international social circle officially recognizes our  peace- loving position and policy. Our revolutionary armed  force is through and through a self-defensive armed force in  which its fundamental mission is to defend our republic's  sovereign right and security.    It is preposterous for some members of the U.S. ruling class  to publicize about our so-called military attack, and is the  same as the proverb, "Like a thief calling another a thief."  During the Persian Gulf war, the United States put on a bold  front of the single superpower, openly moved and deployed the  aggressive forces in this region, and committed an overall war  on Iraq. However, in our country, the United States laid a  smokescreen of so-called self-defense, is concentratedly  deploying armed forces in South Korea and its region, and is  also trying to carry out a military attack opposing our republic.    However, they have miscalculated. No forcible measures can  work for us at all. Our people and the People's Army are  sharply observing the unusual war attempt by the United States.  If the United States and its cat's paw kindle the fire of war  to the end, we will answer through a resolute counterattack by  defending our country's socialist system and the Republic's  dignity.    The truth of history is that justice is victorious and  injustice is defeated. The United States must not carry out  rash and thoughtless acts, and it will be good for it to not  forget the bitter lesson of the past Korean war.</p>

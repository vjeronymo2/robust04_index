			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ji Yonghua [0679 3057 5478], Xu Ke [1776 4430], </F> Shanghai Institute of Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences;  Hiroyuki Hatori, Susumu Terakawa, Okazaki National Institute of  Physiology, Okazaki, Japan]    [Summary] A best spectrum with high recovery rate of  scorpion neurotoxin components has been obtained by using the  reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC)  to separate crude toxin of East Asia scorpion (Buthus martensi  Karsch). The RP-HPLC was able to effectively and clearly  separate into two zones the anti-mammal neurotoxin (including  anti-insect neurotoxin that attacks both mammals and insects)  and the anti-insect neurotoxin which attacks only insects. The  method was also used to purify five anti-insect neurotoxins  which were then designated as BmK IT1, BmK IT2, BmK IT3, BmK  IT4, and BmK IT5. The BmK IT1 was identified as a contracture  anti-insect toxin and the BmK IT2 through IT5 were all flaccid  paralysis anti-insect toxin newly identified by the following  methods including toxin detection, amino acid component  analysis, and N-terminal three-peptide sequence analysis.  Results obtained from this experiment showed that the four  flaccid paralysis anti-insect toxins were all alkaline and were  all single chain polypeptides composed of 61 amino acid residues  with isoelectric points between 8.3 and 8.5. Researchers found  that positive electrical charge on the surface of amino acid  residues of BmK IT2 molecule played an important role on  biological activity of BmK IT2 toxin, because BmK IT2 molecule  lost its toxicity when being treated with fluorescent labelling  substance.</p>

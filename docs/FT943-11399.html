			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / A long and winding road: Should BT go down the superhighway? Andrew Adonis looks at the telecommunications company's strategy The 'superhighways' of the future have nothing to do with eight-lane motorways. They are sophisticated telecommunications networks connecting living rooms and offices that will buzz with inter-active computer terminals. If some modern prophets are to be believed, home shopping, games, movies, lessons, remote diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, information on virtually anything could be available at the flick of a button, via fibre-optic telecoms lines - providing a 'communicopia' of new services, transforming work and leisure patterns. Some believe the living room will ultimately double as the office for many, perhaps most, people, as 'teleworking' spreads and commuting becomes a minority activity. For British Telecommunications, entering its second decade after privatisation, assessing and successfully exploiting the growth of superhighway services is a critical challenge. The task is still greater because, at the same time, BT is fighting to protect its position in the existing UK telephony market and attempting to turn itself into a global company. Phone boxes now work, call charges are falling, and service quality is far higher than at the time of privatisation. But the UK's largest company yearns to be the main UK provider of inter-active services in the next millennium. 'We will become retailers of anything you can convert into digital form,' says Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman. Earning Pounds 60m of profit each week, BT has the resources necessary to build a superhighway, and it is a match for any other telecoms company in its access to technological know-how. Yet for management and employees alike, BT's vision goes hand-in-hand with deep frustrations. Besides mass redundancies, the company faces tougher competition at home, a UK regulatory regime that it claims makes superhighway investments uneconomic, and deep uncertainties about the strength of demand for new inter-active services. This week BT received a fillip when the House of Commons trade and industry committee declared a 'information superhighway' a national priority and called for a gradual lifting of the ban on BT providing broadcast entertainment services to homes. The government has yet to endorse that recommendation. But BT is planning on the assumption that it will be able to offer a full range of inter-active services by the late 1990s. It is currently undertaking technical trials at Ipswich, to be followed next year by commercial trials of home shopping, video-on-demand and other inter-active services with 2,500 customers in Colchester. Dr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development, says the first services could 'follow on from those trials'. Yet even if regulatory hurdles are lifted, the demand for such services is questionable. Teleworking has obvious attractions, but it is debatable whether most businesses or individuals will think it desirable, let alone feasible. In the shorter term, it has yet to be shown that services targeted at residential consumers across inter-active networks - such as home shopping, teaching packages, video-on-demand and games - can be competitive. Existing providers, such as video stores, and high-tech alternatives to the network services, such as CD-Rom discs (advanced multi-media versions of compact discs which run on personal computers), may be cheaper for consumers than superhighways. BT is finding it hard enough to persuade people to use normal home telephones, which are currently engaged for an average of barely four minutes a day. Persuading customers to use a telecoms terminal for expensive multi-media wizardry is a speculative venture. Furthermore, if telecoms operators can carve out a distinct niche for inter-active home services, then the main gainers may not be BT but the cable operators which have had a head start in building inter-active local networks and already claim 750,000 TV subscribers. Should the cable operators, mostly backed by large US groups, corner the market for domestic inter-active services before BT has constructed its 'superhighway', there may be no room for a BT fibre-optic local network offering the same services. All of which makes the battle between BT and its 130 telecoms competitors in the UK - most of them licensed in the past three years - more than a straight fight over the existing telephony market. BT still has an 85 per cent market share but, says Sir Iain, 'this is a war of attrition, and our strategy has to be to fight every inch of the way'. To combat domestic competition, Sir Iain's strategy is to turn BT into a marketing-led company with a reputation for quality. Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, tells the company's managers he wants BT to be the Marks and Spencer of the UK telecoms industry. It is more than a quip. A confidential report to the BT board last spring, based on a survey of opinion formers, ranked BT's corporate image 7th out of 7 selected blue-chip UK companies. The top-rated company, with favourable ratings from 91 per cent of respondents (against 43 per cent for BT) was Marks and Spencer. Tellingly, the most recent non-executive director to be appointed to the BT board is Mr Keith Oates, deputy chairman of M&amp;S. Mr Hepher's mission, strongly backed by Sir Iain, is to carry through a cultural revolution, eliminating all trace of BT's old utility and monopoly ethos. To lead the revolution Mr Hepher, an outsider recruited by Sir Iain three years ago from Abbey Life, the insurance group, has been steadily filling the top executive posts with fellow outsiders. 'We are continually winnowing out the old-style managers,' says Sir Iain, emphasising that customer-responsiveness and an appreciation of the need for change are the qualities he most values in his managers. BT's management board, which Mr Hepher chairs, has been renamed the 'group quality council.' Of its nine members, only two are career BT executives: the other seven are recent recruits from companies as diverse as IBM, Black &amp; Decker, and US West, the US regional phone company. Another former IBM executive, Mr Howard Ford, has just been appointed to head Cellnet, BT's cellular network joint venture with Securicor. In the business sector, where Mercury, BT's main rival in the UK, is well-established, Mr Hepher has been masterminding a 'win back' campaign, emphasising the quality of BT service. In the domestic sector, a recent marketing blitz has concentrated on getting people to realise how cheap it is to use the phone. BT staff in all sectors are being familiarised in basic marketing techniques. The strategy appears to be bearing fruit. In the past year BT has increased its inland traffic by 7 per cent and its international traffic by 5 per cent  -more than compensating for the loss of business to Mercury, cable operators, and other competitors. According to Robert Fleming, the brokers, BT is adding phone connections at the rate of 100,000 a month, including cellular and land-based lines, which is four times its rate of loss to cable operators. Daiwa Research estimates that BT will still have 90 per cent of local phone connections in 2000, and that its share of revenue will have fallen only to about 80 per cent of the total. As well as securing its future UK base, BT has set out to build a significant international business. Abroad, as at home, its ambition is to dominate. 'We would expect to be number one in the globalisation of telecommunications,' says Sir Iain. 'A lot of it has to do with surprising the enemy, then dislocating the enemy, then advancing into his territory.' In June last year BT forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second largest US operator. BT's strategy is to make Concert, its joint venture with MCI, the main provider of international telecoms services to multinationals, as corporate life becomes a true 'global village' which can be serviced by single telecoms operators. The deal is an integral part of BT's superhighways vision, piggy-backing advanced business services onto networks operated mainly by other companies. It faces tough competition abroad from AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, and from the French and German state operators, which earlier this summer forged a Dollars 4bn alliance with Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance operator. But most observers put BT at least six months ahead of its international rivals in terms of concrete services. Sir Iain says BT has a a 'nuclear deterrent' - the possibility of using its alliance with MCI to break the existing cartel of national telecoms operators which keeps international phone calls artificially expensive. To do so would be a huge gamble for BT, which gains from the existing arrangements. But the dividends for the first operator to bust the cartel could be equally large. BT's global ambitions, however, may be held back by trouble on the home front. It faces deep discontent among its workforce amid large scale redundancies and continual management change. In the past four years BT has shed a third of its workforce - 90,000 employees, more than the total manpower of the Royal Air Force and Royal Marines combined. An employees' meeting earlier this week brought the discontent into the open - particularly among managers, who are bearing the brunt of this year's redundancies. One graduate trainee said that she had joined the company with 28 others, but the best ten had now left. 'There is a time of a maximum uncertainty, when people know the numbers but not what it is going to mean for them,' says Sir Iain. But it is not past. Further massive redundancies are in the offing, and Sir Iain will give no guarantee that compulsory redundancies will be avoided. Yet nobody believes that the clock can be turned back. Privatisation, competition and the convergence of media are facts of life, and BT's managers realise they have no choice but to ensure the company is able to take advantage of those changes - and exploit the arrival of the new superhighways. In a recent book* examining BT's post-1984 experience, Mr Kenneth Baker, the minister responsible for privatisation, recalls: 'when I went to other European countries explaining liberalisation and privatisation, I was treated as a sort of lunatic . . . who was breaking up a natural monopoly'. Ten years on, the lunatics are triumphing the world over. *Joyce Wood, UK Telecoms: Springboard for the Future, FT Publications, 1 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL, Pounds 48.  -----------------------------------------------------------                                            1983/84   1993/94  ----------------------------------------------------------- Turnover (Pounds)                            6.9bn    13.7bn Pre-tax profit (Pounds)                       990m    2.76bn Fibre in network               Less than 500,000km   2.6m km Employees                                  241,000   156,000 Payphones                                   76,000   122,000 Residential lines                           16.06m    20.47m Business lines                               3.77m     6.17m Proportion of revenue  generated in UK (per cent)                    100        98 Chairman's salary (Pounds)                  84,198   663,000  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: BT  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> Interview with Anatoliy Holubchenko, minister of industry of </F> Ukraine, by Lyudmila Nikolaychuk; place and date not given:  "Antidumping: The Suit Has Started, but Ukraine May Attempt To  Influence It"]    [Text] The antidumping suits, which have recently  been threatening Ukraine, augur many problems for our industry  which, clearly, is already facing more than enough of them. Just  what threat do the antidumping suits pose for the Ukrainian  economy as a whole? Quite obviously those in the Ministry of  Industry, with jurisdiction over most of the enterprises with an  export potential, had to work out some projections dealing with  these issues. What were those projections? Anatoliy Holubchenko,  Ukrainian minister of industry, talks with a UNIAN correspondent  about them.    [Nikolaychuk] Mr. Anatoliy, Ukraine's difficulties, as  commonly known, started with the initiation of an antidumping  suit by the International Arbitration Court against the  metallurgical flagship Azovstal. How complicated is that  situation?    [Holubchenko] The problem of dumping is increasingly acute  for Ukraine. We have done too much "trading" in the years of  unlimited freedom. The reason being the lack of a price  regulation mechanism as well as three years of uncontrolled  trade by our enterprises. Particularly in types of products that  are in short supply, which are eagerly purchased, and also in  raw materials.    Canada and the United States initiated antidumping  litigation  involving products that are supplied from Ukraine. Even though  the products were not supplied directly by Azovstal or even by  Ukraine, but by the Kleker firm, which simply acquired sheet  steel from Azovstal and resold it in Canada and the United  States. We are, however, a civilized country with a state  economic sector.    Therefore complaints concerning those products, which come  from Ukraine, are expressed directly to the government.    A special task force has now been formed, headed by my  deputy  Valeriy Mazur, which is working on the antidumping problem.    [Nikolaychuk] Beside the Azovstal suit, what other  antidumping litigation was initiated against Ukraine?    [Holubchenko] The EC filed an antidumping suit against our  government pertaining to ferro-alloys, certain types of mineral  fertilizers, and cast iron. Today, for instance, Ukraine is  selling cast iron at $95-$115 per tonne. Europe is maintaining a  price of $140-$150. Naturally it cannot allow our cheap cast  iron on its market since that would ruin its producers.  Therefore, in protecting its producers, the EC initiated a suit  against us. That, naturally does not mean the production of cast  iron is that cheap in Ukraine. But because we have always  maintained low prices for energy sources, the cost of cast iron  production was artificially kept low.    [Nikolaychuk] Approximately how much and from whose treasury  will the Ukrainian enterprises have to pay in case the suits are  lost? According to certain data, for instance, Azovstal alone is  being threatened with a fine of $1.5 million.    [Holubchenko] We are working on that right now and in my  opinion, have every chance of avoiding payment of fines. Almost  daily our experts participate in negotiations with EC experts  and western firms. Naturally, we ask that consideration be given  to the fact that Ukraine is a developing country and that the  violation occurred due to our lack of experience and ignorance.    [Nikolaychuk] Please indicate whether the guilty enterprises  will become bankrupt if Ukraine has to pay in case of the loss  of antidumping lawsuits?    [Holubchenko] I do not believe so. But the point is not the  fines. If we should lose the suits such heavy taxes will be  imposed on the import of Ukrainian products that Ukrainian  enterprises will be unable to appear on the market at all. For  example, we are selling cast iron today at $105, while EC  countries sell it for $150, and in case of a loss Ukraine will  be compelled to sell cast iron in Europe at $200. No one would  buy it. In other words we will lose the market.    [Nikolaychuk] Do the enterprises have adequate funds to pay  the fine?    [Holubchenko] If they do not have them, they will have to be  earned. They must build less and pay lower wages and even  smaller pensions. In other words, it will be necessary to  economize.</p>

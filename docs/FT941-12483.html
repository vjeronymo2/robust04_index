			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: A bodyguard against sharks The world of 'independent' financial advice is dominated by those who get commissions from companies which have their products recommended. But this potential conflict of interest - between serving a client's needs and earning a living - is avoided by a few fee-based advisers who charge clients for the work done on their behalf. In this article, the first of a series, Joanna Slaughter talks with one such adviser about how he conducts his business Norton Partners hardly fits the popular image of an independent financial adviser (lFA). The firm has its roots in the accountancy profession and its small staff works from a converted 16th century granary in the village of Tickenham, near Bristol. Although its nominal business is chartered accountancy, Norton Partners specialises exclusively in personal tax and personal financial management work. It is the kind of firm that is well-established in the US but comparatively rare in Britain. David Norton, the senior partner, explains: 'I tell people that we are chartered accountants who don't do any chartered accountancy. I think everyone has to specialise these days and I wanted to specialise in financial planning. 'When I got rid of all the accounting and auditing in 1989, I think everyone thought I was mad. We were left with half a practice of existing tax clients and half a practice that was just a blank piece of paper.' Norton is chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, a body that claims to set the toughest professional financial planning examinations in the country. While the institute welcomes both commission-based and fee-based IFAs as members, Norton argues: 'The real professional will tend to become fee-based over time. 'We are trying to create an entire profession where only an industry has existed in the past. The words financial planning have been hijacked in the most awful way. If you say you are a financial planner, people think you've come to flog them life assurance. But one of the key issues about financial planning is that it is a continuing service; a relationship for life. 'Our whole strategy is to look at clients as if they were a business. We try to increase their income, save tax and protect them from disaster.' Norton will not be specific about the size of funds the firm has under management - 'do you count a client's business expansion scheme holding, where another party controls the investment?' he asks, with some pertinence  -but adds: 'You are talking millions.' He describes his 250 clients as individuals of high net worth. Most are London-based and made their way to Tickenham as a result of personal recommendation. Typically, clients pay a time-based annual fee of around Pounds 3,000 for the services of Norton Partners, but the fee clock does not start ticking until after the first meeting. This usually lasts 60 to 90 minutes. 'At this meeting, we establish what their position is; what they are looking for; whether they like us; and whether we like them,' says Norton. He will not take on a client whose affairs are not sufficiently detailed to warrant the fees. Nor will he accept somebody if he feels that they and the firm will not get on. After the initial interview, clients are sent a 37-page questionnaire. This is so detailed that even the respondents' health, habits and hobbies are logged, together with their partner's mobile telephone number. The information is processed on a computer. Then a draft plan is produced and dissected at a comprehensive meeting, which Norton likes clients to attend with their partners. He points out: 'We are not really just talking about money. We are talking about how they can achieve the things they want in life. Our key role is to be with the client, acting as a bodyguard against the sharks.' There could be 20 items on the agenda and discussion covers areas such as income and spending; provision for disability cover; school fee planning; pension planning; underwriting membership of Lloyd's; investment, life assurance and estate planning; and risk management. Norton describes most clients as 'sophisticated' but they can be as prone to fall into financial bear-traps as anyone. He once had consecutive meetings with six solicitors and none had made a will. Norton Partners' approach to financial planning is deliberately holistic, and it is usual for clients to be seen three times a year. Obviously, not all clients need all the services the firm offers; investment management is a stand-alone requirement for a number of them. Norton describes the firm's investment style as 'pretty risk-averse.' All clients have some money in cash, some in lower-risk assets such as gilts or international bonds or zero preference shares, some in index-linked securities and some in equities. Portfolios change as little as possible. 'Our basic position is that every time you change things, it costs money,' says Norton. 'I always make it clear that we are looking at a five-year term.' One portfolio, taken at random, had Pounds 14,000 in cash in a building society; Pounds 6,000 in a Tessa; Pounds 15,000 in overseas bond unit trusts; Pounds 15,000 in index-linked gilts; Pounds 18,000 in overseas equity unit trusts and Pounds 12,000 in Peps. The fee for the firm's initial investment advice will be around 1 per cent of the value of the portfolio and the typical annual management fee is 0.9 per cent. The firm always rebates any commission in full to clients. Like every investment manager, Norton has had his successes and his disappointments. He believes his clients were put into emerging markets at just the right time but is less happy about the behaviour of the Skandia Swift fund. This is basically a cash vehicle, investing in Japanese derivatives, but has not performed. The sour legacy of investment scandals means that no prospective client of an lFA can afford to flinch from blunt questions about competence and security. Norton, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says he welcomes interrogation. He gestures to walls which bristle with certificates and says: 'Among our five professional staff we have 12 professional qualifications and my colleague, Lin Ashurst, is one of the most highly qualified female financial planners in the City. We don't handle client money at all and everything is registered in the client's name.'

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Foster's shares at lowest for year SHARES in Foster's Brewing, the Melbourne-based international brewing group, fell a further 5 cents yesterday to a low for the year of ADollars 1.33 (USDollars 0.98), writes Bruce Jacques. The fall is in reaction to this week's announcement of large write-downs leading to net losses of ADollars 950.8m and a two-for-five share issue at ADollars 1.10 a share, to raise about ADollars 1bn. BHP's interest in Foster's is now up to almost 37 per cent.</p>

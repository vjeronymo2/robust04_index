			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 3 ARTISTS TRANSFERRING MOVEMENT ONTO SCREEN  </P> <P> Three artists who explore film or video dance show their recent work on a  stimulating episode of the "New Television" series tonight at 11:30 on KCET  Channel 28.  </P> <P> Jeff McMahon and Charles Moulton each create movement collages that remain  wholly subservient to photography and editing techniques. Bridget Murnane faces  a thornier task: transferring to the screen solos by Susan Rose and Louise  Burns that possess a genuine choreographic shape.  </P> <P> In Murnane's "To Dancers," the camera selectively captures the essentials of  Rose's dramatic, seated solo through bold close-ups made more striking by an  intense red-and-black color scheme. Cries and drumming by Megan Roberts  intensify the imagery. The Burns segment starts in the studio and then follows  the dancer into outdoor environments that expand the spatial thrust of the  choreography beyond theatrical limits.  </P> <P> "To Dancers" actually represents the second half of Murnane's "For Dancers"  (two and "To" make "For"). The deleted sections are, if anything, more unusual,  since they attempt to reconceive classic techniques of shooting dance (long  takes, full-body compositions) developed in Hollywood musicals.  </P> <P> Moulton is celebrated in the American avant-garde for his inventive sequencing  ploys, and these, indeed, dominate his off-the-wall extravaganza, "Hazardous  Hootenanny." However, here they involve the juggling of split- and  multiple-screen panels, some of them cleverly faked. (Watch what happens when  performers reach out of frame.) The sax-and-vocal score by Steve Elson is every  bit as delirious as the visuals.  </P> <P> Dancing? No. This is gesture processed into camera choreography, something that  McMahon also uses -- combined with animated stills and plenty of real dance  footage -- in "Cross Body Ride" to music by Charles Nieland.  </P> <P> Shot in Venezuela, it shows David Zambrano and Donald Fleming on a staircase,  on a beach, on a catwalk, in a bed -- sometimes emphasizing physical intimacy,  elsewhere the space separating the men.  </P> <P> Unabashedly homoerotic, this paean to the male form in motion suffers from  McMahon's generalized swoop-and-lift choreography (derived from contact  improvisation) but is very deft in its editing juxtapositions.LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

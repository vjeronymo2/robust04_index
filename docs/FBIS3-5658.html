			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Get Out or Be Left Out"] </F>   [Excerpt] On recent visits to India and China, and again in  Vietnam last week, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has been  consistent about one theme: Singaporean businessmen must get  out there -- quick. Vietnam, he reckoned, could become a tiger  cub in 10 to 15 years although, at its current stage of growth,  he put it at 30 to 40 years behind Singapore. In that growth  curve Vietnam has to traverse, there will be opportunities  aplenty for builders, manufacturers, consultants and lawyers,  suppliers of consumer goods and services. What is being asked  of our businessmen in going to Vietnam is that they be  trail-blazers. After a long period of French occupation which  left little that was serviceable, and another 20 years fighting  the Americans, Vietnam is in a rage to build a polity from  ground up. It takes nerve and acumen for a Singaporean  businessman to survey the ruins and say: "I smell money here."  Are our risk takers up to it? By comparison, India is the  easier to penetrate although its immediate profit potential may  look less appealing. Its legal framework, financial system,  property and repatriation rights are fairly well encoded.  China, having a lead time of a dozen years over India in  economic liberalisation, has advanced to the stage where  maintaining a stable currency and keeping growth from  over-heating now form the basis for orderly development.    Vietnam is different, but this is no reason for Singaporean  businessmen to hesitate. If its bureaucrats trained in the  communist tradition have little understanding of the forces that  shape a market economy, they are prepared to adapt. As a sign  of resolve, common folk and civil servants are studying English  with a vengeance to gain access to the commercial highway. If  its legal framework is wobbly and the banking system basic, it  should spell opportunity, not a hindrance, for brain-service  suppliers such as Singapore. Mr. Goh has in fact signposted the  areas -- apart from property investments where Singaporean money  is prominent -- in which the private and state sectors should  pay close attention to. These include banking,  telecommunications and land transport. Then there is  infrastructural work -- port development, public housing,  industrial estates -- where, it should be conceded,  participation may be better handled by government-linked  companies. No less a Vietnamese personage than Mr. Do Muoi, the  party chief, has asked Singapore to help his country  industrialise. Such invitations do not come often.  Singaporeans have committed US$390 million in 52 projects in  Vietnam since the investment ban was lifted in November 1991.  But so have 500 companies world-wide signed on for US$7.5  billion worth of investments during that period, and a flood can  now be expected as the last of the Americans' trade restrictions  on Vietnam have been lifted.    It was left to Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong,  who was in Mr. Goh's party, to give the reluctant the most  telling prod. In persuading companies to expand in the region or  be left behind, he spoke of competition growing more intense a  few years from now and how opportunities would be harder to  find. The Government will smooth the path with appropriate  incentives and concessions. The need for an external economy  has been accepted by investors and workers alike. [passage  omitted]</p>

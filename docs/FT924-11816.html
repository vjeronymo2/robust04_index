			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bell Resources dispute raises fears over puts A DISPUTE between Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the Australian investment company which owns the former Bell Resources, and holders of Bell Resources convertible bonds could have serious implications for other holders of bonds with put options. ACIL faces repayments of ADollars 19.2m (USDollars 13.8m) to investors following a decision in the UK Court of Appeal two months ago in favour of investors' right to put, but plans to take the case to the House of Lords. The original dispute arose when bondholders tried to exercise a put option providing for early repayment of principal at 117.7 per cent of par value on November 13 1991. Instead, bonds were redeemed at 103 per cent of their par value, when the company exercised its call option. However, it gave receipts to bondholders when the call was exercised. Ahead of the Lords' appeal, the company has caused further controversy by printing a notice in the Financial Times, offering to buy back the receipts at 10 cents per dollar. If the Court of Appeal's decision is upheld, investors stand to gain 14.7 cents a dollar. However, brokers and potential investors complain they are unable to buy receipts, because they are not regarded as tradeable securities, even though they are offering a higher price than ACIL. One broker said he was willing to pay 11 cents in the dollar, but had no way of making that offer directly to receipt-holders.</p>

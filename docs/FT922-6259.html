			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: Town halls fall to the commercial revolution - Contracts awarded to date total Pounds 1.9bn a year / From refuse collection to leisure management the provision of services is big business MR NICHOLAS RIDLEY'S vision of local authorities meeting once a year to hand out contracts may not be shared by the post-Thatcher regime. But the phrase 'enabling councils' is on all politicians' lips - and compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) is seen by the government as one way of creating them. The survey below summarises a comprehensive study of the effect of tendering on local authorities across Great Britain, published today by the Institute of Public Finance, a research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. It will be followed by regular FT updates, based on CCT bulletins to be published by the institute, on the position sector by sector. Tendering is worth big money. Contracts awarded to date total Pounds 1.9bn a year, with the typical refuse collection contract alone worth Pounds 1.2m a year. The private sector is advancing steadily. Its share of the local authority market is now appreciable: of the seven main sectors currently subject to tendering - refuse collection, street cleaning, building cleaning, vehicle maintenance, grounds maintenance, sports and leisure management and catering  -in all but one (catering) private operators have won more than 18 per cent of contracts put out to tender. Most councils now have a private contractor providing at least one of their main services. Like privatisation, compulsory competitive tendering is a Tory policy which came late, started slowly amid political controversy, but is coming to be taken for granted by unions and opposition parties alike. Labour fought the general election committed to end tendering - 'but by the next election it will be a way of life', said one of the party's prominent council leaders. The result? A revolution in local authority culture - not least in the 41 per cent of councils in which the in-house labour force has so far won all the main contracts. For the first time in most authorities, the 'client' and 'contractor' functions have been separated - divorcing the setting of standards and monitoring of performance from the management of service delivery. One leader of a large authority confessed that before compulsory competitive tendering he did not even know how many staff the council employed. Research by Mr Simon Domberger, an associate of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, indicates that cost savings of about 20 per cent have been made by putting refuse collection out to tender. The precise figure is disputed, but none deny that real reductions have been achieved. Mr Tom McGuirk, manager of the IPF's competitive tendering information service, said: 'The definition of service standards as set out in contract specifications largely did not exist prior to the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering.' With citizens' charters as profuse locally as nationally, standards look set to be the refrain of the 1990s.

It is reported that members of the committee held that,  according to the stipulations of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the PRC will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1  July 1997 and the British Government will return Hong Kong to  the PRC on the same day. This means that British rule over Hong  Kong will end on 30 June 1997. Prior to this, the British  Government is using two constitutional documents, "Letters  Patent" and "Royal Instructions," as legal grounds for its rule  over Hong Kong. It rules Hong Kong specifically through a  political structure composed of the Legislative Council, two  municipal councils, and district boards. The British Hong Kong  political structure is an overall reflection of the British rule  over Hong Kong. With the termination of British rule over Hong  Kong, the two constitutional documents that hold its power  together will definitely be abolished, that is, the legal  grounds will disappear. This signifies that the original  British Hong Kong political structure that rules Hong Kong will  of course terminate concurrently. British rule over Hong Kong  can neither be extended beyond 30 June 1997, nor can it be  allowed to make any decisions to let the existing political  structure do so. Otherwise, it will be considered to have  overstepped its power, and the principle of sovereignty  stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic  Law will be meaningless. If such were the case, it would be the  same as extending British rule beyond 1 July 1997, which is  absolutely impossible.    According to the abovementioned principle, council members  of  the last term of the three-tier political structure under the  British Hong Kong Government can only serve until 30 June 1997.  However, current relevant laws of the British Hong Kong  Government specify that all the terms for council members under  the three-tier political structure are four years. Members of  the committee felt that this clearly contravenes the  abovementioned principle, and therefore is definitely invalid.  The day when China resumes its sovereignty over Hong Kong, 1  July 1997, is also the time of the termination of the existing  British Hong Kong political structure. This is also a justified  and inevitable outcome when Britain returns Hong Kong to the PRC  and the Chinese Government resumes its sovereignty over Hong  Kong. This is the duty the British Government should fulfill  and a right the Chinese Government should exercise, as  stipulated in the Joint Declaration.    Members of the committee pointed out that the first  legislative body and district organizations of the Hong Kong SAR  established after 1 July 1997 will be completely different in  nature from the political structure of the British Hong Kong  Government prior to 1 July 1997. It will not be a "complete  copy" of the original British Hong Kong political structure, but  one that will be established in accordance with the Hong Kong  SAR Basic Law and relevant decisions of the National People's  Congress [NPC]. It will be a political structure that embodies  the Chinese Government's resumption of sovereignty over Hong  Kong, and shows that Hong Kong is run by its residents and  enjoys a high degree of autonomy.    The status, power, and organization of the legislative body  of the Hong Kong SAR will differ greatly from the Legco, which  acts as a British Hong Kong consultative organization. The  Basic Law and relevant decisions of the NPC on procedures for  establishing the first government and legislative body of the  Hong Kong SAR have specified conditions and confirmation  procedures for council members to ride on the "through train."  The Chinese Government had hoped that China and Britain would  make arrangements for a smooth transition for members of the  last term of the British Hong Kong Legco through consultations.  However, as China and Britain could not reach an agreement on  Hong Kong's 1994/1995 election arrangements in their talks,  conditions for the transition of council members no longer  exist. Members of the committee pointed out that the two  legislative institutions, different in nature, cannot be lumped  together, even if there had been an agreement between China and  Britain on arrangements for transition. Nor is it because of  the absence of an agreement that the current issue of the  different nature of the two legislative institutions has  emerged. As mentioned earlier, it is the different legal grounds  that decide the different nature of the two legislative  institutions.    Members of the committee also pointed out that as component  parts of the British Hong Kong Government political structure,  the district boards and two municipal councils of Hong Kong are  closely connected to the administrative power of the British  Hong Kong Government. Therefore, as with Legco, the last term  of the district boards and two municipal councils of the British  Hong Kong Government will inevitably be terminated on 30 June  1997. If the regional organizations are not of an  administrative nature, they certainly may transit to the Hong  Kong SAR and all they need is an agreement between China and  Britain. However, for reasons known to all, China is unable to  realize this wish.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: TV Choice Television has never quite mastered New Year's Eve. Having abandoned that ghastly Scotch trifle that they used to serve up, they have found nothing obviously suitable to take its place, though Clive James does his best. Tonight those without an invitation to the sought-after Krichevski New Year's Eve party will no doubt end up watching Clive James On 1992 (10.20 BBC1). Jokes are promised about Ross Perot, Madonna, Norman Lamont, and Antonia de Sancha. Well, you could always try reviving the hand-bell tradition .. Earlier ITV shows Murder At The Farm (7.00), a programme about the Carl Bridgewater case, written and presented by Paul Foot. Bridgewater was the paper boy murdered in 1978; Foot (like Ludovic Kennedy) has spent large parts of his life investigating what seem to him to be miscarriages of justice. BBC2 tells the story of Kurt Weill in the US in I'm A Stranger Here Myself (8.00). Weill went to the US in 1935 and had to adapt his style, somewhat anyway, to the demands of Broadway. Best offer of the night is Monty Python And The Holy Grail (BBC2, 10.00) with Cleese, Palin, Idle etc. Kurt Weill enthusiasts will be pleased on New Year's day to find BBC2 devoting two and a half hours to Street Scene (6.00), the ENO production of his 1946 'American opera' with Janice Cairns and Lesley Garrett as Anna and Rose Maurant. The rest of us, who find some of Weill's early German material just about tolerable and his American work tedious, can leave the set switched off until 8.30 when C4's arts and culture series, Without Walls, promises to lay bare the truth about Sid James, sidekick to Tony Hancock and one of the chief stalwarts of the 'Carry On' series. A Cry In The Dark is a feature film about the 'dingo baby case': the extraordinary business which rocked Australia in 1980 when a mother claimed her child had been taken by a wild dog. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep play the parents who were tried for murder. BBC1 begins another batch of the successful drama series Love Hurts (9.00) in which Adam Faith plays the successful plumber turned businessman and Zoe Wanamaker is the high powered charity executive who tries to withstand his attention. Funniest programme of the night promises to be 60 minutes of Rory Bremner (10.00 C4).</p>

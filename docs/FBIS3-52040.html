			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy for Piaui Jose Luis Maia yesterday resigned  his post as leader of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] in the  Chamber of Deputies. He stopped discharging his duties at the  beginning of the work by the budget CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee]. "I am tired, I have lived through a  period of embitterment during the work by the CPI, and I must  now rebuild my image before my supporters," he said in  justifying his resignation. He added, however, that in addition  to working with his grassroots he will use his time to prepare  his defense for the investigation that the Chamber's supervisor  [corregedoria] will conduct in light of the conclusions of the  CPI report.    Despite the fact that the CPI did not punish him with the  cancellation of his mandate, the faction of the PPR bloc that is  promoting a renewal has questioned his leadership. His  resignation will facilitate the process. The PPR leadership is  being exercised by Deputy for Porto Alegre Gerson Peres, the  first deputy leader. He will summon a bloc meeting to debate the  election of the new leader next week. The candidates are:  Gerson Peres, Marcelino Romano (Sao Paulo), and Jose Lourenco  (Bahia).</p>

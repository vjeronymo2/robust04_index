			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: SAFE TURKEY STUFFING  </P> <P> Question: The last time the family gathered together for dinner was a very  memorable occasion -- we all got sick. We had turkey, and then our doctor had a  lot of patients.  </P> <P> He said we had food poisoning, and that the stuffing was probably responsible.  Is there any way to avoid this without eliminating the stuffing?  </P> <P> Answer: Harmful food bacteria can grow in stuffing. This may be avoided by  getting the stuffing to a high temperature quickly, and one way to accomplish  this is to prepare the stuffing separately.  </P> <P> However, if you would rather stuff the turkey, do so just before you cook it.  Stuff the turkey loosely, and remove the stuffing right after the turkey is  done.  </P> <P>  Neil Solomon is the author of "Sick &amp; Tired of Being Sick &amp; Tired,"  Wynwood Press. If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box  36184, Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will  answer as many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

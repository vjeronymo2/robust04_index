			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Volkswagen to boost parts purchases THE VOLKSWAGEN group of Germany, Europe's biggest carmaker, aims to double the value of its component purchases in the UK to about DM1bn (Pounds 400m) a year by the end of this year. The total is expected to continue to rise rapidly to more than DM2.5bn by the mid-1990s from DM500m last year. The move is part of the group's effort to cut its purchasing costs in order to reduce its heavy losses. The group suffered a loss of DM563m in the last quarter of last year and a loss of DM1.25bn in the first quarter this year. The group established a UK purchasing office in Milton Keynes earlier this year as one of seven regional offices around the world responsible for implementing the group's new global purchasing strategy. Last year the UK accounted for less than 1 per cent of the group's purchasing volume of DM53.8bn, but Mr Frans Boot, head of the UK purchasing office, said yesterday this could increase to more than 5 per cent by the mid-1990s. The UK operation is seeking to increase purchases for all the group's four divisions, Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, which are being linked into one global purchasing system by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the recently appointed group director for purchasing and production. Mr Lopez, who moved from General Motors in March, was previously responsible for greatly increasing the volume of GM component purchases in the UK. VW has previously lagged rivals among the world's volume carmakers in seeking lower-cost components outside its main German supply base, and the UK is seen as one of its most promising sources for lower-cost purchases. The group said that UK component makers had become much more competitive as a result of the arrival in Britain of the Japanese carmakers, which had greatly improved levels of quality, service and cost. The drive to increase purchases in the UK had been intensified by the devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark, it said. Mr Boot said that there had been 'a quantum leap' in the competitiveness of the UK automotive components supply base since the late 1980s. 'It is not just low labour costs and currency but also in product development capability, quality and just-in-time delivery with the Japanese transplants working on the supply base.' Mr Boot said some quotations from UK suppliers were coming in at only 60 per cent of VW's present costs.</p>

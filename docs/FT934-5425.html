			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television If you are fascinated by the trials and tribulations of being a rich pop star, tonight's the night. Remember 'The Singing Nun'? In 1963 Jeanine Deckers recorded that intensely irritating number which began 'Domi-nique, nique, nique' and in 1966 she left her convent and became a 'celebrity'. Without Walls (C4, 9.00) tells how she set up house with another woman and, in 1985, agreed a suicide pact which resulted in the death of both. The second half of the programme considers those photographic posters for Benetton which are so successful at creating attention. In 1986 the androgynous pop star Boy George was a heroin addict, but he beat the addiction and today, we are told, 'He is back on top'. Filmed against a background of a trip to America, Omnibus (BBC1, 10.30)reveals a funny, complex, sensitive survivor. Assignment (BBC2, 7.45) considers the problems facing the ANC in South Africa and the chances of the movement managing to form a successful 'government of national unity'. John Harrison interviews Nelson Mandela.</p>

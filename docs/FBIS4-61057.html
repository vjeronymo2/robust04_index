			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Andreyev: "Foreign Ministry Intends To More </F> Actively Protect Rights of Russians Abroad"]    [Text] Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation deputy foreign  minister, has called on Russian diplomats to move resolutely  toward Russian consular institutions in the CIS and Baltic  countries. Summing up the results of a two-day conference of  Russian consuls in the near abroad, the deputy minister even  promised to cancel "far abroad" trips for Foreign Ministry  staffers if they failed to work properly at consular level in  the former Soviet republics.    Cases of illegality in respect of the Russian-speaking  population in many countries of the near abroad are common  knowledge, and the consular apparatus in some of them is still  modest. In Latvia alone, Russian diplomats issued 23,000 visas  last year. Consular officials in Estonia processed 18,000  permits to visit Russia. And, although in some places this  embassy activity brings in considerable revenue -- the visas  issued by the diplomatic mission in Riga cost a total of  $380,000 -- numerous restrictions prevent even part of the  proceeds from being used for the apparatus' needs.    As of 28 April Lithuania has followed the other two Baltic  states in introducing visas for Russians. Rules are rules, but  even the strictest regulations should not exclude a humane  approach in relations between countries in individual, dramatic  circumstances. The deputy minister said that the episode of the  burial of a Russian inhabitant of Estonia, which relatives from  Russia were not allowed to attend, was a situation that demeaned  great Russia and Russians wherever they may live. These people  did not have foreign passports and, however quickly preparations  were made abroad, the Estonian authorities refused to stamp a  visa on their internal documents. As a result, the relatives  bade farewell to the deceased at the border bridge in Narva, and  the coffin was sent back for burial on Estonian soil.    Condemning the position of the authorities in a number of  CIS  countries vis-a-vis the Russian-speaking population, Boris  Pastukhov called on consular workers to be tougher, more  vigorous, and "fiercer" [zleye] in defending the rights of  ethnic Russians in the near abroad.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rescue culture needs law changes Sir, I am delighted that the vexed question of UK law in respect of insolvencies is beginning to get the airing it deserves, in view of the many unnecessary receiverships which have robbed shareholders and creditors and weakened the UK's industrial base. Robert Rice's article 'Towards a rescue culture' (October 5) is an enlightening contribution to the debate. Whether or not the 1986 Insolvency Act is working depends on your definition of 'working'. As the article points out, the intent is not being fulfilled. This is particularly the case in rescues or recoveries, where the management is trying to turn round the company, but continues to be excluded along with the owners/shareholders by banks in pursuit of a quick run for their money. This malpractice almost inevitably takes place at the time when the foundations of a turnaround have been laid. Such was the case in the recent demise of a quoted clothing group of which I was chairman (Dunkeld Group plc). I know we are not alone. The article does not mention that the law permits a bank under the terms of its debenture to put its own short-term interests on the table and ignore recent investment by shareholders and the security of creditors. These interested parties will have been encouraged by the bank's initial support for the refinancing process, the kernel of the 'rescue culture', and possibly by its position as shareholder. It must be in the interest of all those involved in the risk ventures necessary for the country's industrial success for legislators to give shareholders and creditors an opportunity to negotiate a less lethal attack than receivership, if, in their combined judgment, it is likely to lead to the successful continuation of the recovery. The absence of that opportunity seems to be the essential difference between the American and British environments. 'Mutual obligations' might provide a suitable framework within which the necessary legislation could be developed. The article did not refer to the fact that the use of the same company as both investigating accountants and receivers has, in many cases, increased the likelihood of the receivership route and the inherent conflict of interest the practice creates. This custom needs to be outlawed in the interests of objectivity and a 'rescue culture'. I hope that the lessons learned from the current spate of avoidable receiverships will be used by the authorities to amend the regime. This would help in the creation of the so-called 'rescue culture' and should be designed to afford some protection, or at least sufficient time, for those brave enough (or foolish enough under the current rules of the game) to take on the responsibility of corporate rescue work.

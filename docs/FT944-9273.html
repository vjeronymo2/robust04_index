			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring charge hits BOC - Decline to Pounds 253m despite strong growth in gases division A sharp rise in gas prices and volumes in the final quarter helped BOC's turnover increase by 8 per cent in the year to September 30. However, an Pounds 85m restructuring charge and a Pounds 16.6m loss on disposals left pre-tax profits down at Pounds 253m, against Pounds 338m. Mr Pat Dyer, chief executive, said the economic climate was right for more gas price increases in the US. US gases plants were running at close to full capacity and some competitors had been rationing products. Group turnover advanced to Pounds 3.48bn (Pounds 3.24bn) generating operating profits of Pounds 435m (Pounds 421m). The gases division accounts for 71 per cent of sales and achieved a 9 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 332m, with a fourth quarter gain of 20 per cent to Pounds 88.2m. Increasing sales volumes had raised profit margins. Most of the price of each extra bottle of gas sold goes straight to the bottom line because capital costs changes little with output. Mr Dyer said that average prices had fallen slightly because customers were on contracts that offered discounts for higher volumes. He added, however, that the recent surge in US prices indicated that there could be price rises elsewhere in 1995. BOC's second biggest division, healthcare, continued to suffer from the expiry this year of patent protection on the anaesthetic gas Forane. Its market share in the US had fallen from 'almost 100 per cent' to less than 35 per cent and the price had fallen by more than one-third. Healthcare's turnover fell 2 per cent to Pounds 568m (Pounds 577m) and operating profits dropped 37 per cent to Pounds 54.6m (Pounds 86.2m). Mr Dyer warned that further competitors were likely to challenge Forane within months. Forane's replacement, Suprane, continued to grow and had 35 per cent of the US market. The healthcare division's performance in Europe was hurt by a product recall of Suprane vaporisers, costing Pounds 5m by the year end. The company's third division, vacuum and distribution, registered strong growth thanks to the buoyancy of one of its main customers, the semiconductor industry. Turnover grew by 20 per cent to Pounds 435m and operating profit increased 55 per cent to Pounds 51m. The exceptional charge, announced in January, left earnings per share at 23.82p (42.97p). Excluding the charge, earnings were 43.87p. BOC announced 1995 dividends of 12.4p for each half, to make a total of 24.8p - a 7 per cent increase. BOC shares rose 10p to close at 720p. See Lex</p>

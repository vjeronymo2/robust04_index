			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (1): Manufacturers prepare for take-off  -Collaboration, partnerships and joint ventures have all become the rule in the civil sector The mood two years ago at the Farnborough Air Show was one of profound gloom. The aerospace industry was in the midst of its worst post-war cyclical downturn hit by the combined and prolonged effects of the slump in civil aviation and cuts in defence spending following the end of the cold war. Senior officials of leading aerospace companies were trying to put on a brave face inside their corporate chalets at the show. 'I'll offer a case of the best champagne to the first person who walks in with a real order,' said one executive of a large European aircraft manufacturing company. Next week, as the world aerospace industry gathers again en masse at Farnborough, the atmosphere is likely to be much improved. Not that the industry is finally out of the woods, but at last it is seeing some light on the other side of the dark valley. During the past six months, there have been tangible signs of recovery in the airline industry. After four years of record losses, world airlines expect to return to profit this year as passenger and cargo traffic continues to pick up strongly. In the first half of the year, the 224 airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) saw their overall traffic grow by 9.3 per cent compared with 7.2 per cent for the whole of last year. Although this improvement has yet to translate into a new sustained wave of orders for aircraft manufacturers from more financially stable airline customers, the market has begun to stir. 'Deferrals and cancellations of orders are now slowing down,' said a senior official of the European Airbus consortium. 'Last year they were the rule: today they are becoming the exception.' Singapore Airlines, one of the most profitable carriers, sent a strong signal to the market in June when it placed one of the biggest new aircraft orders on record for 52 widebody airliners worth Dollars 10.3bn. The airline said the deal reflected its confidence in the long-term health of the aviation industry. This was in sharp contrast to what its chairman wrote in June 1993 in his annual statement when he noted that 'aviation analysts surveying the carnage in the industry are sunk in despair'. In his annual statement this year, he wrote:'Analysts may be inclined to infer that the downward slide in the industry remains intact: their melancholy may be misplaced.' This cautious revival of optimism has also followed two years of a continuing shake-up in the civil and defence sides of the business. Defence contractors have had to adapt to what appears to be a lasting reduction in government military budgets forcing them to accelerate the trend towards greater consolidation and rationalisation in the industry. The US has taken the lead with a significant wave of disposals of their defence activities by some large industrial conglomerates to other groups that have decided to increase their presence in a shrinking market. European competitors have been slower to adapt. But, in the past two years, there has been a growing trend of transnational mergers and consolidations in Europe. These include negotiations between British Aerospace and Matra of France to merge their missiles activities; the planned acquisition by a joint venture between Matra and the UK General Electric Company of BAe's space systems division; advanced negotiations between Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace to combine their missiles and space operations in joint companies, similar to the merger of their helicopter activities into Eurocopter. Collaboration, partnerships and joint ventures have all become the rule of the game in the civil sector reflecting the global nature of the aerospace market as well as the rising costs of developing new products and technologies and the increasingly long investment pay-back lead times. All aerospace manufacturers from airframe producers to aero engine makers and components suppliers now agree that co-operation is the only way forward. The regional jet and commuter turbopropeller market seems set for significant consolidation in the coming year as manufacturers desperately seek to rationalise a sector where too many products are chasing too few orders. After failing in its efforts to merge its loss-making regional jet activities with Taiwan Aerospace, BAe is now in talks with the Dutch manufacturer Fokker which was taken over last year by Deutsche Aerospace. It is also in discussions with Aerospatiale to create a joint venture in the turboprop sector. But even in the bigger end of the airliner market, the three leading manufacturers - Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US and the European Airbus consortium - are seeking risk-sharing partners to collaborate on the development of new programmes. Boeing and Airbus have also been discussing during the past two years joint collaboration on a future very large aircraft with 600-800 seats. However, these talks have been marred by suspicion with each side worried that the other is seeking to establish a lead in the future development of a super jumbo airliner. As a result, both Boeing and Airbus have continued to pursue separate studies to develop on their own a very large transport which they believe the market will need by the beginning of the next century. Continuing trade frictions on government direct and indirect supports for civil aircraft programmes have not helped collaboration efforts between Boeing and the Airbus partner companies. Although the trade dispute has abated following the 1992 agreement between the US and the European Union on aircraft subsidies, both sides are still anxious to secure new commitments on this controversial issue. The US wants even tougher restrictions on direct subsidies to Airbus, while Europe is insisting on stricter controls on indirect government support from Washington to its aerospace industry. All three leading aircraft manufacturers are continuing to forecast strong demand for new aircraft over the next 20 years. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer, expects Dollars 980bn worth of new airliners to be sold in this period to meet the growth in air travel and the need to replace older jets. For the manufacturers, the biggest prize in the short to medium term remains the Asia-Pacific market which has continued to grow much faster than other regions with strong demand not only for civil aircraft but also for military equipment. The Chinese civil aviation market in particular has been growing at breakneck speed. In contrast, the industry's earlier hopes of seeing the former Soviet Union emerge as a significant new market opportunity for western manufacturers have so far failed to materialise. But the airline industry in general is in no hurry right now to start ordering new aircraft with the same frenzy as it did in the late 1980s. Airlines are still struggling to restore their balance sheets, badly dented by several consecutive years of losses and fare wars that have undermined their passenger fare yields. In the face of what are likely to be lasting pressures on yields, airlines have sought to improve their financial performance by extensive cost-cutting to improve overall productivity. One of the most interesting recent trends in the airline industry's cost-cutting drive has been the growth in employee ownership in airlines. The US has taken the lead and already employees own 26 per cent of Northwest Airlines, 45 per cent of Trans World Airlines and 55 per cent of United Airlines. Negotiations are taking place between management and employees at USAir over restructuring proposals also involving an exchange of equity to employees for labour concessions. This trend now seems set to spread to other countries. Already British Airways pilots are interested in increasing their stake in their airline. Because airlines are preoccupied with holding down costs, manufacturers have had to shift their traditional emphasis from pure product research and development to improving their manufacturing processes. This will enable them to produce airliners more cost efficiently thus ensuring a return on investment from airline customers purchasing aircraft with lower operating and acquisition costs. 'The issue today is not so much what you build but how you build it,' explained an Airbus executive.</p>

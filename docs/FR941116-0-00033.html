			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, the FAA has reconsidered this requirement for leak checks of the service panel waste drain cap in waste drain systems incorporating in-line drain (ball) valves. The FAA has determined that, for these configurations, the valve reliability is sufficient to obviate the need for additional assurance provided by performing a leak check of the cap, as long as a leak check of the dump valve is accomplished. A leak check of the dump valve (in-tank valve that is spring loaded closed and operable by a T-handle at the service panel) can be accomplished easily and does not entail spillage of waste on the ramp. Therefore, the FAA has revised paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the final rule to require operators to perform a leak check of the dump valve, in lieu of performing a leak check of the cap valve. Operators would still be required to perform a leak check of the in-line drain (ball) valve. The leak checks must be accompanied by visual inspections of the service panel drain valve outer cap/door seal, the inner seal (if the valve has an inner door/closure device with a second positive seal), and seal mating surface for wear or damage that may cause leakage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This revision to the requirements of the final rule does not entail any additional burden on operators. As previously proposed, operators would have been required to perform leak checks of both the inner and outer doors of the cap valve and of the in-line drain valve, and a visual inspection of the service panel drain valve outer cap/door seal. As now required by the final rule, operators will be required to perform fewer leak checks of valves, and one additional visual inspection of the (inner) door seals. Since visual inspections are less labor-intensive and less costly than leak checks, the FAA considers that the revised requirements will significantly reduce the economic burden on affected operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the FAA has revised the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iv), which require leak checks of the dump valve and service panel valve. The final rule now specifies that the leak check of the service panel drain valve need only entail a leak check of the inner door/closure device (rather than leak checks of both the inner and outer door, as was previously proposed), provided that a visual inspection is made of the outer cap/door seal and seal mating surface for wear or damage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has not revised the similar requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii), which pertains to drain systems incorporating ``donut'' valves. As explained later in this preamble, the reliability of this type of valve is such that a leak test of the downstream cap is considered necessary; therefore, paragraph (b)(2)(iii) retains the requirement for leak checking the cap in drain system configurations where ``donut'' valves are installed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waste Drain System Leak Check Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that proposed paragraphs (a) and (b)(2) be clarified to specify that, for drain systems that may contain more than one kind of valve, only one of the waste drain system leak check procedures needs to be conducted at each service panel location. The procedure conducted should be the one that applies to the equipment with the longest leak check interval. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request, since this was the intent of this requirement. The final rule has been revised to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Kaiser Valve Part Numbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that the part number for the Kaiser Electroprecision in-line drain valve, specified in the proposal as ``part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher dash number),'' be revised to include the entire part number 2651&hyph;329 series. The valves in this series are all virtually identical in design and, therefore, would have the same reliability. The FAA concurs and has revised the final rule to call out these valves as ``Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 2651&hyph;329.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, this same commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to include Kaiser Electroprecision in-line drain valves, having part number series 2651&hyph;334 and 2651&hyph;278, in all requirements that apply to part number series 2651&hyph;329 valves. Although these valves differ slightly in their inlet/outlet configurations, actuating handle sizes and shapes, and actuating handle orientation and movement, they are identical in their main sealing components, design standards, and principle of operation; therefore, their reliability can be assumed to be equivalent. The FAA concurs and has revised the final rule accordingly. Operators should note that a review of available data indicates that the latter valve series are not currently installed on Boeing 727 airplanes, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Leak Check Interval for Kaiser Valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to permit the Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 0218&hyph;0026 valves (Expander Valves) to be leak checked at the same interval as the valves listed in the supplemental NPRM for 1,000-flight hour leak checks. This valve series was qualified to and meets the design/performance criteria of Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213 (Revision A). The commenter indicates that a large number of these valves have been installed in various transport category aircraft, and a tracking of the service history of the installed valves reveals that over one million flight hours have been accumulated without any reported leakage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA partially concurs with the commenter's request to provide an extended leak check interval for this specific valve series. The FAA considers that the presence of a forced-opening, or ``icebreaker,'' feature in a valve reduces the likelihood that service abuse will occur that would create a leaking valve. Unlike other valves eligible for inspections at 1,000-flight hour intervals in this rule, the Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 0218&hyph;0026 valves do not have such an ``icebreaker'' feature. In light of this, as well as the service history data provided, the FAA has revised the final rule to add a new paragraph (a)(3) to address these Kaiser Electroprecision valves and to provide for a repetitive 600-flight hour leak check of them for those operators electing to comply with paragraph (a) of the final rule. The FAA has also revised paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the final rule to include these Kaiser Electroprecision valves in the requirements for leak checks at 1,000 flight hour intervals. The FAA has determined that the difference in this leak check interval between paragraph (a) and (b) is appropriate, since the repetitive visual inspections, seal replacement requirements, and other comprehensive aspects of paragraph (b) will ensure that any leakage will be detected that may be caused by service damage inflicted on the valve (due to lack of an icebreaker feature on the valve).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

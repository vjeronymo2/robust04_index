			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore to launch micro trust Gartmore is to launch an investment trust to track a new index covering the smallest 1 per cent of UK equities by market capitalisation. The MicroCap index has been formulated by Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh of the London Business School, who have also been involved in establishing smaller companies indices for Hoare Govett. The new index includes about 670 companies, the largest of which has a market capitalisation of about Pounds 29m. This means that there is no cross-over with the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, which has a cut-off point of Pounds 30m. The Gartmore Micro Index Trust will take holdings in about 500 companies. Mr Gary Smith, the fund manager, said the trust would be capped at Pounds 100m. Its minimum size has been set at Pounds 25m. The trust will be launched by means of a placing and public offer, opening on December 2. Hoare Govett announced yesterday that it had raised Pounds 30m for an investment trust tracking the new Hoare Govett 1000 index, which covers the bottom 2 to 2.5 per cent of the UK equity market.</p>

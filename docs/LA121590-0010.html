			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY  </P> <P> Phillips is welcome to his viewpoints on homosexuality, but I wish he would use  the entire Bible and not just pick a questionable translation of I Corinthians  6:9. Romans 1:26-27 says that God gave homosexuals up to vile passions because  they left the natural use of the man or woman.  </P> <P> Agree with it or not, but the Bible still teaches homosexuality is unnatural!  </P> <P> Phillips' claim that Sodom was destroyed for "inhospitable treatment" to God's  messengers is laughable. Genesis 18:20 says Sodom was destroyed because "their  sin is very grievous." Genesis 19:4-6 states that the men of Sodom demanded the  two angels of God "so they may know them carnally." I imagine Phillips is now  going to say that homosexual rape is just "inhospitable treatment."  </P> <P> I have only one thing to say to Marshall Phillips and the liberal scholars he  quotes: "Professing to be wise, they became fools" (Romans 1:22).  </P> <P> ED SCHAEFER, Tustin  </P></p>

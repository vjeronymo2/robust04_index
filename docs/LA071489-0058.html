			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RENOVATIONS TO EASE SQUEEZE AT SAN FERNANDO COURTHOUSE  </P> <P> An end to crowding is in sight for the San Fernando Courthouse's arraignment  court, which recently was cited as a fire hazard because too many people were  crammed into the small room.  </P> <P> A courtroom renovation and expansion project underway at the old courthouse  will create two new municipal courts with their own courtrooms. One of the new  courtrooms will be used to handle traffic arraignments now processed in the  overtaxed Division 130, which some lawyers and judges call the busiest  courtroom in the county.  </P> <P> "The idea is to alleviate the serious overcrowding and adjudicate matters in a  timely fashion," said Eileen Berger, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles County  Municipal Courts. "We will relieve Division 130, and make that building as  efficient as it can be."  </P> <P> Division 130 handles about 250 cases a day, a 40% increase over last year.  Defendants in all cases at the San Fernando Courthouse -- from minor traffic  violations to murders -- are arraigned there.  </P> <P> Although Commissioner Gerald Richardson, who presides over Division 130,  arraigns people at a rate of about one per minute, people frequently wait all  day to pay a traffic ticket.  </P> <P> The congestion prompted Los Angeles Fire Department inspectors to cite San  Fernando Municipal Court officials last month for two fire-code violations --  crowding and blocking exit aisles -- in the arraignment court. The court was  not fined, however, because officials quickly sent people out of the courtroom  to wait in the hall until their cases were called.  </P> <P> The courtroom has a legal capacity of 119. As many as 190 are sometimes ordered  to show up at 9 a.m. for arraignment, court officials said.  </P> <P> The new courtrooms will be located in space previously occupied by lawyers'  offices and a branch of the Los Angeles County Library. The lawyers relocated  and the library moved to a new building in September, 1988, vacating 3,000  square feet.  </P> <P> Richardson said that moving traffic cases to another courtroom will alleviate  much of the pressure on the staff of Division 130. More than 14,000 traffic  violators were arraigned in Division 130 between July, 1988, and May, 1989,  according to court records.  </P> <P> Berger said court officials are still deciding how they will use the second new  courtroom.  </P> <P> Eventually, one court may receive one of the four new judges the county has  been authorized by the state to hire. But, initially, both will be staffed by  lawyers who volunteer to serve as temporary judges, Berger said.  </P> <P> The remodeling is one part of a general face lift for the old San Fernando  Courthouse building, located in the 900 block of First Street directly behind  the new courthouse.  </P> <P> The expansion raises the number of courtrooms in the bungalow-style building  from four to six. The building, built in 1953, was the only court facility in  San Fernando until the completion of the new building in 1983, Berger said.  Three of the original courtrooms are used for misdemeanor trial courts, and the  other for small claims and traffic trials.  </P> <P> The renovation project includes improving security and handicapped access,  painting and carpeting, Berger said.  </P> <P> Work began at the end of April and is expected to be completed by the end of  August at a cost of $50,000, taken from general construction funds, Berger  said.  </P> <P> During remodeling, trials have continued in three of the courtrooms. Matters  scheduled for the fourth have been sent to a makeshift courtroom in a  conference room at the Van Nuys Courthouse, Berger said.  </P> <P>  Times staff writer Philipp Gollner contributed to this story.  </P></p>

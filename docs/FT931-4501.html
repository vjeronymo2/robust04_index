			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Insuring exports BUSINESS HAS welcomed Mr John Major's recent public espousal of the role of exports in his strategy for economy recovery. But some industrialists argue that they are paying a price for the recent privatisation of the part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department that handles short-term export credit insurance. They are wrong on the privatisation, which has been a success. Where they have a legitimate complaint, however, is over the lack of government arrangements for reinsurance against political risks after 1994. Exporters are getting better service from NCM - the Dutch credit insurer which acquired the ECGD's short-term business - than could have been delivered by a government department. They can, for example, take out a single credit package for both domestic and international business, where before they needed to take out two. Furthermore, in a market in which NCM is often competing with four other companies for an insurance contract, many exporters have seen premium rates fall. Meanwhile, the government no longer needs to worry about the bill for insurance of commercial risks, which are firmly in the private sector, where they belong. On reinsurance, however, the government may have gone too far. It must reconsider its decision to make private-sector reinsurers assume full responsibility for coverage of political risks associated with wars or political upheavals. Reinsurers such as Munich Re and Swiss Re insist that the private sector does not have the capacity to cope with such political risks, even within the EC. They argue that commercial insurers could never cope with the concentration of risks involved, while the potential effects of the current Italian political crisis on sales to state-owned companies demonstrate that those risks are not confined to developing countries. As part of the original privatisation, NCM won the government's agreement to offer reinsurance for political risks for a three-year period to the end of 1994. But it is concerned that business is being affected by uncertainty beyond that year. The government should acknowledge that wholesale privatisation of reinsurance may be an over-ambitious short-term aim. It should prolong the transitional reinsurance arrangements, not only for NCM, but for competitors such as Trade Indemnity as well. By setting clear limits to government exposure, however, and ensuring the risk of reinsurance is shared by the private sector, the government could also limit the costs to itself and help foster a private market substantial enough to handle all risks. The longer-term goal must be the elimination of reinsurance by governments of developed countries against political risks created by one another. Such competition is particularly absurd within the European Community. New York does not insure its firms against political risk in California. Why should the UK insure its exporters against political risks in Italy?</p>

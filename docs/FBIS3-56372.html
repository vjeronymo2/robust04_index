In Addition to This,  the Yeltsin-Clinton Meeting Also Has Some Other Results"]    [Text] The just concluded meeting between the Russian and  U.S. Presidents has not brought anything new in the relations  between these two countries. Bill Clinton's expressions of  support for Boris Yeltsin and his course toward economic reforms  have been heard from across the ocean ever since the moment when  Yeltsin himself started talking about them. The presidents did  not report anything sensational at their final press conference,  like what they agreed on in Vancouver or at the Tokyo G-7  meeting. The Moscow summit with respect to Russian-U.S.  relations can be described as working, regular, and transient  rather than historic. Were it not for the issue of the  Ukrainian nuclear weapons and yesterday's signing of the  Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. agreement on their abolition, Clinton's  visit to Moscow would not have justified the usual expectations  of a meeting between the presidents of great powers.    An exception here might be a $12 billion contract signed  yesterday in Moscow on the sale of Russian weapons-grade uranium  to the United States over a period of 20 years which will be  processed into nuclear power plant fuel with U.S. assistance.  But this question too could have been dealt with during the  visit to Russia by Vice President Albert Gore, which was  precisely of an economic character.    Yet the latest meeting of the presidents has its own results  which are perhaps worth elaboration. The most outstanding among  them may be the accord on lifting most of the discriminatory  economic restrictions on Russian goods entering the U.S. market.  This is far more important for the prestige of the Russian  Federation than the reception of economic aid packages some of  which -- for instance, the Tokyo one last July -- are allocated  only in word. Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at the  final press conference with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton  stressed that Russia needs full-fledged collaboration with the  West, not "humanitarian aid." Therefore, by renouncing the  status of a state being dragged out of the mire of economic  crisis by others, Russia is putting itself in the same rank with  the developed countries. This is also evident from Yeltsin's  words, which showed that he sees the prospect of G-7 soon  turning into G-8. Possibly this will happen in July at the G-7  Naples summit to which the Russian president has been invited.    He told journalists that relations between Russia and the  United States "have been developing in a stable and partner-like  manner," but they need adjustment, especially in the social  sphere. Russia is not expecting direct social assistance from  the United States because, according to Yeltsin, "such support  is needed by the United States itself": It is impossible to  help Russia overcome unemployment without having overcome its  own unemployment in the first place.    Touching on this social issue, Boris Yeltsin thus apparently  sought to hedge against possible attacks on the part of a number  of opposition forces in parliament who are accusing him of  lacking a social security policy. Furthermore, the president  uttered a seemingly flattering phrase with respect to the  parliamentarians: "I do not think that we have a bad parliament.  It is more intelligent and more intellectual, and with great  experience. The upper chamber will follow the president's line  and the State Duma will come around to that." Although it was  spoken in linkage to the issue of ratification of international  treaties, Boris Yeltsin apparently also had the domestic aspect  in mind. The implication behind this phrase is approximately as  follows: "I am commending you and you should learn to listen to  me. If you do, I shall praise you again."    The joint statement by the Russian and U.S. Presidents on  securing human and ethnic minority rights, which primarily  applies to the Baltic countries, was fairly important but  unfortunately little more than a mere declaration. Boris  Yeltsin described this statement as "having teeth." After its  concessions to Moscow on the issue of NATO expansion the United  States has once again shown who is more important for it. And  here, judging by how feebly Clinton agreed with Yeltsin's  statements at the press conference, presumably there was some  pressure involved there. In the situation of misunderstanding  that has developed between Russia and the Baltic republics, the  White House has in the end taken the Kremlin's side.    As for NATO, by inviting the East European countries into  the  Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic alliance, according to  Clinton, is giving a chance to all of them to become  full-fledged members of this structure. Today the Partnership  for Peace will be conducive to preventing a division of Europe  and Russia's separation from it.    Both Clinton and Yeltsin noted that there have been  disagreements in the course of the talks. But at the press  conference only one such issue cropped up on which the  presidents hold different points of view -- the conflict in  Bosnia and the possibility of bombing it with NATO forces. On  this problem the heads of the two states did not come to  agreement but, in Clinton's words, a frank conversation on this  subject created the foundation for future discussions.    Apparently fearing "embarrassing" questions, especially  after  the words about disagreements between the two friends,  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian Federation president's press  secretary, gave no opportunity to representatives of Russian  newspapers to ask any questions. Journalists from third  countries were also denied this possibility.    So, it can be stated that the main result of Bill Clinton's  visit to Moscow has been the signing of the trilateral agreement  on the destruction of Kiev's nuclear weapons. Importantly, on  Yeltsin's initiative. As for Russian-U.S. bilateral relations,  there have been no particularly outstanding moves. But then,  where is one supposed to move as long as things in this respect  are as good as they can possibly be: President Boris Yeltsin is  friendly with Bill Clinton and the people of the Russian  Federation with the people of the United States.</p>

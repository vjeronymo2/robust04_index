			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPORTSMAN OF THE YEAR;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: JOE MONTANA BECOMES THE FIRST NFL PLAYER TO WIN THE SPORTS  ILLUSTRATED HONOR BY HIMSELF.  </P> <P> On a day Joe Montana made it abundantly clear he's against taking a rest in the  final two games of the regular season, he received what he perceives as his  greatest individual honor.  </P> <P> In accepting Sports Illustrated's award as Sportsman of the Year on Tuesday,  Montana becomes the first NFL player to win the honor alone.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw and Pittsburgh Pirates slugger  Willie Stargell were co-winners in 1979.  </P> <P> Of all the honors he's won, including being named the NFL's Most Valuable  Player last season, Montana said the magazine's award means more "because  you're not just competing with your peers . . . it goes outside those  boundaries (of football)."  </P> <P> When asked who among the previous winners he most admired or identified with  most, Montana chose 1989 winner Greg LeMond because "anybody who has pedaled a  bicycle knows how hard it is . . . to do it back to back. (Winning the Tour de  France) is a great accomplishment."  </P> <P> At 34, Montana says he has no intention of calling it quits, adding that his  physical condition is better now than it was at this point last season.  </P> <P> "I'd still like to finish my contract," he said, which would take him at least  through 1993.  </P> <P> For now, though, he has no desire for his body to be idle in the last two  regular-season games, even though the 49ers have already clinched the best  record in the conference.  </P> <P> "Being rested, maybe there's good to it," Montana said. "On the other hand,  with too much rest you'd probably go in the other direction (i.e. stale)."  </P></p>

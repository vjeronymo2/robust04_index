			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Recovery continues at Storehouse with profit of Pounds 15.2m STOREHOUSE, the retail group that includes BhS and Mothercare, continued its recovery yesterday as it announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 15.2m. That was slightly down on last year's Pounds 15.8m, but was after exceptional costs of Pounds 31.4m to cover losses on the sale of the Habitat and Richards chains last autumn. Before those costs, the profit was Pounds 46.6m - outstripping City forecasts. Operating profits for the continuing retail businesses rose fourfold to Pounds 43m. But Storehouse shares fell 2p to 199p in a subdued market. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, said Storehouse had 'made great progress in the last year on all fronts', and expected sales and profits growth to continue in the coming year. Sales in the continuing businesses rose from Pounds 880.8m to Pounds 966.8m, although total sales fell to Pounds 1.14bn from Pounds 1.18bn because of the disposals. Mr Graham Rider, finance director, said year-on-year sales increases were still running at about 10 per cent, and margins had improved by 1.5 percentage points. But he insisted this was due to improvements in Storehouse's organisation and merchandising rather than a general pick-up in consumer spending. Earnings per share after exceptionals fell to 0.1p from 2.6p, mainly due to a significantly higher tax charge. But the company held its final dividend at 2.5p, making a total pay-out of 5p. The company is close to drawing up a short list for a new chief executive to replace Mr David Dworkin who left in February to head US stores group Carter Hawley Hale. However it could not say when an appointment might be made. Mr Dworkin, who joined Storehouse in 1990, is widely credited with turning the group around. He reduced the staff by 900, cut out layers of management and improved organisation, display and merchandising at BhS. His reforms helped BhS double its operating profits to Pounds 44.1m last year. Mothercare, where Mr Dworkin's work is being continued by Ms Ann Iverson, his former colleague at a US stores chain, moved from a Pounds 3.9m loss to a Pounds 5m profit. Ms Iverson said this was due to an operational revamp and price cuts which helped regain market share. Lex, Page 22</p>

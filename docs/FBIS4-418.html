			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Abdou Diouf by Assane Diop in </F> Paris; date not given]    [Text] Many African heads of state have already expressed  an opinion about what is going on in Rwanda. Senegalese  President Abdou Diouf is visiting Paris. He told Assane Diop  that he agrees with the Western intervention there.    [Begin recording] [Diouf] I favor the international  community's stand against this violence and its attempt to stop  it in order to allow political dialogue to start again under  better circumstances.    [Diop] Do you think intervention by an international force  sponsored by the United Nations, the OAU or a third country such  as France is useful in situations like the one in Rwanda today?    [Diouf] I think it not only useful but absolutely necessary.  It is necessary because it is obvious that those in charge on  the spot cannot solve anything by themselves in the very short  term. They must be helped to solve their problems. This is why I  am in favor of an international solution. [end recording]</p>

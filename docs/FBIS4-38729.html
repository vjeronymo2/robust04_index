			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- President of the Association  of Russian Banks Sergey Yegorov went on record today for a "time  out" in the admission of foreign banks to the Russian market.    "In principle," he told a press conference here, "we favour  foreign investments in the Russian economy, including the  banking sphere. However, the national banking system is yet in  the making. It is not strong enough to face tough competition  from major foreign banks on the domestic market. Hence, there  is no point in trying to `butt the oak'. We need time to gather  strength."    Yegorov noted that Russian banks ran up against great  difficulties whenever they tried to open their offices, let  alone subsidiaries, in Western countries.    "Restrictions on the admission of foreign banks to the  Russian market," he said, "will not last for centuries, but only  for concrete time periods, necessary to give the Russian  commercial banks a breather so that they could gather strength  and build up a Russian national banking system."    Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Chairman of  the Russian Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko said that some  restrictions on the work of foreign banks in Russia might be  lifted in the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passage within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Text] The president of the Chamber of Deputies announced  that the executive power vacuum will probably be filled this  week. Frantz Robert Monde, reporting on the consultations begun  last week, indicated that the majority of sectors he met with  expressed concern about this vacuum. The Chamber of Deputies is  scheduled to meet soon to choose the constitutional formula  required within the current context, according to President  Monde who expressed himself during a news conference today:    [Begin Monde recording] At least if the Haitian Armed Forces  had said no, but President Aristide said yes, we could make them  meet and see what is negative in this plan. From there, we could  then manage to find a consensus between the two protagonists of  the crisis. But, one said no, and because he said no, the  sanctions must be reinforced. This is an aberration. I therefore  say that if the sanctions are reinforced, "greeting or not  greeting your enemy is the same thing; he will eat you up anyway  for something you did." Close the door on all negotiations,  install a government, and agree to die together. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Krasowski: "New Constitution This Year?"] </F>   [Text] The deputies' clubs, president, and government have  until 9 May to submit their constitution drafts. Not a single  draft has reached the Sejm yet. However, two proposals  concerning the method of work of the new constitution have been  drafted, one by the KPN [Confederation for an Independent  Poland] and one by the Union of Labor.    The Union of Labor suggests referendums in which society  would vote on specific constitutional issues, whereas the KPN  wants the Constitutional Committee to resume the work it carried  out under the previous government and consider the  constitutional drafts that were submitted then. The KPN argues  that in this way, those parties that failed to win parliamentary  seats this time around will have a chance of taking part in the  work on the new constitution, and will enable it to be adopted  sooner.    But the Constitutional Committee, led by Aleksander  Kwasniewski, prefers the so-called zero option, in other words  making a brand new start on the constitution and declaring all  the constitutional drafts submitted under the previous  government as null and void. The Sejm is to decide whether the  committee will consider the six draft constitutions that have  been produced by the Democratic Union, SLD [Democratic Left  Alliance], Central Accord, KPN, Senate, and jointly by the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Union of Labor.    Even if the Sejm does accept the zero option, that does not  mean that work on the new basic law will not begin until six  months' time. Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy has urged the  Constitutional Committee to produce its own draft constitution  in an effort to speed up the adoption of the new basic law, work  on which has dragged on for four years already.    In Moczulski's opinion, the SLD's Kwasniewski, who harbors  presidential ambitions, may cause the new constitution to be  adopted in the middle of 1994 so that he can call a premature  presidential election in the autumn. Such a scenario is  possible because if the SLD and PSL were to produce their own  draft, their parliamentary majority would bring about the  acceptance of this draft and the defeat of all the others. But  there are two major obstacles to this -- the increasing  political differences between the PSL and SLD, and the stance of  President Walesa.    Before the elections, the PSL and SLD came out strongly in  favor of a parliamentary system, leaving the president with the  mere role of arbiter. But these days, Kwasniewski is making it  clear that the SLD is prepared to expand the president's powers  considerably. If the PSL fails to agree to this, the SLD, in  its bid for a strong presidency, may count only on Walesa's  Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, and perhaps the KPN.    In turn, if the SLD does accelerate work on the constitution  with the intention of bringing about an earlier presidential  election, Walesa will object most strongly. The president said  recently that he will not allow an earlier presidential  election, and made it clear that if the ruling coalition tries  to make him resign over the constitution, he will call an  earlier parliamentary election.    Since becoming chairman of the Constitutional Committee,  Kwasniewski has said that he has no intention of curtailing  Walesa's presidential term, of which there is still two years  left.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLYMPIC BID BORDERS ON THEATER OF THE ABSURD;  </P> <P> MANCHESTER OF ENGLAND SEEKS 1996 GAMES DESPITE ATHENS BEING CLEAR FAVORITE  </P> <P> If one can judge by the questions at a news conference, Robert Scott, the  Manchester, England, theater owner who serves as chairman of his city's bid  committee for the 1996 Summer Olympics, should close his latest show before the  curtain rises.  </P> <P> For example: Considering that Athens is the sentimental favorite, that  Manchester still must build more than half the required facilities, that soccer  games in that part of England have been terrorized by hooligans and that the  United Kingdom's record on apartheid is out of step with most of the rest of  the world, how can Manchester's candidacy possibly be taken seriously?  </P> <P> "I like being the outsider," Scott said, displaying the same sort of humor that  served another Englishman, Alfred Hitchcock, so well.  </P> <P> Actually, except for Athens, all of the cities contending for the 1996 Summer  Olympics appear to be outsiders, although Belgrade, Yugoslavia might be further  outside than the others considering that its representatives chose not to come  to the annual International Olympic Committee session here this week.  </P> <P> "They had nothing more to say," said Boris Stankovic of Yugoslavia, who will be  inducted into the IOC tonight at the session's opening ceremony. But Stankovic  said Belgrade's bid committee will appear before the IOC when it counts, for  the election on Sept. 18, 1990 in Tokyo.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, representatives from the other five cities bidding -- Athens,  Atlanta, Manchester, Melbourne and Toronto -- have had more than enough to say  this week to make up for Belgrade's absence.  </P> <P> None have said it more dogmatically than those from Athens, which advertises  its bid as the "Golden Olympics." They claim that it is their right to have the  1996 Summer Games to celebrate the centennial of the revival of the Modern  Olympics at Athens in 1896.  </P> <P> "We owe it to history to have the Games in Greece, and all democratic nations  owe it to Greece because that was the birthplace of democracy," said Miltiades  Evert, former mayor of Athens who is now Greece's minister of health.  </P> <P> Kevan Gosper, an IOC executive board member from Melbourne, reacted to that  suggestion angrily.  </P> <P> "No city has a right to the Olympic Games," he said. "Every city has a right to  bid."  </P> <P> Paul Henderson, the chairman of Toronto's bid committee, reacted  diplomatically.  </P> <P> "As we know, Athens has the emotional claim," he said. "But all the cities have  the right. We wouldn't be bidding unless we had something to give to the  Olympic movement." (One thing Toronto gave this week was a poster of a moose on  a 10-meter diving board.)  </P> <P> Scott reacted as he normally does, with candor.  </P> <P> "We see the strength of the Athens Games," he said. "We agree with them that  they have the historical, sentimental and emotional imperative for the  centennial Games. They are a very worthy candidate and may be irresistible. I  make no apologies for saying that. But if that's not exactly what the IOC  wants, Manchester stands ready."  </P> <P> There is something to recommend all the cities. For instance, IOC President  Juan Antonio Samaranch has raved about his recent stay in Atlanta's Marriott  Marquis, calling it the finest hotel he has visited.  </P> <P> Of the bidders here, Toronto's are the only ones who did not bring a video.  They brought one of their city's best chefs, who prepares lavish buffets each  day for the IOC members. Toronto's also are the only ones who did not rent a  hospitality suite. They rented three cabanas an Olympic pin's throw from the  Caribbean.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, there is a sameness to all of the candidates' campaigns. They all  promise state-of-the-art facilities, rapid transportation, smog-free sky,  splendid weather, tight but non-oppressive security and billion-dollar or more  budgets.  </P> <P> Melbourne plans to spend $13.5 million on its bid for the Games. That compares  to the bid budgets of $6 million for Athens, $5.3 million for Atlanta, $4.5  million for Manchester and $6.5 million for Toronto. Asked why their bid is  more expensive, Melbourne representatives deny that it is. They claim that they  are the only ones telling the truth.  </P> <P> But although all the cities have their strong points, they also have  weaknesses. To their credit, they have tried to meet them head on. For example,  there are doubts about Athens because of its numerous political factions. All  were represented Monday at a news conference. There were 15 people on the  stage.  </P></p>

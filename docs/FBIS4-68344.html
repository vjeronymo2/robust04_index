			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Chairman of the Majority Party </F> Vyacheslav Grechnev; People's Artist of Russia Vera Vasilyeva;  Yuriy Moiseyev, member of the Majority Party Political Council,  president of the Russian Potato concern, and doctor of chemical  science; and Andrey Orlov, member of the Political Council, vice  dean of the Economic Academy, and doctor of economic science; by  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA senior staff members at the LITERATURNAYA  GAZETA editorial offices; date not given: "Will the Majority  Follow the Majority Party?"]    [Text] A year and a half ago LITERATURNAYA GAZETA  made a trip to Germany. At the request of our German colleagues  we brought to a "roundtable" organized by them representatives  of all the parties then registered in Russia. At the time there  were 25. The Germans were bewildered: How do you navigate in  such a large number of parties; we in Germany have only four  major ones and several small ones that are of no consequence?  The LITERATURNAYA GAZETA staff promised them that Russia, too,  will have everything the way it is supposed to be "in a polite  society"--two, three, or four parties. A year and a half passed,  however, and instead of 25 parties we have 40, or perhaps 50 (it  is hard to keep track)!    Not too long ago a new party appeared on the horizon,  which chose a name that carries quite a claim--the Majority  Party. So we decided to ask them a question: How does the idea  to set up a party come up today; what is it set up for?    Our guests at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial  offices are Chairman of the Majority Party Vyacheslav Grechnev;  People's Artist of Russia Vera Vasilyeva; Yuriy Moiseyev, member  of the party's political council, president of the Russian  Potato concern, doctor of chemical science; and Andrey Orlov,  member of the political council, vice dean of the Economic  Academy, and doctor of economic science.    Senior staff members of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA  participated in the discussion.  <H5>  Writhing Mute Streets </H5>   [Grechnev] How are parties formed? Probably in different  ways. As to our party, if someone told me three months ago that  I would be participating in this, I would have been very  surprised. After the 12 December elections, when the elements of  society's disintegration became obvious; when one could figure  out using a simple calculator that only 17-20 percent of  Russians were represented in the parliament; when we saw that,  on one hand, a clown had come to the forefront of politics, and  on the other, Russia's Choice's weaknesses became obvious, we  came to the conclusion that Russia needs a new party that will  reflect the interests of the majority of its population.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] We--meaning who?    [Grechnev] A group of entrepreneurs and intellectuals in the  humanities. We came to the conclusion that in reality Russia  does not have parties as such at all. They are more like  associations by interests: a club of Zhirinovskiy lovers, a club  of beer lovers... As for a true party that would express the  interests of average business, the interests of the middle class  in the population, such really does not exist in Russia.    We decided to create a party that would truly be a party and  represent the interests not only of the Moscow mingling circuit  but mainly those of the regions. It did not take us long to set  up a party organizing committee, hold a founding congress, and  open branches in 58 regions.    We acted on the following principle: At the first stage we  contacted commercial, cultural, and sports structures with whom  we had partnership relations. This facilitated the search. Take  for instance entrepreneurs. As a rule, they are successful  entrepreneurs. At their enterprises they pay decent salaries.  And the families that work here also trust those who let people  work normally and earn a normal living. You know, we ourselves  did not expect the tremendous, snowball support we got. We have  already made a trip to the Urals--Chelyabinsk, Chelyabinsk  Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Tagil. These  are huge regions with immense potential. We visited Bryansk  Oblast--regional branches are operating there actively. There is  interest in our party in the North Caucasus. We have a very  strong branch in Smolensk, and there is lot of interest in us in  Kaliningrad Oblast and Kaliningrad itself.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you consider the name of your  party  well chosen--the Majority Party? On one hand, it sounds like  pure advertising; on the other, you will be nicknamed  Bolsheviks. In reality, it follows from your program documents  that you intend to be a party of the middle class, and among  other things a party of small and medium-size business. In such  a case, why could you not make this clear right away?    [Grechnev] We thought for a long time about the name; it is  not accidental. This name expresses the very essence. I will  explain why. In our opinion, in a normal, civilized society,  where Russia should belong, the middle stratum of the  population, the middle class, should comprise 70-80 percent of  the population. It includes far more than just entrepreneurs, of  whom there are no more than 15 percent in society; it truly is a  majority. In our perception the middle class includes skilled  workers, doctors, teachers, engineers, any specialists working  for hire or self-employed, professional athletes, creative  intelligentsia, retired military officers, small and medium-size  business owners... In short, everyone who is engaged or wishes  to be engaged in free, creative, highly skilled labor. This  stratum effective maintains the state, ensures its prosperity.  That is why we say that we want to express and defend the  interests of the majority, the middle class.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] You said that you have support in the  regions. Any party in the country probably has support in the  regions. Shakhray, for instance, proclaimed that his PRES [Party  of Russian Unity and Accord] is a party whose support base is  the regions. According to you there are capital city parties and  there are all-Russia parties, right?    [Grechnev] As to Shakhray, the tactics he uses in work with  the regions is bewildering. He calls a head of administration,  talks to him, and after that believes that the region supports  him. This is far from true. The impression that heads of  administration have a great influence on the situation in the  regions is incorrect. Rather the contrary, entrepreneurs  directly supply them with foodstuffs. Therefore a head of  administration also depends on the entrepreneurial class. To the  best of my knowledge Shakhray, at least in the regions where we  traveled, did not deem it necessary to establish contacts with  local entrepreneurs. So I do not know how real his support in  the regions is.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] It is difficult to set up a party  these days. It takes money. Who is behind your party? Big  capital? Medium-size? Small?    [Grechnev] Medium-size capital. That is, people who have  earned their money themselves. They are mostly our business  partners. Trade business, construction...  <H5>  The Market Is Being Strangled by Taxes </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] From some of your remarks one may  draw  the conclusion that you do not believe that all businessmen have  earned their fortune honestly. Of course, this is true. But here  is the question: Do you work only with those you consider  absolutely honest?    [Grechnev] We are not interested in how a person earned his  money. We are not the procuracy or a court. This is a matter for  a person's conscience and appropriate law enforcement organs. If  a person shares our views; if he has money and will contribute  to the stabilization of society--for goodness sake, we are  always open.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] When one reads your program there are  some unclear points. We would like to hear more specifically  what you offer instead of, for instance, Gaydar's economic  policy. How is your economic program different from other  parties' programs?    [Grechnev] Let us begin with taxes. In our opinion, until  the  system of taxation is fundamentally changed no further reform,  no pulling out of the crisis is possible.    [Orlov] Our current system of taxation is completely  anomalous, idiotic. No matter how you count it, right now from  every million rubles [R] made by an entrepreneur,  R850,000-900,000 "disappear." There are 40-plus taxes--federal,  republic, city...    The conclusion is very simple. Until R650,000 out of this  million remains for investment, development based on market  forces, production is not going to grow. And we will not build a  critical mass of small business, will not be able to support  that part of the middle class that is already deteriorating  today. And is our potential for the 21st century. This means  that we have to create a new tax structure. For our party this  is a very real question. We have announced an international  competition to develop the best tax system.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What problem would you name as second  in importance after taxes?    [Orlov] We are facing an explosion of unemployment. In the  worst case scenario, keeping in mind the VPK  [military-industrial complex] potential--up to 30-35 million  persons. In the medium-gravity scenario--up to 12-15 million and  a change from latent, hidden unemployment to open. Among the  unemployed will be a tremendous number of people we consider  middle class. Based on that, we placed the emphasis on a simple,  well-developed, easy to understand economic program. So that  people will not evade taxes. So that we will find stimuli for an  economic upturn. We have a number of concrete projects that will  allow us to improve the economic situation, Yes, inflation will  persist, but it can be reduced.    The proposals for tax systems we have already received in  the  competition tell us that such potential is there.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your remarks you frequently  mention  the names of Abalkin, Petrakov, and Shatalin. Does this mean  that if your party comes to power, these are people who will be  your advisers rather than younger economists?    [Orlov] No, it does not. In the past I was indeed close to  this group. But I believe now that, with the exception of  Petrakov, they have somewhat exhausted their potential. Today we  need young flexible minds. And we have on our team many young,  talented people.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your opinion, is the return to  state regulation, a planned economy possible?    [Orlov] Impossible.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] And what if those who insist on such  a  return come to power?    [Orlov] Well, with the attitudes that currently exist in  society, with the way we are moving now, they are not going to  get power.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] No, this is not what we are asking:  What if they do take power?    [Orlov] If they take power, we will fight, we will argue  that  they will lead us into another dead end...    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Some people believe that even if  retrogrades take the power, the processes in the economy are  already irreversible and there is no way back...    [Orlov] They themselves understand this. They know full well  that there is no way back. You can slow down some things; some  components in the equation may be changed, but there cannot be a  genuine turning back... There is another possibility--a partial  return. For instance, market socialism with some new face. A lot  of state ownership, a lot of regulation, a lot of all sorts of  slogans: Let us protect these, and those... Not such a fast  progression to a liberal economy of the American type, but  something like a social market economy.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What is your position in the current  polemics around customs duties?    [Orlov] They are needed, of course, but not as high as they  have been set.    [Grechnev] It is just that this is a bad time to impose  them.  In time, when production is up; when a new taxation system is in  place; when it is profitable for producers to work and expand  production--then, of course, in order to protect the domestic  producer customs duties will need to be imposed.  <H5>  Does a Party Need Discipline? </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] There is an obvious contradiction in  your program documents between the claim to be a party of the  majority and the disciplinary restrictions you intend to impose  on your ranks. You even use the odious term "democratic  centralism..." You have not offered anything unifying in the  sphere of ideology. Only disciplinary measures.    [Grechnev] I do not see any contradiction here. You say that  you cannot pinpoint the ideology. In my opinion, the ideology is  defined very precisely and clearly. What is, for example,  important for me as a businessman and a member of the middle  class? First and foremost, stability in society. A society that  is split into the lumpen and the elite is unstable...    About democratic centralism. This is our reaction to the  past  few years of the democratic talking shop. Only talking shop, no  real action. People do not have any real responsibility. We  think, on the other hand, that real members of our party will  have a real responsibility to it. Because they will receive and  already receive something from the party. I do not mean some  monetary handout or something of this kind. We help people in  their self-realization. To some we give a direct distribution  market. To others we help find jobs. That is, we do real things.  And while for others things did not get beyond declarations, we  gather our supporters by concrete, real actions; we help them,  and we have the right to ask for reciprocity.    [Orlov] Today our task is to create distribution markets,  create new jobs, create schools for young talents... We have,  for instance, a studio which is called exactly this: "Young  Talents." We sponsor it. A wonderful school! They recently gave  a great concert in the Rakhmaninov Hall in the conservatory. If  we do not support this, we will lose a great number of talented  kids brought in from all over the former Union. But in order to  help, we ourselves have to be well organized.  <H5>  Place in the Political Spectrum </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What are your goals in the area of  privatization? In your opinion, is it being conducted the right  way? What do you think about vouchers?    [Orlov] We have to start with land. Establish true ownership  of it. Look at what is happening now. There are 200,000 peasant  and private farms. But have you counted how many of them are  true, market-type? Only 25-30 percent. And they only feed  themselves; the rest are merely registered. The critical mass,  however, which forms a real market, must comprise at least  500,000 farms. Only then will some sort of competitive basis  appear. Next we have to organize 3-5 million small  enterprises... Vouchers are a stage I call a registration  stage--statistical, learning stage. We have not yet achieved  fundamental change.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But voucherization has already taken  place; this is a fact...    [Orlov] When I go to my dairy store on Gruzinskaya Street I  see a new sign there--a TOO [limited liability partnership) or  AO (joint-stock company). But it is as dirty as it used to be.  And the sales clerks are as rude as they used to be... So what  has privatization given us? Is this an increase in efficiency?  Is this an upturn coming in place of losses and decline?    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] When a new party appears on the stage  everybody wants to know that kind of party it is. There are  certain tests by which the reader can determine what part of the  political spectrum you are in. Test No. 1: Which of the Duma  parties is closest to you?    [Grechnev] Probably Shakhray's party, because it places  emphasis on the regions. We, too, as we have already said, want  to be a party of the regions rather than a Moscow party.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Test No. 2: How do you feel about  calls to restore the USSR?    [Grechnev] In our opinion, restoring the USSR in the form in  which it existed before certain events is impossible.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But do you see unification in some  form? Or do you support the CIS? Or something else?    [Grechnev] I will answer the question this way. There was  Russia, Russia Minor, and Belorussia. This is the way it should  be. It is one whole organism.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But Russia Minor does not want to be  with us.    [Grechnev] This is an arguable contention--about Russia  Minor. A Ukrainian Majority Party is being set up there. Also a  Belorussian Majority Party. Hopefully we will work together.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] How do you feel about the recent  amnesty declared by the Duma?    [Grechnev] In my opinion, when mercy is shown, this is good.  But the degree of culpability should be determined by a court.    [Orlov] I also want to add that it would be good if the  initiative in such matters came from the president.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you have a presidential candidate?    [Grechnev] Yes. A well-known name, but we do not want to  mention it yet. A person who shares our views.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] What will you say regarding the  current rumors that Luzhkov supports your party?    [Grechnev] I think Luzhkov is the best person to speak up on  this subject. And he has said that he has nothing to do with our  party and that he wrote greetings to our congress at the request  of a friend who shares the views of our party and since his own,  Luzhkov's, views are not in conflict with it.  <H5>  Russia Is a Rural Country </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In your perception, do peasants  belong  with the middle class?    [Moiseyev] Yes, we believe that ordinary rural  workers--peasants, farmers--are part of the middle class.  Although they as a social group have a number of special traits  that have to be taken into account. First and foremost, the  rural population is a pragmatic part of the population, the most  pragmatic one, which no longer believes slogans. They do not  accept revolutionary reforms. Therefore, when farmers come and  say: Let us divide everything--it causes psychological  hostility. Finally, it is the most technologically backward part  of the population. As a result, they have higher production  costs, greater storage losses... So now we have arrived at such  a logical state where food prices in the domestic market are  higher than world prices. And lastly, a proprietor is developing  now in each producer in the rural area. While in the past  house-adjacent plots were mere vegetable gardens, now people  have one or two hectares. They are becoming private producers of  goods. But at the same time they do not want to leave state  organizations. If a person works at a post office, or someplace  else, or in a kolkhoz, he does not want to leave. Such duality  requires great tact in treating the choice of path Russia will  follow in this area.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] But do we not have to finally get  this  sluggish cart moving?    [Moiseyev] We are looking into various scenarios now. The  first is the administrative way: make everyone a farmer. Today  farmers occupy 2 percent of the total area and produce as much  output--a little more than 2 percent. That is, when it comes to  efficiency they are no different from other sectors in  agriculture. This way, as I already said, currently causes  hostility on the part of the rest of the rural population. From  the economic and psychological standpoint, I think that in the  nearest future any forcible pressure in this area is  unacceptable. I can quote in this respect the famous message of  Petr Filippov, head of the Analytical Center of the President's  Administration, in which he recommended "breaking up" over the  period March-April large producers into smaller partnerships  comprising 20-30 persons. Naturally the countryside was  completely hostile to the idea.    The second way is currently officially supported by that  part  of the Duma that oversees the agrarian sector. It envisages  continuing financial aid to the agrarian sector. But this is a  temporary measure.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] So what way do you--the Majority  Party--propose?    [Moiseyev] We are searching for a third way. And we see two  potential trends here. The first is in uniting rather than  pitching against one another personal plot owners, who at the  same time also participate in collective production. This may be  perhaps a purely Russian way. It requires division of functions  instead of division of property. If a collective entity takes  upon itself procurement of seed and equipment, and will take the  final product from the peasants--this will be a rational  division of functions. Therefore, new structures must emerge on  the microeconomic level. They already exist now, and we actively  support them.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] You said that there are two trends.  What is the other one?    [Moiseyev] The second trend is that associations, concerns,  and corporations must emerge on a higher, macroeconomic level.  Not by the territorial principle, however--by product. We had  the experience before the reform of organizing the APK  [agro-industrial complex] by territorial attribute. Meanwhile,  the experience of world development shows that a different  variant is more promising. Sometime after the crisis of the  1930's large concerns came into existence--such as Coca-Cola,  Pepsi-Cola--which combine production, growing, distribution, and  even science in their field.  <H5>  Who Are You With, Stage Workers? </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Let us now ask Vera Kuzminichna: Has  the entire Theater of Satire joined the Majority Party or only  part of it? And how did you come into the party?    [Vasilyeva] The Theater of Satire is not part of any  parties,  including this one. The same goes for me. Being the age I am and  having experienced so many disappointments, it would be stupid  to run from one party to another. But there are things I  consider very important and welcome. This is what I mean.    As you know. the situation in culture is very difficult now.  Our theater is doing quite well, though. As they say, we do not  go around begging. At a time when everybody is getting rid of  the "ballast," our people prefer smaller salaries but no  layoffs. Well, we have four plays in production now, and money  has been found for all four of them. For a year, however, we,  together with director Boris Aleksandrovich Lvov-Anokhin, have  dreamed of producing Gnedich's "The Assembly." The part I have  is far from a dream part, and I could certainly do without this  play, but I think it is very much needed precisely now. This is  also the opinion of our leadership. Because this is a play about  how Peter the Great attempted to lead our Russia onto a  civilized road of development, which turned out to be very  difficult. Everything that is taking place there resonates very  much with our times. Stealing, drinking. The desire of many  people, despite tremendous difficulties, to still walk this road  of civilization. We decided to conduct an experiment: produce  this play together with the New Drama Theater, which is directed  by Lvov-Anokhin, because we realize that there are many acting  parts and expenditures will be considerable.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] We are beginning to guess: Is it they  who got you together with the Majority Party?    [Vasilyeva] Since I am in charge of the domestic commission  in the Theater of Satire, where I very frequently have to ask  for money for old actors, sick people, I am used to asking. I am  not ashamed of it because I ask not for myself. Therefore, when  I was invited to this event--I do not even know what to call it:  a party presentation or simply a meeting--I told the person who  invited me: "Pardon my cynicism--are there going to be rich  people there?" I was told: "Yes." I said: "Then I will be happy  to come. And I will be happy if the new party turns out to be a  good one. I will speak of every good deed and will never hide  who helped us."    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Did you get help?    [Vasilyeva] We were promised stage-by-stage financing for  this production--"The Assembly." I repeat, we are not poor, but  this will simply be a very good act on the part of a party that  intends to help intellectuals, people of art, and helps a  theater in a difficult moment. I consider it a good deed.  <H5>  The Law Is the Law </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Another question for the party  leadership. In your program documents, among the main values you  mention legality. You write about the primacy of the law, the  sanctity of the law. But there are laws and laws. You see, you  are already unhappy about the law on customs duty. On 3-4  October, too, some defended the law while others apparently  violated it...    [Grechnev] You may have noticed that by our orientation we  lean towards the conservatives. To take a Western analogy, we  are a conservative party, and we do indeed respect the law.  Although we see, of course, the difference between the law and  the legal system. As to specifically regarding our attitude to  the October events, we consider it a national tragedy. As your  newspaper reported, we have opened a special account, money from  which will be used to aid all victims of this tragedy.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Once again about your program goals.  You make your priority a strong, stable state as a guarantor of  freedom, dignity, human rights, and the individual, etc. But in  Russia, the state, the bureaucratic state, has always been and  remains the opposite--a guarantor of lack of freedom. A  guarantor of suppression, an annihilator of the individual. The  bureaucracy has acquired a gigantic scale even in comparison  with communist times. How can one worship such a state? Only a  civil society should be a guarantor of freedom--only such a  society is capable of restraining the army of bureaucrats.    [Grechnev] In my opinion, the state per se currently does  not  function at all. What we see is the tyranny of bureaucrats.    [Orlov] The situation right now really is anomalous. We  understand very well that everything is permeated with  corruption. We have to create a civilized stratum of civil  servants. But bureaucrats are not necessarily the state. A state  is a combination of at least three authorities: executive,  legislative, and judiciary. We in the party also attach great  significance to the fourth estate--the mass media. We are  supporters of a state in which laws are intelligent; where there  is a combination of effective authorities, with a great role for  judiciary structures. As for building a civil society--this is a  long process.  <H5>  We Are Open to Everyone </H5>   [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Do you know how many members you  currently have, or is there no such record-keeping?    [Grechnev] There is. We receive up-to-date information.  There  are about 200,000 active party members.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] In one of your program documents  there  are words about the priority you attach to the development of  Russian spirituality. Do you have a certain weakness for  national-patriots?    [Grechnev] We are talking about Russia's [rossiyskaya], not  Russian, spirituality. We have emphasized this many times.    [Orlov] It is our principle, which also was expressed at the  congress. There can be no doubt about it. The same extends to  our attitude to different religious confessions. We are an open  party.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] How do you feel about such populist  undertakings as a beer lovers party?    [Grechnev] I like beer.    [Orlov] Let there be a lot of beer, good-tasting and  different.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] The last question--on your plans for  the immediate future. What can we expect of your party? In which  elections will it participate?    [Grechnev] The plan for the immediate future is to work with  the regions, travel to the regions: Orel Oblast, Nizhniy  Novgorod, Bryansk, Kirov, Yakutsk, Kabardino-Balkaria. We will  participate in elections whenever they take place. We are ready.  We are already participating in regional elections.    [Orlov] We are setting up international contacts. We will  visit Austria and Germany.    [Grechnev] At the end of the month I am going to Cyprus,  where we have already established contacts with the Conservative  Party.    [Orlov] We have very promising contacts in the United  States.  Everything will be fine, we hope.    [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA] Can we see your party card?    [Grechnev] We have the design, and the cards will be printed  soon.  <H8>  *** </H8>   As this issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA was going to print,  the  Majority Party held another press conference, at which the party  leadership expressed their attitude to the draft Agreement on  Civic Accord. The statement says that while supporting the IDEA  of the agreement, the party at this point cannot endorse this  wording of the document. For instance, calls for compliance with  the constitution--which is the duty of any citizen regardless of  agreements--are seen by the Majority Party leadership first as  nonsense, and second, as an attempt to place this document above  the constitution. Also unacceptable is the desire of the  document's authors to impose additional political restrictions  in the form of obligations to "not initiate political campaigns  with the purpose of holding early elections of federal organs of  authority," "not conduct and not participate in organizing  strikes," and others.    In many of its provisions, the party said at the press  conference, this agreement is just a collection of obvious  maxims and banal assertions. To endorse such a document would be  TANTAMOUNT TO ENDORSING THE BIBLE.    At the same time, it was said that the Majority Party is  ready to take part in work on the preparation of a more serious  Memorandum of Accord. It will bring into this work the cadres of  highly skilled jurists, economists, and political scientists the  party has at its disposal.</p>

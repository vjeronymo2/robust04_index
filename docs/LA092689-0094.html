			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Kings put veteran Ron Duguay on the waiver list and assigned rookie goalie  Robb Stauber to their American Hockey League affiliate at New Haven, Conn.,  along with forward Sylvain Couturier.  </P> <P> The Kings are anticipating that because of Duguay's salary -- reportedly about  $450,000 -- he will clear waivers and can be assigned to New Haven or Phoenix.  </P> <P> King Coach Tom Webster had said that Stauber would probably start the season in  New Haven, where he will get more playing time than if he were backing up Kelly  Hrudey.  </P></p>

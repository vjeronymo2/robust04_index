			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Osaka prefectural  police and the Higashi Police Station of Japan are getting all  the more arrogant, ignoring the strong protest by the Koreans in  Japan and public opinion at home and abroad, according to CHOSON  SINBO.    The paper said the Osaka prefectural police, far from  apologizing for its criminal acts, let out a stream of  provocative words at officials of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans, shouting  "Chongnyon of Korea, break up your protest action" and "we will  arrest you, if you stay any longer".    The rampage of the Japanese right-wing gangsters is assuming  greater intensity, coupled with the arrogance of the Japanese  police.    On the 6th of June, they appeared around the prefectural  police bureau and the Higashi Police Station where Koreans were  staging a protest and made a fuss, shouting "away with Koreans."    On the 7th, right-wing gangsters belonging to the "League of  Asian Nations" came with an armoured vehicle and a loudspeaker  car and threatened Koreans who were staging a protest, uttering  uncleanly words unfit for human mouth.    The suppression by the Japanese reactionaries has lashed the  Koreans in Japan into fury.</p>

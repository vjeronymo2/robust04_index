			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carmakers gamble on small concept - The unveiling of the micro compact cars The Geneva motor show, which gets under way today, will see a number of new concept cars unveiled. The joint venture between Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss pioneer of cheap and cheerful watches, to develop a micro compact car is the most striking sign yet of the determination of carmakers in Europe to develop a new market for minicars for use in congested, densely populated cities. For several years carmakers have flirted with ideas for two-seater city cars with a length well below even the 3.05 metres of the British Mini, now in its 35th year of production. Their appetites are whetted by the prospects of new growth offered by opening up a new segment at the bottom of the car market. However, they have fretted over the economics of such car programmes. Small cars often threaten small profits, and at the same time the customer research has been confusing. The concept cars may look cute, be environmentally friendly, and statistics may prove that cars in cities are only occupied on average by 1.2 persons, but will people buy two-seater city cars? Professor Ulrich Seiffert, research and development director of Volkswagen, Europe's leading volume carmaker has a small model of the VW Chico concept car on a cabinet in his office in Wolfsburg. The Chico has been exhibited at many international motor shows, and it was to be VW's city car of the second half of the 1990s. But it will never be built. It allowed only 2+2 seating rather than room for four adults and VW has decided that the concept was not viable. Instead it is backing the idea of a cheap small car to be sold for under DM15,000 (Dollars 8,823), but which will carry four adults and some luggage. It is due for launch in 1996. It will be shorter than the new Polo supermini, to be unveiled later this year, but it will share many basic chassis platform components with the Polo. Volkswagen was the first carmaker to join SMH to study the concept of the so-called Swatchmobile micro car, but it pulled out of that project last year in the face of mounting financial problems. Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman of SMH and the man credited with masterminding the rescue of the Swiss watch industry in the 1980s, claims that he did not lack for suitors for his Swatchmobile project, when it was abandoned by VW. By the end, the main rival to Mercedes-Benz was General Motors, the US carmaker. Like all its rival volume carmakers GM has long been studying the potential of the so-called sub-B segment of the European car market beneath the B-class superminis such as the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, the Ford Fiesta, the Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra. It was intrigued by the Swatch marketing expertise, and by SMH's ideas for hybrid propulsion systems combining electric power and internal combustion, but like VW it has struggled to stand up the business case for a purely two-seater urban car. It was also troubled by the safety issues raised by such a small car. The traditional volume carmakers are still experimenting and hovering on the brink, and at the Geneva motor show, Ford will unveil today its latest concept for a sub-B car, the Ka, to further assess the reactions of potential buyers. The ebullient Mr Hayek has never been plagued by the big carmakers' doubts. He says he has been driven by the conviction that there is a gap at the bottom of the market for 'a high quality, environmentally friendly, low price car'. The success of the concept will be supported, he says, by the classless image of the Swatch brand, as well as by SMH's experience in micromechanics, microelectronics and in the assembly of a high quality product using fewer parts. For Mercedes-Benz the joint venture with Swatch is the most tangible sign yet of its earnest to jump over its own shadow as it transforms its strategic product policy in the search for new markets. Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, claims that its traditional customers are on the move into new markets, and the executive and luxury carmaker wants to be there to meet them. Behind closed doors, Mercedes-Benz has worked for more than a decade on concepts for urban micro cars, and it believes that the time has come to roll the dice. 'We intend to create a market segment which has hitherto not existed in this form yet provides substantial growth potential,' says Mr Werner boldly.</p>

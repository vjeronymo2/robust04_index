			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: A flawed look at fine art - European printmaking THE RENAISSANCE PRINT by David Landau and Peter Parshall Yale University Press Pounds 45, 433 pages The Renaissance print, north and south of the Alps, has largely been taken for granted by art historians unless, as with Mantegna's engravings and Durer's woodcuts, it is a significant part of an artist's oeuvre and necessary to the completion of a monograph. Few have ever considered it as art in its own right, both woven into painting and drawing, and standing apart from them; nor have they enquired into its mass manufacture and marketing, nor the artists to whom its technical development was a matter of ardent intellectual and aesthetic concern. David Landau, editor of Print Quarterly, and Peter Parshall, Professor of art history at Portland, Oregon, have sought to remedy this, and with ten years research have produced a book that covers the subject for a century or so, from the print's first burgeoning in Flanders in the 1460s, to its exploitation for the mechanical reproduction of Raphael's imagery, and from the first crude woodblock to the elegant chiaroscuros of Ugo da Carpi and Beccafumi. Their approach is encyclopedic; we learn of the expanding manufacture of paper from flax, as the market for wool declined and that for linen grew; we learn of paper merchants at a Frankfurt fair, of inks from vine yeast or burnt pitch, of printing presses established all along the Rhine and into the Netherlands and Swabia, of family workshops in which wives and daughters played their part and the works of other printmakers were sold, of networks and of agents, and of Hungary as a source of copper for the plates; we are even told of the use of prints as objects of portable and private devotion, and of their enjoyment in privacy when the market proliferated into erotica and pornography, not just in illustrating the illicit loves of gods, but more directly - and the authors make their point with Raimondi's print of a nude woman at pleasure with a ladies' comforter. It is at an engaging pace at the beginning that we absorb the exciting basic facts and glimpse Renaissance Europe feverishly exploiting a new commerce so important to their prestige that such artists as Lucas Cranach and Urs Graf may have been driven to falsify the dates of their prints so as to lay claim to primacy in technical invention, but the pace is not sustained. The complexities of the material defy the continuous text with which the authors bind it, and like 18th century connoisseurs who know all the facts and are fecund with ideas, but cannot organise either into a logical format, they lose their grasp, and on recovery insert the material almost at random. From page 65, not under his own name, but with the heading The Development of a Tonal System, we have six pages devoted to the vexed matter of Mantegna's prints; a little more appears on page 100, and another five full pages are hidden in the subsequent chapter devoted to Marcantonio Raimondi and Raphael; yet in these three passages the explanation of Mantegna's techniques is far from clear, nor is the question of authenticity satisfactorily addressed. Durer provides an even more continuous leitmotiv, running right through the book - very late we learn that he gave his prints in barter and payment, even as tips, and are treated to a discussion of their financial worth and even of the coins that he carried in his purse - but nowhere in the list of contents is he mentioned (nor is Mantegna), though his compatriots Altdorfer, the Hopfers and Lutzelburger are. The list of contents is one of the book's worst offences; with a confusion of typefaces erratic in their relation to the importance of the subject, a meaningless mixture of capitals and lower case, and absurd crowding, it is inadequate, misleading and damnably unhelpful, and the serious reader intending to use the book for reference must first set to the task of making his own list, with cross-references. An editor should have seen to this, and he should also have shaken the authors by the scruff; too often they write carelessly, their grammar slovenly - 'there are only a couple of his plates known' is typical, and 'more importantly' and other confusions of adjective and adverb are a common irritant. No editor should have allowed to pass into print the fuzzy thinking of the brief paragraph on Marcantonio and Parmigianino in which appear 'almost certainly,' 'most scholars now agree that,' 'more probably,' 'it is not unlikely that,'/'This is not improbable, and it is also possible that,' 'would have been,' 'conceivably,' and 'probably rehearsed.' A decade of labour by two diligent scholars does not of itself result in a good book, particularly when they cannot spell (martial for marshal), cannot write with any style that eases the reader through their torrent of material, and are so jack-in-the-box with its presentation. The design of the book is a disgrace - with a rigid spine its pages never lie flat, and of the twin columns of small print, the inner invariably slides into the gutter; crudely patched with little illustrations, few pages are comfortable to the eye; and the sub-headings that mark the text's crucial shifts from north to south of the Alps are too small to be seen when rifling swiftly through the pages, as one must. All this is more than irksome, for so absorbing a survey of so wide a field, learned, technical, perceptive, and full of sudden and illuminating insights, must be regarded as the most important work on the subject for many years - certainly within my lifetime - but it could have been so much more immediately useful had its publishers insisted on its being, not some four hundred pages to be read as literature (with some four hundred illustrations), but a stout reference book. We shall all use it as a reference book, and every time we do so, we shall curse the press that printed it.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Parmalat improves 24% to L52bn PARMALAT, the Italian milk and dairy foods company, raised net group profits by almost 24 per cent to L52bn (Dollars 32.9m) last year, due partly to a 23 per cent rise in sales to L1,636bn. Mr Calisto Tanzi, chairman, said sales should reach about L2,800bn this year, due to further acquisitions in Italy, the US and South America. Acquisitions this year include a stake in Giglio, an Italian dairy group with sales of about L400bn; Atlanta Dairy, a US dairy products concern with about L100bn in turnover; Lacesa, a dairy products group; and the associated Sodilac company in Brazil, with sales of about Dollars 80m. Mr Tanzi denied Parmalat planned a imminent rights issue to finance further purchases. 'For the time being, our ratios are alright as they are. But if interesting opportunities arise, then we'll have to see,' he said. He confirmed Parmalat's interest in buying the Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica, subsidiary of the state-owned SME foods group now being privatised. At parent company level, Parmalat Finanziaria, reported a slight drop in net profits to L9.1bn against from L9.5bn in 1991. In spite of the fall, stemming from a doubling in taxation, the dividend for ordinary shares is being raised by L5 to L120.</p>

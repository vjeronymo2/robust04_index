Today, after the collapse of the empire, Russia, its legal  successor, is trying to maintain the production and sale of  weapons in the world market. How does Ukraine look against that  background today? Our correspondent discusses that with  Lieutenant-General Lev Hnatenko, first deputy chief of weaponry  and chief of staff for weaponry of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine.    [V. Korol] Lev Mykolayovych, what is the "arsenal" of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine today, is there enough powder for our  "powderhorns"?    [L.M. Hnatenko] The Ukrainian Army is not experiencing any  particular lack of weaponry or hardware. All of these are  moreover the latest models, which were in service at one time  with the weaponry of the former Soviet Army. What sort of arms  are they? For example, T-64, T-72 and T-80 tanks, BMP-1, BMP-2,  BTR-70 and BTR-80 combat vehicles, MiG-29 and Su-27 aircraft,  S-200 and S-300 air-defense systems... This list could go on.  The Navy actually does not have an adequate quantity of vessels.  I hope that this this problem, however, will be solved in the  next few years. That portion of the Black Sea Fleet that goes to  Ukraine will give us the opportunity of creating a powerful navy  in the future. Approximately ten of the latest ships in various  classes have also been laid down at Ukrainian shipyards.    [V. Korol] Even if the Army is equipped with the latest  models of weaponry and hardware, it is still necessary to  prepare for their replacement...    [L.M. Hnatenko] Yes, and there are many ways of resolving  that problem--first, the creation of new models of weaponry;  second, the upgrading of existing weaponry in order to increase  its combat potential; and, third, procurements abroad.    [V. Korol] Which way is the most favorable for Ukraine?    [L.M. Hnatenko] We are now developing two state programs for  the creation of weaponry. Minister of Defense General of the  Army of Ukraine V. Radetskyy is devoting the most steadfast  attention to them. One of the programs is intended for the  period to the year 2000, and the other for the long term, to the  year 2010. They are oriented toward bringing us as close as  possible to a self-contained cycle for the production of  weaponry and military hardware.    Ukraine unfortunately had almost no assembly plants. Our  enterprises manufactured close to 30 percent of various elements  and constituent items for weaponry and military hardware. We  will thus obviously not have the capability of manufacturing all  of these arms independently in the very near future. The  solution of the problem of upgrading the weaponry and hardware  will be pursued in comprehensive fashion--partly through the  development and manufacture of our own weaponry, and partly  through procurements abroad and, ultimately, the upgrading of  existing models in cooperation with the CIS countries. You  cannot get away from cooperation in this case, since most of the  design bureaus are located on Russian territory. The solution of  the problem of modernization is extremely difficult, and  sometimes even virtually impossible, without the technical  documentation they have and the necessary coordination.    We are also now developing a special program for the  modernization of weaponry. We are studying the experience of its  operation in the field, which suggests certain solutions  pertaining to its further improvement. We are making attempts to  set up, as I was saying, joint scientific research with the KBs  [design bureaus] that created these or those models. We are  carefully studying similar processes in the armies of other  countries at the same time. The experience of Israel, which is  upgrading the MiG-21 aircraft and giving it better qualitative  features, for example, is very useful.    [V. Korol] But Lev Mykolayovych, Ukraine has strong  scientific and production potential that is working for the  Army...    [L.M. Hnatenko] Undoubtedly. The first evidence of that, for  example, are the products from the Plant imeni Malyshev. It put  out the T-34 tanks--the best in the world at one time--and the  T-64 also came out of its gates. It is now "bringing to the  surface" the T-80 UD tank, which has already won recognition  among the military of many countries around the world. The plant  also has long-term projects in the corresponding weaponry. The  enterprise is also facing great financial problems today.    Another giant of the defense industry, the ANTK imeni O.  Antonov, on the contrary, is on the rise today. The An-70  aircraft created by that collective has no analogue in the world  among aircraft in its class. The aircraft will be in series  production in the near future, and almost 40 countries from  around the world have displayed an interest in acquiring it.    Ukraine has great capabilities--and they are being  realized--in shipbuilding. We can build the smallest vessels to  missile cruisers.    We have also traditionally been strong in electronics, and  in  radio and instrument building. The appropriate financing is  essential so that we do not lose those positions...    [V. Korol] Financing--the Achilles heel of our existence...    [L.M. Hnatenko] The Army has lived without a budget for two  years, and only pay and food are being financed. The situation  has changed little this year as well, even though a budget was  approved. It provides, as before, for the pay and food for  servicemen. We are getting virtually no budget funds for the  development of weaponry and hardware.    [V. Korol] But there is also extrabudgetary financing...    [L.M. Hnatenko] Yes, for example, the sale of military  property and hardware or arms, the offering of various types of  technical services... The funds obtained from that, however,  unfortunately go not for weaponry, but to pay for various debts  of our department, the procurement of foodstuffs, medicines,  fuels and lubricants etc.    Not a single kopeck from extrabudgetary funds has been  directed to the development of weaponry for two years. The sense  of seeking out extrabudgetary receipts thus is lost, and our  reserves for selling are finally being exhausted; there is  nothing with which to replace them so far.    We can sell property and hardware that has exhausted its  service life to the public. The department is flooded with such  requests. A mechanism for such sales has unfortunately not been  devised--it is not known who should do the selling, who should  receive the money, how the documents should be drawn up. The  Cabinet of Ministers has to make the appropriate decisions.    [V. Korol] Lev Mykolayovych, the question of the gathering  of  by-products that contain precious metals has not been resolved  for a long time as well. That would also be considerable funds...    [L.M. Hnatenko] For the simplest of reasons--the Ministry of  Defense did not have a structure that would be occupied with  that. A department has now been created under the weapons staff  for the gathering and processing of precious metals and  minerals. The staffers of that department have performed an  inventory of most of the units, and have developed a system for  gathering scrap that contains precious metals. A new plant was  also finally launched at Pivdenmash in May for the processing of  precious metals. I very much hope that at least some of the  funds that are received from the sale of those products will go  to the development of weaponry.    [V. Korol] The state order for 1995 is being developed at  the  Ministry of Defense today. How is it being fulfilled this year?    [L.M. Hnatenko] The Ministry of Defense formulated the state  order for 1994 in good time. The procurement of weaponry was  moreover in a certain order in the documents that were submitted  by our department, in conjunction with the Ministry of  Economics, for the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers.  But the money was not allocated for specific line items, as was  envisaged, but rather as an overall sum for everything at  once--foodstuffs, medicine, weaponry etc.; divide it up  yourselves, they said. So only eight percent of the necessary  amount was allocated for the procurement of weaponry this year.  Those appropriations, moreover, did not take into account our  debt to the defense industry for 1993. We were forced to cover  it from the budgetary funds for this year.    [V. Korol] What is the way out of the situation that has  developed?    [L.M. Hnatenko] There is one way out in this  case--additional  financing. The Ministry of Defense [MO] has sent the appropriate  documents to the Cabinet of Ministers.    Our department, despite the financial difficulties, is  already working on drawing up the state order for 1995.    [V. Korol] Have the financial difficulties also obviously  strongly affected the state of military science? Is it realistic  to hope for substantial achievements from the country's military  scientists in such a state?    [L.M. Hnatenko] The scientific potential of Ukraine,  including military, is one of the strongest in the former USSR.  It is in a pitiful state today. Appropriations of 15 percent of  the necessary amount were allocated for this year to the  Committee for Scientific Research and Experimental Design of the  MO. Those funds are moreover being received very irregularly.  And if there is no money, then the science schools will  collapse, and many design bureaus will be cut back by 30--40  percent. The outflow of scientists is 50--70 percent for  projects in high, science-intensive technologies. The number of  staffers at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine who are occupied  with military sciences has been reduced from 25 to seven percent  over the last two years. That is a catastrophe. We could lose  military science.    The Ministry of Defense is doing everything possible to see  that this does not happen. We have developed 28 programs of  scientific research and experimental design, despite all of the  difficulties. They are all directed toward the development of  weaponry and hardware.    [V. Korol] Perhaps it would be worthwhile, in that case, to  designate a few of the 28 projects as the most important ones,  and to subsidize at least those in full?    [L.M. Hnatenko] Such proposals, as you know, come from the  scientists themselves as well. That is an entirely acceptable  solution at first glance. By supporting a few collectives,  however, we risk losing the rest. Losing them forever.  Continuity, after all, is very important in science. We can  never, having ruined them, restore any special areas or science  schools.    [V. Korol] There were large proving grounds in the former  Union for trying out new models of weaponry. Where will  Ukrainian innovations be tested?    [L.M. Hnatenko] We unfortunately have available only certain  elements of scientific-research proving grounds and testing  centers, which came to us as our inheritance from the former  USSR. We want to create a unified state scientific-research  proving ground that would include all of the leading test sites.  Specialists form the Main Directorate for Science, Development  and Testing that was recently created in the Ministry of Defense  are currently engaged in the creation of a mock-up of such a  proving ground.    [V. Korol] But if we find the territory to test models of  conventional weaponry, where will we able to test missiles?  Where and when will we be able to launch the first Ukrainian  satellite?    [L.M. Hnatenko] The launch of the satellite--it will be the  SICh-1 satellite--is planned for the end of 1995 or the  beginning of 1996. It will be put into orbit by a launch vehicle  that was manufactured at enterprises in Ukraine in cooperation  with Russian plants and design bureaus. The satellite is  intended for remote sounding of the Earth. Its launch will begin  the practical realization of the national space program. The  interests of the armed forces of Ukraine will be taken into  account without fail in the fulfillment of that program as well.    There are no test ranges for the launch of satellites from  Ukraine. We thus intend to restore disrupted ties within the  confines of the CIS, and with Russia and Kazakhstan in  particular. We are making efforts, at the same time, to set up  cooperation with the space agencies of a number of European  countries.    The Ministry of Defense is planning to sign a "framework"  agreement with Kazakhstan on space. They have a cosmodrome and  we have rockets, after all. Many Ukrainians are working and  serving at Baykonur, and they once expressed the desire to  foster the realization of the Ukrainian space program.  Kazakhstan, however, as it has turned out, is not able to  maintain such a unique space facility alone. Russia, which has  leased Baykonur, could do it. If we do not arrange cooperation  on this question with Russia, the fulfillment of our program  will be much more complicated.    [V. Korol] Lev Mykolayovych, perhaps a last question. I am  convinced that we will surmount all of the difficulties and  create new weaponry for our Army. Will we be able to break into  the international market by that time?    [L.M. Hnatenko] We are not expecting a cloudless future. Our  first swallows will soon appear at international military-trade  exhibitions. A mock-up of the T-80 UD tank has been prepared,  for example, for an exhibition this summer in Saudi Arabia.  Other models are being prepared for the exhibition as well.    We are planning to launch a permanent exhibition in Kiev as  well. The location has not yet been determined--several options  are still under consideration. One of them is at Darnytsya.  Models could be seen in action there, on the proving ground of  the Darnytsya Tank Repair Plant.    We are, finally, hoping to issue a series of advertising  booklets in the very near future. Then the whole world will be  able to find out about our achievements and capabilities.</p>

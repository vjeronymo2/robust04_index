			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / A baby boom goes bust SUITE 404 in a suburban Seattle office block looks innocuous. There are tastefully-upholstered sofas, house plants, gilt table lamps. But the glass office door is locked. Neighbours are defensive. 'Have you tried knocking?' suggests the receptionist next door. 'Yes.' She remains coldly unhelpful. 'Well,' she says, 'they come and go.' In the case of the Adoption Center of Washington, the inhabitant of Suite 404, a lot more has gone than come in recent weeks. A few months ago, the agency - together with two sister organisations in Arizona and Massachusetts  -was being feted for revolutionising adoption techniques. Today, all three are mired in a financial imbroglio. More than 200 would-be adoptive couples - including some from Europe - have been stranded, having paid out upwards of Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 11,560) apiece in advance fees. Natural mothers, who had agreed to have their babies placed via these agencies, face confusion. On the regulatory side, officials can only wonder whether the hodge-podge of state rules which governs the US adoption industry even begins to suffice. Adoption is a delicate subject. But even if emotional and ethical issues are put aside, there remains a huge mismatch between supply and demand. About 1m couples in the US want to adopt. The actual number of adoptions completed annually is nearer 50,000. Costs are high. Once legal fees and contributions towards a birth mother's medical expenses are added, the outlay per baby may approach Dollars 50,000. In general, only part of the money is advanced up-front. The process can be lengthy - a year's wait is not unusual. It is against this background that the story of ACW and its sister agencies  -Southwest Adoption Center in Phoenix and Adoptions of New England in Cambridge, Massachusetts - must be viewed. Southwest, the largest, was formed in 1984 by a lawyer, Michael Sullivan. His partner, who has remained in charge of the agencies after Sullivan's departure a year ago, is James Medlock. Medlock, whose lawyer does not return calls, lives in one of Phoenix's nicer residential areas, and has been described as a 'one-time real estate developer'. According to an enthusiastic article in Forbes magazine in October, Sullivan started the business as an adjunct to his legal work, but it snowballed. From the outset, Southwest's approach was radical: it made a pro-active search for babies, advertising to birth mothers, and reportedly sending its social workers to high schools and across state lines. For several years, things went well. Although the agencies' fees were high, adopting couples seen to have been satisfied: in 1991 the Arizona agency placed 61 children. However, the Medlock/Sullivan agencies tended to operate in states in which the adoption regulations are relatively lax (or, depending on one's viewpoint, progressive). In Washington, for example, for-profit agencies are allowed; services can be advertised; and parental rights can be terminated within days of a baby's birth. Financial information about an agency is required only when it is licenced. No one seems willing to speculate on when the agencies ran into difficulties, or whether their problems stemmed from the core adoption businesses, or from other interests which their directors own. 'That's part of what we're still trying to discover,' says Julie Tolleson, an assistant attorney with the Arizona Attorney General. 'At this stage, it all seems very intertwined.' In retrospect, there may have been warning signals. It has been noted, belatedly, that both the Arizona and Washington agencies moved offices last year, while Sullivan filed for personal bankruptcy. Matters came to a head in March when Medlock sent a memorandum to clients explaining that financial problems had developed and that a moratorium on adoptions by existing client was being proposed. An 'immediate placement program' was mooted instead. Under this, new couples could pay an increased fee of Dollars 30,000 and receive a placement immediately. According to a lawsuit filed in Arizona, a couple were told in February that for a Dollars 30,000 'immediate placement' fee, they would immediately receive a new-born child. Yet, the complaint continues, this infant had already been matched with a Massachusetts couple, who had been waiting two years. Both the birth mother and the Massachusetts couple were subsequently told that the match had 'fallen through'. Complaints began to mount in all three states, and on March 23, the Massachusetts Attorney-General filed a civil action against ANEI, suspending its licence. An audit by a Boston accounting firm revealed a Dollars 900,000 deficit. The authorities also moved the ANEI business, which included a 30-strong waiting list, to the supervision of another agency. Two days later, Arizona followed, this time with a consumer fraud charge against Southwest and its non-profit affiliate, Southwest Adoption Agency. The agencies were prohibited from making any more placements or accepting new fees. Washington was last to act. It has barred the agency from taking any new monies, but - as of Monday - no legal action had been taken by the Attorney General's office and the licencing authorities were still deciding how the 75-strong waiting list should be handled. In the meantime, couples on all three lists have been struggling to group. Legal initiatives - from class actions to possible criminal charges - are being investigated. However the dust settles, an uncomfortable light has been shone on US adoption regulations. That may send warning signals to couples in Europe who have grown weary of the difficulties of adopting there. 'The fact is, there are other organisations in trouble,' says William Pierce at the National Committee for Adoption. 'The licencing laws are a patchwork'.</p>

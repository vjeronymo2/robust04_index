			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Quarto static despite lacklustre book market Quarto Group, the publishing and printing services company, saw sales advance 17 per cent at the interim stage despite a weak UK book market. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 1.67m on turnover ahead to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 19.5m). Operating profits improved to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 1.86m). Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said sales had been affected by a shortfall in the UK publishing business but, based on current order books, he expected an improvement in core publishing activities in the second half. The effect of destocking by leading UK book retailers 'had been profound' in the first six months but he believed this was temporary. Turnover in the US, which accounts for 53 per cent of total sales, had been strong, boosted by a first time contribution from Front Line Art Publishing, a California-based publisher of art prints and posters, acquired in May. Earnings per share fell from 6.4p to 4.8p, reflecting extra shares in issue following the Pounds 9.5m rights issue in September. An unchanged interim dividend of 2p is declared.</p>

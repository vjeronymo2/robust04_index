			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For multiengine normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the determination of V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is transferred from &sect;23.53(a) to proposed &sect;23.51(a) with minor changes in the specified rotation speed. For multiengine airplanes, in proposed paragraph (a)(1), the margin between rotation speed and V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  increases to 1.05 V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or a margin of 1.10 V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> S1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is established between V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and stall. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a) would define V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as the speed at which the pilot makes a control input, with the intention of lifting the airplane out of contact with the runway or water surface. This definition would apply to tail wheel and tricycle gear airplanes, seaplanes, and single-engine airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the multiengine rotation speed discussed above, proposed paragraph (a) would include rotation speeds for single-engine airplanes and seaplanes and amphibians. This proposed rule would extend V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> R <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  applicability to all part 23 airplanes to establish a safe and standardized procedure that can be used by operational pilots to achieve AFM takeoff performance. This proposed use of rotation speed is consistent with part 25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposed paragraph (b) the speed at 50 feet is based on current &sect;23.53(b) with no change in requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For commuter category airplanes, the takeoff speed requirements move from &sect;23.53(c) to proposed &sect;23.51(c) with editorial changes. The option in proposed (c)(1)(i) for an applicant to determine a V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MCG <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and establish a V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  based on V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MCG <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rather than a margin above V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MCA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is added. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.53&blank;Takeoff Performance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The heading of &sect;23.53 would be new and the content would come primarily from existing &sect;23.51. This section would now provide general takeoff performance requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would move the takeoff speed requirements of the current &sect;23.53 to &sect;23.51. (See proposal for &sect;23.51.) Proposed &sect;23.53 provides general takeoff performance requirements for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes. Proposed paragraph (a) is based on current &sect;23.51(a). Proposed paragraph (b) is a modification of current &sect;23.1587(a)(5). Proposed paragraph (c) is based on &sect;23.51(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.55&blank;Accelerate-stop Distance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise &sect;23.55 to clarify the accelerate-stop segments and to make editorial changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal would divide the accelerate-stop maneuver into three segments, rest to V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> EF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (proposed (a)(1)), V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> EF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (proposed (a)(2)), and V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to rest (proposed (a)(3)). This is not a new requirement, but it divides the total distance into three segments to be considered. The phrase, ``in the case of engine failure,'' in current &sect;23.55(a)(2) would be deleted because it would be included in proposed (a)(2). Also, the phrase, ``assuming that *&blank;*&blank;* the pilot has decided to stop as indicated by application of the first retarding means at the speed V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,'' is deleted because it is stated in proposed &sect;23.51(c)(1)(ii). The ``exceptional skill'' phrase of &sect;23.55(b)(3) would be deleted because it will remain in proposed &sect;23.45(h)(5)(i). The &sect;23.55(b) phrase ``if that means is available with the critical engine inoperative'' would be deleted because it is covered by the safe and reliable requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.57&blank;Takeoff Path <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.57 would be revised to clarify and specify which takeoff path segments must be determined in flight. Proposed paragraph (a) would clarify that the transition to the enroute configuration should be completed on or before reaching 1500 feet above the takeoff surface. In current &sect;23.57(c)(1), the slope of the airborne part of the takeoff path must be ``positive at each point''; this is changed in proposed (c)(1) to ``not negative at any point,'' to allow acceleration in level flight, which is implied by current &sect;23.61(c). A proposed editorial change to &sect;23.57(c)(3) would specify that the climb gradient ``must not be less than *&blank;*&blank;*,'' as opposed to ``may not be less than. *&blank;*&blank;*'' The option in current &sect;23.57(d) of determining the takeoff path, either by continuous demonstration or by synthesis from segments, no longer reflects current practice, nor is it entirely desirable. The only viable option in determining the takeoff path from rest to 35 feet above the takeoff surface is by a continuous demonstration. The most practical method of determining the takeoff path from 35 feet to 1500 feet above the takeoff surface is by synthesis from segments. Accordingly, proposed &sect;23.57(d) and (e) would incorporate these changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

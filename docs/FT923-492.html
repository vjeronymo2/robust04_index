			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Attention on Wall Street returns to domestic outlook WHILE currency chaos continues in a newly divided Europe, Wall Street has diverted its attention from the implications of Maastricht back to the domestic economic outlook and the presidential election. These days only the most optimistic economists or spin doctors for the Bush re-election campaign dare to place much faith in a short-term US economic recovery. Bond investors are steeling themselves for a Clinton victory and assuming this will lead to the use of more fiscal tools to jump-start the US economy. Translated into bond terms, that implies higher bond yields and lower prices in the wake of a Clinton victory. Early last week, US Treasury bond prices fell as a number of foreign central banks liquidated some of their US holdings in order to raise cash for more intervention in the foreign exchange market. However, by last Friday, the familiar flow of discouraging US macro-economic statistics triggered a rally once more, as speculation increased about the prospect of another ease in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. On Friday the Treasury bond market rallied on the back of bad economic news such as the Commerce Department announcing a drop in durable goods orders in August, the third such drop in four months. Also influencing the market was a decline in personal income in August and a 3.2 per cent fall in sales of previously owned homes. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose by  21/32 of a point on Friday, with the yield down to 7.35 per cent, compared with 7.41 per cent last Thursday. This week, the market will focus on the latest unemployment statistics, due on Friday. Depending on what the jobs data says, many traders expect Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, to look seriously at another cut in interest rates. This could bring the discount rate and Fed funds rate, now at 3 per cent, down to 2.50 per cent and 2.75 per cent respectively. An indicator that the Fed could be inclined to ease before the presidential election on November 3 seemed to come last week from pessimistic remarks made by Mr Wayne Angell, a Fed board member who has been more concerned about the return of inflation. It is striking how many serious bankers and economists still worry about the potential inflationary impact of a further rate cut when it seems apparent that the US and other western economies are hurtling through the most widespread deflationary cycle in years. But old anti-inflation prejudices take some time to vanquish, even if they now appear unrealistic. A word about buying US Treasury bonds ahead of the presidential campaign. According to bond market watchers at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the long end of the Treasury market is likely to be dominated over the next five weeks by the growing possibility that Mr Clinton will be elected. This could initially drive rates upward. The same concerns are being expressed at SG Warburg, where the view is that the five-year Treasury paper  -rather than longer maturities - looks cheapest for the time being.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines on rise in jobless insurance claims Wall Street US share prices fell across the board yesterday on more bad economic news, despite a sharp bond market rally writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.29 at 3,254.37. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 1.50 at 416.30, while the Amex composite closed 1.91 lower at 374.81 and the Nasdaq composite 4.94 lower at 578.33. NYSE turnover was 205m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 1000 to 721. After a modest early gain, shares took flight on a 15,000 rise in weekly state unemployment insurance claims. Analysts had been expecting a small decline in claims and the data immediately sparked speculation that today's employment report for September would show another big fall in non-farm payrolls. Although this might prompt another cut in interest rates, investors yesterday chose to focus on the implications of the recent data for economic and corporate earnings growth. They also ignored the big rise in bond prices, which had been sparked by the jobs claims data. The day's other piece of gloomy economic news was a sharp drop in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' September index, which fell from 53.7 to 49.0. Any figure below 50 is regarded as an indication that manufacturing business is contracting. Among individual stocks, Pennzoil jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 as investors reacted positively to Wednesday's late news that the company plans to swap 48 per cent of its Dollars 2.2bn stake in Chevron for some of Chevron's US oil and gas reserves. Chevron was also higher, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 74 1/2 . Medical Care America plunged Dollars 37 1/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 in turnover of 4.4m shares after the company said it was being sued by stockholders for making allegedly misleading comments about its revenue and earnings prospects. Another big loser was Glenfed, which dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 1 3/8 on a warning that a cash squeeze could force the company to seek bankruptcy protection over the next six months. Coleman rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 after the company said it expected third-quarter profits to exceed the 8 cents a share it earned at the same stage a year ago and revenues to top last year's third-quarter total of Dollars 82.7m. On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 in turnover of 3.5m shares after analysts at broking houses Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs lowered their estimates for the company's first-quarter net income to 15 cents a share. Software Publishing fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 7 3/4 after the company said that it will cut its workforce by 15 per cent in a restructuring programme which could cost as much as Dollars 14m. Canada TORONTO posted its fifth consecutive loss in active trading, the TSE 300 composite index falling 22.84 to 3,275.04 in volume of 30.36m shares valued at CDollars 355.9m. Declines led advances by 310 to 201. Dealers said that equities, by now, might have reflected most of the uncertainty surrounding Canada's referendum on the constitution on October 26. Carena Developments and Hees International Bancorp said a private investor had recently bought 50 per cent of Battery Park Holdings from the Reichmann family, principals in Olympia &amp; York Developments. Carena owns the other half. Carena fell 45 cents to CDollars 4.05 in light trading. Hees, which owns 23 per cent of Carena, fell CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 11 7/8 .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with correspondent Philippe Boisserie in Kigali </F> by announcer Bruno Masure in Paris--live]    [Text] [Masure] Philippe, first, can you confirm the news  from the United Nations that the troops of the Patriotic Front  really have entered the capital?    [Boisserie] Absolutely, Bruno. And the Rwandan Armed Forces  themselves have said that the soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic  Front, those who were in the center of the town and those who  this morning were on all the hills round the town, have met up.    Nevertheless, the battalions of the Rwandan Armed Forces are  still there, and they are fighting bravely back. There was very  intense fighting here late this afternoon.    [Masurer] Philippe, a certain number of French soldiers are  still in Rwanda: what exactly will their mission be?    [Boisserie] For the moment nothing has been decided about  the  350 men still here. But this evening the United Nations has  deployed a unit on the airport car park which implies that it  will replace the foreign troops who are occupying the airport  for the moment. So it will be the United Nations that takes  over from the troops. However, so far nothing has been decided.    Anyway, the Rwandan Patriotic Front has made things quite  clear: It has set a time limit of 60 hours from this morning,  the United Nations says. So by Thursday [14 April] evening they  are saying clearly that there must not be a single foreign  soldier left on Rwandan soil.</p>

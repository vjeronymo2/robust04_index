			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Leonel Matias in Maputo on the </F> "London Last Minute" program]    [Text] President Joaquim Chissano has admitted publicly for  the first time that the Mozambican Government could make use of  force against neighboring Malawi in connection with the alleged  illegal entry into Mozambican territory of armed Malawi Young  Pioneers [MYP] men, who belong to Malawi's ruling Congress  Party, MCP. This is the first such statement to have been made  by the Mozambican head of state since those Malawian youths  allegedly came into Mozambique at the end of last year and since  the two governments had met in January and agreed to cooperate  to settle the problem. Speaking to Mozambican Television,  President Joaquim Chissano had this to say:    [Begin Chissano recording] With regard to the use of force  by  us, everything depends on the outcome of those efforts to settle  the problem. If the outcome dictates the need to use force,  then it will be the country's duty to defend its territorial  integrity. I think, though, that it will not be necessary to go  that far. [end recording]    There are contradictory reports concerning the alleged entry  of armed MYP men into Mozambican territory. Some government  sources have already accused the Mozambique National Resistance,  Renamo, of giving shelter to those youths. Renamo has, however,  challenged the government to tell the United Nations where those  men are. Other reports say that those MYP men were placed in  Mozambique to be used at a later stage to destabilize Malawi,  should the ruling MCP lose. This is the first major incident  between the two countries ever since Mozambique threatened to  place missiles along the border. The Mozambican Government had  said at the time that Malawi was involved in a major Renamo  military offensive aimed at creating the so-called Republic of  Rombezia.    However, the Mozambican Government is also having a bad time  of relations with neighboring Zimbabwe. Maputo is annoyed about  the fact that the Zimbabwean Government led by Robert Mugabe,  who fought his war of independence with the support of the  Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, and later helped the  Frelimo government in its war against Renamo, should now be  giving greater attention to relations with Renamo.</p>

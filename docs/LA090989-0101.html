			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG MONEY STING TAPED BY U.S. AGENTS;  </P> <P> SOME DEPUTIES IN SKIMMING CASE SEEN HANDLING FUNDS  </P> <P> Federal agents, working a sting operation against nine Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department narcotics officers suspected of skimming drug money, last  month videotaped some of the officers as they handled money seized during a  narcotics raid, sources close to the investigation said Friday.  </P> <P> It was unclear how many members of the nine-officer narcotics team were  videotaped, but all nine participated in the raid at a San Fernando Valley  hotel, a sheriff's source said. The tape, sources said, is part of the evidence  being used in an attempt to obtain indictments in the case.  </P> <P> Eight veteran deputies and their sergeant were relieved of duty last week when  Sheriff Sherman Block and federal investigators announced that a probe begun  last October had reportedly revealed money-skimming by at least some members of  the drug unit, one of four assigned by the department to investigate "major"  narcotics cases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Separate Pouch  </P> <P> Sources who have reviewed a portion of the tape said it shows at least two  officers taking cash from a money bag and putting it in a separate pouch.  </P> <P> "The feds were using a sting and set these guys up," one source said. "They  have at least one videotape, maybe more."  </P> <P> No criminal charges have been filed in what Block described as potentially the  biggest scandal of his seven-year tenure as head of the nation's largest  sheriff's department.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department sources said Friday that federal investigators were  relying on videotapes of the sting in an effort to obtain indictments. The U.S.  attorney's office in Los Angeles had no comment Friday on whether a tape had  been shown to a federal grand jury.  </P> <P> Richard Shinee, an attorney for the union representing some of the suspended  deputies, confirmed Friday that federal authorities had taped a sting operation  in August and he had seen a portion of it.  </P> <P> Shinee would not comment on how he came to see the tape, nor would he discuss  its details, except to say the footage he saw is "inconclusive and does not  demonstrate misconduct or any wrongdoing."  </P> <P> Shinee maintained that what is shown on the tape could be explained as  legitimate money handling in a drug raid.  </P> <P> "They take money in a drug raid," he said. "They preserve evidence. That's what  they're there for."  </P> <P> The fact that the seized money is separated does not alone demonstrate  criminality, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> Shinee would not identify the deputies shown on the videotape. A sheriff's  source said the tape shows "a couple" of officers separating the money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bag on Table  </P> <P> The source, who said he saw a four-minute portion of a tape, said it showed "a  bag sitting on a table in a room."  </P> <P> "Some guys opened the bag, took some money out and then closed the bag," the  source said.  </P> <P> The narcotics officers were surprised when confronted with the tape last week,  the source said.  </P> <P> Both the Sheriff's Department and federal officials have refused comment on the  investigation.  </P> <P> The officers have been suspended pending completion of federal and county  probes. While they still receive pay, the officers have been forced to turn in  their guns and badges.  </P> <P> One federal law enforcement source has said that at least $200,000 might have  been taken during the last year by members of the unit. There was no indication  that narcotics were also stolen, officials said.  </P> <P> Lawrence Lawler, FBI agent in charge of the Los Angeles office, has explained  the suspensions by saying that some money seized in drug raids never made it to  the evidence locker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officers Named  </P> <P> The suspended officers are Sgt. Robert Sobel and Deputies Terrell H. Amers,  James R. Bauder, Nancy A. Brown, Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C.  Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner and Michael J. Kaliterna.  </P> <P> Shinee said he was unaware of any impending indictments in the case.  </P> <P> "I don't know what else they have, and I have no indications as to the timing  of any (indictments)," he said.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann, who is heading his office's review of  the case, would not comment.  </P></p>

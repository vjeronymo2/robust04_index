Ma Liesun, who was vice-chairman of the Ningxia Regional  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) and member of the Standing Committee of the  CPPCC National Committee before being arrested, was sentenced to  15 years' imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for  four years for being guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully  manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition in plotting gang  fighting.    Ma Fuli, who was associate professor at the Ningxia  Education  College before being arrested, was sentenced to life  imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for life for  being guilty of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing  guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing and commanding gang  fighting.    Ma Jie, who was a lecturer at the Northwest No. 2  Nationalities Institute before being arrested, was found guilty  of intentional murder and unlawfully manufacturing and buying  guns and ammunition in plotting, organizing and commanding gang  fighting and was sentenced to 20 years in jail with his  political rights deprived for five years.    And for the same crimes, Ma Rucheng, who was a farmer in  Xiazhai Township in Xiji County before being arrested, was  sentenced to life imprisonment with his political rights  deprived for life.    Meanwhile, 18 other criminals were sentenced to three to 14  years behind bars, and another one was released.    The gang fighting case in Xiji County was examined in open  trial earlier this month by the Guyuan Prefectural Intermediate  People's Court, which issued verdicts on February 3 and 6.    During the given period, the defendants did not appeal to  the  higher court and the procuratorial organs did not show  disagreement with the court's judgments. Accordingly, by  February 19, the verdicts became effective.    It was learned that from May 1992, Ma Liesun, Ma Rucheng, Ma  Fuli, Ma Jie and others time and again organized gang fighting  and revenge despite warnings from the local government and  Communist Party committee.    As a result, 49 people died, two are still missing and  another 30 were injured.    To prepare for gang fighting, they were also found  unlawfully  manufacturing and buying guns and ammunition. In the end, the  police confiscated 5,442 guns, of which two were for military  use, 7,362 bullets, of which 310 were for military use, 21  self-made cannons and 118 self-made shells and bombs from the  two sides involved in gang fighting.    During the trial, the defendants were found violating the  criminal law and they pleaded guilty in front of evidences.</p>

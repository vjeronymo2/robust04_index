			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Observer: Challenged Now that Arjo Wiggins Appleton has found a French replacement - Saint Gobain's Alain Soulas - for the deposed Stephen Walls, the question now is where will young Walls resurface. Presumably, after his handsome pay-offs from Plessey and Arjo he can afford to wait for the right job to turn up. After all, he is still a mere 44. It sounds like he's going to take on the chairmanship of former glamour stock Albert Fisher. He already sits on the board. It's the sort of challenge which would prove once and for all whether he's as good as he's cracked up to be.</p>

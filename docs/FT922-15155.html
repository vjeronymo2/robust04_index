			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: A thorn in the red rose's side - How Terry Fields may harm Labour WITH its opinion poll leads it may seem unlikely that Labour could lose a seat in Liverpool, but some in the party are braced for the shock. The foe in question is not the Conservatives, but the old enemy within - Militant Tendency. The battleground is Liverpool Broadgreen. Mr Terry Fields, jailed last year for not paying his poll tax and then expelled from Labour for alleged Militant links, is defending against the official Labour candidate, Ms Jane Kennedy. Labour's private fears, however, have nothing to do with a Fields victory. They are summed up by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat defender of neighbouring Mossley Hill: 'Labour's two roses are going to do their worst to each other and our Rosie is going to come steaming through the middle to win.' 'Our Rosie' is Ms Rosemary Cooper, a 41-year-old menswear buyer for Littlewoods and the Liberal Democrat candidate. She fought Knowsley North in Liverpool twice in 1987 - once at a by-election - has been a councillor in Broadgreen for 19 years and will be the next Lord Mayor of Liverpool. Mr Fields, using the motto 'A Workers' MP on a Worker's Wage', has a formidable armoury. It includes years of canvassing records, a portfolio of constituency casework, and a visibly large army of unemployed men who lost their jobs with Liverpool council during its seven-month dispute last year with town hall unions. Mr Fields knows the odds are long against any independent fighting former colleagues in a national election, but he is well-known locally and is respected for his sincerity. Many of his posters have the words 'independent' and 'candidate' in very small letters and the word 'Labour' in big ones between them. They are in traditional Labour red and yellow and are very visible in Broadgreen's streets. Ms Kennedy is relatively unknown and is hated by many of Mr Fields' supporters. An official of Nupe, the public employees' union, she gave information on Militant infiltration to the Labour party. The only certainty about Liverpool is that the Conservatives have no chance of taking any of the city's six seats. With the Tories fielding a company secretary from the south as cannon fodder, how Labour's vote splits between Mr Fields and Ms Kennedy will be crucial to the Liberal Democrats' chances. If Mr Fields reduces Labour's 49 per cent of the poll last time by 14 percentage points and the Liberal Democrats keep up their 1987 performance, Ms Cooper will win. A possible fly in Ms Cooper's ointment is that Broadgreen's independent Liberal councillor is standing, but the key will be tactical voting by Tories. Victory for Ms Cooper or Mr Fields would make Labour's national chances one seat harder, so it may be in the Conservatives' interests not to hinder Ms Cooper. The same argument applies to Mossley Hill, where Mr Alton is defending a 2,226 majority and fighting a strong challenge from Labour's Mr Neville Bann. Mr Neil Kinnock will be hoping that the fight with Mr Fields will be one of his last against the far left. As long as Mr Fields does not win, it may well be.</p>

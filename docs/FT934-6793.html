			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Babcock Pounds 9m in the red and interim omitted - Outcome hit by Pounds 21m provision for higher than expected costs at Drax and closures in Africa Babcock International, the energy contracting, facilities management and materials handling group, yesterday announced a Pounds 9.2m pre-tax loss for the six months ended September 30 and confirmed it would pass its interim dividend. The loss compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 16.6m a year earlier, but was expected following Babcock's announcement on September 9 that it would make a Pounds 20m pre-tax provision which would produce a first-half deficit. The provision emerged at Pounds 21m, and covered higher than expected costs on Babcock's Pounds 400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax power station in North Yorkshire, along with closure costs for Babcock Africa's non-core mining activities. Losses per share for the half year were 1.77p, compared with 2.02p earnings last time, when an interim dividend of 1p was paid. The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 26 1/4 p yesterday. The company maintained its cautious stance on the final dividend, repeating that a decision would be made in the light of the outcome for the year as a whole. Last year's final was 1.1p. In spite of the latest results, Mr John Parker, Babcock's new chief executive, said he was 'quite encouraged' by what he had found at the company after seven weeks in charge. The former chairman and chief executive of Harland &amp; Wolff joined Babcock on October 4, along with Mr Nick Salmon, a former GEC Alsthom executive, who is Babcock's new managing director. 'There are some very good businesses at the core of Babcock,' said Mr Parker, ' and some of them are world class.' He said the problems at Drax and in Africa had overshadowed a good performance elsewhere, but the Drax project was going extremely well, with the first two of the six sulphur absorber towers due to be handed over next month. Babcock said discussions with National Power on the final contract revenue were expected to last until completion of the contract in spring 1996, but Mr Parker said: 'I believe National Power is a satisfied customer.' Babcock's energy division, which includes the Drax contract, saw first-half profits drop from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 1.2m. In contrast, the process division, formerly known as the contractors group, boosted profits from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2.5m, and also yesterday announced Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) of oil production and refinery development contracts from customers in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. The facilities management division, which includes the management contract for the Rosyth royal dockyard in Scotland, lifted profits from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 4.2m. Materials handling performed well in spite of difficult markets, said Babcock. Profits fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.2m, reflecting rationalisation and closure costs. Babcock Africa profits were virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.4m. Babcock noted that the tax charge for the half-year was Pounds 2.6m higher than normal. While the provisions were expected to attract a full deduction for tax, in the UK they displace ACT already paid and relieved against corporation tax liabilities. COMMENT Babcock's new management team have their feet under the boardroom table but are not yet ready to make grand pronouncements - the results of their strategic review will be revealed at about the middle of next year. In the meantime caution abounds, a sensible strategy in light of the difficulties predicting the outcome of contracts such as Drax. The latest results put Babcock on course for full-year profits of between Pounds 3m-Pounds 6m pre-tax, slightly lower than some recent forecasts, and the tax implications of the provisions may even produce a small loss per share for the year. The final dividend, if it comes, may be small too.</p>

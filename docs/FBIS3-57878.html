Durao Barroso is chairing a seminar for  ambassadors, heads of missions and top-ranking Foreign Ministry  officials in Lisbon. It started this morning and will continue  tomorrow. The aim of the seminar is to define the main  objectives of Portuguese foreign policy. Human rights and East  Timor are the main concerns. Candido de Azevedo reports:    [Azevedo] The Portuguese foreign policy team has been  meeting  since this morning at Necessidades Palace [Foreign Ministry  building] with Foreign Minister Durao Barroso. For two days,  ambassadors, heads of missions and top-ranking officials will be  appraising 1993 and looking at the best way to achieve  Portugal's main diplomatic objectives in 1994.    [Begin recording] [Barroso] There are many important  sectors,  but our main battlefront, if you like, is Europe and the  European Union: To deepen the process of European union while  always affirming Portugal's permanent and specific interests in  Europe.    [Azevedo] Minister, I noticed that you paid particular  attention to the question of Timor in your speech. At the  moment is there a possibility of positive developments coming  from Indonesia?    [Barroso] As I said, it is too early to draw that  conclusion.  There was recently a positive gesture, namely the release of  seven Timorese students, but the basic question is far, very far  indeed, from being resolved. Only with perseverance and much  patience will we be able to envisage some progress in the future  regarding this matter.    [Azevedo] Minister, just one more question: The question of  Africa, namely Angola and Mozambique. At this stage of the  peace process, do you believe 1994 could see the end of the war  in these countries?    [Barroso] I do not want to make a prognosis, but I want to  express a wish, and the wish is precisely that 1994 will be the  year in which Angola and Mozambique finally find the peace their  peoples so deserve.

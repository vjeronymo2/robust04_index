			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: CSI plans relaunch as Saltire Cannon Street Investments, a name synonymous with the acquisitions fervour of the late 1980s, is to disappear from the Stock Exchange lists after a name change that accompanies a substantial acquisition and a financial restructuring. Yesterday's announcement represents a relaunch of the mini-conglomerate, whose share price has fallen from a peak of 405p in 1987 to yesterday's 13p, following a disastrous expansion policy. The company is to change its name to Saltire, to reflect the change. CSI is launching a 1-for-1 rights issue at 12p per share, raising Pounds 10.8m to fund the cash element of the Pounds 16m acquisition of Maplin Electronics, a consumer electronics distributor and retailer. CSI's existing Pounds 25.8m convertible preference shares are also being restructured, with a substantially reduced coupon. This will cut the preference dividend burden from Pounds 2.5m a year to a peak of Pounds 1.13m. Deferred preference dividends of Pounds 5m will be cancelled, although holders, primarily the Bank of Scotland, are rewarded with 20.5m new bonus shares. This enables CSI to resume ordinary dividends, and Mr Tom Long, chairman, was 'hopeful that we will pay a dividend from the 1995 results'. Maplin represents a neat fit with CSI's Altai. They source similar products, but serve a different customer base. With the combined buying power of the two companies, cost benefits should accrue immediately. Maplin is expected to make profits of Pounds 2.8m in the year to June 1995, which would put the acquisition on a prospective p/e of 9. CSI is paying Pounds 9.85m cash, Pounds 2.6m in new shares and a further Pounds 3.55m earn out, assuming Maplin hits the profit target. The enlarged group will have Pounds 27.5m of debt, representing gearing of 114 per cent, but the sale of non-core businesses would substantially reduce the figure. Maplin was 44 per cent owned by Brown Shipley Venture Capital, with the remainder held by senior management. COMMENT CSI's management is adamant that there are no more skeletons amid its residual non-core subsidiaries, and the rationale for its acquisition looks sound. Robert Fleming expects the enlarged group to make a Pounds 7.5m pre-exceptional profit in 1995, putting the shares on a p/e of 6.5. At this level, the shares look attractive, although it will take time for the management to rebuild the group's tarnished image.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / United EC puts blame on US for delay in trade talks A UNITED European Community yesterday put the US in the dock for holding up progress in the Uruguay Round world trade negotiations, and rallied behind European Commission efforts to seize the high ground in the last weeks of the seven-year-old talks. Foreign ministers of the 12 closed ranks behind a toughly worded summary of the state of the talks from Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, which described US and Japanese failure to match the EC's offer on market access and cutting industrial tariffs as the barrier to concluding the Uruguay Round by its December 15 deadline. France had been expected to raise the temperature. It is insisting on better terms on subsidised farm trade and wants to keep cinema and broadcasting out of any Gatt settlement. Instead, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, endorsed the Commission report, falling in with Brussels' tactics of turning France's aggression outwards. The Commission wants at all costs to avoid more intra-Community wrangling over Gatt, and to be able to negotiate flexibly on Europe's behalf. 'My optimism is enhanced by today,' Sir Leon said, 'in so far as there are no divisions in the Community. The Community is supporting what I'm doing.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, praised Sir Leon's tactics, and said: 'We're coming towards the end, I hope, I believe.' He estimated a deal was 85 per cent done. Sir Leon added that 'the EC has an enormous amount to gain from a Gatt agreement. We should therefore seize the initiative and keep the initiative'. He also conceded that a final European decision would, in political terms, require unanimity, although in Community treaty terms trade affairs need only a majority under the EC voting system. He was to have had talks tomorrow with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. But Washington has withdrawn from high-level contact with the EC until after the November 17 vote in Congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Sir Leon attributed lack of progress in the talks 'essentially to the American preoccupation with Nafta', which also enabled Japan to delay opening its markets for processed foods and financial services. But the EC offer to cut industrial tariffs by about half had already elicited positive responses from many other Gatt signatories, he said.

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> E. GERMANY GRANTS AMNESTY TO REFUGEES AND DEMONSTRATORS  </P> <P> East Germany today announced an amnesty for pro-democracy demonstrators and  hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled to the West in recent weeks or were  caught trying to escape since the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961.  </P> <P> The move was expected to free several thousand people from prison.  </P> <P> East German dissidents praised the action in the wake of widespread civil  unrest as an "important" step toward fulfilling promises of reform by the new  government of Egon Krenz.  </P> <P> In West Germany, however, officials were cautious, saying those pardoned should  not have been considered criminals in the first place.  </P> <P> The amnesty, announced by the official East German news agency ADN, was drawn  up by the Council of State headed by Krenz, who replaced hard-line conservative  Communist leader Erich Honecker last week.  </P> <P> Krenz has promised to introduce reform in East Germany in the face of street  protests -- and the exodus of more than 65,000 refugees to the West in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the amnesty, all refugees who have fled to the West and  those caught attempting to escape are pardoned, providing nonviolent methods  were used to reach freedom.  </P> <P> The decree makes it possible for refugees, once barred from East Germany, to  return without fear of criminal prosecution. The amnesty also applies to  everyone who fled East Germany since the Berlin Wall went up Aug. 13, 1961.  </P> <P> "Also amnestied are people who before Oct. 27 committed criminal acts against  public and state order in connection with demonstrations and meetings," an  article of the decree said.  </P> <P> But the decree said the amnesty will not cover people who had used or advocated  violence, endangered the life or health of others, or had carried firearms or  used violent methods to escape.  </P> <P> The decree applies not only to the 670,000 East Germans who have fled to the  West over the last 28 years, but also to those jailed for trying to flee across  the wall or other barriers on the East-West border.  </P> <P> Attempted escapes have been punished by prison terms ranging from two to eight  years. After release those convicted of trying to flee are often severely  discriminated against, making it difficult to find employment and apartments.  </P> <P> The decree appeared aimed at not only appeasing the tens of thousands who  demonstrate daily against the Communist government demanding reform but at  inducing many of those 65,000 who recently fled to return home. The amnesty  ends the main legal barrier blocking their return.  </P> <P> The government already has said it will help them financially should they come  back.  </P> <P> It was not known exactly how many pro-democracy demonstrators would be covered  by the amnesty. Thousands were arrested in protests Oct. 7-9 during the visit  of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, before Krenz was placed in power and  adopted a new policy of tolerance and non-interference.  </P> <P> The new government has been trying to channel demands for reform into mass  meetings at which government and Communist leaders appear.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa today publicly and directly accused Saudi  Arabia of involvement in the Yemeni war by helping the  southerners and providing weapons to them, deeming Saudi Arabia  a party to the dispute, as Yemeni Minister of Planning and  Environment 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani put it.    The northern minister said Saudi Arabia is supplying the  south with weapons it is purchasing from certain eastern  European nations, such as the Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, and  Poland via al-Mukalla Port, where southern leader 'Ali Salim  al-Bid is staying.    Al-Iryani said the Sanaa Government has conclusive evidence  that al-Bid is being supplied with weapons -- which he described  as limitless -- from Saudi Arabia.    The Gulf Cooperation Council states, except for Qatar, have  implicitly recognized the Democratic Republic of Yemen  proclaimed by al-Bid two weeks after the eruption of battles.    The northern official also revealed that the contacts made  by  Sanaa with some of the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] in the south have failed. This shows, in his opinion,  that the politicians in the south no longer have any influence  on military affairs. He added that Lakhdar Brahimi, the special  envoy of the UN secretary general, did not propose anything new  in his talks with officials in Sanaa and was satisfied with the  suggestions made in the international resolution on Yemen.  However, Sayf Sa'il, member of the YSP Political Bureau, said  in Aden that he was optimistic about Brahimi's efforts, saying  the main purpose of the mission is to enact a cease-fire because  negotiations can never achieve anything as long as there is no  cease-fire.    The two parties are still divided over how to monitor the  cease- fire. The northerners want a joint military committee to  be formed. The southerners, however, insist on deploying  international observers. This prompted al-Iryani to say that  the southerners want to internationalize the crisis.    Northern Yemeni Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ghanim said the  southerners' demand for international disengagement troops is  open aggression against Yemen's sovereignty and independence.  Ghanim cast doubt on the credibility of the United Nations,  which, he said, uses double standards and adopts its resolutions  without heeding the right of peoples and countries to bar  interference in their internal affairs. Ghanim said there are  parties that support the position of the rebels. He said: We  find it strange for these parties to offer such support and we  ask them to stop it because it leads to more bloodshed, as he  said.</p>

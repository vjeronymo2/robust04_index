			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-SOONERS PLAYER GETS 3-MONTH TERM  </P> <P> Former Oklahoma cornerback Jerry Parks began serving a nearly three-month jail  sentence today after pleading no contest to a charge he shot and wounded  teammate Zarak Peters.  </P> <P> Parks surrendered to the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office after being  sentenced by District Judge Preston Trimble, who also gave him a five-year  deferred sentence, with two years of supervised probation.  </P> <P> "I would like to apologize to my family, to Zarak Peters and to the university  for this tragic incident," Parks said in a brief statement to reporters after  sentencing. He declined to answer questions.  </P> <P> Parks also was ordered to pay the medical expenses of Peters, who was shot in  the chest during an argument in the athletic dormitory Jan. 13.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Joel Barr said it was not a lenient sentence. "I don't think  the court went easy on him at all."  </P> <P> Trimble ordered Parks held in Cleveland County Detention Center until Aug. 4, a  date Barr said was chosen to give Parks time to enroll in another school. He  said Parks is considering three or four schools, but he declined to name them.  </P> <P> "He wants to go back to college to play football," the lawyer said.  </P> <P> Trimble told Parks that he was lucky he wasn't charged with homicide.  </P></p>

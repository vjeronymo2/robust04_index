			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Brussels, March 21 (AFP) -- NATO Monday [21  March] demanded that Bosnian Serbs relinquish heavy weapons  found inside the exclusion zone around Sarajevo or face  airstrikes.    UN peacekeepers Sunday [20 March] discovered Serb tanks and  other heavy armament within the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion  zone imposed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization around  the Bosnian capital last month.    A NATO spokesman said that the United Nations Protection  Force [UNPROFOR] was involved in negotiations with the Serbs to  settle the issue.    "We expect these weapons to be put under UNPROFOR control  immediately as has been the case with other weapons in the  exclusion zone," the spokesman said, adding: "Uncontrolled heavy  weapons within the exclusion zone remain subject to NATO  airstrikes in accordance with NATO's February 9 decision."    On that day NATO issued an ultimatum threatening airstrikes  if the parties to the conflict -- Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian  Government forces -- did not withdraw their heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo or put them under UN control.    UNPROFOR said Sunday's discovery of four tanks, three  anti-aircraft guns, four 105mm howitzer and 18 mortars was a  "big violation" of the UN demilitarization plan. [passage  omitted]</p>

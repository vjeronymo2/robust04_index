			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment famine blights Filipino mining outlook - The high price being paid for the country's high-risk reputation THE PHILIPPINES' mining industry is paying dearly for its inability to attract development capital for over a decade now. Total value of mineral production declined last year by 14 per cent to 20.65bn pesos (Pounds 575m), according to the Bureau of Mines and Geosciences. It blames the fall on low metal prices, increased operating costs and 'poor access to replacement capital'. Copper concentrates output dropped by 8.9 per cent to 521,258 tonnes, which was also only half the annual production achieved in the early 1980s. Gold output declined 12 per cent to 22.7 tonnes the lowest level since 1980. Chromite production also slumped while nickel output was marginally higher. Mining officials say the outlook for the next five years remains bleak, and the industry is likely to miss out on any recovery from the current slowdown in world metals markets. 'Because we have not developed any new ore bodies in the past decade there is nothing to work on,' explains Mr Joel Muyco, director of the mines bureau. He says that risk capital in the local mining sector has been scarce because the country has been considered a high-risk area since the early 1980s in view of the local political and economic crises. Perceptions of instability have countered the attractions of the country's huge proven reserves of such minerals as copper, gold, chromite and nickel. In terms of resource endowment (which indicates the potential for discovering an ore body) the country continues to rank among the highest in Asia. 'When the good times come, we have no new ore bodies to offer,' says Mr Muyco. Much of the available risk capital is now moving towards other mineral-rich countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Chile. The Philippines hopes to attract these capital flows, however, with a new Mining Code that allows 100 per cent foreign equity in a local mining venture. This is actually contained in an executive order issued in 1987 by Mrs Corazon Aquino, the former president. Unfortunately, most foreign investors continue to be hesitant because the Aquino order was issued a few months before the country adopted a new constitution, which, among other provisions, limited the exploitation of natural resources to companies with majority Filipino interests. Mr Fidel Ramos, the new president, is set to sign 'any day now' the first financial and technical assistance agreement under the new mining code, according to Mr Muyco. The scheme allows foreign operators to undertake minerals exploration for their own account, instead of acting as service contractors for local groups. They are required to spend a minimum of Dollars 50m, and to reduce their holdings to 40 per cent after recovering their original investments, which could take 18 to 20 years. The first financial and technical assistance agreement authorises Arimco of Australia to explore for copper and gold in a 30,000-hectare (75,000-acre) area in Nueva Vizcaya province in Luzon. A second, with Western Mining of Australia, is already lined up for approval.</p>

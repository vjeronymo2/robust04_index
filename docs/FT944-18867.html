			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Testing journey to the party's roots: Tony Blair, UK opposition leader, needs to prove Labour shares his policies Mr Tony Blair has a straightforward task next week. He must demonstrate he can command the party he was elected to lead. When he has done that, he can begin the tougher job of making Labour safe for government. Since his leadership victory in July, he has chosen to address a wider audience than the activists gathering in Blackpool for their annual conference. The voters of middle England have been told that here is a Labour leader they can trust. Mr Blair understands economic realities; he is no friend of yobs or criminals; he cares more about discipline than political correctness in the classroom. The prospectus has been an attractive one. The unusually kind (occasionally gullible) media have applauded his youthful self-confidence. The Conservatives have been wrong-footed, unsure whether to attack him directly or to concentrate their fire on the unreconstructed socialists lurking in the shadows. But the new leader has to show that a message tailored to the aspirant classes of southern England has the consent - let alone the enthusiasm  - of his party's activists. After 15 years in the political wilderness, its leadership has rid Labour of the self-indulgent extremism which ensured the electoral defeats of the 1980s. At its roots, though, many prefer still the party's heart to its head. The activists cling to the comfortable certainties of postwar Labourism. An inviolate welfare state, a tax system that redistributes wealth and a privileged place in society for the unions head the list of cherished icons. Mr Blair comes as a stranger to the culture of activism. Despite his overwhelming leadership victory over Mr John Prescott and Mrs Margaret Beckett, he is better known in the media than within his own party. His spell after the 1992 general election as home affairs spokesman gave him a profile as a politician who preferred the instincts of the respectable working classes to those of the liberal intelligentsia in shaping his approach to crime. But unlike Mr Neil Kinnock or Mr John Smith, he has never been a party insider, a politician at home in the smoke-filled rooms in which Labour traditionally has done its business. Even among many Labour MPs the unclubbable Mr Blair is an unknown quantity. More than one shadow spokesman has sought the advice of journalists at Westminster on how they should approach the new leader. Some on the far left are already talking the familiar language of 'betrayal'. There are mutterings higher up in the party about the leader's habit of reinterpreting in interviews long-cherished policies. The traditionalists in the unions will be looking for the moment to reassert their influence. During the conference debate on the economy they will test his commitment to a minimum wage. Leadership pledges to spend only what the nation can afford do not win cheers at Labour conferences. Mr Blair has sought to anticipate the critics. His strategy has been to use the leadership honeymoon to seize as much ground as possible for the modernising cause. In spite of their different backgrounds and one or two private differences, Mr Prescott has proved a loyal deputy. So the Labour leader hijacked a routine press conference on education policy to emphasise his sympathies lay with the concerns of parents rather than with the narrow interests of the teaching unions. He also shunted Mr Larry Whitty out of the post of general secretary at Labour's Walworth Road headquarters. Mr Whitty was too close to the old, traditionalist guard. Then there were the carefully scripted home truths delivered to the Trades Union Congress in Blackpool. His declaration that there would be no favours for the unions was followed by a shift in policy on Ireland to tilt the party away from its traditional attachment to the nationalist cause. This week was chosen to stake out his territory on the economy. Statist solutions were no longer relevant. Nor were the old divisions between private and public sectors. A Labour government would not seek to spend its way to prosperity. Crucially, the party's social ambitions could not be met by pushing up taxes. A better health service and help for the poor could be delivered only through economic growth. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, reinforced the message with an exhaustive review of the constraints imposed by the realities of international competition and technological change. In some ways the symbolism was more important than the substance. Mr Blair is not willing yet to talk in detail about tax and spending. Mr Kinnock and Mr Smith before him had already jettisoned much of the ideological baggage. But the terms of Mr Blair's enthusiastic embrace of the market economy made it sound like he meant it. So the party will discover in Blackpool that it has ditched 50 years of attachment to the fatally seductive vision of a socialist paradise created by pulling a few economic levers or nationalising half a dozen industries. Mr Blair has to start putting something in its place. The Labour leader, we are told, has some answers. His speech in the Empress Ballroom on Tuesday afternoon, the most important of his political life, will start to fill the vacuum. It will offer a programme to modernise industry and create a competitive economy; and a nation at work not on benefit. An education and training revolution and a willing partnership between public and private sectors rather than old-fashioned demand management will provide the instrument of change. The promise of economic competence and social improvement will be accompanied by Mr Blair's new emphasis on social responsibility. A commitment to the notion of society involves an equivalent determination to stamp out antisocial behaviour. It also means higher standards in government and the replacement of quangos with accountable democracy. He calls this ethical socialism. A more accurate description is social democracy. The basic judgment (shared incidentally by many senior Conservatives) is that the election will be won by the party which promises opportunity and security in a turbulent, unpredictable world. The overwhelming advantage that Mr Blair has over his predecessors is that his ideas match his image. He looks and sounds modern, reasonable, intelligent. This week's opinion polls have underlined the strength of his position - and the potential market for his message. But the language of principles is not enough. Mr Blair has to offer substance if he is to provide definition to the sometimes vague rhetoric. He must convince us also that his party's policies are indistinguishable from his own.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Excerpts] Minsk, 9 Jun -- "Being an enormous Eurasian  state with a history and ideology of an empire, Russia has  always been, is now, and ever will be the enemy of Belorussia's  [Belarus] independence and of our freedom, whatever disguise it  may be wearing," maintains Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the  Belorussian People's Front [BPF], who is competing for the post  of the first president of the Republic. An interview with him  appeared today in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIA.    At the same time, the BPF leader is promising that if he  wins  the elections scheduled for 23 June, he will adhere to a  "friendly but firm policy" in relations with Russia, and is by  no means going to force Russians out of the republic. [passage  omitted]    The other five candidates for the presidential post  associate  the future of Belorussia with close and warm relations with  their "eastern neighbor."</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Competitiveness and currencies A booklet with the unpromising title Measuring International Price and Cost Competitiveness by Philip Turner and Jozef Van't dack, and published by the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, is the most revealing international economic detective story I have seen in years. It sheds some light on the upsurge in sterling. This has now recovered nearly three-fifths of the ground it lost against the D-Mark at its lowest point after leaving the ERM. But even for those of us who believe in taking the exchange rate fully into consideration in monetary policy, this does not establish a case for a unilateral UK interest rate cut. The main pressures on sterling in 1992 did not come from uncompetitiveness against the D-Mark or other continental currencies, but against the dollar. But the other and even bigger pressure came from the market's perception that the need to combat the domestic recession would make it impossible to hold British short-term interest rates at anywhere near the very high levels then prevailing in Germany. The British economy now needs a period of above-trend growth to take up slack. But the December labour market figures suggest that this is already happening, and that not only the mainstream forecasts but even the official estimates of recent production performance are understated. To cut UK interest rates unilaterally would not only over-egg the domestic pudding, but could look provocatively like beggar my neighbour. The main messages emanating from the BIS concern, however, the D-Mark and the dollar. There is a large query over German competitiveness, which was once regarded as a yardstick for the rest of the world. Another conclusion is that the US has had a fantastically easy ride in the international economy and has no excuse for blaming the rest of the world for its own social and economic problems. The route to these conclusions is through an analysis of 'competitiveness'. The word is sometimes used in ambitious and mind-boggling ways to express every aspect of a country's economic and even moral performance. It is used in the BIS study for the more quantifiable aspects of a country's price and cost performance in international markets. As such it means the same as the real exchange rate - that is the nominal rate, as it is quoted in the press, adjusted for price and cost changes. Estimating a real exchange rate or competitiveness index is not simple. The first chart shows why there have been such radically different assessments in the case of Germany. Judged by consumer prices or even export prices, the German real exchange has been remarkably stable. But as the BIS points out, world competition makes it difficult for manufacturers of traded products to move very far from international going prices. The effects of high costs are felt in pressures on margins, as shown by German corporate agonies. The BIS regards the labour cost measure as the least unreliable; and it is careful to count in not only pay, but all labour overheads. The fact that competitiveness is now an issue is shown by the strenuous efforts of the Bundesbank in its December monthly report to rebut the case for D-Mark devaluation (yes, devaluation). The origins of German uncompetitiveness go back to the boom of the late 1980s, aggravated by the overheating of the economy in the early stages of unification. German inflation is now all but licked. A sign of the times is the west German chemical workers' settlement, equivalent to an annualised increase of 1 1/2 per cent - below the headline inflation consumer price rise of 3.7 per cent, which has itself been swollen by tax increases. Even more important, the agreement that long-term unemployment workers can be hired at 90 per cent of basic pay rates, shows the first beginnings of a new willingness to price the jobless into work, and to formalise the difference between insiders and outsiders. Nevertheless the result of past excesses is now built into the German cost structure. Some other European countries which the BIS had reckoned to be uncompetitive improved their position when the narrow ERM exploded. But this left Germany all the more high and dry. The continuing depreciation of the D-Mark against the yen has been the main alleviating force. But there has been no depreciation against the dollar, taking the last four years together, but simply a series of V shapes. The French franc, like most of the currencies of the EU core, has stayed close to the D-Mark. Indeed the franc has this winter passed the DM3.43 barrier and re-entered the old narrow ERM band. Nor have the monetary results been the disaster that the opponents of shadowing the D-Mark had hoped. Short-term interest rates, at around 6 per cent, are little more than half a percentage point above the UK's, as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur reminds British visitors. Moreover French costs are lower than Germany's at current exchange rates. The BIS estimates that last October German unit labour costs were 70 per cent above American ones, while French costs were 40 per cent higher, British costs 25 per higher and Italian costs only 7 per cent above. Why then has France lagged behind the UK in economic recovery? Partly because the UK was able to make a sharp early start in reducing interest rates; and partly because the pound became moderately undervalued. The UK could only get away with its effective devaluation because the ERM departure was a market event, unplanned and undesired. The latest sterling upsurge suggests the tantalising possibility that the pound may follow the franc in approaching its old ERM floor against the D-Mark. Nevertheless, sterling is still 10 per cent down on its trade weighted average, compared with August 1992, thanks to the appreciation of the dollar and the yen. That appreciation could have further to go. The clear message from all the different BIS computations is that the dollar is still very cheap on any comparison of labour costs or prices of internationally traded products. This fact might increase the case for a concerted reduction in European interest rates, perhaps timed to coincide with the much discussed next Fed tightening. But attempts by European countries to gain or preserve competitive advantages against each other should be avoided at all costs.</p>

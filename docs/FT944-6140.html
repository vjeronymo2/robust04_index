			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Finnair raises FM500m Finnair, the Finnish national carrier, plans to raise about FM500m (Dollars 103.3m) through an offer of up to 12m new shares to domestic and international investors. Proceeds will be used to buy second-hand McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft to replace its DC-9 fleet. The five-year investment programme is worth about FM1.7bn. The state will not participate in the issue, cutting its holding to 60.9 per cent (57.5 per cent after full dilution) from 71.5 per cent (66.9 per cent after dilution). Kleinwort Benson is global co-ordinator for the issue. Neste, the Finnish oil and petrochemical group, is also selling part of its stake in Finnair. In the half-year to September 30 the airline reported a better than expected pre-tax profit of FM298.9m, up from FM95.3m last time.</p>

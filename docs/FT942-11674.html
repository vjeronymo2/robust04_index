			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (14): The left's confidence is growing - Political puzzle, despite recent polls, many east Germans admit that they will cast their votes differently in the ten local government and state elections, culminating in the federal elections in October The east German economy is only 9 per cent of Germany's total Gross Domestic Product, but its population represents a fifth of the country. The question in the federal elections to be held next October is whether east Germany will hold the national balance of power. The most recent poll by Ipos, the Mannheim-based Institute for Social Research, suggests that the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) coalition will not win if it fails to improve its standing in eastern Germany. However it is slowly clawing back some of its lost support. An Ipos poll last December showed the CDU with 32 per cent of the vote in the west and 22 per cent in the east; the SPD with 45 per cent and 38 respectively; and the FDP, 5 per cent and 6 per cent. But by April 22, the CDU's standing improved both in western and eastern Germany. In the west it increased to 39 per cent, in the east, to 24 per cent; the SPD lost ground, falling to 41 per cent in the west but increasing in the east to 40 per cent. The FDP, the junior coalition, had fallen to 4 per cent in the west and 3 per cent the east. The PDS, the reformed successor party of the former ruling east German Socialist Unity or communist party, which is based in the east, continues to make ground, rising by 2 percentage points between December and April to 16 per cent; the Bundnis 90/Greens have 11 per cent in the west and 9 per cent in the east. 'The CDU will have to make a big push and really improve in the east if it wants to be returned to office,' said Mr Matthias Jung, head of Ipos. Clearly, the economy, particularly unemployment, will be the main issue upon which the election will be fought. In the east unemployment accounts for 16.8 per cent, or 1.2m of the labour force. But if, as economists forecast, west Germany is emerging from the recession, it could have a positive spin-off for investments in eastern Germany, besides improving the general level of confidence, and boosting Chancellor Kohl's chances. On a different level, other polls indicate that east Germans seem less angry and disappointed than they were a year ago with the consequences of unification. But would this benefit the present coalition? Officials from the five eastern states believe that the easterners will register an anti-Kohl vote, but perhaps not on the federal level - 'I may be wrong,' said one senior official from the state of Saxony, which is CDU, 'but I think that the incumbents will suffer on the state level in order to register an anti-Kohl vote. After all, four of the five states have CDU prime ministers.' However, he and other officials said that on the federal level, the CDU might scrape in because 'although the easterners may not like Kohl, they know him and they link him with achieving unification. Rudolf Scharping (the head of the SPD) is still an unknown quantity.' Many east Germans admit that they will cast their votes differently in the nine local government and state elections, culminating in the federal elections in October. They say the local government elections will be based on local issues; personalities will play an important part on the state level; and how they vote on the federal election will depend on how urgently they want a change of government in Bonn. They also make two other points. First, they increasingly realise that there are now no quick answers to unemployment or restructuring. And since the massive transfers from the west cushion the unemployed and subsidise consumer spending, they are slowly coming to accept the extraordinary depth of social, political and economic changes. Second, they are still unsure about what the SPD stands for, unlike the CDU, or for that matter the PDS, which according to opinion polls could win at least 16 per cent and even pass the 5 per cent threshold needed to enter the Bundestag or parliament through getting three candidates directly elected. Yet none of the established parties, with the exception of the PDS, can rely on membership in the east to help in the campaign. By the end of last year, the CDU had a total of 83,794 members in eastern Germany, 10,000 fewer than the previous year; the SPD's 25,000 members rose by 200; the FDP is hovering at around 35,000, after falling from 100,000 in 1990; the PDS has 131,000 members, a drop of 16,000 over the same period. 'The low party membership is worrying,' said the Saxon official. 'But what concerns us most is that the east could matter, if, in the west, both political parties are neck and neck at the opinion polls by next October but the CDU has not moved from its current 24 per cent level in the east. 'Everyone will then start counting the numbers in the east. They would be very unwise to neglect the region until then.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   THE FIRST ALL-GERMAN ELECTIONS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The first federal elections took place on December 2, 1990. The average percentage of vote among the five eastern states was:   Christian Democratic Union, CDU: 42.1 per cent.   Free Democrats, FDP: 13 per cent.   Party of Democratic Socialism, PDS: 10.3 per cent.   Bundnis 90/Green Party: 5.9 per cent. The average percentage vote for the whole of Germany was:   CDU 43.8 per cent.   FDP 11.0 per cent.   Greens: 3.8 per cent.   Republicans: 2.1 per cent.   Others, including PDS: 5.7 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

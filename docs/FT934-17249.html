			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: US issuance records broken US corporations issued record amounts of new debt and equity during the third quarter as the lowest interest rates in 30 years continued to fuel Wall Street's unprecedented surge in underwriting business. According to Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial information group, US companies sold Dollars 285.5bn of stock and bonds between July and September, up from Dollars 232.5bn in the same period a year earlier. The biggest increase in volume by category was in common stock issuance, which jumped to Dollars 24.4bn from Dollars 14.5bn a year ago, due primarily to buoyant US share markets and heavy demand for equities from yield-starved investors. Initial public offerings, or flotations of new companies, accounted for Dollars 13. bn. The volume of investment-grade debt issues rose 22 per cent to Dollars 94.9bn, while the volume of mortgage- and asset-backed securities issued increased to Dollars 141.8bn from Dollars 120.9bn a year ago. The market for new high-yield corporate debt, or junk bonds, remained active in the quarter, with volume climbing 18 per cent to Dollars 12.6bn. The capital markets were busy in the third quarter. Tensions within the European Monetary System prompted a decline in interest rates across Europe, and attracted record amounts of new debt and equity to the markets. A total of Dollars 93.4bn in Eurobonds and international equities were issued in the quarter, up from Dollars 56.6bn a year earlier. Wall Street firms continued to cash in on increased capital raising , earning Dollars 2.2bn in fees during the quarter. Merrill Lynch again dominated the rankings, earning Dollars 470.6m. Goldman Sachs retained its runner-up position, while Kidder, Peabody leapfrogged Lehman Brothers and CS First Boston to take the third spot. In total, Dollars 1,100bn in new debt and equity has been raised on the world's financial markets so far this year, surpassing 1992's total.</p>

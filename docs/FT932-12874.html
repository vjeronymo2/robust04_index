			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Bank to set up shop in east Europe THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will adopt a more decentralised approach towards helping the former communist countries of Europe and the former Soviet Union develop market economies, Mr Jacques Attali, the EBRD president, said yesterday. Reporting on a closed meeting of the EBRD board of governors, Mr Attali said this was a turning point in the bank's operations. It is intended to make its activities more visible and understandable in the countries in which it operates. Instead of taking all decisions from its London headquarters, the EBRD would establish local institutions, most probably in partnership with governments or private sector companies. It is likely that the new philosophy will be applied in policies to help create small and medium sized companies in the former communist states. Two plans will be developed in the months ahead. A Dollars 300m (Pounds 195m) fund to be administered by the EBRD, proposed at the recent meeting of Group of Seven finance and foreign ministers in Tokyo. This would take equity stakes in small and medium sized enterprises in Russia. A national development bank for Russia. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and chairman of the EBRD board, suggested that this could be modelled on the German Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau that helped in the reconstruction of West Germany after the second world war.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo feels growing pressure on top-selling drugs A steady improvement in profits at Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday threatened to be overshadowed by growing market pressure on some of its top selling drugs. While showing a 10 per cent increase in full-year profits, the UK group admitted that at constant exchange rates its performance had been held back by slowing sales growth from products such as Zofran - used to treat nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy - and Ventolin, its long-established anti-asthma drug. Even Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, failed to keep pace with growth in the anti-ulcer market of 11 per cent in the year to June 30. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, said a number of drugs were facing challenges from cheaper generic rivals, while pricing pressures had also seen the group lose sales in some important markets, including Germany, France and Japan. 'We have seen slower growth rates and some markets will continue to be difficult,' he warned. 'But things are still moving in the right direction and we will continue to support our best-sellers.' Of those top products, Zantac continued to dominate - - accounting for 43 per cent of total turnover - and Sir Richard predicted further progress if approval was secured for over-the-counter sales. The group's overall market position would also be strengthened by the success of its five fastest growing products. While only accounting for 10 per cent of total turnover last year, these products enjoyed average sales growth of 161 per cent. That improvement was led by Imigran, its migraine treatment, which doubled sales to Pounds 243m. And, although revenues were adversely affected by government healthcare reforms in some European countries, Glaxo's overall rise in turnover exceeded market growth. Meanwhile, costs were cut over the year as spending on marketing and administration fell from 36.4 per cent to 34.8 per cent as a proportion of turnover.</p>

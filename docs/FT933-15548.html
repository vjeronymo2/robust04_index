			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hope of accord on block vote recedes OPPORTUNITIES for comp-romise between the Labour party and the unions over internal party democracy appeared to recede yesterday as Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, reaffirmed his commitment at the annual conference of the Transport and General Workers Union to the 'simple principle' of one-member-one-vote. Mr Smith told the conference that the principle must apply to the selection of parliamentary candidates, but side-stepped the issue of union involvement in the election of the party's leadership. Mr Smith last week indicated that he would consider a deal which allowed the continued participation of unions in an electoral college for the selection of leader. Such a compromise was flatly rejected by Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, speaking yesterday after Mr Smith's address. 'I don't think that we are in the business of trading off one part of our members' democratic rights for another,' he said. The GMB, another of the large unions opposed to the Labour leadership's plans, has already made known its rejection of the deal. The scene now looks set for a damaging split between the two wings of the party at Labour's autumn conference. Unless Mr Smith can drive a wedge between the unions opposed to reform, he faces a defeat: unions control 70 per cent of the votes at Labour's conference. Mr Smith told the TGWU conference that there was 'no question of breaking the historic links' between Labour and the unions. He added, however: 'We should not be afraid of modernising our relationship.' The word 'modernise' was greeted by a few shouts of 'rubbish' from the audience, although, overall, the Labour leader's speech was well received by the 700 delegates. Mr Morris said afterwards that he did not think Mr Smith's speech had 'changed many minds in the conference'. One delegate said the Labour leader should remember 'the trade unions started Labour, not the other way round'. The union is likely to vote overwhelmingly today for a motion against reducing trade union input into Labour's decision-making procedures. Referring to a scheme which would offer cut-price party membership to trade unionists who paid the political levy, Mr Smith appealed for union members to join the party as full individual members. This was not just the democratic way forward, but would be a 'new source of energy and strength', he said. Mr Morris said later: 'We must not confuse proposals to increase Labour party membership with the rights of trade unions within the Labour party constitution.'</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Property: A dormitory for the world - Look behind Surrey's suburban facade and you will find that plenty of attractive countryside remains THINK OF Surrey and you might bring to mind the Oval, home of the county cricket club with its base in south London next to a gas tank. Or the annual university boat race, with either Oxford or Cambridge taking the Surrey station. Or the chalky North Downs that form Surrey's natural frontier with the sticky clay of the Sussex Weald to the south. Or commuters . . . In the last century, the railways turned Surrey from a place of farms and market towns into a dormitory for London. Cars continued the work, bringing arterial roads and ribbon development. Now, set between Heathrow and Gatwick airports, it is a dormitory for the whole world. But look again. It is extraordinary how much countryside survives. Between the old and new Surreys is the county of architect Edwin Lutyens and garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. Many of his houses are expanded cottages, built in the traditional materials of south-east England. He loved the mixture of half-timbering and brick, with lots of wood indoors, leaded lights in windows and hanging tiles as a wall cladding (there originally to stop rain destroying the fill between the timbers). Indeed, the pull and the sense of comfort these materials exude have been so strong that thousands of 19th and 20th century houses in the county use them. For mansion or shed, the cottage style predominates. And it is hard to tell the age of a house. Are the bricks 1930 or 1630? A common answer in Surrey is that you can get both. Demand for houses has picked up this year - a problem, since there have not been enough suitable properties available. This has meant slightly firmer prices - 'an increase of 3-5 per cent,' according to Michael Parry-Jones, of agent Browns - and some very quick sales. James Wilson, of search consultant Wilson &amp; Wilson, attributes the renewed interest in Surrey to prices being at pre-1987 levels. Despite this, September was not so busy as agents had hoped. One Lutyens' house for sale is The Old Barn outside the village of Holmbury St Mary. He was not yet 30 when he converted the barn - which had been brought from Slinfold in Sussex - and gave it an almost vice-regal drawing room (although at hill station level, not his later New Delhi grandeur). He even conjured a small room between the backs of the two chimney hearths. The stone slab roof is vastly solid, and it has a good garden. Browns in Cranleigh is asking Pounds 495,000. A superb garden, but one for serious gardeners only - it has part of the National Collection of magnolias - is Tilgates, near Reigate. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley is asking Pounds 600,000 for the house and seven acres of garden. The same agent is seeking Pounds 1m for Reel Hall, near Guildford, with beams and inglenooks galore; and offers over Pounds 820,000 for Crocknorth House (knapped flint and brick) near East Horsley, with a stable cottage and 12.5 acres in an official area of outstanding natural beauty. Barnfield, at Dunsfold, is a small estate (74 acres) for Pounds 1.25m (from Hamptons). In Shamley Green, Hill Clements is selling Timbers (the house has them) near the cricket field and duck pond for Pounds 400,000. For over Pounds 500,000 there is Tangley Way, a 1920s' traditional house at Blackheath, near Guildford; while the Cherry Tree Cottage in Holmbury St Mary, thatched and dating from the 1930s, costs Pounds 245,000 from the same agent. Worplesdon is famous for its golf club. Houses for sale in the district from Hamptons include: Bridley Manor, a fine example of Tudoresque (offers over Pounds 1.5m). Nortons Farm, which goes back to the 17th century but now has electronic gates, a stable yard, loose boxes and 13.5 acres (for Pounds 725,000,). The Old Mill House, a Georgian brick box defiantly not in the traditional style. In an era of mock-Victorian conservatories, it is a joy that it has an original Victorian greenhouse. Price: Pounds 500,000. The Manor House in Bletchingley is also Georgian, but the property has been divided. Price: Pounds 300,000 (from Savills). Near Haslemere, the same agent has Stedlands Farm, listed Grade II and basically 17th century, for around Pounds 650,000. At nearby Linchmere, the 1937 Queen Anne-style Gillhams House is going for Pounds 725,000 (Hamptons), and the adjacent Gillhams Farm for Pounds 800,000 (Savills); this includes a cottage made out of a tithe barn. In Ockley, between Dorking and Horsham and close to Sussex, Lane Fox is selling Elderslie House, which has a cedar tree on the front lawn and is almost opposite the village cricket pitch, for Pounds 400,000. At Ripley, close to the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Savills offers Dunsborough Park, basically Georgian, with 62 acres for Pounds 1.45m; and Hamptons has the traditional Home Wood Farm in a price range of Pounds 625,000-675,000 for the main lot which includes plenty of farm buildings. The other lots are fields, some already under offer for grazing. Two intriguing houses to finish. The Moat House in Guildford is a castellated Victorian coach house, gloriously Gothic with a garden probably laid out in the 1840s as part of the Weycliffe Pleasure Gardens. The price for this hidden gem is around Pounds 350,000 (from Browns). In Merstham, two miles from Redhill, the vendor himself is selling the 1925 Knockando Manor, designed by the Scottish architect Louis Beaton McDonald. Much of it McDonald built himself, using fireplaces from older houses and front doors from a City bank. Its deep pink colour reminds one of Scandinavia, where he is said to have built the first 'spaghetti junction' in Oslo. Inquiries: 0737-643171.

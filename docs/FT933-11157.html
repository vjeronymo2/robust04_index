			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Norwegian medical group ahead at halfway HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products, yesterday reported a slight increase in first-half pre-tax profits to NKr782m (Dollars 106.4m) from NKr757m, but said it may double the dividend. 'The board will consider increasing the dividend per share for the current financial year by up to twice last year's distribution, bringing the payout ratio into line with other pharmaceutical companies,' Hafslund said. The company paid a total of NKr2.20 a share last year. Group sales improved by NKr175m to NKr2.793bn for the six months, following an increase in royalties to NKr361m from NKr72m. Operating expenses increased by NKr34m to NKr1.797bn. Operating profit fell by NKr101m to NKr741m, including research and development costs of NKr361m against NKr341m last year. However, Hafslund said that operating profit - once it had been adjusted for the shipping business spun off last year into a separate bourse-listed company - had risen by 2 per cent.</p>

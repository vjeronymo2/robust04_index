			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR CHINESE, TIME STOPPED JUNE 4, '89, A DAY OF INFAMY;  </P> <P> CHINA: A YEAR AFTER TIAN AN MEN SQUARE, THE CURRENTS OF DISCONTENT AMONG THE  PEOPLE RUN SWIFT AND DEEP. THE LEADERS HAVE LOST LEGITIMACY.  </P> <P> I had last been at the Shanghai Airport in 1979. Not much has changed. The  baggage claim area is dark and dingy. Young men in military uniforms wander  about arguing, having nothing else to do.  </P> <P> As soon as I left the airport, however, I began to see China had changed  dramatically. Unimaginable numbers of people still clog the streets. But the  depressing conformity conveyed by the sea of blue and grey Mao jackets has  given way to a buoyant stream of color and fashion. Modern buildings dot the  skyline in many cities. Passers-by now eye Westerners with curiosity, but then  go on their way. In 1979, I was usually followed by 50 or more, all bewildered  by their first contact with a foreigner.  </P> <P> China is no longer in isolation. With the political and economic reforms of the  1980s, the Chinese became part of the international community. The success of  this decade of transition -- economic gains, new diplomatic and academic  contacts, political liberalization -- made the violent repression of the  student movement on June 4, 1989, more painful for the Chinese. "Not only has  reform ground to a halt," one student told me, "we're actually moving  backward."  </P> <P> I was invited to China in the spring to give a series of lectures on  international politics. The itinerary included a hectic week of meetings in  major cities as well as a leisurely week of travel in more remote regions. For  this, my rusty Chinese proved indispensable, few speak English outsie the  coastal cities. Virtually everyone I met wanted to talk about June 4 and how it  changed their lives. Nor were these casual chats. People spoke with an urgency,  a passion. The fearful events of June 4 stirred up powerful currents of  discontent that have yet to subside. Massive opposition to the government runs  strong beneath the illusive surface of calm.  </P> <P> The student movement captured the hearts and minds of much of the urban  population, despite continuing debate over exactly what the students were  after. The ambiguity of the movement actually proved to be the key to its  popularity -- everyone identified the objectives of the movement with his own  specific grievances.  </P> <P> For intellectuals, the movement was about democracy -- a catch-all phrase that  stood for political liberalization. Beijing University students who  participated in the demonstrations admitted to me that they took to the streets  without mapping out their objectives and how to attain them. But they agreed  that freedom of expression and accountability were the unifying themes. "Our  main aim," one graduate student put it, "was to express our frustrations openly  and to demand government officials start being held responsible for their  actions."  </P> <P> For workers, the movement was about fighting inflation and corruption. During  the second half of the 1980s, high inflation had been eating away at living  standards and pervasive corruption only made matters worse. A worker from  Sichuan Province explained: "The corruption is so bad that it now touches  everyone. Bribing officials has become a way of life. It was the students'  demand for an end to corruption that linked the workers to the democracy  movement."  </P> <P> For the older generation, the movement was of symbolic importance; the specific  grievances addressed were less significant than the message that students were  sending. "The student demonstrations restored my faith in China's youth," a  woman in her 60s told me. "Before, I thought students just wanted to dance and  prepare their language exams in order to study abroad. I thought they did not  care about the country. Now, I am hopeful about the younger generation."  </P> <P> Sympathy for the student movement, pervasive in China's coastal cities, begins  to wane in the country's rural interior. About two hours southwest of Kunming,  not far off the highway that runs from Yunnan's capital to Burma, I pulled over  to chat with farmers sweeping up grain they had left on the road to be threshed  by the tires of passing cars.  </P> <P> After the necessary discussion of this year's crop, I turned to the student  movement. The peasants said they had supported the demonstrations until the  imposition of martial law. "After that," one said, "the students had to be  stopped to prevent turmoil and chaos from spreading all over the country." This  was the same line the government had presented on the television news. "What do  you expect?" a student in Kunming said. "The farmers are very isolated from the  cities. Forty percent of Yunnan is illiterate. Most people have no reason not  to believe what they hear on TV."  </P> <P> Lack of sophistication, however, is not the only explanation for the more  conservative attitudes of the countryside. The farmers have economic incentives  for supporting the status quo: Many benefitted enormously from economic  reforms. Workers in cities, in fact, are beginning to resent the growing  economic disparities between urban centers and countryside.  </P> <P> Peasants and government officials were not the only ones fearful that the  student movement might lead to political chaos. Many intellectuals who  supported the students' objectives questioned their methods. For those who had  experienced the violence of the Cultural Revolution, the demonstrations  conjured up terrifying images. "I lived through the Cultural Revolution," an  intellectual in his 50s said. "It was out of control. The damage to China was  great. We cannot live through that again." Another scholar agreed that the  situation in Beijing bordered on chaos. "How would the U.S. government react,"  he asked, "if hundreds of thousands of people surrounded the White House and  brought the center of Washington to a standstill for several weeks?"  </P> <P> This fear of disorder is not simply a product of the Cultural Revolution and  other excesses of the Mao era. It is grounded in a more fundamental  appreciation of the challenge involved in maintaining political order in China.  Before the Communist Revolution in 1949, the country suffered through decades  of economic and political fragmentation. Many Chinese view the establishment of  centralized authority as one great achievement of the Mao era. "We live in a  country of 1.1 billion people," a recent graduate of Beijing University told  me. "Except for a few roads and rail lines, our interior provinces are cut off  from the coastal cities. Feeding and keeping control of the country are very  difficult. If we push for radical change, we will only end up worse off."  </P> <P> Intellectuals who led the demonstrations acknowledge that change must come  slowly to China. but they disagree that the students went too far. "What are we  supposed to do, write a letter to Deng?" a student at Fudan University in  Shanghai said, "Demonstrations are our only means of expressing opposition."  </P> <P> The government's continuing efforts to suppress overt opposition has made life  more unpleasant for many Chinese. Academics and journalists have been hit the  hardest. They face increased supervision, harassment and, sometimes, arrest.  </P> <P> On the campuses, organized opposition to the government has been virtually  eliminated. At Beijing University, a few students were reading on the grassy  area next to the statue of Cervantes, where the democracy movement was born  last spring. The wall once covered by pro-democracy posters sported  advertisements for dances and films. "We sometimes gather in the dorms in  groups of three or four to talk about the democracy movement," one student  said. "But that's it."  </P> <P> The general populace has suffered too. Virtually everyone faces more frequent  and intrusive political education classes at the work place. Public discourse  has become sterile; searching debates that, before the crackdown, took place in  parks and newspapers have moved behind closed doors. Economic conditions have  also worsened. The government has instituted an austerity program to bring down  inflation.  </P> <P> The violence used to extinguish the student movement and the less hospitable  environment that emerged thereafter have taken a spiritual toll. Confusion and  disorientation hang over the country. The reforms of the 1980s not only raised  expectations, they indicated that the country was moving in a certain  direction: towards a mixed economy, a more open relationship with the outside  world and a more liberal domestic order. Now, many believe the country is  floundering. Deng Xiaoping, the supporter of reform, has become the culprit  behind the Tian An Men Square tragedy.  </P> <P> Confusion about the present translates into uncertainty about the future. The  hard-liners are now in control, but the current leadership is in dire straits.  Rural residents -- some 70% of the population -- remain a source of support for  the government. But the peasants are geographically and politically isolated  from the center of power. It is the urban population that the government must  placate -- a daunting task.  </P> <P> June 4 stripped the government of whatever legitimacy it enjoyed after several  years of rampant corruption. Ideological mobilization is no longer possible. I  met no one who took the required political education classes seriously. Even a  government official admitted, "We Chinese are now very cynical about ideology."  Students have little interest in reading the works of Mao or Lenin and are  instead turning to religion. Since June 4, studying Buddhism and Christianity  has become a fad.  </P> <P> Events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have only compounded the plight  of the ruling elite. The government has failed in its effort to convince the  Chinese people that the collapse of Communism is unique to the Soviet Bloc. On  the contrary, it is Soviet-style reform that the Chinese people are hoping for.  As a student at Beijing University put it, "We are waiting for Deng to die in  the hope that we will get our Gorbachev."  </P> <P> A joke now popular in China goes as follows: "We Chinese used to say, 'Only  socialism can save China.' Now we say, 'Only China can save socialism.' " The  cynical smiles that follow make clear that saving socialism is not a task for  which much enthusiasm remains. There is indeed wistfulness over the failure of  communism and appreciation that the party is responsible for saving millions of  Chinese peasants from abject poverty. "Nevertheless," one young woman told me,  "Communism is now seen as an ideal, a dream that will never come true."  </P></p>

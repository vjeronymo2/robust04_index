			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 18 KILLED IN RIOTING IN INDIA  </P> <P> At least 18 people were killed today in riots and by police nationwide during a  strike called by a right-wing Hindu party that is trying to bring down Prime  Minister V. P. Singh's government.  </P> <P> Singh said he will prove on Nov. 7 that he can muster a majority in Parliament  despite the defection of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Whether he can do so is  questionable. India could soon face new elections.  </P> <P> The government called a special one-day session of Parliament on Nov. 7. The  reports of violence during today's strike came mostly from small cities and  towns in western and southern India where both Hindus and Muslims live.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges higher in heavy early volume Wall Street WITH a 'triple witching' hanging over the US stockmarket yesterday, share prices edged slightly higher during most of the trading session, before jumping sharply in the final half-hour, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The upward trend persisted throughout most of the day, the market's only modest retreat coming in a brief period after lunch. Volumes were moderately heavy for the day although dealers suggested that a burst of business occured when the market opened and again in the final hour's trading. Many investors were expected to remain on the sidelines until the potentially volatile session was over. By the 4pm close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.99 points on the previous night's close, at 3276.39. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index gained 1.45 points to 411.25. However, the Nasdaq index, which measures the over-the-counter market, eased by 1.68 points to 624.28. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing stocks outpaced declining ones by a margin of approximately three to two on volume of 246.7m shares. AT&amp;T, the large US telecommunications group, was among the most active shares traded during the morning session. They gained  3/4 to Dollars 40 5/8 , on confirmation of a Dollars 1.4bn contract from the US Internal Revenue Service for computer equipment and services. The contract was awarded to the company in July, but the decision ran into controversy. Also rising sharply were shares in Allied Signal, up Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 . The company said it expected first quarter earnings of 85 cents a share, some 15 to 20 cents higher than analysts' had been predicting. Allied Signal said reasons for the better-than-expected figures lay partly in an accelerated restructuring programme, and partly in relatively strong sales in the automotive aftermarket. It did warn, however, that it was too early to say whether this would be maintained throughout 1992. A couple of US car companies enjoyed useful gains in the morning, shares in Ford gaining  3/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 and General Motors rising  3/4 to Dollars 39 1/8 . Only Chrysler, weakest of the 'Big Three' Detroit manufacturers, eased back - by  1/2 to Dollars 17 7/8 . Analysts at Painewebber, the Wall Street brokerage, were said to have raised their earnings estimates for the industry. Canada TORONTO SHARE prices strayed little from yesterday"s close, leaving the index with a slight loss on the week. The composite index edged up 3.22 points to close at 3,469.95, off 5.84 points on the week. Volume was 29.97m shares against 28.138m the day before. The transportation sub-group led the gainers with a 1.20 per cent climb on index, and financial services, mining and industrial products posted smaller gains. Energy and consumer products were off moderately. PWA Corp, the day's most active issue, rallied 0.30 to 5 1/4 on PWA's announcement that it was discussing a strategic partnership with American Airlines.</p>

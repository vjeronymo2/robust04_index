			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Secretary of the Treasury Fernando Cossio in </F> La Paz; date not given]    [Text] At the moment, Fernando Cossio--a geologist and an  economist who has never worked in the private sector--is one of  the most sought after persons in the government. Together with  the president of the Central Bank of Bolivia, his namesake  Fernando Candia, the secretary of the treasury has the mission,  assigned by the president of the Republic, to maintain economic  stability.    With this objective, he is now about to give the finishing  touches to the 1994 general budget, which will soon be submitted  to Congress.    It is no easy task because "it means having great fiscal  discipline. This role, naturally, is not very pleasant; everyone  has pretensions to more funds and wants to do things, but there  are essential limitations and it is not possible," he explains.    Nevertheless, he is optimistic about the country's future,  while not ignoring the difficulties, and he is prepared to  receive an evaluation mission from the International Monetary  Fund on Wednesday, 16 March, which will in his judgment make  possible a disbursement of $20 million--suspended because of a  deficit incurred by the previous government--and will begin to  negotiate for new assistance over a period of three years.    After two postponements and amid constant interruptions  (until he turned off the cellular telephone), Cossio received  PRESENCIA in his office.    [PRESENCIA] How will the balance in the national budget  between social investment and economic investment work in  practice?    [Cossio] The tendency over the medium and long terms is to  give greater emphasis to social investment. However, this will  no longer be possible beginning in 1994 because most foreign  financing already agreed upon or in the process of being  approved still complies with traditional criteria of public  investment.    On the other hand, it is rather difficult to develop new  plans in three months. These procedures are much longer and  normally take more than 18 months. This discrimination in favor  of the social sector will become much more evident beginning  next year.    In spite of this, the 1994 budget already assigns an  appreciable amount of funds to the social sector; but, this has  begun to grow with the passage of time as new projects to be  financed in the social sector take shape and--something very  important--the structural reforms take shape. Which means that  they "go together."    Let me explain: so that investment in education, for  example,  be much more efficient and not be wasted--as happens now--there  must be a change in the structural functioning of the sector. It  cannot be otherwise. The administration of these funds must be  handled much more efficiently than it has been so far.    It is no accident that among the important conditions of the  World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to  grant loans, one, for example, is that educational reform be  under way.    [PRESENCIA] And for the health sector?    [Cossio] The same for the health sector.    Now, naturally we must enact the reforms with or without the  World Bank. Because, what happens if we do not? We build  schools, health facilities that no one takes care of, that fall  apart by themselves, there is no maintenance and, five years  later, you have to start spending again to recapture the  investment, and so on in a vicious circle, because there is no  maintenance or care, the desks are stolen, the windows in many  educational institutions....    Then, the community must look after these assets, and that  is  how education reform is going. The education councils or the  scholastic communities (or whatever they are called), that will  be made up of parents, teachers, and representatives of  municipalities, will be the ones who look after the schools.    At the moment, there is no supervision of any kind. If the  teacher goes to school, fine. If he does not go, nothing  happens. There is no supervision over the use of these resources.    [PRESENCIA] Will resources be transferred directly to the  community or will the state continue to manage them, under its  own control and authority?    [Cossio] As this is not my area and I have not dealt with  it,  I do not have exact answers, but I have the impression that the  unit of Bolivian society that is going to be strengthened with  the participation of the people will be the municipality, which  will receive the resources.    [PRESENCIA] You have said that the general budgetary cap is  9.5 billion bolivares. Where will the revenue come from if  domestic income and customs only produce 2.8 billion bolivares?    [Cossio] The financing is roughly as follows:    About 53 percent of the Treasury's revenues come from income  and customs; about 42 percent from transfers from hydrocarbons,  and the remainder from various items: services provided,  surpluses, and something (minimal) from mining royalties.    Basically, it is domestic revenue, customs' revenue,  transfers from hydrocarbons, and foreign financing for  investment, which is a large share.    [PRESENCIA] This is about 9.5 billion bolivares?    [Cossio] No, this is the amount in the nonfinancial public  sector. The Treasury budget is only 4.2 billion bolivares, more  or less.    The nonfinancial public sector, the consolidated sector, is  9.5 billion bolivares. Excluded are the public financial sector,  which is the Central Bank, and certain funds, such as the  National Fund for Regional Development, that are institutions of  a financial nature that we do not take into account. What we do  take into account are the nonfinancial public sector, that is,  the Treasury, the central government, decentralized state-owned  companies, and development corporations.    [PRESENCIA] To clarify, the Treasury has 4.2 billion  bolivares....    [Cossio] Yes, 4.2 billion.    [PRESENCIA] This comes from customs, income, transfers from  hydrocarbons, and various services. And the difference of 5.3  billion bolivares?    [Cossio] This is from resources of their own that the  companies generate and much of the foreign financing, which goes  to the companies.    [PRESENCIA] How will the 7.5 percent increase in global  wages, proposed by the government, be translated into real wages?    [Cossio] First, why 7.5 percent? Because our forecast for  inflation in 1994 is 7.5 percent and our policy is to at least  maintain real wages. We are aware that we cannot improve them  from one day to the next, but we will maintain real wages.    [PRESENCIA] Could the 7.5 percent increase in global wages  vary in real wages as a function of differentiated curves or to  benefit some sectors more than others, as in previous years?    [Cossio] The 7.5 percent is applied to the global wage of  each group. Now, as long as it does not exceed 7.5 percent, some  might receive 10 percent and others 5 percent, to reach the  average of 7.5 percent.    [PRESENCIA] Will each institution decide this distribution  independently or will your ministry be in charge of doing it?    [Cossio] I believe that each ministry will negotiate with  its  sector, and each company will take its real possibilities into  account.    [PRESENCIA] One of the proposals for education reform is to  increase teachers salaries substantially. Does what you say mean  that this increase will be possible only through the application  of the 7.5 percent?    [Cossio] No. There is something more in the teachers'  situation that may also arise in other situations. We have a  study on teacher staffing which shows us that, in the city of La  Paz, there is a difference of 2,800 positions that are paid but  not occupied. These are what are called ghost teachers. We have  the impression that in the three principal cities of the central  axis there are 5,000 to 6,000 positions that exist in the budget  but are not filled; this is the difference between the positions  in the staffing pattern and the people who are actually there.  As we identify these ghost positions, which are important, the  resulting savings can go to improve the salaries of teachers who  really exist.    [PRESENCIA] Will the 7.5 percent by which the global salary  will be increased be calculated on the present staffing,  including the ghosts?    [Cossio] Yes, but we are naturally going to clean this up  when the reenrollment of all government employees is completed.    There are ghosts not only in teacher staffing, but in other  institutions as well, even among the well-deserving of the  fatherland. There are many persons who have died but who  continue to receive payment. The number of widows does not  diminish but rather increases.    [PRESENCIA] How many teachers are there paid by the state?    [Cossio] There are 107,000 positions.    [PRESENCIA] With regard to the 7.5 percent increase in the  budget for universities, you said that this decision was  "unchangeable but could be revised." What does that mean?    [Cossio] It means that the 7.5 percent cannot be revised,  but  if there is a real willingness to negotiate, expenses could be  rationalized in other sectors of the universities' budgets.    Everyone knows, for example, that administrative personnel  staffing is very large in relation to the number of professors  and students.    Some universities have already begun to rationalize. For  example, there has been an important reduction in administrative  personnel in the Technical University of Orura and the Greater  University of San Simon.    [PRESENCIA] Will the premium for efficiency for universities  be continued?    [Cossio] Only for 1993, which we are going to pay now, in  1994. These are one time only payments.    [PRESENCIA] If the budget prepared by the government is  followed, will it not be necessary to increase the price of  hydrocarbons?    [Cossio] No, because the budget is going to be unbalanced,  with a deficit of 800 million bolivares, which is three percent  of the gross domestic product (GDP) and must be financed.    [PRESENCIA] According to what you say, the budget is very  austere and the government has forecast growth of 4.5 percent.  Is there not a risk of entering a vicious circle of low spending  but also of low growth? And what remains of the promise of 8  percent annual growth by the end of this administration?    [Cossio] Let us not forget that 1994 is the first real year  of this government. We estimated 4.5 percent taking into  consideration above all foreign financing, which is assured.    We think that progress in the capitalization process and  greater, more decided and bolder participation by the private  sector in investment must cause the economy to grow by 7 to 8  percent in one or two years.    Last year, total investment in Bolivia was about 14 percent  of GDP; the public sector invested about 7 percent and the  private sector a similar amount. I am speaking in very global  terms, but those are the orders of magnitude.    If we had an investment structure similar to Chile, for  example--about 25 percent of GDP--the state would have to be  investing about 9-10 percent and the private sector about 15  percent. Only those levels of investment can assure growth of 8  percent.    In sum, the private sector (the foreign portion, through  capitalization, as well as the domestic portion, through its own  investments, in a market economy that is working) has to assure  these higher investment levels.    [PRESENCIA] How much public investment is there; and what  portion of it comes from foreign credits or grants and how much  from the Treasury?    [Cossio] This is a somewhat dynamic situation. Until the  budget has been presented to Congress and promulgated by the  executive, the numbers will be changing constantly. We are still  adjusting them, but let us say that the level should be around  $500 million. I believe that will be the figure, more or less,  from $500 to $510 million.    Investment from foreign resources is about $350 million in  credits and grants. The rest is from the Treasury, and in  addition what corporations invest with copartnerships,  royalties, etc.    [PRESENCIA] A large share of the Treasury's income comes  from  transfers from state-owned companies. When these companies are  capitalized, will the taxes they pay equal the amount of the  transfers?    [Cossio] They must, they have to.    [PRESENCIA] Do the projections show this?    [Cossio] We are conducting exercises with mathematical  simulations and with models to calculate exactly the levels of  revenue that the new system should produce, so that the Treasury  will not lose out during a period of transition.    [PRESENCIA] The announcements about the composition of the  budget and the structural measures the government intends to  initiate are already causing social conflict. Although your  office is essentially technical, what political factors are  there to weaken or to negotiate with the various sectors?    [Cossio] There is a large margin for negotiation, and to  explain that not only the government is going to benefit by  these changes but the entire country. That is the essential  element of a transformation.    Transformations do not occur in a calm environment. There  are  going to be conflicts because a transformation brings with it a  change in things, and people normally do not like change. I  believe that, while not entering areas that are not my  responsibility, there is a broad margin for negotiation and for  becoming convinced of the need for these reforms.    [PRESENCIA] Do you believe in force?    [Cossio] In the force of ideas, yes.    [PRESENCIA] In the context of what you have said, would you  hazard a forecast of what the government is going to do in the  next four years?    [Cossio] It would be very pretentious of me to do that, in  general, but I believe that if we are successful in the  capitalization process, if we carry out the law on popular  participation--which is really going to change the country's  roots in the allocation of resources--and if there is greater  and massive private investment, the conditions will exist to see  a new Bolivia in four or six years. These are long processes and  no one can say that the country will be totally changed by 1997,  but if we leave the seed well planted in fertile soil, I  believe.... I am very optimistic.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  My Beloved Buenos Aires </H5>   [PRESENCIA] What is the situation with Argentina at the  moment?    [Cossio] I can cite only two facts, because the subject is  outside my area. First, only $20 million remains of the special  payment made by Argentina last year, which will be paid in  January and February. Unfortunately, this special payment of  $110 million is finished. Second, new sales contracts--because  there might be more than one--are being negotiated.    [PRESENCIA] Has provision been made for these contracts in  the 1994 budget?    [Cossio] We have made provision in the budget for a volume  similar to that of 1993, estimating the sales price at 10  percent more than the previous year, at $1.10. It is a very  conservative estimate but also very realistic.    [PRESENCIA] But does this not open a serious gap for the  government?    [Cossio] The gap we have is caused by the end of the special  payment, because there will no longer be any taxes to be  collected on it.    [PRESENCIA] How has this gap been filled?    [Cossio] With very significant cuts in operating expenses.  First, we reduced all budgets for overtime pay by half; travel  by half; travel expenses by 33 percent. These are the cuts, the  savings we have been talking about, and it is a lot of money.    Second, we have sufficient data to be almost certain that  income tax collections will improve by 17 percent, which means  additional revenue of some 240 million bolivares.    These measures make it possible for us to cover the gap  caused by the decline in revenues due to the cessation of the  special payment from Argentina, and also part of the salary  increase.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  The Dreary Legacy </H5>   [PRESENCIA] What was the legacy left by the previous  government in the economic area?    [Cossio] The figures tell the story. The previous government  had committed itself, in the plan agreed on with the IMF, to a  deficit of about 750 million bolivares (total deficit of the  nonfinancial public sector). But, we arrived at the end of the  year with a deficit of 1.48 billion bolivares.    There were three reasons for this: First, they lost control  of salaries in 1993 and they granted increases well above what  had been agreed upon with the IMF, which was 9 percent. What  came out of Congress was 12 percent. But, because of previous  agreements with the petroleum workers, insurance funds and  corporations, they reached a salary increase in real terms of 18  percent.    The second reason is that they inflated revenues and relied  on the supposition that internal revenue and customs would  improve their efficiency by 41 percent. But customs was  ineffective, it was completely disorganized, and internal  revenue was no better. Therefore, that projection turned out not  to be true. At least internal revenue began to improve, starting  in September, but it was too late to make up for the shortfall  of the entire year.    The third reason is that, in an election year, there was a  great deal of spending, and the domestic debt increased  spectacularly. They were contracting projects, buying goods and  services, and not paying for them. This is why we received an  accumulated domestic debt of almost 180 million bolivares.    [PRESENCIA] Is this the problem with the construction  companies?    [Cossio] With everyone. Construction companies, providers of  goods and services, payments to the social communication media,  for example. They continued to accumulate debts. One way of  financing was to increase the domestic debt. They stopped paying  the complementary funds; there too we received a significant  floating debt.    These are the reasons they lost control in 1993 and this is  why they could not reach an agreement with the IMF.    [PRESENCIA] How are you negotiating the payment of these  debts?    [Cossio] We know that we cannot pay it all in one year and  we  are making a payments plan. For example, we have already  proposed to the Bolivian Chamber of Construction that we pay  them with Treasury bonds redeemable in four years. We think we  can comply in that period, with all due precaution and beginning  with the oldest debts. That is one possibility. Some companies  have accepted, others no, but the dialogue is open.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  The Endless Foreign Debt </H5>   According to figures provided by Treasury Secretary Fernando  Cossio, the foreign debt on 31 December 1993 was $3.788 billion,  of which $2.478 is owed by the Treasury.    Of the total debt, 55 percent "is of multilateral origin,  the  principal creditors being the IDB and the IBRD [International  Bank for Reconstruction and Development], with 46 percent of the  debt. The remainder are crumbs: 3 percent to the CAF [Andean  Development Corporation] and 3 percent to FONPLATA [River Plate  Basin Development Fund]."    "Then, 42 or 43 percent is bilateral, and the two principal  creditors, with 22 percent, are Germany and Japan," he said,  adding that 1.6 percent of the debt is owed to private banks.    Cossio said that being in debt to the multilateral  organizations is an advantage and a disadvantage. An advantage  because "most of the credits were made on concessionary terms,  for a term of 40 years at 2 percent interest and a 10-year grace  period. The disadvantage is that it is not renegotiable. We  cannot go to the Club of Paris and renegotiate the multilateral  debt."    He explains that the Treasury's debt was incurred primarily  for roads, but in addition, when a state enterprise,  corporation, potable water service, or municipality does not pay  its debt, the debt is assumed by the Treasury.    "For example, we are paying $43 million in foreign debt for  the City of La Paz, we are paying SAMAPA's [Municipal Drinking  Water and Sewer Service] debts, and debts of corporations  because, always, when they can no longer pay, somebody has to  pay, and it is the poor Treasury that has to pay the piper. This  is the reason for our reluctance to continue taking on  commitments, because the Treasury has reached a limit. This debt  represents about 12 percent of its budget," complains Cossio.    Asked whether part of foreign borrowing is used to pay old  debts, Cossio says that only "a very small part--funds that come  in as balance of payments support, which are usually grants in  the type of aid program that we have with Germany, Switzerland,  the Netherlands, and also part of balance of payments support  from the United States--is used to pay foreign debt, but it is  not very much."    Finally, he pointed out that, in 1994, the government has  made provision to pay about $173 million to service the foreign  debt (amortization and interest).  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5> <H5>  Distribution of Public Investment and Allocation of Resources </H5>   When discussing the national budget, the most important  subjects after the salary increase are the distribution of  public investment to the regions and the allocation of resources  to the various government departments.    According to the treasury secretary, public investment will  be carried out on the following basis:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Investments by Department (in percentages)                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Santa Cruz                            |18.9                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |La Paz                                |18.2                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cochabamba                            |12.18                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tarija                                |6.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Potosi                                |5.97                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oruro                                 |5.6                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chuquisaca                            |5.2                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Beni                                  |3.65                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pando                                 |1.5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National investments                  |12                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Multidepartmental investments (benefi-|8                                     |  |ting two or more departments)         |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Distribution by Sector </H5>   The treasury secretary was also asked about allocation by  sector. Cossio said that "about 37 percent of the Treasury  budget goes to the Ministry of Human Development (which includes  education, health, and housing). Then, the Defense Ministry,  with 14 percent."    Regarding allocations to the economic area, he explained  that  the portion assigned to the Treasury is very inflated, because  it includes service on the foreign debt, which represents 20  percent of the Treasury budget, "which is very important."</p>

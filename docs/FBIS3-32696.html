The PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] senator for Rio Grande do Sul, Pedro  Simon, the government leader in the Senate, has reacted with  concern, especially because the STF trend was announced the same  day Congress approved, on the first vote, the economic plan  measures.    "They did not even wait for the opposition to question the  measure. It is as if the judicial branch was inviting the  opposition to challenge the plan," Simon said.    According to Simon, the government had no alternative  proposal until 9 February in case the STF rejected the economic  plan's promulgation, which is scheduled for the first week of  March. The immediate promulgation method (or "sausage," as it  was christened in Congress) has always caused controversy, but  the PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, Nelson Jobim, the  constitutional revision coordinator, claims that this is an  internal affair of Congress and does not fall under court  jurisdiction.    After the first vote on the government measures, the PFL  [Liberal Front Party] deputy for Pernambuco, Inocencio de  Oliveira, the Chamber of Deputies president, said the Social  Emergency Fund will be an excellent test for the "sausage  method." According to Oliveira, both the government and Congress  want the plan's immediate promulgation.    Says Oliveira: "An STF decision against immediate  promulgation would be a challenge to the two other branches and  also to the public, which demands urgent measures against  inflation."    The PFL deputy for Minas Gerais, Gustavo Krause, the  constitutional revision deputy coordinator, said the Social  Emergency Fund's immediate promulgation is essential for  continuing the revision.    Says Krause: "The first case will set a precedent. If the  courts do not ban the fund's immediate promulgation this  principle will apply to all the other changes approved by  Congress."    Jobim said on 9 February that he was surprised at the  comments by STF members, who spoke before taking any action  against immediate promulgation.    "It is surprising that judges should speak about actions  that  have not yet been undertaken. It is not the standard procedure,"  he said.    Jobim claimed that the method already has been provided for  in the regulations for the revision, adding that he does not  intend to talk with STF members, minimizing the controversy. He  believes there is no reason for criticizing the amendments'  immediate promulgation. According to Jobim, considering that the  revision modifies only some articles of the Constitution, it is  not necessary to wait until the end of the process to put the  modifications into practice.    The PMDB senator for Rio Grande do Sul, Jose Fogaca, said  that eventual STF opposition to the promulgation should awaken  no concern, especially on the part of the government. He claimed  that implementation of the URV [real value unit] by the economic  team is very important for the government and does not depend on  the Social Emergency Fund's implementation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that there has been no change at  all in the position of North Korea, which has refused the  overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], even after the ROK and U.S. leaders  announced a principle of settling the North Korean nuclear issue.    North Korea sent a message to Hans Blix, director general of  the IAEA, yesterday [1 December], a day before the meeting of  governors of the IAEA is held, and showed a negative response by  saying that it cannot accept the overall inspection at present.    The IAEA said that it had received a reply message from  North  Korea in connection with its 24 November message urging the  North Korean side to accept the overall inspection, but the  contents of the message shows that there is no change at all in  its previous position that it would only allow the change of  monitoring equipment.    Also, IAEA authorities say that the IAEA may declare North  Korea as a country that has not fulfilled the Nuclear Safeguard  Accords unless it allows access to experts of the suspected  nuclear facilities.    An IAEA official said the IAEA has no other choice than to  refer the North Korean issue for the second time to the UN  Security Council around the end of this year.</p>

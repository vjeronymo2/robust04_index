			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard rises on bid hint STRONG demand for Standard Chartered shares sent them sharply ahead to reach an all-time high amid rumours of rights issues and takeovers. The stock jumped 23 to 827p, although volume was thin at just under 1m shares traded. A combination of mostly old stories surrounded the banking group. One was that the Development Bank of Singapore was in the process of preparing to make a takeover bid. Other stories included suggestions that the bank would soon make a cash call and also that Lloyds Bank was considering the placing of its 4.6 per cent stake in Standard, acquired during its abortive bid in 1986.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Reduced underwriting loss lifts CU to Pounds 144m A REDUCTION in underwriting losses helped Commercial Union, the largest composite insurer, increase pre-tax profits to Pounds 144.2m for the first nine months of 1993, against Pounds 6.1m for the same period of last year. The figures were roughly in line with expectations and the shares rose 10p to close at 606p. 'The substantial improvement in general insurance trading, especially in the UK, continued in the third quarter and life profits again made a significant contribution,' said Mr Tony Brend, chief executive. UK underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 59.8m (Pounds 128.6m), with London market losses of Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 65.8m) offsetting profits on other lines. CU said that although market conditions were continuing to improve, there 'are signs of increased competition for private motor business'. General insurance premiums rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 2.46bn), and life premiums increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Investment income advanced to Pounds 263.4m (Pounds 212.4m) - after charging external loan interest of Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 35.1m) - reflecting the benefit from higher cash flow, the proceeds of capital issues and exchange rate movements. Group underwriting losses fell to Pounds 215.3m (Pounds 302.3m). Associates contributions were Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 14m). Non-life profits amounted to Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 75.9m losses) and life profits were Pounds 86.4m (Pounds 82m). The figures include a loss of Pounds 3.7m, which relates to the termination of activities in Argentina. Shareholders' funds at September 30 increased to Pounds 2.31bn (Pounds 1.5bn at end-1992), which included Pounds 428m from the rights issue and Pounds 81m from shares in lieu of dividends. COMMENT Results this week from Royal, General Accident and Commercial Union leave no doubt about the recovery in the UK insurance market. The main question for investors is which of the five large composites to favour. On some grounds CU looks a shade expensive. The company should comfortably achieve full year profits of Pounds 180m. So at yesterday's closing price, CU is on a prospective multiple of about 21, one of the highest ratings in the sector. However, in other ways the company appears to be a safer bet than its rivals. A historic gross yield of 5.1 provides firm underpinning. Less volatile life business provides a much higher percentage of CU's earnings than at any of its four main composite rivals. At the nine months stage, life provided 30 per cent of income and nearly 60 per cent of operating profits.</p>

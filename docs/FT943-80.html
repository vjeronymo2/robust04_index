			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Alcatel leaves trail of damage across Continent Alcatel-Alsthom's half-year results, coming in well below expectations on Wednesday evening, left a trail of damage across Europe yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. The French group's shares fell 7.1 per cent in New York overnight, and were suspended limit down in Paris before falling FFr78.30 or 13.8 per cent to a new 1994 closing low of FFr489, after FFr472. This totally undermined confidence in the French stock market, said Mr John Blackley of James Capel, and in the electronics sector across Europe. In the afternoon, selling from the US in thin trading conditions broadened to encompass whole markets, and most of the Continent. Alcatel's troubles in Germany were reflected in the share price of Siemens, DM25.50 or 3.9 per cent lower at DM629.50 after a painful afternoon in the Frankfurt market. In Zurich, Brown Boveri fell SFr41 or 3.5 per cent to SFr1,124 and, in Stockholm, Asea gave up SKr20 or 3.6 per cent to SKr541 amid worries that they could be hit by similar profit pressures. FRANKFURT, initially, put in a conventional response to the Alcatel news, the Dax index falling 24.53 or 1.2 per cent to 2,043.58 on the session, with Volkswagen and BMW joining Siemens as big underperformers. Turnover picked up from DM5.3bn to DM6.7bn, reflecting the size of the names involved. However, the afternoon saw a more extended version of the weakness that hit Paris for a while on Wednesday, and the Ibis indicated Dax hit 2,010.75 before closing 54.28 or 2.6 per cent lower at 2,016.08. Traders saw hedge funds offloading stock, and straight investment selling from the US. BMW finished DM40 or 5.2 per cent down at DM734, and VW at DM426.50, off DM24.70 or 5.5 per cent. The afternoon weakness took in a wide range of stocks, including Deutsche Bank, MAN (in trucks and automotive equipment), Degussa and Henkel (in specialty chemicals), Kaufhof (in retailing), and engineers and utilities. PARIS ended 1.5 per cent down, the CAC-40 index losing 28.77 at 1,876.18. Turnover rose from FFr3.19bn to FFr5.6bn, with Alcatel accounting for FFr1.9bn of the total. Reaction to the Alcatel figures was neither as widespread, nor as acute, as in Frankfurt, but French brokers compensated by worrying about the morning slide on Wall Street, US interest rates and inflation worries in general. Once again results, or the anticipation of them, produced movement. Saint Louis, the sugar and paper group, rose FFr14 to FFr1,400 ahead of a 59 per cent jump in first-half net attributable profits. In financials, BNP rose FFr3.10 to FFr239.8 ahead of its own half-year figures, but Paribas, in a similar situation, lost FFr7.80 at FFr312.2. ZURICH fell 1.2 per cent as Wall Street weakened and the SMI index finished 32.0 lower at 2,558.0. Trading in UBS shares was unusually heavy as the market buzzed with rumours. A key story was that UBS wanted to reduce the influence of BK Vision, the investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, which owns 18 per cent of UBS's registered shares and 3 per cent of its bearers. In the event, news that UBS planned to seek shareholder approval for a single category of bearer share at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 22 came after the market had closed. The bank said its intention was to prevent single shareholders of registered shares from having 'excessive influence'. The SFr100 bearer shares rose SFr10 to SFr1,205 while the SFr20 registered shares fell SFr6 to SFr324. BK Vision fell by SFr50 to SFr1,450. MILAN encountered some profit-taking after the strong run of recent sessions as budget optimism faded into the background and investors reflected on the poor half-year figures from the banking sector, which came late on Wednesday. The Comit index fell 2.58 to 690.97. BCI dropped L121 to L3,960 while Credito Italiano, which is also launching a capital increase, shed L96 to 2,150. The results of both were hit by losses on bond portfolios. Telecom Italia, L53 lower at L4,496, lost out to Stet, L58 ahead at L4,970, after the government said that the latter was its preferred privatisation candidate. Fiat gave up L97 to L6,731 as the market awaited its interim results after the market closed. Analysts said later that, at first sight, the figures were sharply better than had been expected. AMSTERDAM closed at lunchtime to reroute telephone and computer cables for today's launch of a new, computerised trading system. The AEX Index closed 1.20 lower at 403.91, depressed by a weaker London market and lower state bonds. BolsWessanen eased 0.30 cents to Fl 34.70: the food and drinks group had climbed Fl 1.70 on Wednesday on news it would take a stake of at least 33 per cent in Italy's Campari. Among mixed blue chips, DSM, the chemicals group, fell Fl 2.30 to Fl 152.30 after Wednesday's strong gain. Oce-van der Grinten rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 72.30, boosted by Wednesday's news of a distribution deal in the US. STOCKHOLM was weaker, tracking bonds and Wall Street. The Affarsvarlden index lost 15.8 to 1,416.4. MoDo B closed SFr4 higher at SKr344, following the company's announcement of a rise in fine paper prices.

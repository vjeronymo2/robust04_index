			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: The quality of teacher training Sir, Your criticism of Kenneth Clarke's plans to reform the teacher training system ('Education and the election', January 6) as 'panicky electioneering' is ill-founded. My company, employing some 29,000 people in the UK, has a direct interest in the quality of our teachers. The inspectorate's report shows very convincingly what can and should be done to equip schools to invest their knowledge and skills in the next generation of teachers. Much of the opposition to the plans smacks of self-interest and an elitist view that education 'theory', taught by people who no longer teach children, is more important than practical classroom skills; teachers must be able to manage all the different modes of learning. My company put some ideas to the education secretary on the need for such a change of emphasis in teacher training. I am delighted to see this new consensus, of which we are a part, has found such a practical and dynamic response from the secretary of state. Children and teachers themselves will benefit.

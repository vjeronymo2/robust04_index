			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO STEREOTYPES AND THE DRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE  </P> <P> In reading July 29 articles about playwrights Luis Valdez and Josefina Lopez, I  discerned several themes running through both: Immigrants cause problems for  the union; it's good to "get out of the barrio"; Mexicans are macho; Mexican  mothers are long-suffering and stoic; Mexican sons are rejected by their  families if they are homosexual; all other sons are cholos.  </P> <P> Really, I must protest.  </P> <P> Unionization has always taken place among non-union workers. That's what  unionization means. To see Latino immigrants as somehow weakening the union,  rather than strengthening it, is to parrot the line of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service and the Department of Labor.  </P> <P> Maybe it's good to get out of the barrio (as both Lopez and Ritchie Valens  remark) if you want to become rich, declasse and alienated from your own  people.  </P> <P> Asked to name machos, I would pick Ronald Reagan, Chuck Norris and the people  in the Pentagon, plus a few Ku Klux Klanmen, none of whom appear particularly  Mexican.  </P> <P> Mexican men, in fact, usually have a very sweet nature and are intimidated by  the aggressive and war-like gringos.  </P> <P> As far as Mexican women being long-suffering, there are plenty examples of  women doctors, lawyers and politicians in Mexican life, as well as Indian women  in the villages, who rule the roost, not least of whom are the matriarchal  Mayas.  </P> <P> No Mexican family that I know of will reject a gay son. The prevailing attitude  is "you're still our son."  </P> <P> There is no doubt that Latinos may now succeed in Hollywood, but at the price  of stoking racist Anglo stereotypes about a people little understood by  outsiders, stereotypes little supported by Latinos themselves, who can't be  bothered with Anglo Angst.  </P> <P> ANTONIO BERNAL  </P> <P> Ex-member of Teatro Campesino  </P> <P> Montebello  </P></p>

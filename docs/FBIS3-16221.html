			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We begin with a report from Moscow by correspondent  Ritums Rozenbergs in which he says that at the end of the first  day of the Latvian-Russian talks, Latvian delegation chief  Martins Virsis said that two things were not coordinated. One  about payment for rent of the Skrunda military facility and the  other one concerning the wording of the text of the agreement.  However, in spite of the disagreements, there is hope that an  agreement will be reached in the nearest future, possibly today.    The main achievement of yesterday's talks is an agreement  prepared for signing on the army withdrawal and two agreements  on social guarantees for the Russian military. It has been  agreed in the document that pensions will be paid to Soviet army  pensioners, that is, to those who had become pensioners by  January `92. A new stage is characteristic of this round of  talks, because documents which have been discussed for several  years have practically been prepared for signing.</p>

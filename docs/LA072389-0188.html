			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRATULATIONS! YOU PAID HOW MUCH FOR WHAAAAT?  </P> <P> After-purchase dialogue, or what not to say to new homeowners:  </P> <P>  -- "What did you go way out there for? It's got to be a seven-hour commute."  </P> <P>  -- "That's what they told you? How could it be Gothic Cape Cod with French  Provincial trim?"  </P> <P>  -- "You mean you're contracting for your own landscaping? All around? That's a  headache that's this big."  </P> <P>  -- "You put money down for one bedroom, one bath, no garage from pictures? In  a brochure?"  </P> <P>  -- "You can't possibly get your money out in a hundred years."  </P> <P>  -- "No down payment? Watch out how they load your first 10 months."  </P> <P>  -- "I should have told you beforehand. My brother-in-law could have gotten you  a much better deal at Lonely Acres."  </P> <P>  -- "Sounds nice, I guess. When I drove by last time, it was all refuse and  weeds."  </P> <P>  -- "I hear the schools out there are terrible. Worst in the state."  </P> <P>  -- "Sweat equity? Even a gross of Underarm Plus won't get that place finished  for five years."  </P> <P>  -- "Adjustable-rate mortgage? On those pumped-up payments, you'll be on the  foreclosure circuit before the end of the second year."  </P> <P>  -- "My folks actually moved away from there. You know, no bus service, no  library, no supermarket, nothing. Man, you're stuck."  </P></p>

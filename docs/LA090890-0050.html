Police said they were not sure what caused the incident.  </P> <P> Police Chief Mayer DeRoy said Fisher appeared to be despondent, and police  offered counseling at a hospital with assurances that he would not be  prosecuted. He surrendered his rifle to policemen about an hour before he  killed himself, but he refused to relinquish the pistol.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Silviya Velikova from the Bulgarian Socialist </F> Party Congress in Sofia -- live]    [Text] The first thing the delegates to the 41st Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] Congress did was to adopt the congress  agenda. Two additions to the agenda were proposed and adopted.  The first proposes that a debate should be held on the party's  election campaign platform during the discussions on the BSP  program, and the second is to hear a declaration from a group of  BSP intellectuals on the situation of the Bulgarian  intelligentsia and the BSP's stance on this issue.    BSP Supreme Council leader Zhan Videnov read to the  delegates  an exceptionally detailed report entitled "On the BSP political  line." Here are a few of the points he mentioned:    According to Videnov, the SDS's policy regarding the  government failed because it was based on confrontation and  restoration of the former state of things. This has led to the  SDS becoming isolated form the people and falling into a serious  crisis, Videnov said.    Despite the numerous question marks hanging over the formula  on which the Berov cabinet was formed 18 months ago, the BSP  supported Berov because he placed all-national interests higher  than narrow party ones. However, Videnov stressed that a number  of features now militate against this support: the blocking of  the reforms, complete exhaustion of resources, and a fragile  economy. The most crucial decision that you congress delegates  have to reach, Videnov said, is to call for early elections in  October or November, which can lead to major changes in the  country's development and the imposition of a clear,  left-of-center, socially oriented policy. However, he emphasized  that Bulgaria needs early elections, but they should in no event  be premature ones. For the BSP, the elections were not an aim  in itself, but means for developing a free and just society.  The road toward such a society lies precisely via democratic  elections, the BSP leader emphasized.    Here is one of the concluding sentences that Videnov said at  the end of this speech: More than ever before, we must get to  realize where and why we went wrong during these four or five  years that followed 45 years, and then strive to unleash new  potential for social dialogue.    At the moment the congress is continuing with a report from  the All-Party Control-Auditing Commission, and it is then to  hear a report on the work of the BSP parliamentary group.</p>

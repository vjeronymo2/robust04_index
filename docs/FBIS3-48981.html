			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Croatian Defense Council's Vitez operational  group today warned the UN Protection Forces and other  international organizations about the consequences of a possible  explosion of the ammunition factory in Vitez. This factory  stores explosives and dangerous chemicals, and if it is blown up  by the defenders or as a result of Muslim shelling everything  within a 3 km radius would be destroyed.    A document issued by the Vitez operational group also warns  that toxic gases would affect people living from 2 to 15 km from  the factory. Snow, rain, and fog could reduce the effect of  toxic clouds to a certain extent, but in any case the safety  zone for the population of the area would be at least 20 km away  from the epicenter of the explosion, the Vitez operational group  warns in the document.</p>

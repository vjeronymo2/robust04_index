The commentary titled "water pollution under corrupt  politics" notes that more than ten million people in Pusan and  North and South Kyongsang Provinces of South Korea are suffering  from a shortage of drinking water because the Naktong River is  seriously contaminated with ammonia nitrogen and carcinogenic  benzene, toluene and other toxic substances.    The news analyst says:    The Kim Yong-sam clique, much upset, is resorting to petty  tricks to lull the resentment of the people, sending "a  fact-finding team" to the spot and publishing "a message of  apology to the people" in the name of the puppet prime minister.  On the other hand, it is working hard to shirk the blame for  the drinking water problem.    Such hide-and-seek of the puppets, however, can work on  nobody at all. [sentence as received]    The South Korean people know only too well it is the Kim  Yong-sam clique that has received thick bundles of banknotes  from pollution-causing comprador businesses and connived at  their dumping of toxic waste water into the Naktong River.    Under corrupt politics, nature and society become sick and  degenerated.    With nothing can the Kim Yong-sam clique conceal its  treacherous acts in turning South Korea into "the worst hell of  pollution in the world" and imposing sufferings and misfortunes  on the people.</p>

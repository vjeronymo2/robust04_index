			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bayer to license Celltech antibody BAYER, the German pharmaceuticals group, has exercised an option to license a new genetically engineered human antibody being development by Celltech Group, the Berkshire-based biotechnology company planning to seek a UK listing. The move means Celltech has received Pounds 4m of milestone payments to add to the Pounds 4m it already has from Bayer. The Celltech antibody, CDP571, is in phase two of clinical trials in seven European centres. It is designed to block the action of Tumour Necrosis Factor which is produced by the body's immune system and appears to be a key factor in the development of life threatening septic shock. This condition leads to rapidly falling blood pressure and failure of a number of the body's organs. Celltech has also begun a phase two study in rheumatoid arthritis patients whose joints can display abnormally high concentrations of TNF. Celltech said Bayer had been encouraged by findings from studies of septic shock patients using its own mouse antibody, now in phase three of clinical trials. Celltech's development of a human antibody will be one to two years behind the mouse antibody. But if successful it should be more effective and less prone to attack by the body's immune system. Celltech also believes success for Bayer's septic shock antibody will increase the chances of success for its CDP571 antibody. 'If Bayer makes it to registration it is likely our product will do at least as well,' said Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive. The exercising of the option confirmed the two companies' confidence in Celltech's new antibody, he said. Bayer's option allows it to license Celltech's anti-TNF antibody for all clinical indications and to pursue later phase development in collaboration with Celltech. Mr Horst Meyer, head of Bayer Pharma, was optimistic that joint products would be successfully developed with Celltech 'in the foreseeable future'.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Aid for Ukraine Time to compromise. European Union finance ministers look set to spend today's Ecofin meeting in Brussels squabbling over whether to lend Ecu85m (Pounds 67m) to Ukraine, Ecu65m of which the country will immediately pay back to meet an earlier debt. Germany is pressing hard for the deal, believing that it provides the EU with a cheap opportunity to do considerable good. France and the UK fear that the deal would set a dangerous precedent for the future. But letting the Ukraine's reform efforts stumble over such a paltry sum would be more dangerous still. Ukraine's president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, has taken the country a long way in recent months. Private land ownership has been legalised; agricultural and energy prices have been brought close to world levels; and the budget deficit is at last, slowly, being brought under control. Recognising these and other achievements, the International Monetary Fund is negotiating a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 910m) stand-by loan to support Mr Kuchma's efforts. As ever, the cloud hanging over Ukraine's brighter economic future is the trade account. Ukraine needs to find a way to fill the looming Dollars 1bn gap in its balance of payments for the fourth quarter of this year. The IMF has pledged to provide around one third of this figure, while the US, Canada and the Netherlands have offered around Dollars 100m between them. A show of support from the EU would unlock further funds from the US and other G7 countries, and a much-needed debt re-scheduling agreement from Russia, Ukraine's chief energy supplier and creditor. The British and French governments oppose the deal on the grounds that the EU is not in the business of making balance of payments loans to distressed countries. Only one country - Moldova - has been granted similar support in recent years. And the Moldovans, at least, had already reached a formal deal with the IMF, and were therefore locked into a full-scale macroeconomic reform programme. Russia ought not to be in the balance of payments financing business either. Yet, as Ukraine's largest energy supplier, it has provided more than Dollars 5bn in import financing over the past two and a half years, mostly in the form of unpaid bills. The Russian government has accepted that its help will continue to be needed for a while yet. But it understandably balks at the prospect of continuing a task which the EU values at less than Ecu20m. A gesture is needed. The ministers could pledge the money now, on condition that it is disbursed only when Ukraine's IMF facility is formally in place. But pledge they must.</p>

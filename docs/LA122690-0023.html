			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Casting Change: Ron Silver is out and his understudy, Tom McGowan, is, at least  for the moment, the new star of "La Bete," a Broadway-bound comedy that opens  today at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.  </P> <P> Gary Springer, a spokesman for the show, called Silver's departure "amicable,"  saying that the actor's withdrawal was due to "irreconcilable interpretive  differences." Whether McGowan will have the role when the play opens on Jan. 31  at the Eugene O'Neill Theater in New York is not certain. The play, written by  David Hirson and directed by Richard Jones, takes place on the 17th-Century  estate of a French prince, whose court is disrupted by a manic troubadour. The  producers are Stuart Ostrow and Andrew Lloyd Webber.  </P></p>

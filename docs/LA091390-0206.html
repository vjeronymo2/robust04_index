			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM, UAW TALKS HOLD RISKS FOR THE SOFTENING ECONOMY  </P> <P> The United Auto Workers union has an array of options open to it as national  contract talks with General Motors Corp. enter their final hours.  </P> <P> Some of the strategies, if carried out, carry potentially serious consequences  for the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> In a nutshell, the union has three choices: Reach agreement before the current  contract expires at midnight Friday, extend the current agreement beyond then  or stage some kind of strike.  </P> <P> It was difficult on Wednesday to assess the chances of an agreement before the  deadline. The tone of negotiations since they began in mid-July has been mostly  cordial, but some auto analysts have said for months that a strike against GM  is likely.  </P> <P> The UAW also is bargaining with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., but the  union has put talks with those two companies on hold pending the outcome of the  GM negotiations. In all, more than 450,000 active auto workers are covered by  UAW contracts with the Big Three, each of which expires at the same time.  </P> <P> With a strike fund of about $770 million, the union has the fiscal flexibility  to take a large number of the 300,000 GM workers out of the company's plants  for a long time.  </P> <P> But the union may feel that such a labor bomb is unnecessary to demonstrate its  discontent with GM.  </P> <P> The company, like other auto makers, brings parts to its assembly plants within  hours of the parts' being installed in vehicles. That means even a small strike  can take on huge proportions as it dries up the parts pipeline.  </P> <P> The UAW demonstrated that last month, when it staged a walkout involving about  2,800 workers at GM's AC Rochester West plant in Flint, Mich., where fuel tanks  and other parts of GM cars and trucks are made.  </P> <P> When the supply of fuel tanks stopped, so did assembly plants.  </P> <P> The strike was seen as a signal of what the union could do to the auto maker if  national talks broke down.  </P> <P> By the time the six-day strike was over, seven assembly plants and portions of  more than a dozen component factories had been shut down, temporarily idling  more than 20,000 workers.  </P> <P> Whenever an assembly plant shuts down, layoffs ripple out. Depending on how  long production at an assembly plant is interrupted, effects can be felt  throughout the auto supplier industry, including plastic, glass, rubber and  steel makers.  </P> <P> Labor negotiations in the auto industry come as the economy is slowing down and  predictions of a recession are growing.  </P> <P> In 1970, an already weak economy slipped into recession when the UAW struck GM  for 69 days, said Donald Ratajczak of the Economic Forecasting Center at  Georgia State University in Atlanta. At that time, he said, GM played a much  larger part in the U.S. economy than it does now.  </P> <P> "Therefore, it (GM) by itself isn't going to take down the economy," Ratajczak  said Wednesday of this year's negotiations. "Although it's a negative. We're  being hit by negatives all over the place."  </P> <P> He said auto negotiations this year come "at a bad time when consumer  psychology is hurting anyway. You start to run up the unemployment rate (from a  strike) and you'll kill Christmas."  </P> <P> A strike that slows production conceivably could help clear out dealers' lots  of unsold cars, but inventories are already at optimum levels for this time of  year, the dealers say.  </P> <P> Auto dealers, struggling with slumping sales for nearly a year, have been  decreasing their orders to increase their profits.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore regrets the statement made by U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor on its bid to host the first  ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization [WTO]. Mr.  Kantor told reporters in Washington the meeting ought to be held  somewhere else. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said it was up to  members of the WTO and not the U.S. Trade Representative to  decide on the venue. The spokesman stressed that Singapore's  bid to host the conference stands.</p>

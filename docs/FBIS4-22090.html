			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Najwa 'Abd-al-'Aziz] </F>   [Text] Security authorities and some diplomatic quarters  are conducting extensive investigations into how the names,  posts, and movements of some foreign diplomats were leaked to  the extremist al- Jihad Organization members who were recently  arrested. Interpol is also participating in these  investigations.    The security authorities seized a list of the diplomats  targeted for assassination along with the members of the  extremist group, which was led by 'Adil 'Awad, who was killed in  the al-Munib battle on 14 April.    The extremists confessed to receiving instructions from  their  leadership abroad to assassinate the foreign diplomats,  especially Americans and Israelis.    The security authorities also discovered the underground  "cells," which the organization's members had prepared in  al-Qattamiyah and Bilbays to kidnap the diplomats and detain  them there.    An investigation is underway on how the detainees identified  the persons mentioned in the assassination list, which was  seized in one of the organization's hideouts. The investigation  authorities held face-to-face confrontations with the eight  defendants.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Yeltsin claims a convincing win in Russian referendum RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin yesterday claimed to have won a convincing, if not absolute, victory in Sunday's referendum but his opponents immediately dismissed the result. Mr Yeltsin's office said he won 59.2 per cent support for his presidency in the first 79 of Russia's 88 regions to tally results from the referendum. Voters also backed the government's reform policies, with 53.61 per cent declaring their support. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament, dismissed the results and claimed the referendum had split society. He accused Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the Yeltsin aide in charge of the state-owned media, of 'Goebbels-style lies'. While only a simple majority was required for the first two questions, Mr Yeltsin failed to achieve the absolute majority required by the constitutional court to call early parliamentary elections. Only 42.9 per cent of the electorate of 106m supported early elections, with which Mr Yeltsin would like to combine the introduction of a new-style bicameral parliament foreseen by his draft constitution. The results confirmed that he was more popular than the parliament, with only 32.8 per cent of the electorate supporting early presidential elections. Although aggregate results were not yet available, turnout was reported by the Russian Information Agency as just above 60 per cent. Mr Alexander Rutskoi, vice-president, another high-profile Yeltsin opponent, said it was impossible to talk of 'overall popular support' for the president. Mr Vladimir Isakov, the co-ordinator of the parliament's hardline Russian Unity bloc, said the results gave 'neither political nor moral ground for any unconstitutional acts by the president'. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and a key Yeltsin aide, said the president would move swiftly to capitalise on the results. There would be a cabinet shake-up on Thursday and a new constitution would be discussed with leaders of the republics and regions this week before it was submitted to parliament. If deputies refused to adopt the constitution, Mr Yeltsin would call immediate parliamentary elections. 'There must be no cavalry charge but nor can the president sit on the result,' Mr Shakhrai said. He stressed the need for rapid action in the economic sphere, particularly on inflation. Mr Yeltsin's support was at its highest in Moscow and St Petersburg, but lower in the central provinces and rebel autonomous regions. US president Bill Clinton telephoned Mr Yeltsin yesterday to congratulate him and said he expected the outcome would make it easier to win Congress backing for additional US aid.

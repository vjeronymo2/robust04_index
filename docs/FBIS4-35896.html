			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Ministers Taha Yasin Ramadan and Tariq  'Aziz and the ministers took the constitutional oath today  before leader Saddam Husayn, president of the republic and prime  minister, may God preserve him.    The leader president, may God preserve him, chaired the  first  meeting of the new Council of Ministers, which lasted  approximately four and a half hours. During this meeting, his  excellency delivered the following valuable and important speech:    First, we would like to thank brother Ahmad Husayn for  assuming the tasks of the prime minister over the past period.  He exerted his utmost in this field.    The statement of the Revolution Command Council was very  clear. Our assessment was that our circumstances require this  formula in terms of the presidency's relationship with the  Council of Ministers, despite the fact that it will increase our  burdens and cost us extra time. This, however, is required.    You will continue to assume your ministerial posts, except  the agriculture minister, who was previously a minister. Now,  he is a comrade in the party and a governor and knows our  course. The new thing, however, is the new situation.    The new thing is that, as you recall, we addressed the  Iraqis  on one occasion and told them: You are in the last 10 days of  Ramadan. Some people interpreted this by saying that these are  the last 10 days and that the blockade will be lifted on 'Id  al-Fitr. They also said that something would happen. I heard  these interpretations from some people.    Meanwhile, what we meant by the last 10 days is the fact  that  the largest period of time has passed and that the reward of the  whole month will be gained during the last 10 days. In other  words, man will either succeed or fail. The last 10 days need  additional patience and efforts so that man will gain the reward  of fasting during the month of Ramadan.    Addressing the members of the Council of Ministers, his  excellency said:    In the past, ministers might have taken their time and read  the newspapers before beginning work. But, now, the first thing  I will do is read the newspapers after dealing with the basic  components of the morning mail. As of now, every minister  should be in his office at 0800. This is the first measure to  be carried out by all, except the sick person, who should  telephone Dr. Khalil al-Ma'muri, secretary of the Council of  Ministers, to inform him that he cannot report to work at his  ministry. This will help us know that he is sick, to be  reassured about him, to wish him good health, and to follow up  his medical situation. Those who are not sick should be present  in their ministries at 0800. I do not want any other excuses.    This issue has someething to do with some psychological  reasons. Someone might contend that he is making field visits.  Nonetheless, I would like to answer him, saying that working at  his ministry is more important to me than making his field  visits. I am well aware of the value of field visits. My  rationale in this regard is that once the ministry employees  feel that their minister reports to his ministry at 0800, they  will do their utmost to be there at 0800. But, if the minister  arrives at his ministry at 1100, yawning, the director general  will, in his turn, report to his office, yawning at 0900. As  for the ministry's under secretary, he will report to the  ministry a little bit later. He might report to his office at  0930. Beginning with the chief of the Presidential Office, all  Iraqi employees must report to work at 0800. There can be no  excuse for those who might say that they slept late, and  consequently woke up late. They have to sleep early. Those who  were used to sleeping at 0200 must get used to sleeping at 0100.  If they cannot sleep before 0200, they must wake up at 0500, or  0600 until they get used to sleeping early after close of  business. I am not saying this out of theoretical or  imaginative conceptions of my own. I have applied this myself.  Sometimes, I get busy for some reason or another. The reason  might not be that important. I might stay up late until 0200.  Nonetheless, I get up at 0500 or 0515. Right now, we must  abandon the morning sleep, and report to work at 0800 so that  all employees may see us. We must revive and reactivate the  state. Can we not do this?    I have told you that we cannot forge legends. However, we  can do this. I am pressing for early reporting to work for  psychological reasons. Some of you might be working more hours  than those I am demanding of them, which should begin at 0800.  But what I am talking about is discipline, as well as the  psychological aspect of state employees. The influence the  minister has when he works a certain number of hours, or an  additional number of hours is less than the influence he has  when he reports to work on time. This is because in the latter  case, all employees would feel that the minister reports to work  on time, just like all ministry employees.    What I want to discuss in this meeting -- which has no  agenda -- is the living conditions of our people, and some  phenomena which I noticed in the state departments in general so  that the brother ministers will work toward overcoming these  phenomena once we reach agreement on them.    Regarding the people's standard of living, I will explain to  you how I view prices so that you may not imagine that I am  unaware of the minor details, and that being what I am will make  me unaware of minor things in the life of the people, and that  consequently, I would ask you for things that would appear  illogical.    Price increases, except for those of the commodities listed  on the ration card, are inevitable. Why? At the beginning of  the blockade, the Ministry of Trade had its own stockpiles. In  the same vein, citizens had their own stockpiles. A section of  the society benefiting from this situation emerged. This is  natural. It happens in all wars all over the world. It happens  in socialist and capitalist countries alike. That is, people  benefiting from the difficulties experienced by their countries  do emerge. These people take advantage of the hardships that  emerge in their countries. These people have emerged because the  revenues they make are less in value than the efforts made. The  greater part of these revenues is deemed illegal in terms of  legitimacy, fairness, and religious rulings. These people are  engaged in trade, using their possessions on the market in an  unnatural manner. For instance, when one of them is offered a  single commodity, and he has 300 million dinars with him, when,  by God, he did not have 1,000 dinars with him in the past, let  us say that this commodity is a car, and that it was offered for  15 million dinars, he would say: Well, why not buy it at this  price? So, these people are not engaged in exploitation only in  their well-known areas. They have turned into a factor that  increases the value of market commodities. I have cited this  example to let you know that I am following up on people's  lives. I am well aware that some people are saying that not a  single dollar is being spent on agriculture. Nonetheless, there  are two factors that are contributing to increases in the prices  of agricultural produce. These factors have nothing to do with  the traditional equation of supply and demand. The first factor  concerns the comparison phenomenon, and its psychological  impact. This prompts vendors to constantly demand higher  prices. This is because they live in areas where they see the  prices of chairs and any other commodities, for that matter,  rising. Consequently, the okra vendor contends that his okra,  compared to their chair, must be equal in value to the legs of  the chair. That is why he demands a price equal to the value of  the legs of the chair.    In addition to this psychological impact, you are well aware  that the components of the society influence each other. We  have taught our society that all are equal in their human value,  and that there is no difference between the children of a  minister, and those of a peasant. In the past, people used to  wonder about the wide gap existing between different classes of  the society. You recall that statements to this effect were  made in alleyways, houses, and rural areas. Nowadays, this  statement is no longer heard. As a matter of fact, children in  rural areas are telling their fathers that the children of so  and so minister or merchant are wearing a certain brand of  clothes, and that they want the same brand of clothes. This  psychological consciousness of the importance of equality, even  though when it is only in form rather than substance, also plays  a basic role in price increases. This is because this increases  the obligations of people who have possessions for sale. This  pushes in the direction that we have just mentioned.    Moreover, there is also the transport sector. We do not have  new means of transport to augment the private sector's fleet,  ensure adequacy in terms of transport capabilities, and allow  fares to remain at certain levels, to make them stand still, or  to reduce them. The number of vehicles in the country has  remained unchanged, and so has the number of tires. Hence, if  we only examine the transport factor, along with another factor;  namely, that peasants do not all work with their own hands,  particularly since many of them pay daily wages for workers,  whose wages affect other workers' wages, we can come up with  some conclusions. So, we can identify two factors, at least, in  this regard. The first is a psychological and social factor, an  indirectly economic one. The other is a directly economic  factor. These two factors play a role in raising the prices of  tomatoes, even though peasants are not importing chemical  fertilizers for them from abroad, and although they do not pay  the wages of plowing in dollars, not to mention the fact that  some peasants lease their tractors and similar equipment.    What I want to say to you is that I am following up things  and thinking them over as much as I can. Do not imagine that I  am unaware of things. I follow up people's life. I want to say  that we can do something, but what is it?    I prefer that we hold a dialogue about this, and that each  of  you makes his suggestions, hoping that you make these  suggestions as brief and concise as possible.    The two deputy prime ministers and the ministers presented  a number of ideas and proposals which were discussed.    The leader president then said:    The blockade will end just as any other issue. Wars have  ended and there are still other wars. The blockade started on a  certain day, and there must be a day when it will end. It is  clear that the remaining time is less than the time which has  elapsed. I believe that the expression we used before is  accurate. However, the basis which will end the blockade, keep  Iraq just as its sons want it to be, and end any strong storm  with the fewest possible losses or ysacrifices, with the  continuation of the basic constants wished by its sons, the  people of the country, lies in the people of the country  themselves. The basis lies in the people of the country. The  responsibility increases gradually in accordance with the level  of influence and center of influence among the people of the  country. It is natural that the minister's responsibility of  steadfastness differs from the responsibility of others. This  means that the minister's sense of responsibility and the level  and size of influence differs from that of the ordinary employee  or citizen in the state of Iraq. Thus, this includes members of  the leadership, beginning with the ministry's under secretary,  the director general, and ends with the end of the job scale.    From the beginning we said that the basis that will fragment  or lift the blockade is you. Why you? Because the more you  increase your people's patience and ability to stand fast, the  more this will be in your favor to end the blockade in an  honorable way. Praise be to God that the country's  capabilities, its sons' capacity, and the level of their  awareness have remained intact regardless of the reckless  outbursts brought about by a quick assessment, or a quick or  hasty stand. I know the national essence of the people of the  country. They understand that they have no other choice. This  is how the situation can be decided the way we wish. The  ministers, when they increase their activity in their offices  and make their mental and organizational ability more efficient  and more effective, will play a role in increasing the patience  of the citizen, whether he is an employee or something else.    It seems that some sides mobilized the people in a way which  was interpreted as if the Iraqis should wait for good news, in a  dramatic sense, after the meeting, the UN Security Council's  meeting which was held in May. This is wrong and is contrary to  our policy. Our policy says that we are working in the  international arena with all our capabilities and mental  abilities. However, the basis which changes the international  approach is the Iraqis' position. The Iraqis weaken their  position in the international arena when they grumble too much  and when their balance of patience is disrupted. They weaken  their position in the international community, which has a  purpose. Even he who has no purpose will no longer be  enthusiastic about insisting on shortening the time for lifting  the blockade when he sees the people's resistance against the  blockade has become weak.    At any rate, when they tell you that prices are high, tell  them that we are working to mitigate their impact on you. But,  what is the alternative you have? Give it to us. When they  tell you that prices are high, and that there must be  restrictions, tell them: Okay. But ask them the following  question: If we were to set the prices for tomatoes, will you  refrain from buying them except at the prices set by the state,  or will you carry your bags and buy them regardless of the  prices set for them? But, if you want the state organs to  engage in a battle with a single sector of our people, while you  stand idly and buy from it, I would like to say that this is  unacceptable. Similarly, it is unacceptable for some of them to  utter the well-known Iraqi phrase: By God, you have the right  to do so. Vendors are telling you that transportation is  costly, etcetera. For those who say that they are not happy  with prices, we would like to say that we are willing to  transfer all powers of state organs to the concerned popular  councils and neighborhood residents so that they may set their  own prices and go by them. But, if they want the security organs  to carry out pursuit operations, imprison people, and batter  them for any violations, minor violations, when they refrain  from demonstrating cooperation to promote their own interests, I  would like to say that this is not going to be our own major  battle. Tell them that these phenomena are harmful to us and  you alike, and that what pains you pains our hearts. But, tell  us what is the thing that we are withholding from you, and  keeping from you in the circumstances of this crisis. Tell us  what it is that we can do, and have failed to identify; that is,  let us engage in a dialogue with them. We are supposed to  identify proper procedures and mistakes in the suggestions that  could be made by the director general or the ministry's under  secretary. We must engage in a dialogue on the issues that we  understand in our capacity as ministers. Likewise, we must  identify proper procedures and mistakes in their conceptions.  We must discuss proper measures at our council, regardless of  whether they were enunciated by laymen or responsible officials.  We must correct mistakes. Are you convinced that all ranking  officials in the state, the party, and the society are playing  their roles in terms of explaining to citizens mistakes and  sound thinking in their conceptions and behavior? Are we  incapable of correcting the citizens' conceptions? I would say  that we are capable of doing so.    Our citizens have a nationalist nature. They can hear facts,  and therefore, we must clarify facts to them in order for them  to be balanced. They have been used to this issue since 1969.  When onions, potatoes, or tomatoes become scarce, they make an  issue out of this, and when we give them a solution by the  available means, all of them will stand in the right position.  So, let's do so and rely on God.    At the end of the meeting, specialized committees were  formed  to study some urgent issues. The results of their actions will  be presented to the Council of Ministers soon.</p>

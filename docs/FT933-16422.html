			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures plunged to a discount to cash for the first time in recent sessions with its 2,900 resistance level smashed, Christine Buckley writes. The September contract reeled from end-of-account trading, a poor Wall Street opening and general gloom over Europe's economic picture. It closed at 2859, down 21 on its opening, with 8,837 contracts traded. Its estimated fair value premium to cash trailed 9.7 points. The downward drift was relentless, as institutional investors who had been bullish recently felt the cue to exit. A further body blow was dealt late in the day when 1,000 contracts were sold by an independent trader. An uncertain opening on Monday is feared. Large volume in traded options was triggered by the FT-SE and Asda. The FT-SE 100 option bounced by more than 9,000 lots to 14034, largely shaped by August 2,900 calls on fears of market volatility. Total volume was 52,050 with 8,797 lots in Asda on the back of results.</p>

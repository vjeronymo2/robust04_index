The group, also engaged in the communications business, saw turnover jump from Pounds 4.19m to Pounds 7.09m. The profit was up from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 2.21m, and included Pounds 401,000 exceptional net gain on the sale of the shareholding in AmBrit International.

In communications, turnover more than doubled to Dollars 9m (Pounds 4.5m) while gross profit doubled to Dollars 2.9m. Earnings were 9.4p (7.19p) and the interim dividend is 3p on increased capital (2.5p).</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDING SHAKESPEARE  </P> <P> My heartfelt appreciation to the anonymous Costa Mesa woman who gave $10,000 to  the Grove Shakespeare Festival (Oct. 25).  </P> <P> But what a sad commentary it is on the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> None of the controversy over NEA funding would have happened if the endowment  had been spending its money wisely. Why can a woman who smears food on her  naked body get funding when a Shakespeare festival can't?  </P> <P> Our government should support the arts by helping to find the artist in us all  -- by funding programs that put poets, painters, writers and dancers in the  schools; by helping cities fund plays and concerts in our parks; by supporting  teaching inner-city youth to paint murals instead of graffiti.  </P> <P> Let experimental art and the private performance artists get funding elsewhere.  Let the government fund truly "public art."  </P> <P> MARK JAMES PAVLAKOVICH  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

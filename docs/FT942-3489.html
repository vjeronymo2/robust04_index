			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Strong US selling, technical trading and the weakness in other European markets together brought a sharp decline to stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. In its last week of trading, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,043. However, this was at a 16- point discount to cash, and together with active selling by a leading US broker, June fell steeply, pulling the underlying cash market lower. Attempts at a rally petered out as dealers reflected on the poor performance in European bond markets and carried out technical trading ahead of the contract's expiry on Friday. The tentative start on Wall Street led to a further fall in the June contract and it touched a day's low of 2,991 at around 3pm when it was trading at a 24-point discount to cash. Bargain hunting late in the session helped the contract steady and it closed at 3,011, down 34 from its previous finish and at a 4-point discount to cash. Volume, at 18,722 lots, was healthy. Turnover in traded options was modest, with a mere 22,252 contracts dealt, against Friday's 38,042. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 12,190 lots and the Euro FT-SE option 2,562 contracts. Tarmac was the most active stock option at 1,025 lots traded, followed by National Power at 901 contracts.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (11): Home town woes - Small brokers are feeling the pinch EVERY YEAR in Gifu there is a nearly-naked ceremony where hundreds of men gather for a traditional rite of male bonding. But this is hardly typical of a town in the heart of the Chubu manufacturing region which surrounds Nagoya. The area is steeped in conservative values. While manufacturing remains the engine of the Chubo economy, the finance community based in Nagoya has a problem. Nagoya lies about halfway between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's second city. The improvements in communications and technology have meant that business has steadily been sucked out of the Nagoya stock exchange and on to the larger markets of Tokyo and Osaka. Even the regional companies which have traditionally used a listing on Nagoya as a stepping stone are being tempted away. That only adds to the woes of small town brokers such as Dai-Ichi Gifu, already suffering badly from the bursting of Japan's bubble economy. Most of Dai-Ichi Gifu's customers are individual savers; in the past they have tended to invest in blue chip shares and, sometimes, local companies which they know well. Turnover has slumped with the stockmarket - particularly in pooled investments such as investment trusts, which paid the highest commissions. 'People have seen the value of their investment trusts fall sharply,' explains Mr Hiroki Mori, president of Dai-Ichi Gifu. 'They just are not prepared to buy any more until prices rise.' Mr Mori paints a picture of his customers which looks much like that of small investors everywhere. Contrary to the popular western myth of the housewife share trader in Osaka, it is usually the father of the family who takes the investment decisions. Mr Mori's male customers outnumber the women by four to one. They typically have stockmarket holdings ranging from Y2m to Y10m, and the money is split between two and 10 stocks. Average families might keep 10 per cent of their funds in shares, and only the most adventurous keep more than a quarter in equities. However, unlike many other countries it is not true that stock investment is more popular with the rich - Japanese investors tend to keep more of their money in property or deposits than their western counterparts. Dai-Ichi Gifu feels the backwash of the recession. Turnover is now only 20 per cent of the peak, and many of the brokers' 10,000 clients, who were dealing a couple of times a month, may now only trade once a quarter. Yet the firm has some protection. 'We have lower running costs than the big houses because rents and overheads are cheaper here,' says Mr Mori. 'Our 22 sales people are split between three branches and the firm only employs 45 people overall. Though turnover has fallen badly, we do not need as much as the large houses to keep going.' That may be true, but cost savings are still needed. The company has reduced its staff and is cutting back on information services such as chart books and monitors. Low revenues may mean that many small brokers will not survive, and some will have to try to fall back on their ties to larger firms such as Nomura - if big brother is willing to help. Mr Ichiro Kawai, president of the Nagoya exchange, offers little comfort to his beleaguered members. 'We are trying to encourage trade on the exchange, but what business there is gravitates to Tokyo or the futures market in Osaka. Things can not really improve until the economy turns around.' That will be some time.</p>

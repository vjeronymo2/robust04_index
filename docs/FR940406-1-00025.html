			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Lamar attainment and maintenance demonstrations did not follow EPA general guidance, the State included a commitment in the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP to conduct revised CMB analyses on all filters greater than 100 &mu;g/m3 and to use this information to assess the adequacy of the SIP. On September 20, 1993, the State submitted the revised CMB analysis but did not utilize the results in calculating a revised attainment and maintenance demonstration. The State determined that the receptor modeling performed for Lamar did not provide the conclusive source contribution information that would be necessary in order to adequately revise the Lamar PM&hyph;10 attainment and maintenance demonstrations. EPA has reviewed the State's analysis and concurs with the State's justification for using emissions rollback modeling in its attainment demonstration. In addition, because the emissions rollback modeling demonstration accounted for growth in source categories that were not even identified in the CMB analysis, EPA believes that the use of emissions rollback modeling provides for a more conservative prediction of future concentrations. Thus, EPA believes that the State's attainment demonstration adequately demonstrates that the Lamar PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will remain in attainment and maintain the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. (See the TSD for further information.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 &mu;g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 &mu;g/m3 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 50 &mu;g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 &mu;g/m3 (id.). The demonstration predicted that the 24-hour design concentration in the attainment year of 1994 will be 115 &mu;g/m3, thus demonstrating attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. The demonstration also showed that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be maintained in future years by predicting a 24-hour design concentration in 1997 of 116 &mu;g/m3.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since no violations of the annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS have been monitored in the Lamar area and since the attainment demonstration in the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP clearly shows attainment and maintenance of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, it is reasonable and adequate to assume that protection of the 24-hour standard will be sufficient to protect the annual standard as well. For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration, see the TSD accompanying this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. PM&hyph;10 Precursors   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act).   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis of the air quality and emissions data for the Lamar nonattainment area indicates that the PM&hyph;10 exceedances in the Lamar area are generally attributable to particulate matter emissions from area sources, mainly windblown emissions from agricultural lands, re-entrained road dust, cattle feed lots, and residential wood combustion. In addition, the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors. Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major stationary sources of precursors of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. If finalized, this finding would exclude major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors from the applicability of PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's proposed finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this document. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area, this finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementing the quantitative milestone and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to ensure timely attainment and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1)). Because the Lamar area can demonstrate expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS without taking credit for the reliance on the soil conservation plans, no further reductions are necessary. Therefore, EPA believes the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP satisfies the quantitative milestone and RFP requirement. However, there will be emissions reductions that occur as a result of the federally mandated soil conservation plans, which will help to ensure that the area attains and maintains the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Selling insurance AFTER SEVEN or eight years of argument, another decision point is approaching in the controversy over the disclosure of life assurance commissions. The Treasury, now the responsible government department, is preparing its reply to the Office of Fair Trading's latest proposals to rock the life industry's boat. In preparation, the Securities and Investments Board is setting up a special taskforce that will seek to draw up a disclosure regime to square all the circles. The OFT's recommendations in March included the compulsory 'hard' disclosure in cash, at an early stage in the selling process, of the commissions earned by independent financial advisers. Recently the Securities and Investments Board joined with the two junior retail investment regulatory bodies, Fimbra and Lautro (which may soon be combined within the new Personal Investment Authority), to produce a joint submission to the Treasury. Although this has not been published, it is known that it argues against hard disclosure, at least in so far as a harsher regime might be applied to IFAs alone. Yesterday the SIB chairman, Mr Andrew Large, said that he hoped the life industry would at last be able to escape from what he called a regulatory Bermuda Triangle, with the disclosure issue bouncing around repeatedly between the SIB, the OFT and the Treasury. With a call for 'one last push', he is setting up a taskforce of regulators to devise a permanent solution. The danger is that this will prove to be yet another vain search for an unattainable consensus. Mr Large appears to be relying, first, on a perception of fatigue within the life industry which might make companies and intermediaries less resistant to hard disclosure and, second, on a greater emphasis on the need for a level playing field for both IFAs and salesmen. The OFT took a purist view, arguing that IFAs hold themselves out to be giving independent advice, and therefore they must be ready to disclose the cost of that advice to their client. Salesmen acting for only one company are not required to disclose in the same way, however. If the Treasury comes to the decision that the OFT is right on this issue, SIB apparently will attempt to devise a solution that will be harsher for salesmen too, but will retain the competitive balance between the two distribution channels. It remains to be seen what the direct-selling life offices will think of this approach, although it is possible to guess. Regardless of such details, the Treasury should come to its decision on the broadest view, that transparency at all levels is needed if the market is to be balanced in favour of the client. The life industry has for too many years exploited poor disclosure standards in order to promote extravagantly expensive distribution channels and dominate the retail investment industry. The particular issue of commission disclosure by IFAs should not be allowed to delay progress towards better disclosure whatever the type of sales intermediary. The root of the problem of IFAs lies in the rigid polarisation rules. If the Treasury backs the OFT, the right response would be to devise a system of multi-company ties for those IFAs fearful of the effect of hard disclosure on this business. But the life industry has yet to demonstrate that it has the necessary flexibility to respond to the public interest. Mr Large may discover that one last push will not be enough.</p>

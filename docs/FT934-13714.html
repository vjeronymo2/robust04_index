			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cheung Kong pays HKDollars 500m for 15% of Allied Group MR Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings has acquired a 15 per cent stake in Hong Kong-listed Allied Group, one month after a government inspector issued a report listing numerous allegations of corporate misfeasance by Allied's former management. The investigation into five companies associated with Allied was launched in August 1992, and has had a drastic impact on their share prices. Cheung Kong has paid around HKDollars 500m (USDollars 64.7m) for its stake in the parent company, which analysts believe has an asset value more than double that figure. Cheung Kong is now the second largest shareholder in Allied Group, which controls two other listed companies with interests in manufacturing and property development. The largest shareholder, Mr Lee Ming-tee, holds a 29.9 per cent stake and there is speculation that he may sell, which would give control of the group to Cheung Kong. Following the recommendations in the government investigation, it is possible that legal action may be taken against the former management of Allied. Stock market regulators are also examining possible breaches of securities regulations. This has created substantial pressure for Mr Lee to withdraw from the group, and he recently resigned as chairman. Minority shareholders have yet to receive any direct benefit from the government's move to clean up the company, which has so far had to make provisions of HKDollars 43m as a result of the investigation. If Cheung Kong were to take control of Allied, however, it would be seen as arguably the most positive outcome of the 13-month, HKDollars 46m inquiry. The investigation will have shaken out a management which appears to have refused to play by the rules of a more tightly regulated stock market, and it will have replaced them with one of Hong Kong's most renowned deal-makers.</p>

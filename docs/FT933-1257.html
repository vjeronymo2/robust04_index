			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: OPEC ministers to meet in Geneva Oil ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather in Geneva tomorrow with the oil price languishing just above Dollars 16 a barrel despite this week's upheavals in Russia, writes David Lascelles, Resources Editor. Analysts say that the ministers will have to hammer out an agreement to hold production at around 24.5m barrels of oil a day - slightly less than the third quarter peak but 920,000 barrels above the official ceiling - if they are to provide the market with a firm underpinning. However, this meeting has been preceded by less kite-flying than usual, and analysts say the outcome is hard to call. Although the final quarter always produces a rise in demand, with the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere, there has been little indication that Opec is getting to grips with its over-production problems. The meeting will also have to address the question of how to re-integrate Kuwaiti output into the production ceiling, and consider the return of Iraq to the Opec fold.</p>

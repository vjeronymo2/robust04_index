			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: TWA unsecured creditors appoint advisers INDICATIONS of further behind-the-scenes activity at Trans World Airlines, the heavily indebted airline owned by Mr Carl Icahn, surfaced yesterday as a group of unsecured bondholders formally appointed financial advisers to represent their interests. The formation of an 'unsecured bondholders committee', and the appointment of advisers, follows recent talks between the international carrier and some of its secured bondholders over debt restructuring plans. The US courts last month confirmed the right of certain secured debtholders to repossess aircraft and engines if a deal could not be struck. TWA defaulted on a variety of payments due on its debt earlier this year. The unsecured creditors' advisers said they had already approached TWA about talks on the securities in default, but that no meeting had yet been set up. Mr Seth Schofield is to succeed Mr Edward Colodny as chief executive of USAir, one of the middle-ranking US carriers. Mr Colodny will be 65 in June, the age when USAir officers usually retire, but will remain as chairman. Mr Schofield is currently president and chief operating officer of the group.</p>

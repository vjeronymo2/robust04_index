			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UN in disarray as Serbs halt Croatia pullout: Fears grow that war could break out anew in Croatia THE future of the United Nations peace plan for Croatia was yesterday thrown into disarray after the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army announced it was halting its withdrawal from the east of the republic. The army statement coincided with renewed calls to the international community by Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, to send troops into the besieged city of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The military statement said the army had decided to halt its planned withdrawal and would 'undertake measures to defend its territory, population, and its forces in eastern Slavonija, Baranja, and Western Srem, Serb-occupied territories in Croatia'. The army's withdrawal is a key element of the UN plan agreed last December between Croatia, the UN and the Yugoslav federal army. Western diplomats said the army's statement could mean the start of another war in Croatia. But a UN official, anxious to salvage its peace mission in Croatia last night said the delay in the army's withdrawal was only suspended. She said the evacuation of the protected areas was supposed to be on a mutual basis, adding that three Croatian tanks had failed to pull back from the eastern sector. General Satish Nambiar, the UN commander, was holding negotiations with army commanders. However, western diplomats expressed serious doubts over the success of the UN operation. 'Time is running out,' a senior defence attache said. 'We are faced with delays in Croatia. It is becoming tense there again. We have talked about sending in aircraft to relieve Sarajevo, we have talked about imposing a wide range of sanctions. But we must have the political will to stop Serbia and to prevent the war from spreading to Kosovo and other parts of the Balkans,' he said. Yesterday, armed Serb militiamen finally allowed 6,000 Moslem women and children to travel to the western Croatian city of Split. They had been held hostage on the outskirts of Sarajevo by Serb gunmen demanding that food be allowed into the federal army barracks in Sarajevo. But the federal army and Serb irregulars continue to deny the people of Sarajevo any food, medicine and water. 'The army is starving the city into submission. Why is it that western aircraft can protect the air space for the Kurds, but it is unwilling to protect the air space and free the airport in Sarajevo in order to feed our people,' Mr Silajdzic said. Serb forces already control two-third of Bosnia. In Austria, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister, said the only chance to secure peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina was to create a restricted security zone around Sarajevo. In Brussels, Mr Willem van Eekelen, secretary-general of the nine-member Western European Union (WEU) criticised European Community states for their reluctance to use force to stop the fighting in Yugoslavia. Mr van Eekelen said 'We recognised these republics (Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegopared to defend those countries.' 'I think we have to do more to remain credible and faithful to our own principles,' he said. In Lisbon, attempts to reconvene the EC-sponsored peace talks stalled after Moslem representatives from Bosnia were unable to travel outside the republic. Mr Silajdzic said the peace talks were being undermined by Serbia. 'None of the agreement set down at the previous talks have been fulfilled. The roads (in Bosnia) have not been unblocked, and the airport has not been freed. Our country is being overtaken by fascists,' he said. In Bosnia, Borba, the Belgrade daily reported that General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army of Bosnia, demanded martial law for all Serbian-controlled territory, including suspension of all civilian institutions.</p>

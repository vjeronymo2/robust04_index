			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Jin Kai [6855 0418]: "Major Advances in </F> Applied Research on Coal Body Permeability Theory; Shanxi Mining  College Scientific Research Personnel Apply Their Newest  Research Achievement in Coal Production With Significant  Economic Results"]    [Text] Shanxi Mining College professor Ma Guangdi [7456  0342 4574], associate professor Zhao Yangsheng [6392 7122 0581],  and others have used the coupling action of coal body  deformation and water transfusion to do research on coal body  water injection theory and applications, and they have directly  applied their achievements in coal industry production.    Coal seam water injection is an engineering standard during  the coal mining process to reduce coal dust and prevent gas  eruptions and the occurrence of shock ground pressures. Because  China has no experimental standards for coal permeability  coefficients and coal body water conduction coefficients had  never been measured, on-site water injection mostly depended on  experience and water injection at most mines depended on their  situations, so it was difficult to obtain the expected results.    To undertake intensive research work on this topic, Ma  Guangdi, Zhao Yangsheng, and others developed their own coal and  rock body water conduction coefficient experimental console and  triaxial stress measurement instrument. They can use this  equipment to conduct research on coal and rock samples measuring  100 x 100 x 200mm. These dimensions are eight times those of  samples measured using similar experimental equipment in foreign  countries. It provided the conditions for doing research on coal  and rock pore and crack permeability, and it can be used to  study the permeability of softer rock. In addition, they  conducted 300 x 300 x 300mm coal sample tests and derived the  conclusion that the dimensions of coal bodies do not change  their permeability.    They also collected coal samples from China's seven big  unified distribution coal mines and conducted a large amount of  experimental research in the laboratory on coal bodies that  contain pores and cracks. They derived a mathematical model for  water conduction coefficients under the effects of  three-dimensional stress and pore water pressure, and the laws  of coal body deformation and effective stress caused by pore  water pressure, and produced a correction formula for the  (Taishaji) principle. These research achievements have laid a  solid foundation for coal seam water injection.    On the basis of a large amount of basic research, they have  conducted industrial experiments at Datong, Lu'an, Xishan, and  other coal mines in Shanxi Province. They successfully conducted  a coal seam water injection shock ground pressure prevention  experiment that enabled the safe extraction of 140,000 tons of  coal in one year from this work face. Their softening of  moderate hardness coal seams using coal seam water injection  overcame a problem in mining roof coal in moderate hardness coal  and led to success in a skylight coal mining method which  produced 1.65 million yuan in economic benefits for this mining  bureau in one year. Their water injection dust reduction  experiments have achieved a gratifying on-site result of a 63.2  percent reduction in dust.    They are now working on a scientific research project for  the  Ministry of Coal Industry in which they will complete research  on the water conduction properties of coal samples from all of  China's primary coal mines and will propose a water conduction  characteristic classification program.</p>

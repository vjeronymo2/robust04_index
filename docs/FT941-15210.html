			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Greece abandons pledge on staffing Greece's Socialist government has unveiled legislation which is likely to create 30,000 permanent civil service posts, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The draft law, to be presented to parliament later this month, appears to signal the Socialists' abandonment of an earlier commitment to the European Union to cut public sector staffing levels. Permanent jobs for public sector workers employed on contract for at least six years would swell the civil service by about 8 per cent and further burden this year's budget. The Socialist government assured the European Commission earlier this month that Greece would renew efforts to cut its borrowing requirement, estimated at 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993. The former conservative government's pledge to cut thousands of public sector jobs under a structural reform programme agreed with the EU was dropped last summer. The public sector wage bill soared after the conservatives granted extra pay rises and made more than 20,000 patronage appointments.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark eases against dollar STERLING, the dollar and the Italian lira all rallied against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers continued to believe that the Bundesbank would cut its official interest rates again this month, writes James Blitz. Earlier this week, the Bundesbank added liquidity to the German money market at a fixed rate of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the Lombard rate and 80 basis points below the level at which it was adding funds three weeks ago. Two Bundesbank Council members have also commented that the M3 indicator of monetary supply indicator should lose some of its status as the fulcrum of monetary policy. These moves give the impression that the Bundesbank has positioned itself to cut official rates to meet growing signs that the country is moving into recession. 'There is a growing perception that this is the big turn in German economic policy,' said Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London. These moves continued to push the dollar up to a London close of DM1.4730 yesterday, more than 3 pfennigs higher on the day and nearly 6 pfennigs higher on the week. Two of the free floating currencies in Europe, the lira and sterling, continued to gain ground. The lira closed at L888.0 against the D-Mark, L22.9 higher on the day, and a staggering L92 higher than its low point on Tuesday. Sterling also benefitted from the growing perception that a cut in German rates will weaken the D-Mark and give the UK government more room to manoeuvre on interest rate cuts. The pound closed at DM2.4900, up nearly 2 pfennigs on the day. By contrast, Mr Norman Lamont's speech to the Conservative Party conference, which was billed as outlining the government's new economic policy, did little to support the currency. The pound actually lost 2 pfennigs as an accompanying policy document was issued, bottoming out at DM2.4650. 'The speech and the Treasury document were a disappointment because there was nothing new,' said Mr Austin. 'It was a re-hash of the 1980s policy of throwing all the indicators into a basket and looking at them that way.' However, another analyst suggested that the increased emphasis on monetary indicators could be a precursor to a rate cut and that he would not be surprised by a 1 percentage point cut today, the final day of the conference. Currencies inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism did not rally because there were continuing fears of a realignment to support the weaker members. The French franc closed higher at FFr3.3920 to the D-Mark, while the peseta weakened to close at Pta71.45 against the German currency.</p>

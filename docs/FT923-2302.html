			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Mirror, mirror on the wall As every child knows, the Wicked Queen pioneered multimedia applications of the humble mirror to pursue her vendetta against the hapless Snow White, but the Audio-Vision-Mirror promises to be the modern equivalent. As you move in front of the mirror, you hear music and it begins to talk to you in stereo as a 3D object appears and multiplies into 10 pictures advertising products, applications and services. You are entranced and informed as the programme runs its course. That, at least, is the theory behind the mirror, which was developed by EC Tronics, sponsored by Seeboard and launched this week at the Seeboard Technology Fair in Brighton. Uses could include acting as a warning sign in factories, a menu board in restaurants or a marketing tool. EC Tronics: UK, 0273 818188.</p>

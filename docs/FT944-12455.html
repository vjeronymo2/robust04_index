			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Demand for Hanson International conglomerate Hanson was among the most heavily traded stocks in London as the shares received support from reports of higher commodity prices. Analysts said that the price for polyethylene, which is manufactured by Hanson subsidiary Quantum, had increased by five cents a pound. The fundamental firmness combined with an increasingly attractive yield has been encouraging buying interest after a steep slide since the start of the month. The shares firmed a penny to 231p, with 7.5m traded.</p>

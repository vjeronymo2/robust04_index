			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Electronics side behind Fairey's rise to Pounds 8.1m FAIREY GROUP, the diversified engineering company, reported a near-15 per cent increase, from Pounds 7.07m to Pounds 8.12m, in interim pre-tax profits  -a rise underpinned by a strong performance in its electronics and electrical power businesses. The improvement for the half year to June 30, achieved on turnover ahead some 12 per cent at Pounds 48.2m (Pounds 43.2m), resulted in earnings per share of 15.4p (13.3p). As expected, the interim dividend is raised to 3.3p (3p). The electronics and electrical power sector lifted operating profits to Pounds 5.08m (Pounds 3.68m) on turnover of Pounds 25.7m (Pounds 18.2m), helped by the contribution of LaserMike, acquired in August last year. In contrast, operating profits in aerospace and defence fell to Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 1.05m) on turnover of Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 12.1m). Mr John Poulter, chief executive, said the division's performance had been temporarily affected by the relocation of operations to a new site. He said that sub-contract work for the Tornado was coming to an end and it remained unclear whether Saudi Arabia will order more Tornados. However, he said the business was delivering steady results 'despite difficult market conditions.' The filtration and specialised ceramics sector saw operating profits of Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.51m) on turnover of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 12.9m). Net cash at the period end stood at Pounds 14.8m, compared to Pounds 12.7m at end-December, and will be used for a continuing, selective acquisition programme. In May, the group completed the acquisition of the minority in Arcom Control Systems. In addition it acquired Zygo's US non-contact laser gauging activities in June. This business has annual sales of about Dollars 4m (Pounds 2m). Since the end of June Fairey has also paid Pounds 10.3m in new shares for Infrared Engineering, a leader in the production of infrared technology-based measuring devices. Infrared had sales of Pounds 7.3m in 1991-92. COMMENT Since coming to market in November 1988, Fairey has enjoyed a positive cash flow resulting in a handsome cash pile. With additional small acquisitions expanding its range of products, a new Tornado order would be welcome but not crucial. Meanwhile, UK utilities provide a steady stream of orders and Fairey appears well positioned to take advantage of any upturn. Projected full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 17m give earnings of 31p a share, putting the company on a prospective p/e of 12.6. The stock looks safer but less exciting on the upside than some other engineering plays.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television More than anybody else, David Attenborough makes television respectable. However thick the anti-TV bile in cocktail party conversation, among people who give themselves away by knowing the plot of 'Neighbours' too well, everybody is happy to admit to watching David. He forms a link to the days of Uncle Mac when the role of the broadcaster was to explain the complexities of the world. Today, as we shall see in the opening episode of Life In The Freezer (BBC1, 8.00), he combines that avuncular quality with exploitation of the most modern technology. This six-part series on wildlife of the Antarctic - penguins, whales, seals and so on - has necessitated all sorts of new techniques simply to make filming possible at extremely low temperatures. That is followed by yet another new series, Goodnight Sweetheart (8.30), written by Marks and Gran, creators of 'Shine On Harvey Moon'. This time, instead of merely harking back to the 1940s the writers have enabled the hero, TV repair man Gary Sparrow played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, to flit between 1940s and 1990s via a time-warp pub.</p>

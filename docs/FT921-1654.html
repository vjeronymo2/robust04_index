			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Community across the divide: Chris Tighe finds there is common ground on both sides of the Scots border OVER tea and Border tart in Coldstream's Candy's Cafe, Mrs Peggy Allan assesses her allegiance in the devolution debate. Every Friday Mrs Allan travels from her home in Cornhill on Tweed, in England, across the bridge to Coldstream in Scotland to visit the hairdresser and the cafe. Like most Cornhill residents, the Allans are registered with Coldstream GP. When they go shopping for larger items they travel to Kelso in Scotland, where their daughter lives. 'I look more to Scotland than I do to England,' says Mrs Allan. 'You feel you're part of Scotland.' Talk of independence for Scotland upsets her. 'You'd lose part of your heritage. I wouldn't like it at all - I think we'd move to this side.' Mrs Jenny Waite, Mrs Allan's sister-in-law, feels differently. 'I think the Scots are the poor relations,' she says, citing the recent closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks. She would favour devolution 'if Scotland could stand on its own feet'. Mrs Waite and her husband Alec have lived in Coldstream for 30 years, although Mr Waite is from Cornhill on Tweed. He supports Newcastle United football team, but 'if Scotland are playing football against England it's Scotland he wants to win', says Mrs Waite. Cafe proprietor Mrs Madge Scott and her business partner Ms Kathleen Lees, both Scottish, feel that if Scotland became independent a rigid border post between Coldstream and Cornhill on Tweed would be 'ridiculous', given the links between the two communities. But they do support a degree of devolution for Scotland. 'We definitely need a bigger say,' says Mrs Scott. 'A lot of people would really like total independence but I don't think the country's rich enough.' Politically, Coldstream is complex. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, is defending the seat, while Berwickshire district council is dominated by the Tories, and its representative on the Borders regional council, Mr Donald Moffat, is a Scottish Nationalist. His call for independence is not anti-English, he says. 'In the Borders anything up to a third of SNP members are English.' A handsome 18th-century stone bridge links Coldstream (population 1,800) with Cornhill on Tweed (population 306). For many residents of Cornhill on Tweed the bridge is a lifeline to important services, including the hospitals to which their Scottish GPs refer them, as well as banks, chemists and chip shops. Cornhill on Tweed does have its own sub-post office, but the mail is sorted in Scotland and brought over the bridge. The village's telephones, all with a Coldstream code, are routed through BT's Galashiels exchange. Electricity also comes from Scotland. But the education system highlights the differences. Although Mrs Julie Grainger, the Northumberland-born head of the school in Cornhill on Tweed, lives in Scotland, she doubts she could get a comparable job there. She is not registered with the Scottish General Teaching Council as she trained in England. English and Scottish news-papers are displayed with equal prominence in the Cornhill on Tweed village shop, and the same customers buy both. The till has a special section for Scottish Pounds 1 notes, and the shop's stock includes Tweedside honey from Berwick-upon-Tweed and meat pies from Coldstream. 'I'd say I'm a Borderer,' says Mrs Mary Black, the shop assistant, who lives in Cornhill on Tweed but was born in Coldstream. Her colleague, Mrs Catherine Telford, who lives in Coldstream, concurs. 'We think of ourselves as Borderers. We are one.' But there has not always been this sense of unity. The English and the Scots fought bloody battles for control of the border lands, and just two miles from Cornhill on Tweed is Flodden Field, where in 1513 the Scots armies of James IV were destroyed by the English. A commemorative stone cross on the site is inscribed To the Brave of Both Nations. Mr John Kelly, who is house-hunting in Cornhill on Tweed, believes Scotland should give independence a try. 'English people, Scottish people, they're all the same,' he says. 'It's just the people trying to run the country that get on my nerves.'</p>

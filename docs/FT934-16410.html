			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: UK moves towards paperless trading THE UK securities industry took a small step forward in its quest for a paperless trading system yesterday when the three vendors of electronic trade confirmation (ETC) systems said they had set a date for testing a link between their systems. ETC is an automated screen-based process which replaces the current practice of sending paper contract notes between brokers and their institutional clients. ETC also shortens the time taken to confirm equity or fixed-income trades between brokers and institutions. This means any failed trades can be detected before they turn into expensive errors. Many institutions and brokers have backed the introduction of ETC, but few have subscribed to one of the three systems because they operate independently. As a result, they would have to subscribe to all three in order to confirm trades with each other. There has been an agreement in principle between the vendors to set up inter-vendor links (IVLs), but progress has been hampered by discussions about who will bear the development costs and how the charges for using the links will be divided. Yesterday, the International Securities Market Association (Isma), the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Thomson Financial Services announced an implementation plan for the trilateral testing of IVLs. Isma and the LSE will begin testing on November 29 and testing by Thomson will begin in early 1994. The first link between Isma and the LSE is expected to go live in April 1994 and Thomson expects its links with the other two to go live in August 1994. Mr John Lambert, chairman of a group of ETC users and operations director at Schroder Investment Management, said that brokers and institutions should now feel confident to make decisions about which system is most suited to them.</p>

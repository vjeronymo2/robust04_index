			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Scottish Provident Scottish Provident has cut payouts on short-term with-profits endowment policies, but lifted longer-term payouts slightly. A 25-year policy, taken out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, will pay Pounds 56,760 this year, up 0.6 per cent from last year, while a 10-year policy would pay Pounds 6,478, down 5.3 per cent. The company has also changed its annual bonus system, with different bonus levels on the sum assured and previous bonuses, rather than a single level as before. So rather than 5.2 per cent overall on life contracts paid last year, this year the figures are 4 per cent on the sum assured and 6 per cent on existing bonuses. This rewards longer term policy-holders more, as they have accumulated more bonuses. Terminal bonus scales have been adjusted to pay more to longer-term policies. Bonus rates on unitised with-profits policies have also been cut, from 8.5 per cent to 7.75 per cent for life, and 10 per cent to 9 per cent for pensions. Royal Life has increased payouts on with-profits endowments by increasing terminal bonuses. The pay out on a 25-year policy is Pounds 61,172, up 10.1 per cent, and for a 10-year policy, Pounds 5,878, up 0.1 per cent. Reversionary bonuses on unitised with profits policies have been held at 6.5 per cent, but terminal bonuses have been raised from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Retail fall hits recovery hopes THE PROSPECT of an imminent consumer-led recovery collapsed last month as retailers suffered the largest year-on-year decline in sales and responded with the sharpest cut in orders to suppliers since the Confederation of British Industry started its distributive trades survey in 1983. The latest survey, covering 290 retailers, 157 wholesalers and 79 motor traders, paints a picture of falling sales, orders and expectations in almost every sector. The survey was conducted between July 20 and August 5. Retail sales in July slipped below their level of a year ago for the second successive month, and the decline is accelerating. Of the retailers surveyed, 33 per cent said the volume of sales in July was higher than a year ago while 48 per cent said the volume was lower. The percentage-point balance of - 15 compares with - 3 in June and positive balances in the previous two months. Retailers said that sales for the time of year were more depressed in July than at any time since the survey began. Only 6 per cent of retailers said sales were good and 52 per cent said they were poor. The percentage-point difference of - 46 between those reporting good and poor sales follows a balance of - 21 in June and a previous low of - 27 in March when sales were depressed in the run-up to the election. Only chemists, confectioners and grocers saw business improve in July, while stores supplying durable goods for the home continue to be badly affected by the depressed state of the housing market. Grocers reported a slight annual sales increase in July but the balance of +3 reporting higher rather than lower sales, compared with a year ago, was the lowest since the survey began. By contrast clothing and footwear sales showed a marked annual decline in July, after growth in volumes during the preceding two months, and furniture and carpet retailers reported the second sharpest annual declines in sales. The balance reporting higher rather than lower sales fell from - 2 in June to - 43 in July, with the sector's fall on the year outstripped only by specialist food retailers. Retailers expect little improvement. Sales in August are expected to decline again, though at a slightly slower rate than in July. Among retailers, 29 per cent expect higher sales compared with 39 per cent predicting lower sales. The balance of - 10 compares with a balance of +1 in last month's survey, suggesting that retailers were expecting July to be a better month than it turned out to be. Depressed sales caused retail stocks to rise slightly last month and retailers have cut-back their orders to suppliers. A balance of +21 said that stocks were too high, compared with +19 in June, and the volume of orders placed with suppliers fell for the second month running. Sales volumes in the motor trade are expected to increase slightly in August compared with a year ago but sales are expected to remain poor for the time of year.

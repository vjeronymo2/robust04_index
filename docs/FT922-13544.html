			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: American Airlines overhauls domestic fare structure AMERICAN Airlines, one of the three largest US airlines, yesterday unveiled details of a radical and much-rumoured overhaul in its domestic fare structure, writes Nikki Tait. American said that, for domestic travel starting on April 13, it planned to operate four principal fare classes, with fares generally lower than full fares for comparable existing classes. First-class fares, for example, would be 20 to 50 per cent lower than existing full fares for first-class. On the minus side, the company will discontinue corporate discounts, and charge a Dollars 25 fee for rescheduling or refunding tickets. The overhaul will reduce the number of different fares offered from 500,000 to around 70,000. Some analysts, however, saw move as an implicit attempt to push up fares. Few travellers pay full coach fares at present, and businesses often find discount alternatives. Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, stressed that this was not a 'one-off' promotional scheme, but a fundamental overhaul of pricing policy. He denied that American was responding to aggressive pricing tactics by either Southwest Airlines, the smaller carrier also based in Dallas, or Trans World Airlines, which is in bankruptcy and has been slashing fares to attract business customers. Both Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, American's biggest rivals, said that simplified fares made sense, and pledged to remain competitive. Northwest Airlines, Continental and America West, a smaller bankrupt carrier, also said they would adjust fares. Mr Crandall admitted that American could lose some revenue in the short-term  -he put the second-quarter figure at around Dollars 100m - but estimated the long-term annual benefit at Dollars 300m to Dollars 350m. The simpler structure, he added, could lead to annual cost savings of around Dollars 25m. PWA, the parent of Canadian Airlines International, is seeking CDollars 200m (USDollars 169.5m) cash in return for selling 25 per cent of the airline to American Airlines. Analysts had estimated Mr Eyton would seek about CDollars 100m in new equity for Canadian. The two companies are now in negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> LEGACY OF STATE'S COASTAL ACT CAN BE SEEN BY WHAT'S NOT THERE NOW  </P> <P> As spades begin to turn over dirt on the majestic coastal lands between Corona  del Mar and Laguna Beach, it seems appropriate to think about what might have  been had there been no Coastal Act.  </P> <P> It is no accident that those who use Coast Highway have a glorious view of the  Pacific Ocean for a 3-mile stretch along the Irvine Coast. It is no accident  that the public now has access to the beaches that hug the bluffs that line the  water's edge. It is no accident that when development takes place on the inland  side of the Irvine downcoast property, wildlife habitats will be protected, the  watershed will remain, the effects of traffic and air pollution will be  minimized, and both the public and the landowner will benefit.  </P> <P> The present Irvine development plan is no accident because the Coastal Act  forced discussions among the Irvine Co., government agencies and  environmentalists who together shaped the company's plans. Had there been no  Coastal Act, chances are there would now be fewer views, limited public access,  fewer wildlife habitats and watersheds preserved, and more intense development.  </P> <P> This is not to suggest that the Irvine Co. has no social conscience nor concern  for environmental quality. However, the goal of a landowner is to develop land  to its highest and best use. This does not always generate views available to  the public, access and environmental quality. Therefore, it is the role of  government to see that a given development does not adversely affect the  quality of the environment.  </P> <P> Monitoring development along the coast is the task that was given to the  Coastal Commission by the 1972 Coastal Act, and monitor it does! Yet for a  variety of reasons, most residents have little awareness of the connection  between the California Coastal Act and the coastal landscape in Orange County.  </P> <P> The Irvine Coast development plan is but one example of the monitoring process.  Other examples abound. Before the Coastal Act was passed, the Avco property in  Laguna Niguel (part of which is home to the Ritz-Carlton hotel) was planned for  much more intense private development. The original Avco plans called for a  commercial strip along Coast Highway, a private golf course that would not  extend to the sea, and building that would make the sticks and stucco in the  area there today seem insignificant.  </P> <P> Coastal commissioners and their staff spent years working with Avco to change  the company's blueprints. And although there are still pockets of opposition to  what is being built, the Laguna Niguel development today shows far more  sensitivity to environmental concerns than the one proposed before there was a  Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Crescent Bay Park in Laguna Beach is another example of the work of the Coastal  Commission. Each year thousands of people visit the park to revitalize their  spirits or watch the start of the Ensenada Race or even exchange their marriage  vows. This beautiful vista point exists because the Coastal Commission, under a  provision of the Coastal Act, was able to deny the building permits for two  large homes that would have blocked the view of the famous sea lion playground.  By denying the permits, the Laguna Beach and the county were able to purchase  the land for public enjoyment.  </P> <P> The Balboa Pavilion site, which boasts of eating places, boat rentals, clothing  shops, a merry-go-round and Ferris wheel, is another example. Newport Beach had  rezoned the area from commercial to residential and approved a proposed  development for locked-gate condominiums on the site. The Coastal Commission  denied the permit. Had that not happened, the Balboa Ferry today would be  transporting condo owners instead of families and bicycles.  </P> <P> In Huntington Beach, the degraded Bolsa Chica wetlands now have a chance for  restoration because of the combined efforts of the Bolsa Chica Amigos and the  Coastal Commission. These wetlands -- which serve as open space, flood control,  a toxics filter, a fish nursery and a bird sanctuary -- were destined to become  a massive commercial yacht harbor.  </P> <P> It was predicted that the proposed harbor could have resulted in destruction of  valuable beachfront, would have necessitated the moving of Pacific Coast  Highway and would have cost the taxpayers millions of dollars. Coastal  wetlands, a public resource, have been devoured by private developers up and  down the coast, and local government officials now acknowledge that the Bolsa  Chica wetlands need to be protected.  </P> <P> These are a few of the major accomplishments of the Coastal Commission in  Orange County over the last 15 years. If colored pins were to be stuck in the  places along the coast to indicate where development plans were denied or  improved, where beach access was obtained, where coastal bluffs were retained,  where wildlife and marine life were protected, and where the attitudes of local  officials toward environmental issues were changed, Californians would quickly  see that indeed coastal resources are being protected -- albeit not as well as  some would like.  </P> <P> The legacy of the Coastal Act is not easy to assess. It is as much measured in  the development you don't see as in the quality of development you do see. It  is as much measured in the views and public access you enjoy as in the citizen  participation that made the views and access possible. It is as much measured  in changed attitudes about protecting the environment as in seeing how  public-private partnerships have been forged to protect coastal resources.  </P> <P> As we anticipate the reaction that will come when the hotels, roads and houses  begin to sprout along the Irvine coast, we should remind ourselves of what  might have been!  </P></p>

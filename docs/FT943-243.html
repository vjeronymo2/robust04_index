			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Unit trust net sales rise to Pounds 773m Sales of unit trusts rose last month to a net Pounds 773m from Pounds 646m in July. However, the figure was below the net sales of Pounds 981m in August last year. The number of accounts was a record 6.04m. The figure has risen by a third since January 1992, as private investors have turned to equity-related products in the search for better returns against a background of low interest rates.</p>

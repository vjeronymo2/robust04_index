			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: BES investors face threat to tax relief MORE THAN 55,000 investors in loan-back business expansion schemes stand to lose tax relief if proposals for an amendment to the Finance Bill are enacted. Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, proposed this week that an investor in a BES where shares were issued after December 31 1992 should lose relief on a loan taken up after June 30 this year. 'This would be retrospective legislation of the worst possible kind,' said John Spiers, of BESt Investment. 'It would be devastating.' Loan-back schemes allowed investors an exit from their investments after six months and were introduced in September to attract more investment. The majority of business expansion schemes issued this year have been loan-back, and Spiers estimates Pounds 556m has been raised by some 55,000 investors since the beginning of January. They get tax relief at their highest marginal rate, and loan-back schemes depend on this relief in order to work. By offering these loans after six months - typically, of 75p for every Pounds 1 invested - banks and building societies gained cheap finance. Top-rate taxpayers benefited since, effectively, they invested only 60p for every Pounds 1 received by the institutions. Schemes where shares were issued after midnight on March 15 were abolished by the chancellor in the Budget. But Stern's proposal would make loans on all the BES companies launched in the busiest period of the year - from January until the chancellor's Budget deadline - ineligible for tax relief. Mavis Seymour, BES tax specialist at accountants Stoy Hayward, said: 'People who applied for shares did so because they thought there would be no loss of BES tax relief if the loan was taken. Someone who invested their redundancy money would have had every reason to suppose that the law would not change.' Stern has also proposed another change which would make loans received in these schemes liable to capital gains tax, and BES sponsors this week expressed surprise and alarm at the proposed amendments. 'We are all very concerned about it,' said Tim Heaton, business development manager of Close Brothers, the second-largest sponsor of loan-back schemes. 'Stern is trying to put the kybosh into these schemes even more than was originally envisaged.' Ross Macdonald, partner at Neill Clark, added: 'I'm totally against Stern's proposals because investors invested on the basis of the law as it stood. It would be disappointing - to put it mildly - if this went through.' Stern's proposals, if selected for debate, would not be discussed for several weeks and the Finance Bill is not expected to be enacted before the end of July. Meanwhile, National Westminster bank and BZW, the securities arm of Barclays bank, are expected to take the Inland Revenue to court over the tax status of the loan-back BES companies which they launched before the Budget. The Revenue said recently it did not accept that shares in them had been issued in time to beat Norman Lamont's deadline of midnight before the Budget.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Market fear more likely a phobia Sir,Richard Waters' article on the structure of the US stock market ('The price ofa share in the cake', January 31) provided an interesting view on the problemsarising as a result of market fragmentation. However, I would suggest that 'a far-reaching fear. . .that if the volume of share trading is divided among an increasing number of arenas, the efficiency of the market will eventually be undermined' is more truly a phobia. Surely if shares in a given company are traded on several arenas then arbitrage will occur to the extent that all arenas in toto will act as efficiently as if they were a single market. After all, isn't this what happens to a large degree with the markets for international currency?

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Man in the News: Rough words, smooth player - Umberto Bossi In Italian politics, battles are usually won without ever being fought. Politicians posture loudly, muster their weaponry in public but rarely move to a real confrontation. Instead, behind the smokescreen of belligerent statements, they measure the strength of their opponents. Then a deal is struck on the basis of a hypothetical battle. It is essential to grasp the nature of this phoney warfare to appreciate the game played out this week by Mr Umberto Bossi, fiery leader of the populist Lombard League. Through a mass of contradictory and increasingly belligerent statements, Mr Bossi has been seeking to extract the maximum price for forming a government with media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini. The stakes are high. For the past three years, Mr Bossi and the Northern League have represented the one genuinely new national force in Italian politics and have played a vital role in breaking the hold of the traditional parties. But the sudden appearance and extraordinary electoral success of fellow northerner Mr Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement has threatened to eclipse the League and with it the political career of Mr Bossi. Mr Bossi's aim has been to ensure the League retains its identity within the government likely to be formed by Mr Berlusconi and to prevent the media mogul from dominating the exercise of power. But behind these strategic aims, there has been considerable bile. Mr Bossi finds it hard to stomach the success of Mr Berlusconi whom he regards as a political parvenu. His political career has been a tough, lonely 15-year struggle to forge a grassroots protest movement based on the support of small traders, artisans and blue-collar workers in the industrial heartland of the north around Milan. His target has been constant: misgovernment by Rome. It was largely a one-man show based on Mr Bossi's enormous energy, personal magnetism and his ability to formulate a political credo in clear terms (often delivered in the coarsest of language). In contrast, Mr Berlusconi has become a national political leader in less than four months, riding effortlessly on the back of his huge financial and media resources. Even the two men's styles of dress are different. Mr Bossi's clothes are wrinkled, the colours clashing, the tie askew and hair dishevelled. Mr Berlusconi is carefully manicured, a double-breasted suit meticulously pressed, the colours matching. Thus it was not so surprising that at the beginning of this week Mr Berlusconi was being branded by Mr Bossi as a 'threat to democracy'. By mid-week, Mr Bossi ever-more garrulous, had dubbed the man likely to form Italy's next government as Berluskaiser - Berlusconi the Kaiser. To raise the stakes, Mr Bossi succeeded in injecting a new element into the phoney war. He gave the impression that he was actually serious when he threatened to keep the League out of Italy's next government. He also began to talk of teaming the League with the centre and left parties defeated in last month's general elections. Tension increased further when Mr Berlusconi cut off negotiations with Mr Bossi and threatened - if asked by President Oscar Lugi Scalfaro to form Italy's next government - to chose whom he pleased. Mr Berlusconi, too, gave the impression his threat was real. But by the end of the week, it looked pretty much as though all parties had assessed each other's weaknesses and strengths. The three main parties that formed the Freedom Alliance (which won 366 of the 630 seats in the chamber of deputies) look condemned to forge an agreement to govern Italy. Mr Bossi was even seen shaking hands with Mr Fini. This was remarkable considering that Mr Bossi had recently dubbed the neo-fascist leader as a 'political nobody', and that during the election campaign he had said: 'Fascism cannot be allowed into the government. This would open the doors to Nazis in Germany and Le Pen in France.' Until now Mr Bossi has insisted his electoral alliance was solely with Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia. The kind of compromise Mr Bossi is seeking would be based on a clear commitment by the next government to bring in constitutional reforms that would make Italy a more federal state. In return, he would accept both Mr Berlusconi and Mr Fini's desire to introduce a strong directly-elected president (such as in France) but with a shorter mandate. But Mr Bossi can only sell this to his League rank and file, he said in a newspaper interview yesterday, if 'Berlusconi divests himself of all interests which are incompatible with holding government office'. Mr Bossi acknowledged this could be an obstacle. 'This autocrat will have immense power in his hands: the government, parliament, television, newspapers, publishing, insurance, mutual funds and store chains. This has to be monitored . . . The League will do this. It will be the guarantor of democracy.' Mr Bossi is right to raise these issues, just as he is to question the presence in a future Berlusconi-led government of the MSI, given its unreconstructured fascist wing. But the Lombard leader's political credibility is undermined by the opportunistic way he took advantage of his alliance with Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia to fight the elections. If the League does not join the government, it risks losing supporters to Mr Berlusconi. Mr Bossi would then become the head of a querulous regional party, whose power base was limited to Piedmont, Lombardy and the Veneto. If the League does join the government, it has to keep itself distinct from Forza Italia and ensure it is strong enough to outlive the Berlusconi phenomenon. It is also a fair bet that Mr Bossi himself will not be part of the government. He wants to keep his powder dry to snipe from the side-lines, permanently threatening to pull League support away from Mr Berlusconi. The next few days will determine whether Mr Bossi will become a serious player on the national scene or be marginalised to run a vituperative regional party.</p>

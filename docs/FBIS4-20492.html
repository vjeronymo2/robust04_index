			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Shi [2621 1102]: ``Beijing Free Electron </F> Laser Facility Achieves Saturated Oscillation; Maintains Leading  Position in Asian Region'']    [Editorial Report] Additional details on the 28 December  1993 realization of saturated oscillation at the Beijing Free  Electron Laser (BFEL) facility not already reported in an early  summary [see JPRS-CST-94-002, 25 Feb 94 p 26] are as follows:  After their successful realization of Asia's first infrared FEL  oscillation on 26 May last year, the BFEL scientists succeeded  in raising the charge density of the electron beam in the  undulator interaction zone and improving the uniformity of the  electron-beam quality factor within the [4-microsecond-wide]  macropulse. This in turn permitted them to raise system gain  from the original 6 percent to 17 percent, at which point they  achieved saturated oscillation. Other parameters of the December  experiment include a saturated-oscillation maximum output energy  of 3 mJ, a saturated-oscillation pulse plateau width of 2 s,  and an intra-cavity oscillation average power of 190 kW. The  successful achievement of saturated oscillation indicates that  the BFEL facility and its key equipment -- the microwave  electron gun, high-power wide pulse modulator, NdFeB  permanent-magnet undulator, and five-dimensional high-accuracy  remote-controlled optical cavity resonator -- have attained a  world-class performance level.</p>

Start the season off with a positive professional  attitude. Perhaps you should be able to sit and watch the balloons and bands,  because, as you stated, without incentive clauses in your contract, your record  is incidental. What with your high salary and numerous endorsements, why worry  about opening day and your team?  </P> <P> L. CRAIG  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

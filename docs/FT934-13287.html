			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Management: Struggling with the curse of success the Kodaks, General Motors and IBMs of this world  - used to be held up as models for lesser fry to emulate. Remember In Search of Excellence, that best-seller full of gung-ho 'lessons from America's best-run companies', as its subtitle claimed? The troubles which have afflicted many of them since it was published barely a decade ago have taught us all to be a little more sceptical. The market shares of such enterprises may soar for a while and their profits defy gravity, but it has become obvious that most eventually fall prey to what is known in academic circles as 'the curse of incumbency'. When an innovator attacks their market, most incumbents fail to react effectively. Within a few years, even months in some unstable sectors, they are toppled from their perch  - Kodak by Fuji, GM by Ford, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, and IBM by the combined forces of clones, workstations, personal computers and Microsoft. A related example is Wang, which dominated word processing until PCs almost sank it. The popular explanation for this phenomenon is the 'fat and lazy' syndrome: a company grows over-confident, careless and sluggish, and either fails to spot the significance of an innovation or cannot stir itself to take remedial action until it is too late. In the post-war years most steam locomotive makers fell into this trap when they finally perceived the challenge from diesel-electrics was serious. As you might expect, academics suggest a set of more complex explanations. These attribute the phenomenon to economic, political or behavioural factors  - or to a mixture of all three. In a draft research paper, Diana Day of Philadelphia's Wharton School comes down against the economic view: that incumbents make a conscious choice not to innovate so as not to hit their existing 'rent' stream and the value of their underlying assets. Rebecca Henderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology takes a more catholic line. She suggests rational economics plays a part, although the fundamental problem is what she calls the power of 'embedded architecture'. As successful companies learn more and more about their existing products, services and ways of operating she says, this knowledge becomes deeply embedded within them: in their communications channels, information and accounting systems, strategies, structures and cultures. So they have difficulty recognising the innovative threat, and take too long to launch remedial action. Up to this point, Henderson's account parallels the 'inward focus' explanation of unresponsiveness put forward by Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, the IT services giant which is striving to avoid the problem (see this page, October 15). But Henderson elaborates further. Even if an incumbent manages to remain strategically alert and organisationally flexible, she says, uncertainty over whether the attacker will succeed may make it hold back from emulating the rival's innovation  - and thereby cannibalising its own product and considerable investment. If, for instance, a maker of chocolate bars began to promote the idea of consuming its products for breakfast  - a less far-fetched proposition than it might seem, since at least one manufacturer has considered it  - Kellogg would think a hundred times before following suit, Henderson told last month's annual conference of the Strategic Management Society in Chicago. Instead of rushing to destroy its market for cornflakes and other cereals, plus decades of its own investment, Kellogg would hold back and try to play safe by extending its existing products  - a process known generally as 'incremental innovation'. It might, for instance, launch banana-flavoured corn flakes, Henderson suggested. The depth of an incumbent's dilemma was illustrated further at the conference by P. Ranganath Nayak, a senior vice-president of the Arthur D. Little consultancy. As he pointed out, it is easy to recognise the potential of an innovation in retrospect, but tough at the time. Jet aircraft were once predicted to supersede propeller-driven aircraft completely, but have failed to do so. Microwave ovens were expected to oust conventional ones, but have expanded the market for home cooking. The pace of substitution is also difficult to predict. Diesel locomotives took about 20 years to replace the steam variety, while the partial incursion of jet engines into the propeller market was rapid, as was the take-off of the microwave oven market. Cash registers went electronic almost overnight, while compact discs have taken longer to oust long-play vinyl records. As Nayak says, the only solution is to watch constantly for competitive threats, especially from unexpected directions. To overcome their internal defences against innovation and self-cannibalisation, he advises incumbent companies to maintain a strong, but not necessarily large, central research and development effort, on the grounds that 'you can't ask the people who run an existing business to replace it'. To help create successful innovations, Nayak says that companies must also foster 'skunkworks' (small entrepreneurial teams), and collaborate more closely with customers, suppliers and competitors . Companies should also use a 'balanced scorecard' of measures, comprising not just financial yardsticks but also information on customers and technology. Above all, chief executives must be iconoclasts. As Nayak puts it, 'if the top is committed deeply to maintaining the status quo, there's no hope'.</p>

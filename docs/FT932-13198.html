			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Non-EC trade deficit narrows THE UK'S trade deficit with countries outside the European Community narrowed slightly last month, with export volumes starting to benefit from the devalued pound. In March the value of visible, or merchandise, imports from non-EC countries continued to exceed the value of exports but by only Pounds 918m. This compares with a visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.25bn in February. Export values reached a record high of Pounds 4.7bn, suggesting that companies are taking advantage of the lower pound. The trend was backed up by a similar rise in the volume of exports. These rose to a record high and were up 4.5 per cent in the three months to the end of March, compared with the previous quarter. Import volumes fell marginally month-on-month but were also 4.5 per cent higher than in the three months to December. A 16 per cent increase in import volumes compared with the same period a year ago was consistent with evidence that the economy is recovering. Excluding oil and erratic items, such as precious stones and ships, the Central Statistical Office figures showed that export volumes grew by 5.5 per cent in the latest quarter compared with the previous one. Underlying import volumes were up 3 per cent on the previous three months and 14 per cent on a year ago. Trends in export and import volumes for non-EC trade, excluding oil and erratic items, were rising at about 1 per cent every month. The figures, which account for just less than half of the UK's total trade with the world, showed a big rise in the UK's trade deficit with North America. This widened from Pounds 256m in February to Pounds 320m in March. The CSO stressed that it was not possible to deduce from the figures what was happening to trade with the EC. The first intra-community trade figures, measured by a new method, will be released on June 22. The balance of trade with Europe excluding the EC improved slightly on the month, but the value of imports from these countries - mainly eastern Europe and Scandinavia - rose by 31 per cent in the latest three months compared with the same period a year ago. This compares with a 6.5 per cent increase in export values. Export growth has been concentrated in basic materials and food, drink and tobacco. Import values have shown their strongest rises in basic materials and manufactured goods. Imports of manufactured goods rose 23 per cent in the three months to the end of March compared with the previous quarter.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES Balance of payments basis seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                ex oil and erratics*               Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991           44,477    53,884    -9,407    38,289    45,252    -6,963 1992           46,573    56,510    -9,937    40,522    48,187    -7,665 1992  Q1       11,288    13,618    -2,330     9,832    11,550    -1,718       Q2       11,641    13,898    -2,257    10,106    11,820    -1,714       Q3       11,556    13,678    -2,122    10,048    11,676    -1,628       Q4       12,088    15,316    -3,228    10,536    13,141    -2,605 1992  Oct       4,021     4,828      -807     3,470     4,175      -705       Nov       3,968     5,045    -1,077     3,454     4,314      -860       Dec       4,099     5,443    -1,344     3,612     4,652    -1,040 1993  Jan       4,345     5,405    -1,060     3,764     4,561      -797       Feb       4,459     5,709    -1,250     3,822     4,705      -883       Mar       4,733     5,651      -918     4,028     4,692      -664  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Obstacles beset PC manufacturer  -Borland faces growing competition and a price war JUST a year ago, Borland International was one of the fastest-growing companies in the personal computer software industry. The Scotts Valley, California, software developer had cemented its leadership in the database management program market with the acquisition of Ashton-Tate, and expectations were high for several new products. Today, with some of these products still yet to be delivered, Borland is facing mounting competition and its growth has ground to a halt. The company's stock, which reached a peak of Dollars 86 3/4 in January 1992, has been trading this week at under Dollars 18 after disappointing third-quarter results. On revenues down 9 per cent at Dollars 104.3m, Borland reported losses of Dollars 61.3m, or Dollars 2.34 a share, compared with net profits of Dollars 7.5m, or 28 cents, in the same period last year. The results included charges of Dollars 34.8m for 350 job cuts announced in December, consolidation of facilities, and inventory write-downs. Borland is now engaged in a potentially crippling price war with PC software market leader Microsoft and other competitors as it makes a long-delayed entry into the market for applications programs that run with the popular Microsoft Windows software. The delays have cost Borland dearly, forcing it to sit on the sidelines as sales of Windows applications programs soared to an estimated Dollars 2.9bn last year, an increase of 238 per cent over 1991, according to a market study published this week by Dataquest, the US market research group. To make matters worse, when Borland finally launched a Windows version of Quattro Pro, its spreadsheet program, in September, the company blundered by packaging the new program with an existing DOS version of Quattro Pro. The bundled software was supposed to appeal to a broad range of users, including those who use either Windows or DOS. But Borland has since acknowledged that instead it caused confusion. It withdrew the package in December and relaunched Quattro Pro for Windows as a separate product at a steeply discounted price. Third-quarter revenues were reduced by Dollars 10.7m, the company said, because retailers would receive rebates on their earlier purchases of the Quattro Pro product. The price battle began in November, when Microsoft invaded Borland's most prized territory, the market for database management programs, with the introduction of Access, a PC database program for use with Windows. Offered at an introductory price of Dollars 99, about one-fifth of the price of Borland's established database products, Access has taken the market by storm and Microsoft expects to sell 750,000 copies by the end of this month. Firing back, Borland has announced a new 'introductory price' for Quattro Pro Windows of Dollars 99, down from Dollars 495. The company also said that when it finally begins shipping Paradox for Windows, the first of two new database management programs, it too will be heavily discounted to Dollars 149 for 90 days. 'Borland is celebrating its two-pronged entry in the Windows market with this promotion,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, chairman, president, and chief executive. Financial analysts, however, are already counting the cost and lowering estimates for Borland's fourth-quarter earnings. In the longer term, it appears the 'introductory prices' being offered by Borland and Microsoft could establish new expectations among customers for downward price trends like those for PC hardware. Software developers may have a difficult time persuading buyers to pay higher prices, analysts warn. While the price war wages, Borland is also battling in the courts with Lotus Development. Last year, Lotus won a copyright infringement suit filed against Borland in July 1990, forcing Borland to cut certain features out of its Quattro Pro products. Last week, however, Lotus charged that the revised versions of Quattro Pro still infringe its copyrights. Borland is confident it will ultimately prevail in the dispute. However, if Lotus wins then Borland may be forced to pay damages, possibly amounting to millions of dollars.</p>

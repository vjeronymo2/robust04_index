			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christo Retief] </F>   [Excerpts] An explosive situation exists in eastern Caprivi  after details surfaced of an incident involving a strange armed  force supported by an attack helicopter of unknown origin, which  apparently attempted to terrorize the Mafwe chief at Linyanti.  The household of Chief Bonniface Mamili, on the banks of the  Linyanti River, which forms the border between Namibia and  Botswana, was allegedly held captive for several hours by armed  men combing the surrounding areas in search of members of the  Angolan resistance movement, UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola], while a helicopter equipped with  weapons circled over the tribal settlement. The president of  the DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] in Namibia, Mr. Mishake  Muyongo, who is presently visiting the eastern Caprivi,  yesterday described the incident as sufficient proof of SWAPO's  [South-West African People's Organization] secret missions to  intimidate political opponents and to fuel chaos in Caprivi  where SWAPO currently enjoys no political support.    Yesterday the Namibian police strongly denied any  allegations  of police and army involvement in the alleged incident and  confirmed that the incident is being investigated at the highest  level. According to government sources, Minister of Home Affairs  Lucas Pohamba and Police Inspector General General Raonga Andima  was kept fully informed yesterday about developments during the  joint investigation by police, the Intelligence Service, and the  Defense Force. Yesterday DIE REPUBLIKEIN could not succeed in  independently confirming the incident but inhabitants and  community leaders in Katima Mulilo suggested that members of the  Botswana Defense Force stationed at the Chobe National Park, or  even a reconnaissance and fighter unit of the MPLA [Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola] army in Angola, could be  responsible for the incident. [passage omitted]    Mr. Muyongo said that according to preliminary information  at  his disposal, a secret informant of SWAPO notified the police at  Katima Mulilo that members of UNITA were hiding in the vicinity  of the chief's residence. In reaction to this information a  helicopter and at least three land cruiser vehicles full of  armed "policemen" were sent to the town. The men in the  vehicles searched the bush around Mr. Mamili's residence in  military formation after a helicopter circled the house. After  the unsuccessful search they disappeared and nothing was heard  from them since. [passage omitted]    Inhabitants of Katima Mulilo said yesterday that the  Botswana  Air Force operating from the Kasane Airport near Linyanti often  violates Namibian borders and that these violations are usually  accompanied by patrols into Caprivi from the Chobe Nature  Reserve. According to these inhabitants, high-level talks  recently took place between senior officers of the Namibian  Police, the Defense Force, and Intelligence, with their  counterparts from Botswana. The assistant to the secretary  general of the police, General Martin Pool, yesterday confirmed  these talks, adding that the group of officers made use of a  Botswana Air Force helicopter in their investigation. He  strongly denied, however, that the helicopter entered Namibian  airspace. [passage omitted]</p>

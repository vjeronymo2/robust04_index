			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Macfarlane ahead 48% THE BENEFITS of a cost-cutting programme in 1991 helped Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Scottish packaging company, achieve record annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m for 1992, an increase of 48 per cent. Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said the rise reflected the 'many painful measures which had to be taken . . . to ensure that our companies became even more efficient and professional'. A significant number of jobs had been cut and a squeeze put on stocks and debtors. The benefits continued in the current year with both sales and profits ahead of the same period in 1992. 'Although there are few signs of indentifiable and sustainable growth,' Lord Macfarlane said, 'I am convinced that the recession has now bottomed out.' Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 87m. Both the packaging division, which provides two thirds of profits, and the plastics moulding business had performed successfully. The proposed final dividend is increased from 2.49p to 2.9p, for a total 13 per cent higher at 4.78p. Earnings advanced by 47 per cent to 13.2p per share. Macfarlane also announced a 1-for-2 scrip issue.</p>

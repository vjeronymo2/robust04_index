			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M Y Sung in Beijing and Jim Cheung] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's post-1997 government is set to tighten  restrictions on political activists for the sake of maintaining  stability in the territory under Chinese rule.    Beijing's political think-tank on Hong Kong affairs, the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), has recommended that the  Special Administrative Region (SAR) government withdraw key  political freedoms granted in the territory in recent years.  The PWC will recommend the SAR government restore restrictions  on political organisations which were removed from the 1949  Societies Ordinance in 1992 to conform with the Bill of Rights.    Political societies in Hong Kong would be prohibited from  forming ties with foreign organisations. Formation of new  political organisations would not be allowed without permission  from the government. The PWC warned the SAR government would  also overturn amendments--if they were adopted--currently before  the Legislative Council curbing police powers to stop and search  people, and easing restrictions on public demonstrations. PWC  members said the changes contravened the Basic Law--Hong Kong's  mini-constitution after 1997- and breached the spirit of the  1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The PWC said the changes  reduced the government's control over political organisations  and activists and threatened the territory's stability.    PWC legal group co-convenor Shao Tianren, a Chinese official  who advises the Foreign Ministry, said the spirit of the Joint  Declaration--stipulating the conditions under which Hong Kong  would revert to Chinese rule--made it clear that the law in  force in the territory since 1984 should remain basically  unchanged. He said "any major change in the transitional period  should be negotiated with the Chinese side". He said the SAR  government would not adopt major legal changes introduced  unilalerally by the British-Hong Kong government.    The government hopes to amend the Public Order Ordinance and  the Societies Ordinance to make them conform with the Bill of  Rights. But China claimed this violate the Basic Law.    "Any amendments or new legislation made between 1984 (the  year the Joint Declaration was signed) and 1997 should not be  regarded as original law of the territory (and should be  negotiated first with China)," co-convenor Simon Li said. The  former local Appeal Court judge said he suspected the Hong Kong  government had attempted to circumvent the Basic Law by making  the changes. He also accused the government of granting too  much political freedom since 1990, resulting in almost daily  public demonstrations.    The recommendations caused a furore among Hong Kong's  political activists and legislators. Prominent activist and  United Democrats legislator Lau Chin-shek said the decision was  indicative of Beijing's intention to clamp down on activists  after 1997. Independent legislator Anna Wu said: "The move  reflects that Beijing is cautious about political groups and  would like to hinder basic freedoms in Hong Kong (after 1997)."  Independent legislator Emily Lau warned the move could create  "legal chaos".</p>

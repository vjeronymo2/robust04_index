			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anders Lehmann: "Forget About </F> Legalization of Drugs"--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE  introduction]    [Excerpts] General practitioners must cease prescribing  methadone and addiction-treatment programs need to be improved;  police actions must continue whereas talk of legalizing hashish  must cease. Treatment program director, Jorgen Green, has few  doubts on the subject after 30 years of experience with drug  users.    Quicker and tougher measures need to be taken against drug  abusers. The first time the police nab a drug addict, he must  get an offer he cannot refuse. Either he submits to controlled  treatment or else the judge gets his file, and the addict risks  being locked up.    Having worked with drug addicts since the onset in the  carefree 1960s, the director of the youth center in Vordingborg  has little doubt.    "But we will not use force--we do not want to battle our  clients. We have abolished illegal use of force and corporal  punishment. There is no reason to resurrect them," said Green.    If the drug abuser breaks off treatment, he must go back to  the judge on his own and explain his breach of contract.    Green recommended that the judge enter into treatment  contracts with drug abusers in the same manner as is done with  youth contracts. But most importantly, drug abusers must find  work or schooling. Even if others have to be moved back in line.    "There are lots of other groups we give advantages to.  Well-educated youth already have excellent opportunities to move  ahead. The worst thing that you can do is to hand drug addicts a  maintenance allowance. Then they can sit on the sidewalk and  sell their various wares to other addicts and beginners. A  government employee on the state, county, or district payroll  and an addict on the government payroll cost about the same,"  said Green.    He has also taken a close look at the right of general  practitioners to prescribe methadone to addicts.    "Right now we maintain people on permanent methadone use. If  we dispense methadone, it must be tied to an offer of treatment.  It does not cost any more than doing nothing--it is just a  question of where the funds are put. Either they have to be  spent on rehabilitating drug addicts or else in combatting  crime, prisons, and hospital care," he said.    Methadone treatment, on the other hand, only makes it more  difficult to cure addicts of their addiction, according to  Green. Methadone treatment thwarts every other form of  treatment. The addict sets up obstacles and forces the doctor to  write out a description instead of quitting the needle and  embarking upon a difficult cure--without drugs.    "You are letting the drug abuser leap from the fat into the  fire, because if he does not have a grip on his life, he will  supplement his methadone with alcohol, pills, and heroin,"  Green's experience has shown him.    He rejects the idea that it is police raids on drug users  and  pushers that have caused some users to make their next injection  their last. He is strongly opposed in this view by the Danish  Association of General Practitioners, which has vehemently  protested the police raids on pushers.    "If one looks at police figures for 1992, it is evident that  there was a significant drop in the number of drug-related  deaths in Copenhagen during the Vesterbro raids, while there was  a rise in the provinces," he said.    The deaths are due to a number of diverse factors:    --The average age among drug addicts has risen. Recruitment  of youths is declining.    --The channels of distribution have changed. This means that  neither addict nor pusher knows how much morphine is contained  in a dose, with the consequent risk of overdose.    --There is an increase in the flow of methadone coming out  of  general practitioners' offices. Addicts supplement methadone  with drugs on the illegal market.    --Drug abusers are psychologically and physically worn down.    --AIDS claims the life of many more drug addicts than was  the  case earlier.    --Revision of police statistical methods.    The one thing Green does not believe is responsible for the  rise in the number of drug deaths is police intervention.    "It happens because certain idiots take trips to Bangkok,  buy  heroin, and rush back to Copenhagen to sell it," he said.    Meanwhile, he points to studies in Zurich where the number  of  drug-related deaths rose significantly when police withdrew and  permitted a "needle park" to be created where addicts could hang  out unmolested.    "Unless we create a kind of ghetto, virtually any idiot can  burst on the scene with drugs and slip out of the country with  money in his pocket. This guy could care less about how much  morphine there is in the drug," Green warned.    Daily incidences of lethal injections forced the authorities  to close the park in 1992.    Green paints a scary picture of Copenhagen as the Amsterdam  of the North. He warns against setting up "coffee shops" where  hashish may be freely bought and sold.    "When I hear people mentioning it, I often wonder whether  they have really seen what goes on in Amsterdam. If they did,  people would return home shocked and say this is not what we  want," said Green.    He does not believe there is anything to indicate that  legalizing one drug or another and selling it in "coffee shops"  would reduce the amount of addiction. In Amsterdam, pushers  selling the hardest drugs stand right outside the cafe doors.  Shops selling syringes, hash pipes, and equipment for snorting  are located right next door.    Nor does he feel that a rise in illegal activity involving  euphoric drugs can be used as an argument for setting up locales  where hash is freely sold.    "This merely reflects the level of activity of the police in  the area. The police activity in Christiania alone causes that  number to rise," said Green. [passage omitted]</p>

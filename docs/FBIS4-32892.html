			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Elias Garcia] </F>   [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (EFE) -- Colombians will  have to go to runoff presidential elections on 19 June, since  none of the 18 candidates secured a simple majority today's  primary elections.    Contrary to poll estimates, both candidates finished in a  virtual tie: liberal candidate Ernesto Samper, the favorite,  garnered 45.2 percent of the votes, while conservative candidate  Andres Pastrana obtained 44.9 percent. Former guerrilla Antonio  Navarro Wolff of the "Commitment for Colombia" was third with  3.8 percent of the votes, followed by Regina Betancourt of the  Metapolitical Unitary Movement obtained 1.1 percent.    Blank votes accounted for 1.1 percent of the votes cast.  Once again, abstentionism was one of the predominant notes of  the day: less than 6 million people of a total of 17.1 million  potential voters went to the polls, representing approximately  70 percent abstentionism.    The narrow margin between the two principal contenders was a  surprise because the majority of the polls put Samper 5 percent  over Pastrana.    The elections took place amid calm, as occurred throughout  the campaign in which there were no major incidents of violence.  Colombians still recall with horror the previous presidential  campaign in which three candidates were assassinated.    Beginning tomorrow, the candidates will no doubt begin the  second stage of their election campaign. Their aim will be to  garner the small percentage of votes (approximately 7 percent)  that went to the other candidates today. The two candidates who  will go to the runoff elections will seek to obtain the support  of some of the 15 candidates who were eliminated by verdict of  the polls, above all, Antonio Navarro, Regina Betancourt, Miguel  Maza, and Enrique Parejo, who altogether obtained almost 6.5  percent of the votes, some 400,000.    Of course it remains to be seen whether the votes of these  candidates are "transferable" or, if on the contrary, their  supporters do not respond to any persuasion.    It will be especially important to see what stand Antonio  Navarro adopts. Some of his supporters in the Democratic  Alliance (former M-19 guerrilla group) abandoned him in the  middle of the campaign because they did not agree on going to  the elections under another acronym and went over to Ernesto  Samper's ranks.    More people are not expected to turn out for the runoff  elections. Perhaps there will be less because the voters are  tired (today's election was the second one this year and there  is still another one following the runoff) and because of the  negative influence of the World Cup in which Colombia will play  against Romania on the eve of the runoff elections.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hollinger profits sharply lower A poor performance for Canadian newspapers plus negative currency factors pulled first-half profits sharply lower at Hollinger, the Canadian holding company headed by Mr Conrad Black. Despite continuing strength at the Daily Telegraph newspaper in the UK, the company's net profit was CDollars 24.6m, or 36 cents a share, for the first half of 1993, down from CDollars 54.1m, or 87 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dipped slightly to CDollars 433.5m. Mr Black said operating profit was CDollars 45.5m, against CDollars 40.7m. The steeper decline in after-tax earnings was due to smaller capital gains and the weakness of sterling.</p>

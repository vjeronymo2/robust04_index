			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fang Pei (2455 0160): "Urgent MOFTEC Notice </F> Demands Nation Take Firm Control of Assignment of Textile  Manufacturer Designators; Textile Export Quota Controls Will Be  Further Heightened"]    [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation [MOFTEC], in the latter half of September, issued an  urgent notice to economic and trade departments throughout the  nation demanding that prior to 30 November they complete the  task of assigning textile manufacturer designators (MIDS) in  their region. Economic and trade departments in every locality  are presently urgently carrying out this task, and some  provinces have completed the task.    National assigning of textile manufacturer designators is an  important condition for the establishment of an export license  approval system to export textiles to the United States. The  establishment of an approval system is significant for raising  China's export quotas for nations that limit textile imports,  especially the United States. This measure can more effectively  combat the illegal activity of fabricating false licenses and  combat illegal textile transhipment and ensure the legitimate  interests of export enterprises.    Manufacturer designators are made up of fifteen digits and  are mainly used to clarify which manufacturers have textile  exporting licenses, and to prove the original place of  production of goods.    Textile manufacturers are state, cooperative, individual,  partially or wholly foreign-owned, and other types of  manufacturers engaged in the processing and manufacture of  textiles, clothing, accessories, and other products included in  bilateral textile agreements. It is reported that some local  economic and trade control departments only assign the  designation to manufacturers that provide their region with  textile export goods. Therefore, some manufacturers that provide  goods for export enterprises outside of their region and have  the capability to provide export goods are left out of the  designation. This leads to some export licenses not being issued  on schedule because they lack a designated manufacturer, causing  an adverse effect on normal exports. Therefore, all localities'  economic and trade departments, based on MOFTEC's requirement,  should organize all manufacturers and not designate some  manufacturers.    The economic and trade control departments of all localities  are the departments responsible for organizing all textile  manufacturers in their region as designated manufacturers. In  accordance with the demands of MOFTEC, all local economic and  trade control departments should direct and oversee the  designation of their region's textile manufacturers, and the  collection of data and reporting to MOFTEC by all local and  county departments responsible for economics and trade.    Once the manufacturer designation is set up and recorded, it  should not be arbitrarily revised. The designation should be  controlled by a person with special responsibility.    Every export enterprise, when applying for a license to  export textiles to the United States, must enter the  manufacturer designation for the goods in the permit in column  13 and enter the designation in the MIDS column when filling out  the visa. Otherwise, the certificate will be considered false.  Thus, it is mandatory to use the manufacturer designation.    Presently, the establishment of the manufacturer designation  is entering the final stage and economic and trade departments  from every locality should seize the opportunity and seriously  and meticulously accomplish this task. Units that still have not  completed the task when the time expires, after China implements  the approval system for licenses to export textiles to the  United States, will not receive certification for the United  States. This will create a huge economic loss for export  enterprises. Thus, the economic and trade departments of every  locality should energetically strive to overcome various  difficulties and complete the task of establishing textile  manufacturer designations on time throughout the nation.</p>

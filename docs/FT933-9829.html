			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Postal strike may spread after talks fail AN ESCALATION of the five-day postal strike at Cardiff looks possible this weekend after yesterday's negotiations between Post Office management and officials of the Union of Communication Workers failed to achieve a settlement. Further talks will be held today to try to resolve the dispute over new shift-working patterns, which involves 900 staff at two Royal Mail offices in Cardiff. Royal Mail staff in Oxford and Worcester have already decided in secret ballots not to handle any of the mail affected by the dispute. Further ballots are being held among postal workers in Bristol, Southampton and Gloucester. Talks in Gloucester have so far lasted more than 20 hours over two days. The strike is delaying mail addressed to Companies House - the government's business registration headquarters in Cardiff - and the Federation of Small Businesses has warned that this could trigger financial penalties for companies if accounts and returns arrive late. An estimated 1m letters lie undelivered at Royal Mail sorting depots around Britain. About 2,500 postboxes in Cardiff have been sealed. The parcel service and delivery of registered mail are unaffected so far, as is the Post Office counter service. Mr Graham Hall, head of Cardiff Chamber of Commerce, said local companies were making alternative arrangements through private courier services and using faxes, but business customers outside south Wales were still unaware of the dispute and were continuing to send mail to Cardiff. The dispute began on Tuesday when staff walked out in protest at the Post Office's decision to introduce a fixed pattern of shift-working in its Cardiff offices for 300 of the 900 staff. Initially staff decided to strike for 24 hours, but they have accused the Royal Mail of refusing to enter serious negotiations, and have agreed to continue the dispute indefinitely. Over the past 18 months the Royal Mail has been introducing 'settled attendances' at its sorting offices throughout the UK. Many of the 140,000 Post Office staff - including three quarters of staff in south Wales - accepted the new system after local consultation, although there have been a number of disputes over its introduction, notably at Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire and at Chester. Under the Royal Mail's traditional working patterns, postal workers are rotated between early, later and evening work shifts and between areas such as sorting, distribution and delivery. The new working practices involve specialist work teams who will develop staff skills in specific areas and so end job mobility. The Post Office's south Wales headquarters said yesterday that 80 per cent of the staff involved would get the shifts and duties they preferred. It added: 'The new scheme is designed to improve the quality of the service we provide. It encourages staff to become experts in their own field.' Mr Les Parry, a member of the UCW executive, said yesterday: 'We are not against people having fixed duties. But the new system must be introduced with their consent.' The Post Office said it remains ready to deal with problems flexibly by trying to ensure that unpopular shifts are made more attractive. It said that no one would lose their job under the new system, and that basic pay would not be affected.</p>

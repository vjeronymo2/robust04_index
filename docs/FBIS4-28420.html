			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Social organizations of  different countries recently sent letters to the Japanese prime  minister in protest against the Japanese authorities'  suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan.    The letter of the Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship  Association said the Japanese authorities' search of Chongnyon  organizations and murder of Japan-resident Koreans are part of  Japan's hostile policy towards the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea and a very ill-boding move assuming political character.    It warned that if they continued to commit reckless acts,  failing to lend an ear to the voices of the world peaceloving  people, they will face a stern judgement by history.    The Lausanne Cultural Information Centre on the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in Switzerland in its letter  denounced the Japanese authorities for harshly suppressing  Chongnyon organizations and Koreans in Japan and strongly  demanded that they be ensured democratic national rights.    The chairman of the Bulgaria-Korea Friendship Association  branded the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities  as a reckless and inhumanitarian act trampling down the  democratic national rights of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and  a challenge to the DPRK.</p>

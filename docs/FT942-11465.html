			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Move to thwart Creditanstalt bid A group of Austrian entrepreneurs and companies may take a stake in Creditanstalt Bankverein, Austria's second biggest bank, in an effort to thwart a possible foreign bid. A bank official said yesterday moves were under way to put together an Austrian-led consortium for a minority stake in the bank. The consortium could include EA-Generali, the insurance company which is majority-owned by Italy's Assicurazione Generali. The government wants to sell part of its 70.5 per cent voting stake in the bank this year. CS Holding, the Swiss financial group that owns Credit Suisse, recently declared an interest in buying into Creditanstalt. The bank yesterday reported a steep rise in earnings for 1993, and is lifting its dividend to 10 per cent from 6 per cent. Operating results reached a record, Sch5.4bn (Dollars 465m) compared with Sch3.4bn in 1992. 'Income from securities trading, money market and foreign exchange dealings, precious metals activities, and trading in claims on rescheduling countries rose 113 per cent to just under Sch2.6bn,' the bank said. The bank 'made good use of favourable conditions in the bond, stock and interest-rate related markets', it said. Provisions against bad debt rose by Sch3.8bn, of which Sch2.9bn was set aside for domestic credit risks to cover a record number of bankruptcies. Provisions are expected to be considerably lower this year. Profits after tax rose 17.6 per cent to Sch1.46bn. The results for the whole group, published for the first time, showed profits after tax rising by more than 21 per cent to Sch2.05bn. The group comprises several financial services companies and three regional middle-sized banks, in which it has a majority stake.</p>

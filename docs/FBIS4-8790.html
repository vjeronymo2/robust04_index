			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- The supreme command of  the armed forces of the Srpska republic met today in Pale,  chaired by the supreme commander, Radovan Karadzic.    The participants reviewed the current military and political  situation following the deployment of NATO aircraft on combat  actions on the side of the Muslims.    It was noted that, by resorting to the use of air power and  other means, certain circles in the West, the United States in  particular, wish to goad the Srpska republic into concluding  local and regional agreements and making other concessions.  This particularly applies to the sectors of the front where the  Muslims are in an unfavorable military situation and is geared  toward encouraging the Muslims and creating conditions for  attaining military and territorial objectives, a statement from  the office of the president of the Srpska republic says.    The supreme command concludes that conditions are not yet  ripe for the normalization of relations with UNPROFOR's [UN  Protection Forces] military sector, but that the president of  the Srpska republic may, if need be, and if he personally deems  it necessary, maintain contact with UNPROFOR's civilian  department with the aim of examining possibilities for extending  the peace process, the statement reads.</p>

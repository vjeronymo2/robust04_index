			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHOENIX OPEN GOLF TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> MCCUMBER'S LATE FINISH TIES GLASSON FOR TOP SPOT  </P> <P> Mark McCumber grabbed a share of the lead moments before darkness halted  second-round play in the $700,000 Phoenix Open golf tournament Friday.  </P> <P> McCumber completed two trips over the windblown TPC course in 133, putting him  in a tie, at 9 under par, with Billy Glasson.  </P> <P> McCumber, a member of the United States' winning World Cup team last fall, had  a second-round 69.  </P> <P> "It was a very hard day. It started in winds and ended in darkness. The last  two holes I couldn't see the greens," McCumber said.  </P> <P> Glasson, playing in the worst of the gusty winds, shot a 68, which included an  18-foot birdie putt on the final hole.  </P> <P> Twelve players, including challenger Ben Crenshaw, did not complete their  rounds because of darkness. They marked their positions and were scheduled to  return early this morning to complete second-round play.  </P> <P> Crenshaw was at 7 under par with 1 hole to go.  </P></p>

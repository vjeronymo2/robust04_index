			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THEY LIKED IKE, MARK HIS CENTENNIAL  </P> <P> Sir Winston Churchill's grandson, saluting Dwight D. Eisenhower on behalf of  his wartime "comrades-in-arms," joined Americans today in honoring the man who  led Allied armies to victory in World War II and became the 34th President of  the United States.  </P> <P> "It was under the command of General Eisenhower that Europe -- or at least half  of it -- was liberated," Winston S. Churchill told a joint meeting of Congress  convened as part of a yearlong celebration marking the centennial of  Eisenhower's birth on Oct. 14, 1890.  </P> <P> "How thrilled he and Churchill would be today, to see the peoples of Eastern  Europe at last emerging as free nations from a nightmare of 50 years'  occupation, first under the Nazis, then the Soviet Red Army," Churchill said.  </P> <P> "He will forever be revered among those nations who, like my own, were his  comrades-in-arms and remembered with abiding gratitude by those nations which  were liberated, under his command, from the most monstrous and vile tyranny  that has ever defiled this Earth," Churchill said.  </P> <P> John S. D. Eisenhower, son of the Republican President who served from 1953 to  1961, said, "I believe he would like to be thought of simply as the Good  Soldier."  </P> <P> "He walked with kings but never forgot his home in Abilene, Kansas," Eisenhower  said. "He was the vaunted warrior who hated war. He was the five-star general  who warned of the dangers of an unbridled military-industrial complex."  </P> <P> Walter Cronkite, retired CBS television news anchor, saluted Eisenhower as "the  greatest hero of the greatest war in history."  </P> <P> Members of Eisenhower's family, including several great-grandchildren, and  surviving members of his Administration joined senators and representatives in  the chamber. Many wore red, white and blue "I Like Ike" buttons.  </P> <P> Eisenhower was born in Denison, Tex. When he was less than a year old, the  family moved to Abilene, Kan.  </P> <P> The Dwight David Eisenhower Centennial Commission, established by Congress to  observe the 100th anniversary, has planned observances throughout the year,  including a celebration in Abilene on Eisenhower's birthday.  </P></p>

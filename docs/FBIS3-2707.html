In 1993, more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign  funds were actually put to use in Shenzhen, doubling the figure  for the previous year. Foreign-funded enterprises reported an  export volume of more than 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, an increase  of 25 percent and accounting for more than 70 percent of the  city's total.    Over the past 14 years, the city has utilized nearly six  billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign funds.    In recent years, foreign investors have been encouraged to  invest in the city's energy, transportation, and high- and  new-tech industries.    The foreign-funded enterprises in the city are in good  performance and a sample survey showed that some 80 percent of  them are profitable.    A total of 370 foreign-funded enterprises increased their  registered capital and extended terms of operation last year,  according to a city office in charge of foreign investment.</p>

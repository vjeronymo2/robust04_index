			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Jordan hit by sanctions on Iraq THE JORDANIAN economy has suffered losses of at least Dollars 570m (Pounds 372m) in nearly 2 1/2 years of United Nations sanctions against Iraq because of the reduced volume of transit cargo through the port of Aqaba and the cost of ship inspections, according to the Jordan Shipping Agents' Association. The losses are a sizeable amount for a country with gross domestic product last year of Dollars 3.98bn. Transit imports to Iraq through Aqaba have collapsed by 66 per cent since the onset of the Gulf crisis. In 1989 some 5.6m tonnes of transit cargo for Iraq passed through Aqaba. In the first 11 months of last year the total was just 1.9m tonnes, mainly food and medicine. Transit exports from Iraq, about 1.15m tonnes in 1989, have ceased. The Jordan Shipping Agents' Association says the total loss of port revenues from trade with Iraq since August 1990, when the sanctions were imposed, amount to Dollars 500m. In addition to this, operators shipping cargoes to Jordan, or other transit destinations such as Syria, have increased their charges to account for interference by naval inspectors policing sanctions in the Red Sea. Ships for Aqaba are frequently subject to delays and the risk of being turned away, and they are forced to carry lighter loads in order to make their cargo accessible to inspection. The authorities invested heavily in the Aqaba port in the 1980s. A new oil terminal, seven additional berths, and a Dollars 3m communications centre were built to handle the ballooning demand from Iraq when Baghdad's Gulf outlets were blocked by war with Iran. Aqaba is now operating at only 60 per cent of capacity compared with 1989.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW PENDLETON CHIEF'S TRIAL BY FIRE  </P> <P> The tall general almost gleefully lifted the machine gun, then his jaw jutted  fiercely as he rattled off bullets that wreaked dust-kicking havoc on the  countryside.  </P> <P> "You know, we're all just like kids," he said with a certain impish  satisfaction, the usual warm countenance returning to his face.  </P> <P> Yet Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Neil, more than almost anybody, grimly realizes  this isn't child's play.  </P> <P> This bloodied hero of Vietnam and prominent San Diego trial lawyer, who  suddenly found himself in command of Camp Pendleton nearly three months ago, is  somberly aware that the young Marines he is so fond of personally greeting may  be sent off soon to a new war.  </P> <P> Reservist Neil was called back to active duty after President Bush ordered  troops to the Middle East, including Marine Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, who had  commanded Camp Pendleton only three weeks before he turned the world's largest  amphibious training base over to Neil.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Neil gave outsiders a glimpse of command as he appeared around the  196-square-mile base, applying his style of tough discipline that's mellowed by  friendly small talk and frequent pats on the back.  </P> <P> One minute he wears a stern, the-man-chews-nails expression; next minute, he's  almost joshing the troops.  </P> <P> After taking a trial run behind the steering wheel of a 14-ton light armored  vehicle, Neil stood before a bleacher full of training Marines and intoned,  "Did you see me driving this up here?"  </P> <P> "Yes, sir!" replied the chorus.  </P> <P> "How'd I do?" he inquired.  </P> <P> "EXCELLENT, sir!" the young Marines privates said, as if there were any other  answer for a general.  </P> <P> At first glance, this would seem an unusual change of venue for a 50-year-old  trial lawyer, the president of the law firm of Neil, Dymott, Perkins, Brown  &amp; Frank.  </P> <P> But Neil dwells in two worlds, one with a plush legal office, orderly  courtrooms and juries to coddle, cajole and convince.  </P> <P> The other is Camp Pendleton, a scruffy, shopworn expanse that has minted  Marines since World War II, a noisy place of gunfire and thundering artillery,  yet a place where Neil doesn't have to plead for a verdict -- he gives the  orders.  </P> <P> In normal times, 36,000 Marines are stationed at Camp Pendleton, but the 1st  Marine Expeditionary Force went to Saudi Arabia in August, and the 5th Marine  Expeditionary Brigade is shipping out Saturday.  </P> <P> Neil doesn't say exactly how many Marines will remain, but he comments that  there will be "a very significant reduction" of Marines on base.  </P> <P> However, there's plenty of responsibility left for a warrior-administrator,  including overseeing the care of 12,000 dependents on base and another 32,000  living in the surrounding area.  </P> <P> It may not be the battlefield command he's used to, but Neil is sort of a city  manager of a self-contained community of barracks, a brig, training areas, 90  firing ranges, PXs and a security force of MPs.  </P> <P> He spreads himself around, noting that "part of being a commanding officer is  to make his presence known." He often stays overnight on base, when he can't  break away to go home to Mission Beach and see his wife, Jan. They have two  children.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, Neil visited the School of Infantry where, regardless of the  deployment, 22,000 Marine recruits a year receive six weeks of training. Neil  wandered around, always strolling up to the officers and enlisted men for a few  moments of conversation about equipment, training and hometowns.  </P> <P> Yet no matter where he goes, no matter how many fresh young faces he meets,  Vietnam, with its unforgettable agony and camaraderie, is always with Neil.  </P> <P> It is the land where he saw good men die, and where he distinguished himself,  winning the Navy Cross for leading his 21 Marines in a desperate firefight with  150 North Vietnamese.  </P> <P> "I don't think a day goes by when in some manner you don't think of the men you  served with," he said.  </P> <P> When talking of such things, he uses the word "you" rather than "I" in a way  that seems to protect the emotions no one who hasn't seen combat can possibly  share or understand.  </P> <P> For all Neil saw during his 13 months at war ("seemed like every day you were  getting shot at"), he couldn't put the Marine Corps behind him when he came  home in 1968.  </P> <P> "I stayed away a couple of years, (but) I found out I missed being around the  Marines, the camaraderie," he said.  </P> <P> And he was undaunted about combat: "I always thought there would be another  war. I wanted to be part of it if there was."  </P> <P> In a way, that attitude may be natural for Neil, whose father was a 30-year  Marine artillery officer who served in World War II. Neil remembers visiting  Camp Pendleton for the first time in 1945, when he was 5.  </P> <P> Vietnam was lost, but for Neil, war sealed in him a certain mission to make  sure the Marines of today and tomorrow learn their lessons well.  </P> <P> "I certainly believe in being tough, being firm, and in discipline, but at  times letting them know you care about them," he said.  </P> <P> He believes contemporary Marines are better trained than were Vietnam-era  troops, and the unabashedly gung-ho general said the Marines he sees are  itching for service in the Middle East. He wishes he could go.  </P> <P> "Every Marine wishes he was going, but some have to stay behind," he said. And,  although a Camp Pendleton corporal this week received media attention by  seeking conscientious objector status, Neil insisted morale and resolve are  high.  </P> <P> He said "there really hasn't been any change in the (absent without leave) rate  that we've seen. Basically, they want to go."  </P> <P> Part of his task in running the base and letting troops know he's behind them  is participating in training and trying his hand with some military tricks that  didn't exist when he was commissioned back in 1966.  </P> <P> Neil scrunched his 6-foot-2 frame and size 13 combat boots into a training  light armored vehicle, in which, even in a modified fetal position, he looked  more natural than Michael Dukakis during the former presidential candidate's  much-ridiculed campaign tank ride.  </P> <P> Then Neil jammed himself into the simulator to learn how to aim and fire the  LAV's guns. The targets, moving and stationary, were visible on a  computer-enhanced screen that showed enemy vehicles and helicopters on sweeping  terrain.  </P> <P> Sgt. Richard Parks instructed him, but his first round missed. "Oh, I see what  I did," said Neil. The second shot was high. "I see what I did," he repeated.  The third mock projectile did it.  </P> <P> By the second target, Neil was a real gunner.  </P> <P> "One round, one hit, sir," Parks said. "Outstanding."  </P> <P> Neil had just killed a truck.  </P> <P> A little more trial and error, and Neil definitely had the hang of things.  </P> <P> Twisting himself out of the simulator, Neil said: "I think we scared 'em."  </P> <P> "Scared hell out of 'em, sir," the sergeant replied.  </P></p>

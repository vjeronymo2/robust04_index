			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SKATERS, COACHES PROTEST PLAN TO CLOSE ICE ARENA  </P> <P> About 150 figure skaters, hockey players and coaches picketed Burbank's  Pickwick Ice Arena to protest the planned closure of the landmark facility that  has served as the training center for a handful of Olympic athletes.  </P> <P> The protesters, many of them children, chanted "Save our rink" Thursday and  carried homemade signs tacked to the ends of hockey sticks as they marched  outside the rink near the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.  </P> <P> "We'll have to fight," said 9-year-old Brad Haber of Chatsworth, goalie for a  youth hockey team.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old rink, home of one of the most prestigious figure-skating clubs  in the country and a popular practice arena for many local hockey clubs, will  close Sept. 30, Manager Cary Adams announced at a noisy meeting of skating  enthusiasts Monday night.  </P> <P> Rumors that the arena would close had been circulating since April, but the  news came as a shock to its users, especially because it is one of the few  Olympic-sized rinks in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We don't want a battle," said Nancy Forbes, whose son Kirk practices figure  skating at the arena. "We just want a place for our kids to skate."  </P> <P> Pickwick owner Walter Stavert said the protest would not change the decision to  close the arena. "We've pretty well made up our minds," he said.  </P> <P> But protest organizer and skating instructor Russell Sessions said many skaters  understand the decision to close the arena and will settle for more time to  find an alternate facility.  </P> <P> Stavert did not rule out a postponement of the closing date. "We'll have to  work with that when it comes to us," he said.  </P> <P> Adams said the owners, Stavert and his brother Edward, decided in January to  close the aging rink because it needs about $500,000 in repairs.  </P> <P> "The revenue on it just doesn't warrant that kind of work," Walter Stavert  said.  </P> <P> Pickwick is home base for the highly competitive Los Angeles Figure Skating  Club, which has nurtured such Olympic skaters as Linda Fratianne of Northridge,  Tiffany Chin of Toluca Lake and Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys. The rink is  used by speed skating clubs, hockey teams, pleasure skaters and students.  </P></p>

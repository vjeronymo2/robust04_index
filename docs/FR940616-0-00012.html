			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this regulation, a lot is considered to be imported when it is released by the Customs Service for entry into commercial markets or other channels. Lots that are exempt from maturity requirements of the import regulations are not subject to the inspection and certification requirements in such regulations. An imported lot intended for normal commercial channels, or any portion of such a lot, that fails established maturity requirements, could be disposed of in exempt outlets, as specified in the pertinent avocado import requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third copy of the form will accompany the exempt lot to its intended destination. The receiver will then certify that the lot has been received and it will be utilized in an exempt outlet. After the certification is signed by the receiver, the form is to be returned to MOAB by the receiver, within 15 days of receipt of the lot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], and have been assigned OMB numbers 0581&hyph;0078 for avocados grown in South Florida and 0581&hyph;0167 for imported avocados.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the USTR has concurred with the issuance of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to make the specified changes. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers since it will help ensure that only mature avocados are shipped to fresh markets. The committee considers that maturity requirements for Florida grown avocados are necessary to improve grower returns and promote orderly marketing conditions. Although compliance with these maturity requirements will affect costs to handlers, these costs will be offset by the benefits of providing the industry and consumers with mature avocados.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule also reflects the Department's appraisal of the need to reinstate the suspended avocado import maturity requirements, with the specified revisions, as hereinafter set forth, in accordance with section 8e of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that this final rule as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) The shipping season for South Florida avocados is expected to begin in late May; (2) avocado handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the committee; (3) notice of the proposed rules were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and no comments were received during the 30-day comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 915  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Avocados, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 944  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Avocados, Food grades and standards, Grapefruit, Grapes, Imports, Kiwifruit, Limes, Olives, Oranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR parts 915 and 944 are amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

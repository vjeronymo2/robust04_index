			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: Battle for punt leaves long list of casualties 'THROUGH good days and bad days with the Irish pound, this was one of the most satisfying.' Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, had reason to enjoy the statement by EC finance ministers who on Monday strongly supported the Irish government's four-month battle to defend the punt against devaluation. But has it been a Pyrrhic victory as some analysts now say? The cost has been considerable and forecasts for the Irish economy in 1993 are the gloomiest in years. In defending the punt after sterling's abandonment of the ERM last September, the government exhausted its entire stock of reserves worth IPounds 3bn in August. It has borrowed abroad to rebuild them to around IPounds 2bn now, abandoning its policy of capping foreign currency debt at IPounds 9bn before the crisis. Foreign holders of Irish gilts, mostly German financial institutions, sold IPounds 1.8bn of a stock of IPounds 4bn held by them before September. Their appetite for new purchases will depend on prospects for the economy, which are not promising. Irish commercial and mortgage interest rates were pushed up by three percentage points last October, as the central bank raised its own lending rates to defend the punt. Personal overdrafts now carry interest rates of around 19 per cent, commercial loans are around 16 per cent, while mortgage rates are 14 per cent. Inflation was only 3 per cent last year, and is now expected to fall to only 1.5 per cent this year. 'The monetary squeeze facing Ireland is now greater than in the UK at the height of its monetary squeeze before its abandonment of the ERM,' says Mr Chris Johns, chief economist at the Bank of Ireland. This week, interbank interest rates for one-month money were below 20 per cent, having reached 100 per cent a fortnight ago. The threat of a further 3 percentage point rise in commercial rates has thus receded, but paradoxically, the strengthening of the punt against the D-Mark and sterling has thrown the focus back on the exchange rate problem. Since September the punt has been revalued against sterling by around 14 per cent, and has placed severe pressures on Irish industry. The heads of prominent exporting companies have recently started to call openly for devaluation. On a trade-weighted index, bringing in the currencies of Ireland's main trading partners, the punt has been revalued by around 4 per cent since September. For an open economy such as Ireland's, heavily dependent on trade, this has worrying implications. Mr Tom Jago, president of the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, said last week that their latest statistics show 'a very depressing downturn in order books, investment plans and employment expectations'. The Dublin-based NCB stockbrokers noted: 'The short-term impact of a successful defence of the currency would, on balance, add to deflationary pressures already in train and we would expect growth in real GDP to be no better than 0.5 per cent in 1993.' Davy stockbrokers are issuing a profits warning for Irish corporations this year and predict that even if German interest rates fall, Irish rates are unlikely to fall significantly before the end of 1993. This all creates a dilemma for the new coalition Fianna Fail-Labour government which has committed itself to attacking lengthening dole queues as its priority. It faces some tough budget decisions next month, and its commitment to keep borrowing down to within 3 per cent of GDP leaves little space for manoeuvre. With no policy changes, the government itself predicts a rise in unemployment of 34,000 this year from its present 290,000. Independent analysts believe the increase is likely to go as high as 50,000, rising to 19 per cent of the workforce from 16.6 per cent, already the highest in the EC. Was it all worth it? 'Certainly,' the government argues. It says the benefits of having credibility within the ERM and low inflation, enhances competitiveness and puts Ireland in the fast track to European Monetary Union. This is the strategic goal. Once achieved, the argument goes, Ireland can finally shed the perception that its economic fortunes are forever hostage to those of the UK - a perception which precipitated the last assault on the punt.</p>

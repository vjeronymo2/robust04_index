			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Major prepares defence in sleaze outcry Mr John Major was drawing up plans last night to defuse the charges of sleaze levelled against his government as Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, distanced himself from the mounting political controversy. But a left-right split opened in the cabinet over the fate of Mr Neil Hamilton, the industry minister at the centre of allegations made by Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods. Mr Major's attempts to develop a clear strategy before the inevitable challenges at today's prime minister's questions came as Mr Howard was drawn into a war of words between the government and Mr Fayed. Amid controversy over the processing of a citizenship application submitted by Mr Fayed's brother, Mr Howard issued a detailed statement clarifying his role. He said he had deputed the consideration of the application of Mr Ali Fayed to Mr Charles Wardle, the junior home office minister responsible for immigration. His own role had been limited to suggesting further inquiries before a decision was taken. The application is still pending, and Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, called for a full Commons statement by Mr Howard. Mr Straw also questioned whether Mr Wardle should have been given responsibility for the decision. He pointed to a stinging attack on the Fayed brothers made by Mr Wardle as a backbench MP in 1990. With Mr Hamilton's ministerial future in doubt, Mr Major indicated his readiness to publish the outcome of an inquiry conducted by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, into the so-called 'cash-for-questions' allegations against two ministers. One, Mr Tim Smith, resigned last week, but Mr Hamilton insisted that he had done nothing improper. The prime minister was studying ways of broadening the present investigations into the financial interests of MPs and of securing an end to Labour's boycott of an inquiry by the House of Commons privileges committee. One possibility floated last night by Tory party managers was that Mr Major would signal his willingness to include independent figures from outside the Commons in a wide-ranging study of potential conflicts of interest. Senior Conservatives acknowledged that Mr Hamilton's position in the government had grown weaker by the day since the charge levelled against him last week by Mr Fayed that he had taken a free holiday at the Ritz hotel in Paris. At the weekend Mr David Hunt, the cabinet minister responsible for open government, gave a clear hint that Mr Hamilton should stand down from the government while fighting a libel action. But Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary and, like Mr Hamilton, a right-winger, pointedly defended his colleague. 'He should be allowed to defend himself while (still) a minister,' Mr Portillo told BBC radio. Page 11 Tory MP Michael Colvin failed to declare interest Howard hits at claims</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Guarded welcome for new HK television plan THE Hong Kong government yesterday announced minor concessions to all three leading groups battling for the right to offer more television to the masses when it approved a new framework for television broadcasting in the colony. The decision ends more than two years of confusion over the future of cable and satellite television in Hong Kong. The three groups involved, Mr Li Ka-shing's Star Television, the late Sir YK Pao's Wharf group and Sir Run Run Shaw's Television Broadcasts (TVB), welcomed the fact that a decision had finally been made; but all three had hoped for more. Under the new proposals, Hong Kong should finally receive cable television in the fourth quarter of 1993, four years after the licence was first handed out to a consortium led by Wharf. The consortium folded in 1990, amid internal squabbling and complaints about the government's policy on satellite broadcasting. A two-year government review followed. Wharf appears favourite to win the latest licence, which will be awarded in January 1993. The government has said preference would be given to consortia offering the fixed-fibre optic cable system, which Wharf has strongly supported. This enables the operator to provide value-added telecommunications services such as home banking, in addition to television. The winning cable operator will have a three-year 'exclusive' licence, after which it will be open to unlimited competition. Regional satellite broadcaster Star, 50 per cent owned by Hutchison Whampoa and 50 per cent by the Li family, won some concessions after an aggressive campaign to reverse a five-year ban on Cantonese broadcasting and subscription income. With a population that is around 98 per cent Chinese, the appeal of English language broadcasting is clearly limited in Hong Kong. From October 1993, Star will be able to transmit three of its existing five channels in Cantonese. From the same date, it will be able to levy subscription on new channels, but these must remain non-Cantonese during the cable operator's three-year exclusivity period. Star described the government decision as 'a good way forward', but Wharf was extremely guarded, expressing concern over the development of a subscription satellite service. Wharf director Mr Stephen Ng said there was only room for one pay television operator in Hong Kong. TVB, the largest of Hong Kong's two existing broadcasters, claimed the government decision failed 'to create a true 'level playing field' for all operators in the industry'. The government decided TVB should be allowed to bid for the cable licence, though it would be unlikely to win. The television station's royalty payments will be reduced and some advertising restrictions removed, but the operating environment is going to become much more competitive.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The GMC foundry manufactures iron castings for the automotive industry. The castings include brake drums, bearing caps, differential carriers, water pumps and brake rotors. The foundry is located approximately 1.5 miles from downtown Danville adjacent to Interstate 74 at G Street, in an area that is predominately agricultural, with some residential sections. This is the only iron foundry in Vermilion County. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment'' of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO (Refer to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations &sect;81.314, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The GMC foundry is presently using two cupolas, Number 2 and Number 3, in its foundry operation. A cupola is a vertical shaft furnace which is fed or ``charged'' with layers of metallics, coke and limestone. Cupola melting is used by GMC to melt scrap metal. Approximately 220,000 tons of scrap metal are remelted and made into castings each year. Typical cupola exhaust gases contain 13 to 27 percent CO. This is the equivalent of 130,000 to 270,000 parts per million (ppm). In a cupola, high CO levels and specific carbon dioxide ratios are important to the metallurgical properties of the iron. These levels can be minimized by proper selection of fuels, charge material, and by major facility changes, but cannot be eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1988, emission tests of the cupolas showed CO emissions from both cupolas were in excess of 200 ppm. CO was present at a concentration of 8,317 ppm for Cupola Number 3 and at 4,563 ppm for Cupola Number 2. Subsequent tests showed CO concentrations as high as 16,053 ppm for Cupola Number 3. As a result of these tests, GMC initiated an aggressive plan to modify the system beyond the state-of-the art contemplated by the regulation. In November 1988, GMC filed a petition for a variance in order to continue the operation of the foundry while it implemented corrective action to reduce the concentration of CO in its emissions. Although modifications have significantly reduced emissions, compliance with the 200 ppm limitation has not been achieved. However, emissions have dropped from a high concentration of approximately 18,000 ppm to below 2,000 ppm. A computer modeling study discussed below demonstrated that CO emissions at the rate of 2,000 ppm would not adversely affect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The purpose of this source specific SIP revision request is to permanently amend GMC's allowable emission limit of gases containing CO from 200 ppm to 2,000 ppm for this iron foundry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Analysis of State Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> As previously stated, the IPCB has adopted a site-specific regulation revising the allowable emission limit of CO from GMC cupolas in Vermilion County from 200 ppm to 2,000 ppm. The new language reads as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> The standard for CO for 35 IAC 216.381 shall not apply to the existing foundry located adjacent to Interstate 74 at G street in Vermilion County, owned by GMC on the effective date of this regulation. The emission of carbon monoxide from this foundry shall not exceed 2,000 ppm corrected to 50 percent excess air. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC) Part 216_Carbon Monoxide Emissions, contains the regulations regarding this SIP revision request. Section 216.101_Measurement Methods, contains measurement methods applicable to GMC's site-specific SIP revision request. This section states that carbon monoxide concentrations in an effluent stream shall be measured by the non-dispersive infrared method or by other methods approved by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) according to the provisions of 35 IAC 201. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA had concerns about the test method and recordkeeping for this source. Specifically the test methods and recordkeeping requirements relied on in this requested SIP revision were not sufficient to ensure compliance with the limit and maintenance of the CO NAAQS. Further, because section 216.201 allows IEPA to modify the test methods utilized and because case law indicates that such State discretionary actions modify the SIP without Federal comment or approval USEPA would be required to disapprove this requested SIP revision since the possibility of modification without Federal approval would impede attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. (See for example  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States of America  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allsteel Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (No. 87C4638 ND Illinois, August 30, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA would ordinarily propose to disapprove this site-specific regulation and recommend that the State modify the regulations in the requested SIP revision to incorporate the appropriate test methods, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and to remove the discretionary provisions or at least to limit their effectiveness until they were approved as a SIP revision by USEPA. However, on December 17, 1992 (57 FR59928) Illinois' operating permit program was approved by USEPA and incorporated into the SIP for the purpose of issuing Federally Enforceable State Operating Permits (FESOP). As operating permits issued following the approved State requirements are federally enforceable, Illinois addressed USEPA's concerns by including adequate test methods and recordkeeping requirements as discussed in section 3 in a FESOP for the GMC iron foundry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

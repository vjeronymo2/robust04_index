			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News: ITC bans chip imports in row over patents THE US International Trade Commission has issued an exclusion order banning import of semiconductor devices made outside the country by five American companies whose products were found to infringe a patent held by Texas Instruments (TI), Louise Kehoe reports from San Francisco. The exclusion order now goes to President Bush for review and signing. It would prevent the companies importing and selling any integrated circuit or circuit board product that uses TI's patented technology. But the ITC order is not expected to have any material effect on the five companies. They are Analog Devices, Cypress Semiconductor, Integrated Device Technology, LSI Logic and VLSI Technology. The companies say they no longer use the technology in TI's complaint. The impact of the exclusion order is significantly diminished by an earlier ITC ruling narrowing TI's patent claims, enabling the companies to circumvent TI's patents. The technology in question is the process whereby electronic chips are encapsulated in plastic packages. TI holds patents on the most commonly used method called 'bottom gating' where plastic is injected into a mould cavity underneath the chip. But since the TI complaint was filed 18 months ago, all five have converted to an alternative approach which the ITC ruled is not covered by TI's patent.</p>

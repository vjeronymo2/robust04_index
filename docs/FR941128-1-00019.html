			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The USWA concluded, based upon the above stated concerns, that the permit space standard should require that all host employers establish and use rescue services composed only of their own employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As has been discussed, OSHA believes that the final rule does address the need for the host employer to consider timeliness of rescue and accountability in its selection of outside rescue services. However, the Agency recognizes that these areas of the standard may not have been set forth with sufficient clarity or specificity in the regulatory text. Therefore, OSHA is proposing to revise paragraph (k)(2) so that the standard more clearly states what an employer must do when it arranges to have persons other than its own employees provide permit space rescue and emergency services. (See Section III., Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Revision.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Retrieval Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (k)(3)(i) of the final standard contains a provision requiring that retrieval systems employ a retrieval line which is attached at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level or above the entrant's head. In the final standard's preamble (58 FR 4531) the reason given for specifying the attachment point for the retrieval line is ``so that the entrant will present the smallest possible profile during removal, in case a rescue becomes necessary.'' It has come to OSHA's attention that the language of paragraph (k)(3)(i) may be unnecessarily restrictive. The ADS Environmental Services Company, a contractor which provides flow monitoring services in sewers, has requested that OSHA grant a variance (Ex. 2) from the requirement that the point of attachment either be centered near the entrant's back near shoulder level or overhead. For operational purposes, the ADS Company attaches the retrieval line in front of the entrant at about mid-shoulder level. ADS has satisfactorily demonstrated that their method of retrieval line attachment is equally as effective as the two methods specified in the existing OSHA standard in meeting the stated objective of presenting the smallest possible entrant profile during removal. Accordingly, and in keeping with the Agency's goal of stating standards in performance-oriented language to the extent reasonable, OSHA believes it is appropriate to amend &sect;1910.146(k)(3)(i) to permit any point of attachment of a retrieval line to a chest or full body harness which meets the goal of presenting the smallest possible entrant profile during removal from a permit space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Employee Participation in Exposure Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to suggesting changes to the rescue provisions, the USWA also stated, in its June 22, 1993 letter, (Ex. 1) that the Permit Space standard should contain a provision which requires that affected employees, or their designated representatives, be permitted to observe any exposure monitoring required by the standard. The USWA contends that the inclusion of such a provision is required by section 8(c)(3) of the Act, and that such a provision is routinely placed in all of OSHA's chemical-specific standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a comment from the United Auto Workers (UAW) (Ex. 19&hyph;38), Issue 3 of the Hearing Notice (54 FR 41462) requested input regarding worker participation in the design and implementation of a Permit Space program. As discussed in the final rule (58 FR 4484&hyph;85) most of the comments and testimony received expressed general support for the concept of employee participation, but did not provide specific suggestions as to how that participation should be implemented. In responding to Issue 3, the UAW testimony at the public hearings repeated their NPRM recommendation that the permit space standard require active employee participation in the design and implementation of permit space programs, while adding a suggestion that employers provide employees with an opportunity to observe the monitoring of permit spaces (Chicago Tr. 347). In its post hearing brief (Ex. 142), the UAW repeated the suggestion for observation of monitoring without elaboration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA did not include specific requirements for employee participation in the final rule because the Agency believed it would be very difficult to mandate labor-management collaboration and to determine how disagreements would be resolved. In addition, OSHA stated that employees would have input to the Permit Space program through &sect;&sect;1910.146(d)(13) (review of permit space program) and (g)(2)(iv) (retraining when there are deviations from the permit space procedures).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the submission by the USWA, the Agency has agreed to raise an issue for comment regarding employee observation of monitoring. OSHA does not believe that section 8(c)(3) of the Act mandates the inclusion of a requirement for employee observation of monitoring in safety standards. However, the Agency is considering whether such a provision should be added to the permit space standard based on the concerns expressed and on the record developed as a result of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, OSHA requests comment from interested parties as to whether the Agency should revise &sect;1910.146 by adding a requirement that affected employees, or their designated representatives, be permitted to observe the evaluation of confined space conditions, including any testing or monitoring conducted under the permit space standard. The Agency requests that commenters provide the reasons for their views, and requests the submission of any data or information which would be useful to OSHA in making an informed decision regarding this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USWA also believes that the Permit Space standard should contain a provision which requires that the results of any evaluation of a permit space, including the results of any atmospheric monitoring conducted, be made available to employees or their designated representative. OSHA agrees that it is important that this information be made available to permit space entrants and believes that the existing permit space standard already includes provisions to assure that this objective is achieved. Existing &sect;1910.146(f)(10) requires that the results of initial and periodic tests performed under existing &sect;1910.146(d)(5) be entered on the entry permit, and existing &sect;1910.146(e)(3) requires that the permit be made available to all authorized entrants at the time of entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, OSHA solicits comments regarding the issue of whether the existing standard provides adequate employee access to the results of testing and monitoring in permit spaces. The Agency also encourages interested parties who believe that the existing provisions are inadequate to provide suggestions regarding how OSHA can correct any such inadequacies. OSHA may decide, based upon the comments received concerning this issue, to add a provision or provisions to the permit space rule replacing or strengthening the current provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Revision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA proposes to make several changes to paragraph (k)(2) of &sect;1910.146 so that the standard will more clearly state the duties and responsibilities of employers (host employers) who arrange for persons other than their own employees to perform permit space rescue in their workplace. OSHA believes that the proposed changes will make it clearer that such employers must select rescue services which are capable of responding in a timely manner and which are properly trained, equipped and capable of functioning appropriately to perform permit space rescues at the host employer's facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

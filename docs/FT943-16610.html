			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Motorists warned over summer smog Commuters are being asked to avoid using cars today because the hot summer weather has raised air-pollution levels. The Department of the Environment urges commuters to use public transport or bicycles, or walk to work to help reduce the level of 'summer smog'  - caused by high levels of ozone, the largest source of which is motor vehicles. The department yesterday forecast that air quality would be poor throughout England and Wales today. Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to enjoy cleaner air. Motorists are being asked to switch off engines if they expect to be stationary for more than a few minutes, and to avoid over-filling petrol tanks because spilled petrol evaporates releasing toxic hydrocarbons.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent V. Skvortsov including recorded remarks by </F> V. Kucher, editor in chief of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; from the  "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Skvortsov] Without waiting for New Year's eve, when  the old and unnecessary are thrown away, our fellow journalists  at the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI have freed themselves from  the intrusive stewardship of their masters, the Council of  Ministers.    [Kucher] I will be honest about this. We have taken  advantage of an edict by President Boris Yeltsin about  reorganizing the government, and which has brought us an  unexpected New Year's present. According to Clause 4 of Article  18 of the Law on the Press, if a founder is reorganized, then  all rights are transferred to its successor at the newspaper,  which is the work force.    We held a meeting of journalists yesterday, and we became  founders of the newspaper. We are profoundly convinced that if  Russia is becoming a truly democratic state, then there should  be no newspapers speaking in the name of the state or newspapers  working under the diktat of any state authorities. Newspapers  should perform another vital function: Supervision of the  authorities by society.    [Skvortsov] They plan to solve the problem of finance  themselves, with only part coming from the state budget.    [Kucher] We were not building up a newspaper business. We  felt like a castrated tom cat in the hands of a rich boss.    [Skvortsov] We will find out the government's reaction to  this breakaway next year.</p>

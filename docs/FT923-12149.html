			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Stonehill cuts losses to Pounds 387,000 STONEHILL HOLDINGS, the furniture maker and property investment group, made substantial inroads into its losses in the year to March 31. From turnover of Pounds 2.37m (Pounds 1.6m) operating profits were Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 577,000). After slightly reduced interest charges the pre-tax loss was cut from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 387,000. Mr James Buchanan, chairman, said despite the environment the group had substantially increased the income from the Stonehill business park and improved its facilities. 'We anticipate that an improving trend will be maintained'. Losses per share were 2.24p (5.76p) after allowing for unpaid preference dividends where arrears amount to Pounds 168,000.</p>

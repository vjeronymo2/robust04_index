			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Wiping out pollution from the ground up Much of the industrialised world is a dirty place. In recent years, western governments have forced companies to cut drastically their emissions of gases, chemicals and other pollutants into the air and water. But what happens to the mess left in the ground when a company moves, closes down, or decides to change its ways after operating on the same site for years? The area is often unfit for industrial or other use and a costly, time-consuming, clean-up process is needed. Although the extreme environmental problems of eastern Europe have received most recent attention  - these range from fetid air to unsafe nuclear power stations  - there are plenty of problem sites in the west. One company which specialises in cleaning them up is Lurgi Umwelt-Beteiligung (LUB), though it has plenty of competition from other companies. LUB can draw on the depth of experience in ore processing of its Lurgi parent company, part of the Metallgesellschaft group. As yet, decontamination is an industry in its infancy, but the scale of the problem and the tightening up of regulations across Europe is likely to bring about an escalation of business. LUB reckons some 130,000 former industrial sites probably need cleaning up in Germany alone. In perhaps 10 per cent, this should be done quickly to avert potential health risks. About 30,000 of these areas are in east Germany, which has some of the most notorious pollution in Europe. But more than 90,000 are in west Germany; causing the contamination has been a variety of industries such as smelting, chemicals and power generation. LUB's process is called Deconterra. It works by running the soil though a big rotating drum filled only with water. Through the vigorous scrubbing process, the contaminant materials fall off the large particles and become attached to the small ones. The unpurified particles are sent through further attrition and flotation processes, ending up in a foam discharge which is drawn off in concentrated form. Lurgi says between 65 and 85 per cent of contaminated soil on a given site can be cleaned in this way. Apart from continuing work near its own headquarters at the edge of Frankfurt, formerly a copper processing plant, it is also cleaning up a coking coal site in Bochum in the Ruhr and an area in Bavaria contaminated with mercury. Perhaps its most exciting project is the reclamation of areas in the Hesse town of Stadtallendorf, the location of Germany's biggest explosives plant in the Second World War and where much of the ground contains trinitrotoluene (TNT). Yet mechanical soil-washing processes like Deconterra, which deals mainly with organic chemicals, cannot cope with all problems. Biological and thermal treatment, which LUB does not do, is also needed for some types of contamination such as heavy metals and fuel-oils. In east Germany, the scope for decontamination seems boundless. 'There is a huge need,' says Hartmut Witte, the head of LUB. 'but there is no money.' The states there do not have the funds for a wholescale clean-up. The situation is worse in the rest of east Europe, which has even less money available. Thus Witte is looking elsewhere for immediate foreign expansion. As EC and national rules are stiffened, dumping charges will become prohibitive and most companies wanting to prepare sites for future use will prefer to clean them up. Denmark and the Netherlands, which have even tougher laws than Germany on ground contamination, are likely markets, as are France and the UK. But he also has his sights set on the US, where LUB is operating test sites for eventual acceptance of Deconterra by the Environmental Protection Agency. Its partner there is Horsehead Resources, in which Metallgesellschaft has a large minority stake. To make its process more manageable, LUB has developed mobile units for areas with small soil volumes. These would be suitable not only for Europe but also the US. Moreover, several west German states want to set up regional decontamination centres which would need mobile units to transport the soil. LUB is keen to help operate these.</p>

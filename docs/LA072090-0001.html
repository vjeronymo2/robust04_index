			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE DESTROYS HOLLYWOOD STUDIO;  </P> <P> DAMAGE: COST OF EARLY-MORNING BLAZE IS PUT AT $2.6 MILLION. NO INJURIES WERE  REPORTED, BUT AN OWNER OF THE 70-YEAR-OLD BUILDING SAYS HE LOST EVERYTHING.  </P> <P> Fire gutted a two-story Hollywood studio early Thursday, causing an estimated  $2.6 million in damage to the 70-year-old building where the old "Steve Allen  Show" was made.  </P> <P> About 110 firefighters were called to the Late Night Studios in the 1200 block  of Vine Street, where they battled flames which at one time threatened to  engulf a nearby apartment house, Fire Department spokesman Pat Marek said.  </P> <P> The fire began at 2:10 a.m. and was extinguished 90 minutes later, Marek said.  There were no injuries.  </P> <P> Officials were investigating the cause of the fire.  </P> <P> Rik Sciacca, one of the owners of Late Night Studios, a 5-year-old  entertainment production company, said he was told faulty electrical wires  sparked the fire.  </P> <P> "There's nothing left," Sciacca, who lived in a studio office, said Thursday  morning as he collected the few items that were not devoured by the flames.  Sciacca said nearly everything he owns has been destroyed.  </P> <P> 'I don't know when I'm going to cry," Sciacca told a friend. "I have no pants,  shoes or shirts. I'm still a little shaken up. I left here at 12:15 a.m. and  came back later and watched the place burn."  </P> <P> Late Night Studios is involved in, among other enterprises, the production of  music videos.  </P> <P> The structure, built in the 1920s, once was home to the Filmarte Theatre Movie  House, said Hollywood historian Marc Wanamaker.  </P> <P> Wanamaker said the theater was transformed into a television audience theater  in the early 1960s. Among programs produced there was the "Steve Allen Show."  </P> <P> Officials estimated that the fire caused $1.6 million in damage to the  structure and another $1 million to its contents, which included sound stages,  a rehearsal room, offices and wardrobe rooms.  </P> <P> Two other companies rented space in the building, Sciacca said.  </P> <P> Because of the fire, city officials closed Vine Street and several nearby roads  for five hours Thursday.  </P></p>

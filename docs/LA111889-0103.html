			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE BARRICADES GIVE PEACE A CHANCE IN DRUG-TORN AREA  </P> <P> Inside Los Angeles' newest gated community -- a 12-square-block area cordoned  off by police earlier this month -- the shouts of children playing have  replaced the bursts of gunfire that commonly shattered the peace when drug  dealers ruled the streets.  </P> <P> "It's so much easier to sleep now that they closed off the neighborhood to the  drug addicts and sellers," said Rosalena Jimenez, a 39-year-old housewife who  said that in the past her family was frequently disturbed by the sound of  screeching cars, raucous street brawls and gunfire. Now that the tide of  drive-by drug traffic has been halted, "I don't have to watch my boys like a  hawk anymore when they play outside," she said.  </P> <P> Police put up sawhorse barricades last week at four of the five entrances to  the Sepulveda neighborhood to deter drug buyers. The roadblocks, similar to  those in the Pico-Union area west of downtown, have been so successful that  police want to permanently barricade the streets and erect a guard station at  the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street to admit only residents and  their guests.  </P> <P> Closing the streets permanently would require approval from the City Council  and the cooperation of the more than two dozen property owners in the area who  would have to donate money to set up and staff the guard station.  </P> <P> A diverse group of mostly low-income tenants, many of whom are elderly,  Hispanic or recent immigrants, live in the neighborhood. Fed up with the steady  stream of drug buyers, they appear to strongly support the proposal, although a  minority say they are embarrassed to be living in an area police have deemed a  "narcotics enforcement zone."  </P> <P> "I personally want to move out because it looks real bad to live here," said  Cheryl Insalaco, 25, a clothing store manager who lives with her mother. "The  people I work with found out I'm from there and they said, 'Geez, it must be a  pretty bad area.' "  </P> <P> But Cayetano Guerrerro, 67, an ice cream vendor who also lives in the area,  said the transformation of the neighborhood into a peaceful enclave is worth  any stigma.  </P> <P> "Just take a look and you can see -- it's much better now without those cholos  hanging around pretending to buy my ices whenever the police go by," he said.  "I don't always have to watch out for thieves."  </P> <P> Guerrerro's route takes him past a jumble of new and old apartment complexes in  the area, most of which are already gated to keep drug dealers from using  parking lots to hawk their wares. The neighborhood also contains an 84-unit  complex for senior citizens and Penny Lane, a nonprofit home for more than 100  emotionally disturbed children age 6 to 18, some of whom have been convicted of  drug possession.  </P> <P> One 16-year-old Penny Lane resident lounging this week with friends outside the  one-story stucco facility said she used to sell drugs on nearby Columbus  Avenue, also known as "C Street" because of the heavy traffic in rock cocaine  there. Since the barricades were erected, she said, she finds going outside  "less of a temptation because there aren't any drugs nearby. Maybe the dealers  go somewhere else, but I don't care as long as they're not in front of my  place."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the home said the blockade is "great. We've needed something  like this for years because every time the police would leave, the dealers  would come back." He asked that his name not be used because drug dealers have  threatened him in the past after he asked them to move away from the home.  </P> <P> Residents of Rayen Park, a gated apartment complex for senior citizens, also  applauded the closure of the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "Columbus Avenue is a nasty street," said Lesley Blackstone, 87, a retired  jeweler who uses a cane. "We're always afraid the dealers will go after us. I'm  glad the police are finally doing something to protect us."  </P> <P> For the past two years, a 10-officer task force working undercover and in  uniform patrolled several high-crime Sepulveda neighborhoods, including the  Columbus Street area, said Capt. Mark Stevens of the Los Angeles Police  Department's Devonshire Division.  </P> <P> To further increase police presence in the neighborhood, six to eight officers  were assigned to Sepulveda on foot patrol during a brief pilot program in  September to test the effectiveness of the technique.  </P> <P> But Stevens said police officials realized that more than foot patrols were  needed when a drive-by shooting wounded two visitors to the community late last  month on Columbus Avenue.  </P> <P> Inspired in part by the success of the Rampart Division in temporarily  barricading a Pico-Union neighborhood, Stevens said, he set up the roadblocks  Nov. 7 in Sepulveda.  </P> <P> At least one person is not happy with the change the barricades have wrought.  Oscar Barnett, who drives a catering truck in the area, said the street  closures have cost him money because there are fewer people in the neighborhood  now that drug customers are shunning it.  </P> <P> "I say, 'Sock it to the cops,' " Barnett said. "The Constitution allows the  highways and byways of this nation to be open to anybody."  </P></p>

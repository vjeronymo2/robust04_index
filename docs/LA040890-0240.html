			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY: THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE;  </P> <P> JOE GARAGIOLA'S TIPS FOR WATCHING BASEBALL AT HOME  </P> <P> Vin Scully, the Walt Whitman of the baseball broadcast booth, has been known to  describe the afternoon sky above a ballpark as "azure blue with pewter gray  clouds." Joe Garagiola, the former catcher for the Cardinals, Pirates, Cubs and  New York Giants, will look at that same sky and say, "I'm glad the clouds are  there today, because they will help in seeing the pop flies."  </P> <P> Whether you see baseball through the eyes of a poet or a player, the sky,  Garagiola says, is just one of many signs and signals connoisseurs of the game  will want to observe-even when watching on television.  </P> <P> Obviously, TV viewers are prisoners of the pictures the director and producer  decide to show. If you want to see how the Dodger outfield is positioned to  play Darryl Strawberry in the late innings of a close game, but the screen is  filled with the svelte figure of Tommy Lasorda scratching his head in the  dugout, too bad. Yet even with the inherent restrictions of television,  Garagiola, who on Tuesday will begin his first season as the color man for the  35 Angels telecasts on SportsChannel, says that viewers can often experience  treats of the game that they'd never notice from the stands.  </P> <P> "I was once broadcasting a 'Game of the Week' when Stan Musial was playing, and  I noticed the trainer working on him in the dugout," the former NBC commentator  reminisced. "So I said, 'Stan Musial is being worked on by the trainer. And you  won't believe what he's doing. He's actually trimming Musial's eyelashes so  that they won't interfere with his vision when he gets up to bat.' And the  camera zoomed in real close on his face.  </P> <P> "You miss the ambience, the flavor of the game, sitting at home. I'm sure lots  of people watching on television got real excited when Kirk Gibson hit that  home run in the World Series, but being there was something else. But at the  same time, watching on television you get the benefit of those closeups and  replays that you just can't see from the bleachers."  </P> <P> On the eve of this lockout-plagued season, Garagiola, 63, the 27-year veteran  of NBC who left the network following the 1988 season, offered several tips to  help baseball fans get the most out of watching their favorite game on TV.  </P> <P> * Know the starting pitchers. "If Nolan Ryan is pitching, you'll want to listen  for the grunts, which I find entertaining, but also you'll want to see if the  hitters are fouling the ball off or pulling it. If they foul it straight back,  that means Ryan has his good stuff, but if they are pulling it early in the  game, that means they are starting their swings very early and his curve is  going to make a lot of people look silly."  </P> <P> * Check the flags. "If the wind is blowing out, you can say, 'Hey we might have  some home runs,' but also if a knuckleballer like (Texas Ranger) Charlie Hough  is scheduled, that wind will make his pitches even livelier, and you'll want to  watch to see if the catcher is having trouble handling those things."  </P> <P> * Note the dimensions of the park. "In Atlanta or Oakland, there is tons of  foul territory, so balls that might go into the stands in other stadiums are  easy outs there. And Fenway Park in Boston has that fence that juts out down  the left field line, so a hard hit ball just inside the bag can turn into a  play at first or an easy out at second if the shortstop is alert for the  ricochet. That's a fun thing to watch for."  </P> <P> * Observe how the ball moves through the grass. On the first hit ball,  Garagiola recommends noticing whether the ball dies in the tall grass or skips  with some juice right through it. "In Wrigley field, the grass sometimes gets  so high that the ball has to eat its way through, and you can expect some  runners to try to take the extra base."  </P> <P> * Keep an eye on the catcher. "See where the target is, inside, outside and  whether it's a true target or just a decoy. Sometimes the catcher will put the  glove in the center of the plate as a decoy, and the pitcher will use his shin  guard as a target for pitching low and away."  </P> <P> * Watch the baserunners. "Mark how far the runner on first goes for his lead,  and then check to see f he's in the same place or if his lead is shorter or  longer after every pitch. That gives you a clue about whether he wants to  steal."  </P> <P> * Look for the bunt. "With a man on first, watch the catcher motion for the  pitcher to throw to first, and when he does, don't watch the ball, watch the  batter. Sometimes at the first bit of motion from the pitcher, the batter will  start to slide his hand down the bat, giving away the bunt."  </P> <P> * Zero in on the tags. "Television gives you closeups of plays on the bases,  like around second on a double play. You can see if the shortstop actually  touches the bag or if he is just in the neighborhood. It's interesting to be  the umpire on things like that. Or on plays at the plate-Mike Scioscia, the  human dead end, is great at blocking the plate. But sometimes he does it too  soon, before he gets the ball. Sometimes he gets away with it and sometimes he  doesn't."  </P> <P> * Steal the signs. "With a runner on second, the obvious thing to check is how  big a lead he's getting, but you can also watch to see if he's trying to steal  the sign from the catcher and then relay it to the batter. It's tough to steal  signs, but if he can, he might be bent over with his arms straight, and that  might mean fastball, and if he bends his arms, that would mean a curve."  </P> <P> * Notice where the batter positions himself in the box. "At the beginning of  the game, he might be right back at the back line. When the sinkerballer relief  pitcher comes in, he may move up a step."  </P> <P> A good announcer, Garagiola says, can help point out some of these baseball  intricacies, and with today's sophisticated fans, can't just get by with  stating the obvious. If a hard throwing pitcher is breaking a number of bats  off in the batters' hands, for example, the announcer should note that it  doesn't mean the team is saddled with a bad bundle of lumber, but that the  pitcher really has great stuff.  </P> <P> Of course, it's best for all announcers, even the most astute analysts of the  game's subtleties, to know when to shut up and let the picture speak for  itself. "When Nolan Ryan got his fifth no-hitter," Garagiola remembered, "I  didn't say anything in the ninth inning. The crowd told everyone what was  happening. The viewers didn't need the announcer to tell them the crowd was in  a frenzy. Anyone watching could appreciate the moment all by themselves."  </P></p>

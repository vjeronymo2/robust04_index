			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Stalemate in fishing dispute The Norwegian and Icelandic foreign ministers failed at a meeting of Nordic states yesterday to make progress in a dispute concerning fishing rights around the Svalbard islands. Mr Bjorn Tore Grodal, Norway's foreign minister, and Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibaldsson, his Icelandic counterpart, agreed at the meeting to open a dialogue but came no nearer to a solution to the dispute. 'We agreed to disagree,' said Mr Grodal. Norway has sovereign rights over Svalbard and claims the right to regulate fishing in the islands' 200-mile economic zone in the Barents Sea. This is disputed by Iceland.</p>

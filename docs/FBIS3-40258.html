			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Richard Erdofy: "The Third Day of Michal Kovac's </F> Visit to Poland"]    [Excerpt] Krakow -- Slovak President Michal Kovac,  accompanied by his wife and entourage, flew to Krakow yesterday  at the end of his three-day official visit to Poland. The Slovak  president met at noon with representatives from the  Cultural-Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland.  Miloslav Molitoris, secretary of the expatriate organization,  which has been operating in Poland since 1947, briefed the  Slovak president on the problems facing the some 25,000-strong  community in Poland.    At the moment, there are only two elementary schools in  Poland where Slovak is the language of instruction -- in Nowa  Biela and Jablonka. Slovak is taught in another 18 schools as a  noncompulsory subject. Representatives from the Slovak  organizations in Poland demanded that the teaching of Slovak at  the high school in Nowy Targ, where Slovak was taught from  1933-39, be recommenced and also that financial assistance be  provided to enhance education.    Miloslav Molitoris praised the idea of opening the borders  between Poland and Slovakia. According to him, "we want to have  a border merely as an administrative line and not as a line that  would divide us." He asked President Michal Kovac for help in  obtaining Slovak priests from Slovak communities and also for  the agreements from the former CSFR on good neighborliness and  cultural cooperation -- which would make it possible to enrich  the cultural lives of the ethnic Slovak citizens -- to be  enshrined in the planned agreements with Poland.    The representatives from the Slovak organizations in Poland  -- the Cultural-Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks, Matica  Slovenska [The Slovak Heritage Foundation], and the St. Vojtech  Society -- pointed out in the discussion that the Polish  Constitution does not guarantee ethnic rights for the Slovak  community. It does not have representatives in parliament or  the mass media; there are also few Slovak representatives in  self-administrative institutions. There are problems with  teaching Slovak, the bilingual designation of communities and  Slovak institutions, and religious services in Slovak. At the  same time, they also expressed an interest in the restoration of  their Slovak citizenship, which they lost in 1946 when the  northern regions of Slovakia were annexed to Poland. The  representatives from the expatriate organizations also demanded  that the Slovak minority be enshrined legally in the  constitutional law and that the Helsinki agreements on human  rights, minority rights, and reciprocal rights -- which the  Poles in Slovakia enjoy -- be implemented.

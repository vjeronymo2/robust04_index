			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of  Croatia, received Russia's special envoy for former Yugoslavia,  Vitaliy Churkin, this evening. After the talks the Russian  diplomat told journalists that they discussed top-level  negotiations between state representatives of the Republic of  Croatia and representatives of the Serbs from the occupied parts  of Croatia. A meeting has been scheduled for 22 March. It will  take place at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. Having mentioned  that he had already discussed these negotiations with President  Tudjman, Vitaliy Churkin told domestic and foreign journalists:    [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed  Serbo-Croatian translation] The first thing to be done is to  sign a very strong document guaranteeing that there would be no  further fighting in the [UN] protected areas and around them.  In the past few days we worked very hard in order to arrange a  meeting at which an agreement would be signed. This agreement  had been studied earlier, but for political reasons it was never  either completed or signed. I hope that the agreement will be  signed at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on 22 March, but I am  certain that it will not be easy. I hope that the attitude of  the two sides would not be to try to squeeze out some  concessions at the last minute, but to try to show that each  side is the one which is being more constructive and prepared to  make greater concessions for the sake of peace.    I hope that the attitude will not be technical, i.e., that  they will not discuss how far, for instance, a particular cannon  would have to be moved from a particular tree, so that the  agreement could be implemented. I hope that the state approach  -- based on a very strong desire for peace -- will prevail. I  am certain that this desire exists both among the Croats and  among the Serbs. [end recording]</p>

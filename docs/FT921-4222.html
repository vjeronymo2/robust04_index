			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC warns Japan on bilateral US deals BRUSSELS yesterday warned Japan not to strike bilateral trade deals with the US that might lose the EC its toehold in the Japanese market and raise its deficit with Tokyo. In talks yesterday, Japanese officials provided the EC with details of Tokyo's recent agreement to double imports of US-made car parts over 1990-95. But the Commission said it still lacked pledges this deal would not discriminate against EC producers. In general, the Commission conceded the cause of the EC's mounting deficit with Japan lay more with the nature of the goods traded, and the structure of the Japanese market, than with the relatively few specific tariffs and obstacles Japan still imposes on imports. The EC deficit rose from Dollars 18bn (Pounds 10.2bn) in 1990 to Dollars 27bn last year, Japanese statistics show. Half this deficit stemmed from four sectors of Japanese exports to the EC: mass-market cars, telecommunications, electronic data processing and components, for which European demand is strong. By contrast, such EC exports as luxury cars, high-value textiles and alcohol are sensitive to any downturn in Japan. Thus, the Commission has changed tactics. Instead of mounting the kind of rhetorical assault typical from Brussels only a few years ago, it is adopting a lower-key approach. This involved sending to Tokyo last month its one member - Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner - never linked with protectionism. Sir Leon complained of structural impediments, such as difficult access for foreign lawyers who could help EC companies establish themselves. A year ago, EC investment in Japan was less than one-fifteenth (Dollars 3.3bn) of Japanese investment in the EC (Dollars 55.3bn). Brussels plans in May to send EC governments a 'communication' on links with Japan. By then, it will be clear if a Gatt deal, removing, say, public procurement barriers to Japan buying more EC satellite/telecommunications equipment, is possible this year. If not, the EC will pursue its case bilaterally with Japan, perhaps invoking last year's EC-Japanese political declaration to give it extra leverage on trade issues. The European Court of Justice yesterday rejected an appeal by eight Japanese companies against EC dumping duties imposed in 1987 on their photocopiers.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Investors protest at Stet move over debt STET, the Italian public-sector telecommunications group controlled by the Iri state holding company, ran into fierce investor criticism yesterday of its L700bn (Dollars 561m) plan to buy the Finsiel software group. Shares in Stet fell by 23 per cent on a wave of sales by minority shareholders in protest at the nature and presentation of the deal to purchase Iri's 83.3 per cent stake in Finsiel. Ordinary shares in Stet fell to L1,035 - virtually half their level of four months ago. Analysts and bankers reacted with almost universal hostility to the purchase, which they dismissed as little more than a book-keeping exercise to reduce Iri's indebtedness at the expense of Stet's minority shareholders. 'This harks back to the very worst days of the Andreotti government', said one banker. 'It goes completely against what the new government has been saying about privatisation. I hope prime minister Giuliano Amato will reverse it.' Bankers also objected to the timing of the surprise transaction, sprung late on Friday afternoon. The objections follow similar criticisms in June, when Iri made a poorly-managed announcement of a secondary placement of a 16 per cent of Stet's shares. Stet justified the purchase on the grounds of the growing synergies between telecommunications and software companies, and criticised what it termed as the 'speculative attack' on its shares. The price was reasonable and well within its means. Analysts said the deal was devised after last year's calls by Mr Carlo De Benedetti to merge Finsiel, Italy's biggest software house, with Olivetti Information Services, the software operation controlled by the Olivetti computers group. Mr De Benedetti controls Olivetti through his quoted Cir holding company.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Henry Cooper sells Lonsdale belts THE SALE of three Lonsdale Belts won by former heavyweight boxing champion Henry Cooper, was completed yesterday. The boxer was forced to sell the belts to meet losses at Lloyd's of London, where he was a Name. He stopped underwriting in 1985 and resigned from the market in 1989. Mr Cooper was a member of a number of syndicates, including at least one managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency, which made heavy losses in the early 1980s. The belts were sold at a Sotheby's sale of sporting memorabilia held at Kent County Cricket Club's ground in Canterbury and fetched Pounds 42,000 against an expected price of Pounds 70,000. Mr Cooper, undefeated British boxing champion for 11 years from 1959, won the belts in 1959, 1964 and 1967. He is the only boxer of any weight to have won three Lonsdale belts outright. A belt is awarded for three successful British title defences.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Books: Green woman meets Green man - FT Children's Book of the Month THE FORESTWIFE by Theresa Tomlinson Julia MacRae Pounds 8.99, 166 pages WITH THE exception of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson and Captain Marryat, historical novels for children in the Victorian era did little more than provide an opportunity to preach the virtues of the onward march of the British Empire and its values beneath the thin disguise of spiritedly-told adventure stories. Henty dashed off 70 of these yarns and his spirit lingered on until the 1930s when a new generation of writers - Geoffrey Trease and C. Walter Hodges were among the best of them - brought about a quiet revolution in children's taste by enabling them to imbibe real facts about the past in the palatable way that well-wrought fiction can often make possible. Theresa Tomlinson is among the strongest of a younger generation of historical novelists and her two most recent books have explored themes that have developed from her own researches into the history of Sheffield (where she lives) and its immediate environs. The Rope Carrier (Julia MacRae Pounds 8.99), a memorable account of the terrible sufferings endured by the ropemakers who lived in the caves of the Peak District during the 19th century, was among the outstanding novels of 1991. This month, in The Forest-wife, she mines a much more ancient seam and one which, though beginning in Sheffield, moves north into the country which she knew as a child (Whitby and the coast of north Yorkshire), and south, into Sherwood Forest. The Forestwife is set in the time of Richard the Lionheart and, especially, those years in which the common people were suffering the crippling consequences of the taxes imposed to fund the Third Crusade. Mary, daughter to the lord of Holt Manor, is about to be betrothed to an old nobleman at the behest of her imperious and unloving father. The very thought disgusts her - she will be nothing better than a breeding sow for a rich old hog. She escapes in the company of her old wet nurse, Agnes, and the pair of them make a new life for themselves, eking out a miserable existence in the perilous wilderness of Barnsdale, home to the Forestwife, a woman whose powers of healing cause her both be revered by the forest folk and feared as a witch. Theresa Tomlinson possesses many of the virtues of style necessary to a writer of historical fiction for children - an ability to pick and choose among more or less apposite and authentic details; a manner of factual presentation that is sharp, clear and simple; and an ear for dialogue. But perhaps the most pleasing and intriguing aspect of this novel is the way in which the author draws in, almost by stealth, - the persons of Robin Hood and his entourage, that outlaw who took his first literary bow in Piers the Ploughman towards the end of the 14th century. Robin Hood, usually set firmly to one side in that category labelled 'traditional stories', has had scant justice done him in recent years as an historical personage. Disney, predictably, set him in that ahistorical never-never-land of Merrie Englande. Ian Serraillier's fine re-workings of some of the traditional ballads in Robin and his Merry Men and Robin in the Greenwood have long been out of print. What Theresa Tomlinson has done is to return Robin, Little John, Guy of Gisborne and others firmly to the era of Richard the Lionheart and speculates imaginatively, without ever losing sight of the accumulated ballad lore that has come down to us, upon their roles in a society that found itself in perpetual turmoil thanks to the machinations of church and state. Mary, having thrown off the bonds of her father, renames herself Marian, maid of the woods; Robert, her wet nurse's illegitimate son, having fought in support of King Richard against his duplicitous cousin John, becomes her Robin, who promises to return to the Forestwife (Marian assumes the mantle on the death of Agnes) each May Day and dance with her.

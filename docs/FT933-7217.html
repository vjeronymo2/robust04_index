			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Irish explorer heads for Siberian wastes: Why a big Russian trader has invested in a tiny oil company Alexander Sarukhanov has become a familiar figure in the prosperous Kent village of Seal, thousands of miles from his usual stamping ground, the desolate oil fields of Siberia. He has just forged a unique partnership between Aminex, a small quoted Irish oil company managed in the UK, and Zarubezhneftj, the Russian state-owned oil equipment trading company which had a monopoly position until the break up of the Soviet Union. As a result of this deal, Aminex, a company with a market capitalisation of only Pounds 11m, has apparently won access to the vast oil producing potential of the former Soviet Union. Mr Sarukhanov, a 44-year-old petroleum engineer and the deputy director general of Zarubezhneftj, recently accepted a seat on the board of Aminex, which is listed on the Irish Exploration Securities Market, Ireland's equivalent of the old London Third Market. His appointment follows the purchase of 35 per cent of Aminex by East West Oil, which is based in Seal and is jointly owned by Zarubezhneftj and Titan Assets, a UK company with Russian shareholders also based in Seal. The deal which brought Mr Sarukhanov to the Aminex table has raised considerable interest in the industry - both enthusiastic and sceptical. Russia's potential is widely acknowledged. Five years ago, the then Soviet Union was producing almost 13m barrels of oil and equivalent products a day, 61 per cent more than the whole of North America. But the industry is now suffering a chronic lack of investment and equipment and production has halved. Many larger western companies, though scenting vast opportunities, are reluctant to plunge into a country rife with political uncertainty and economic chaos. Aminex, by working with Zarubezhneftj, may have eliminated some of the uncertainties which plague western companies in Russia. Mr Sarukhanov, with more than 20 years' experience of working in government circles, is expected to bring real returns in a matter of months by clinching a deal for Aminex to revive some of the 30,000 neglected oil wells languishing in Siberia. Zarubezhneftj's close ties to the government and long experience overseas make it a useful partner for a venture in bureaucratic and unpredictable Russia. It is used to working with foreign companies, having been the body through which the Ministry of Fuel and Energy imported and exported all of its oil equipment. It was also the government's arm for setting up, running and supplying foreign joint ventures in oil in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and, most recently, Vietnam. At its peak five years ago, Zarubezhneftj boasted turnover of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, and the growing independence of Russian oil producers, turnover has fallen to between Dollars 300m to Dollars 500m. Zarubezhneftj's interest in a tiddler such as Aminex is difficult for many to understand - but not Mr Sarukhanov. 'We are allowed, and it is our duty, to reinvest money back into Russian industry,' he says. A deal such as the one with Aminex - which he describes as 'small enough and at the same time with potential enough' - will 'increase possibilities to do something in Russia'. He continues: 'We hope it is the proper choice. We will see.' He points out that Zarubezhneftj must also seek 'more commercial' opportunities if it is to survive as a privatised entity. Zarubezhneftj will also be able to use Aminex to help Russian producers negotiate the unfamiliar world of western companies and markets. Aminex's relatively small size may in itself be an advantage in Russia. Many larger companies are regarded with suspicion there. 'Russia is a relationship country,' says one industry executive with considerable experience in the region. The majors, he says, have singularly failed to build personal relationships. 'The big shots only go in to sign agreements and then go away again,' he says. 'Small companies can often do things that appear much bigger than they would normally be capable of because of personal relationships.' Oil industry participants have their own ideas about why Zarubezhneftj should choose such a small and insignificant partner. Although the board which rescued Aminex from collapse in its previous incarnation as Eglinton Exploration has experience of the oil industry, it has no expertise in Russia. An analyst specialising in the Russian oil industry says that Aminex may provide a useful hard currency earner for its Russian shareholders, particularly if they can ensure that Aminex gets the best quality oil. The Russian investment in Aminex has been made through a complex web of companies. East West Oil has bought 35 per cent. The 35 per cent stake was purchased at an average price of about 18p per share, against Friday's close of 45p. East West in turn is 50 per cent owned by Zarubezhneftj, with the rest held by Titan Assets, whose ultimate owners are hidden behind nominees, which hold 83 per cent of it. One of Titan's directors is Mr Andrei Gloriozov who is also deputy chairman of Imperial Bank of Russia, the young and aggressive Moscow bank. It is believed that IBR gets much of its money through trading oil and is closely linked to the highest echelons of Russian government. Mr Gloriozov is also a director of Titan Oil &amp; Metals, one of the original investors in IBR, and runs IBR's Luxembourg bank, East West Bank. Titan Assets says, however, that IBR has no direct interests in East West Oil although there is a business relationship. Oil industry executives say it makes sense for both parties to start tapping Russian potential by rehabilitating shut-in wells. 'It is an inexpensive way to get your feet wet,' he says. However, with the Russian oil producers increasingly calling the shots, even an organisation with the financial muscle and political power of Zarubezhneftj may find trying anything more than rehabilitation too difficult at first. Mr Robin McFarlane, who owns 17 per cent of Titan Assets and is a director of East West Oil, is emphatic about his plans for Aminex. 'We want to build it into a significant force,' he says. However, he and Mr Sarukhanov agree that such plans will take some time.</p>

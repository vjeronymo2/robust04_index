			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL;  </P> <P> UNITED WESTERN MEDICAL CENTER CLOSES ITS 2 OUTPATIENT CARE UNITS IN IRVINE  </P> <P> In 1985, United Western Medical Center, which operates hospitals in Santa Ana  and Anaheim, was the first of several out-of-town hospitals to compete for  patients in Irvine by placing an outpatient facility there. Now it is the first  hospital to pack up and leave.  </P> <P> Last weekend all equipment was moved out of the diagnostic imaging and  surgi-centers at 4900 Barranca Ave. in Woodbridge. Officials at United Western  Medical Center, which had owned the surgi-center and had been a general partner  in the imaging center, said both operations were shut because they were money  losers.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of efforts to make it (the outpatient facility) work. But you  can only bleed so long," said Douglas Drumwright, United Western Medical  Center's president and chief executive officer. He said as a last-ditch effort  to keep the surgi-center going, the hospital tried without success to syndicate  the business to physicians.  </P> <P> Another reason for closing the facility, Drumwright said, is the impending  debut of Irvine's first community hospital. Irvine Medical Center, a 177-bed  hospital, is scheduled to open in January.  </P> <P> Other hospitals that continue to operate outreach medical services in Irvine  include Hoag Hospital of Newport Beach, St. Joseph Hospital of Orange and  Kaiser Permanente, a health maintenance organization.  </P></p>

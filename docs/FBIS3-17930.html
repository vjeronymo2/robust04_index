This was not out  of their own disloyalty but owing to the slowness of  presidential messengers. The edict signed by Boris Yeltsin the  night before reached the polling stations only by the second  half of the polling day.    The people of Krasnoyarsk were supposed to either approve or  reject during their plebiscite the draft law crafted by the  local administration "On the Foundations of Direct Sovereignty  of the People and State Power." One of the kray's well-known  politicians told your SEGODNYA correspondent that the law "was  needed in order to bind up the legislative assembly once and for  all," where, as things stand now, only five out of the 34  deputies would constantly work there. For example, it had been  planned to grant the administration's head the right to push the  discussion of any awkward matter one month back merely by his  directive (that is to "filibuster" it, considering that the  session only takes place four times a year). Notably, all the  governor's legislative initiatives would be entitled to be  considered out of turn.    The referendum, however, was not canceled because of Boris  Yeltsin's suddenly revived love for institutions of  representative power. Local observers maintain that the main  reason was the long-standing tensions between Governor Valeriy  Zubov and Yuriy Moskvich, the president's representative in the  kray. Knowing that the center mistrusts local referendums  (especially in the Urals and Siberia), the latter was prompt to  "present materials") to the president's staff. They say around  the city that the edict that followed dealt an appreciable blow  at Mr. Zubov.    The edict refers to the constitutional ban on putting to  referendums regional charters and -- unless they have been  agreed on in Moscow--questions on the status of a federation  component. They point out in Krasnoyarsk that no charter was  put to the plebiscite (only an individual law), and the changing  of the kray's status (for example to that of a republic) was  totally out of the question. In the opinion of Vyacheslav  Novikov, head of the local Center for Strategic Projections,  "the kray's authorities would surely win their case at the  Constitutional Court, only the court does not work now."

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Israel fears it may have dealt Syria a joker in peace talks: Syrian 'restraint' and doubts over the success of Israeli objectives THE RISKS of Israel's devastating aerial and artillery bombardment of southern Lebanon were becoming apparent yesterday as international criticism intensified and the Middle East peace process came under growing threat, while there was as yet no sign the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas had been neutralised. Both President Bill Clinton and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, were severe in their criticism of Israel's action yesterday. There was also a feeling in Israel that after Mr Clinton's praise of Syrian 'restraint', President Hafez al-Assad's hand at future peace talks had been strengthened at Israel's expense. Some Israelis fear that as a reward for that 'restraint', Syria will persuade the US to increase pressure on Israel to make a commitment to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which it seized in 1967. Meanwhile, the shift of the bombardment to the western and central sectors of southern Lebanon yesterday further revealed the overt and covert objectives of the offensive. The first, confirmed in parliament yesterday by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, is to drive southern Lebanese villagers northwards to put pressure on the governments of Lebanon and Syria to end the Hizbollah problem by denying the guerrillas arms supplies and financial assistance, which comes mainly from Iran. Hizbollah is the only Lebanese militia that has been allowed to retain heavy weapons, on the basis that it is fighting a war of national liberation by seeking to push Israel out of the south of the country. The second, undeclared, Israeli objective appears to be to extend the area of Lebanon it controls without having to commit ground troops, a move that would be unpopular with the Israeli public. As villagers headed out of south Lebanon, military officials said privately that a broad strip of land, 3 to 6 miles north of the self-styled 'security zone', would become, at least in the short term, a no-man's land and a second buffer zone where Israel could strike easily in the future. This would put Hizbollah's 122m Katyusha rockets, which have a maximum range of 17 miles, out of reach of settlements in northern Israel. However, Hizbollah shows little signs of letting up in its harassment of Israel, and if Syria, which allows Iranian supplies to reach Hizbollah, does not move to curb the guerrillas, Israel could again be stuck in a war of attrition. Even senior Israeli government officials admit that, far from pin-pointing Syria as responsible for the upsurge in conflict, the Israeli offensive may play into the hands of Damascus. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said Syria wanted to be the one seen as solving the crisis 'to gain points with the Americans and to increase US pressure on Israel in the peace talks'. Mr David Levy, a senior Likud MP and former foreign minister, said yesterday: 'Syria is now considered the moderate party. We failed here. . . We shouldn't help turn Syria into the key for a solution to whom we'll have to beg and to whom we'll have to pay a price.' Hitherto the offensive has been widely popular inside Israel, although opposition is growing within Mr Rabin's coalition. The blitz has also furthered Mr Rabin's policy of undermining the right-wing Likud, which prides itself on toughness. Much will depend on how Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, approaches the problems when he arrives in the region on Sunday and whether he can turn the crisis into an opportunity.</p>

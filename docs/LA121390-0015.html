			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE AND MIDEAST  </P> <P> Yes, this is a volunteer army. If I hear this from one other television  reporter or read it in another newspaper, I shall lose faith in all that is  honest and true.  </P> <P> I am so revolted by the constant rationalization of those who say that these  men who joined the volunteer army were motivated only by a need to protect our  country, no matter what the reason for the carnage.  </P> <P> We all know, or should know, that many of them, if not most of them, hoped to  become educated, or even to support their families by joining the military.  </P> <P> I wonder if Neil Bush or Dan Quayle were in the front lines in the first attack  if our President would be in such a hurry to commit to war. How about a yuppie  battalion? Are we lemmings to be led to the slaughter with no serious  discussion of why?  </P> <P> NATALIE BROWN  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

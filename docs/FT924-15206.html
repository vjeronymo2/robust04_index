			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Predators come out to play IF BRITAIN'S increasingly substantial devaluation is to work, it needs more than the support of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies from the government. Industrialists have to seize the new opportunity for export-led growth. Yet the first tangible signs of confident activity in industry after Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) appear to be coming not so much from the tradeable goods sector, conventionally defined, as from the market in corporate control - witness yesterday's cash offer by Hanson for food group RHM and the earlier unsolicited tender offer from Hongkong Land for a minority stake in Trafalgar House. It would be foolish to draw too many conclusions in the aftermath of the ERM disaster from one hostile bid and another partial offer. The most striking features that the two besieged companies have in common are anyway independent of external circumstances - namely, unexciting management and disillusioned shareholders. That said, British assets now look cheap even to a bidder from Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to a sagging dollar, and Hongkong Land decided to make its tender offer before yesterday's spectacular stock market collapse. Moreover, Britain remains one of the few economies in the world where the right to manage companies is up for sale at all times. Opposite risks Against that background it would be surprising if local predators with cash on the balance sheet were not the first to scent that the time was ripe to give their acquisitive instincts free rein. There is, in addition, a risk that the return on cash will fall and equity prices rise if the government heeds calls to go for broke by reducing interest rates sharply. But there remains an equal and opposite risk - as Hanson knows from its acquisition of assets in the construction and house-building group Beazer last year - that a decision to go for a given target may not be validated by the timing and shape of a subsequent economic recovery. With hindsight, BTR's bid for Hawker Siddeley looks better attuned to an economy whose best hope now lies with export-led growth. Yet the risks look greater for Hongkong Land's investment in Trafalgar than in Hanson's bid for RHM. Trafalgar, with a portfolio of business almost uniquely ill-suited to the depredations of the present recession  - property, house-building, construction, cruise liners, hotels and engineering - would be a handful for any management. The businesses may have impressive names, such as Ritz, Cunard and John Brown, but the valuation of the assets presents huge difficulties in the present climate, especially in property. Further doubt is cast on the quality of assets and earnings by criticism from the Financial Reporting Review Panel. Those who long suspected that Trafalgar's way with accounting was idiosyncratic have been applauding the new accountancy watchdog from a safe distance. A solid business In contrast, RHM is the custodian of excellent brand names and solid, if unexciting, businesses. Having attracted the predatory attentions of Goldman Fielder Wattie and Sir James Goldsmith at the end of the great 1980s takeover boom, it is an old bid chestnut whose share price languishes way below its level when last under attack. In short it has all the lacklustre but cash-generative characteristics that Hanson has looked for in its past acquisitions. And the bid, which Hanson has toyed with on more than one previous occasion, comes when analysts suspect that conditions in the milling industry are just about to take a turn for the better. What Hongkong Land might bring to Trafalgar House is an open question. It would look an unlikely manager for the businesses of John Brown, Davy or Cunard. As for Hanson, it could reasonably claim to bring useful financial muscle to RHM, but on the basis of its recent record, not much more. What evidence there is suggests that takeovers produce fewer, if any, efficiency gains than their proponents loudly proclaim. Sterling's devaluation will have to be followed by something more substantial than a flurry of bids and deals if anything much is to come of it.</p>

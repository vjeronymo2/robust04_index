			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Plamen Enchev: "How Long Will We Ignore the </F> War in Bosnia?"]    [Text] The recent events in Sarajevo and the attitude of  the international community have yet again caught Bulgaria  unprepared for a proper reaction.    The situation is reminiscent of the well-known farce that  happens every year, when the first snowfall takes the Sofia City  Council by surprise. However, the difference is that the snow  sooner or later melts, whereas the risk of war is drawing ever  closer to our border.    The possibility of NATO launching air strikes in Bosnia  perhaps represents the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national  security in the last 50 years. It is claimed that National  Intelligence Service Chief Brigo Asparukhov spoke these very  words at the session of the National Security Commission the  other day. It is alleged that he even admitted that President  Zhelev's stance on the question of NATO attacks in Bosnia has  undergone a 180-degree change.    One could read this claim in yesterday's issue of DUMA.  However, the president, the prime minister, and the chairman of  the National Assembly maintain an official silence. U.S., West  European, and East European politicians vie with each other in  making statements and giving interviews, while the omnipresent  CNN turns the tragedy in Sarajevo into a live television show.  In Bulgaria, there is silence, except for two statements made  by the president on the Bulgarian media on Sunday evening [13  February], in which he described the Sarajevo tragedy merely as  an "incident."    Zhelev found himself in a spot when he received Demirel's  personal letter. It is thought that the Turkish president  wanted nothing less that support for the NATO air strikes. They  might at least publish this letter, to let us know what is  expected of us. Alas, such a policy of openness on issues on  which a consensus is well-known to exist is a practice that has  been alien for our statesmen since time immemorial.    Instead of this, Ms. Yuliya Gurkovska is now concocting Dr.  Zhelev's reply to his Turkish counterpart. We will probably  learn the contents of this letter from the next laconic  statement that emanates from the Presidential Press Center.  Once again, rumors and guesses are rife. Once again, the  members of parliament will wonder whether they are being  sidelined when issues of national security are decided.    We have reached the point where Nikolay Slatinski, chairman  of the Parliamentary National Security Commission, also had to  sit down and write a letter to the president to remind him of  what our position on the Bosnian conflict has been so far and to  raise the alarm that a wave of militarism is developing that may  engulf Bulgaria as well.    Please excuse me, gentlemen politicians and statesmen, but  against the background of a possible NATO intervention close to  our borders, everything else should be secondary, no matter how  important it may seem. The various ballots, disputes, gang  wars, cabinet shuffles, and so on are nothing in comparison with  the trial to which we are subjected by the decision of a  military-political bloc that some people want us to join as soon  as possible, although it is far from clear whether they want us.    We should now learn a lesson from the other Europeans who  are  still not members of NATO and openly declare our official  position, and at the highest level, instead of letting various  deputy defense minister hint that limited air strikes will not  directly threaten our national security. Does Defense Minister  Valentin Aleksandrov think so, too?    We must put an end to the lack of coordination in our  foreign  policy. A good opportunity for this is presented by President  Zhelev's forthcoming visit to Brussels, where he is to sign the  document by which Bulgaria will join the Partnership for Peace  initiative.    We hope that when in Brussels, he will express the country's  unanimous view that partnership means cooperation in the name of  peace, not war, and that Bulgaria will preserve its neutrality  as regards what is happening on the territory of our western  neighbor.    Otherwise, it may turn out that the snow has again caught us  by surprise, with the difference that the prospects of the  spring coming will be indefinitely postponed.</p>

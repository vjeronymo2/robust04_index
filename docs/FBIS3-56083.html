			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Swedish firm SKB Director (Bo Gustafsonn), </F> German firm GNB representative (Dieter Schonfeld), and Gennadiy  Negrivoda, chief engineer of the Ignalina nuclear power plant,  by Ruta Skatikaite under the "Economy" rubric; place and date  not given: "Forty Years for Contemplation"]    [Text] Each country with a nuclear power plant faces the  problem of storing and burying the radioactive fuel waste.  However, few such countries fail to take care of its storage in  advance.    Lithuania has been forced into a situation where no storage  facilities for particularly radioactive fuel waste have been  built at the Ignalina nuclear power plant over the 10 years of  its operation. The space left in the special water reservoirs,  where waste fuel cassettes have been stored for 10 years, is  enough to last the plant for only a year. If no new storage  facilities are built over this time, the first block will have  to be shut down. It is not difficult to imagine what an energy  crisis may hit the country receiving even 90 percent of its  electric energy from the nuclear plant. However, this danger  has been removed by the government adopting a decision on the  storage of radioactive waste in special dry containers.  Currently, the so-called intermediate "wet" (water) nuclear  fuel storage is more common in the world. The government based  its decision on the conclusions of Lithuanian nuclear energy  specialists and the Swedish firm SKB. A contract with the  German firm GNB is nearing completion today. SKB Director (Bo  Gustafsonn) has actively participated in this work. We have  asked him to detail how the issue of storage choice was settled.    "Sweden concluded a contract with the Lithuanian Energy  Ministry on this matter more than a year ago," said Bo  Gustafsonn. "Two- thirds of the expenses were covered by  Sweden, and the remaining part -- by Lithuania. In the  beginning, six countries participated in the tender, but later  there remained only three -- Germany, Canada, and the United  States. Assessing their projects, we primarily considered their  security, the fact whether the production of a firm has already  been used and what the response is, and whether a firm will  manage to manufacture the necessary amount of containers in  short order. Certainly, we also thought about the price. The  production of the German firm GNB met all of these requirements,  except the last one."    [Skatikaite] It is the price that encouraged the  Canadians to raise objections to the commission's choice. Are  their containers really $100 million cheaper?    [Gustafsonn] This sum is concocted. (We have learned from  other sources that the price of one GNB container is 600,000  German marks [DM]. The decision endorses the purchase of 60  containers for DM36 million. Thus, even the total sum is only  around $20 million -- the author). The containers of the  Canadian firm "Ontario Hydro" are really cheaper, however, they  weigh an even 100 tonnes, and their transportation requires  special vehicles. Their unloading and the purchase of shipment  containers would require a special building. If we add all  these expenses to the price of the Canadian containers, the  latter will differ little from those of the German production.    [Skatikaite] What countries have bought GNB containers?  I am addressing this question to the German firm GNB  representative (Dieter Schonfeld).    [Schonfeld] Our firm has sold 500 containers to Canada, the  United States, Sweden, France, the Czech Republic, and South  Africa. Currently, we have a contract for another 100  containers. Our firm has engaged in this business since 1978.  We perform the design work, while containers are manufactured  at different enterprises.    [Skatikaite] Currently, there are 800 tonnes of HM  [expansion unknown] stored at the Ignalina nuclear power plant,  while Russia has 3,900 tonnes, that is, 1,000 tonnes less than  in special storage facilities. Does Russia plan to begin  production of its own "dry" containers?    [Negrivoda] A plant in Izhora is planning to start such  production. According to primary estimates, one container would  cost DM210. Even if the price climbs to DM300, it would be  twice cheaper than the GNB containers. If the Izhora plant  speeds up the realization of its project, we will have a broader  choice. As long as the Ignalina nuclear plant operates, we will  need 40 containers annually in the future. Radioactive fuel  waste is stored in dry containers for 40 years. Lithuania must  decide over this period of time what is to be done with such  waste -- to bury it for good or to recycle. Whatever the  decision, this will be a costly process. Thus, those 40 years is  a time not only for contemplation but also for the accumulation  of finances.</p>

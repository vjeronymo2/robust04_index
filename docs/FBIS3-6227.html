The dispatch is in line with a request from UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in late February to send Japanese  personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary  elections.    The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three persons from  the Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo metropolitan government  and 11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member UN unit  to oversee the polls in the central American country.    El Salvador is the third country to which Japan has sent  election observers in accordance with the UN Peacekeeping  Cooperation Law, following Angola and Cambodia.</p>

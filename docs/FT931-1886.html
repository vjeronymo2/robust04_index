			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Amnesty says Egypt appears to be operating 'shoot to kill' policy Amnesty International yesterday said Egypt appeared to be operating a 'shoot to kill' policy in recent raids on suspected Islamic militants, and called for an 'urgent review' of the use of lethal force by police, writes Mark Nicholson. It said that reported police instructions to 'shoot to kill' militants who resist the security forces 'looks like an official licence to kill with impunity.' In a statement which also condemned arbitrary killing by Islamic groups, Amnesty said: 'The human rights situation in Egypt has suffered a serious deterioration' in the past year.</p>

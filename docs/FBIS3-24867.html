Now that Eduardo dos Santos has  lost every hope of turning UNITA into a pliable tool that he  could easily manipulate, he has pulled the militarism trump out  of his sleeve. The latest statements by [Angolan Armed Forces  Chief of General Staff] Joao de Matos bear proof of that.    Under orders from Eduardo dos Santos, Joao de Matos  yesterday  told the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor  Party [MPLA-PT] media that, quote, the Lusaka peace talks were a  mere propaganda exercise, unquote. That is a very serious and  irresponsible statement by Gen. Joao de Matos, and it reflects  the [word indistinct] that has become so much part of the  Futungo de Belas radical wing, which only cares for profits  from its deals with foreign multinational companies, thereby  forgetting completely about the Angolan people's suffering and  famine. The Angolan people, who are closely following  developments in Lusaka, are apprehensive and have repudiated the  People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, chief  of General Staff's thoughtless remarks yesterday. Joao de  Matos yesterday called on the Angolan people, who are fed up  with the war, to arm and prepare for even more difficult times  ahead.    Those remarks, which were seen in Angola as an insult to the  fatherland, were made by the FAPLA chief shortly before he left  Luanda for Brazil, where he will try to establish new military  contacts.    According to a military source contacted by the Voice of the  Resistance of the Black Cockerel yesterday, Brazil is today,  along with the Russia, Cuba, and the DPRK, one of the main  forces working for a holocaust in Angola. That military source  also noted that Brazil is looking for a place where the war  materiel it produces can be tested and sold, thereby turning  into guinea pigs the people who live there. Brazil sees the  MPLA-PT as fertile ground for testing its armament industry.    Our source also said that in past the MPLA-PT had received  support from Russia, Cuba, Poland, the former Yugoslavia and  GDR, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Adding that such cooperation  from opportunists and adventure seekers will not threaten the  Angolan people's desire to achieve freedom, that source noted  that, quote, the Angolan people will defend themselves until  justice has been done in this country, unquote.</p>

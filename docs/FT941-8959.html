			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Church announces management review The Church of England's central policy-making and management structure is to be reviewed by a commission established by the archbishops of Canterbury and York yesterday. Church leaders are under pressure to find savings in all areas of the church's activities after severe reductions in the value of assets of the Church Commissioners, who handle investments. The Commissioners' support for clergy stipends is declining sharply, forcing individual parishes to finance a higher proportion of their running costs. The commission will examine the church's national-level institutions - the General Synod, Church Commissioners, Church of England Pension Board and the offices of the two archbishops. It will also examine these bodies' relationships with dioceses and parishes. Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury, and Dr John Habgood, archbishop of York, urged the commission 'not to shrink from asking radical questions'. A radical simplification of the church's structure, however, would not be sufficient to resolve its financial problems. The church needs to increase its income by about Pounds 50m a year, while central administration costs only about Pounds 20m. The commission, chaired by the Rt Rev Michael Turnbull, bishop of Rochester and bishop-elect of Durham, is due to report by mid-1995.</p>

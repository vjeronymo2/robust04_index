			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's government  categorically rejects diplomatic relations with Cuba. Our doors  will, therefore, remain closed to any initiative in that  direction.    Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner said this  morning that our country will not change its position over that  Caribbean island despite Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina's visit to our country on 15 and 16 April.    Following a meeting with the president at government palace,  Ramirez Boettner said Paraguay is only interested in commercial  contacts within the framework of Mercosur [Common Market of the  South].    "Our position continues unchanged. Paraguay has not changed  its position over Cuba. We will receive him to talk about  Mercosur and trade matters," said Ramirez Boettner. The foreign  minister added that Robaina and his entourage will make an  unofficial visit to the country because we do not have  diplomatic relations with the island. Ramirez Boettner added  that Paraguay is very interested in talking about Mercosur,  particularly because Robaina will be arriving here after  visiting the other three Mercosur member countries.    Ramirez Boettner said he will depart for Marrakech, Morocco,  tomorrow and will not be in the country during Robaina's visit.  Robaina will be received by Deputy Foreign Minister Oscar  Cabello Sarubbi. The foreign minister said Wasmosy will not  receive the Cuban foreign minister either. "I do not think he  (Wasmosy) will receive him because his visit is unofficial," the  foreign minister noted. Robaina wants to talk about Mercosur so  perhaps he will also meet with Industry and Commerce Minister  Ubaldo Scavone.    An interesting detail is that no government official is  scheduled to meet Robaina at the airport.</p>

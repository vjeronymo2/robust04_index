			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Yeltsin suppresses parliament guard PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday followed up his ban on the Communist-nationalist National Salvation Front by suppressing a 5,000-strong parliamentary guard whose actions have caused disquiet among liberal legislators. The guard, formed after last year's failed putsch and answerable directly to Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, had been accused of initiating an exchange of fire with the regular militia. On Tuesday, they were sent to 'guard' the liberal Izvestia newspaper, which Mr Khasbulatov has insisted must again become the official organ of parliament. The guard has been withdrawn from Izvestia, but was reported yesterday still to be in control of the Russian parliamentary building. The two bans have raised the political tension still further in Moscow, which is abuzz with rumours of coups, the formation of shadow cabinets and the imposition of presidential power. A group of liberally-inclined parliamentary factions yesterday appealed to Mr Yeltsin not to introduce presidential power. They argued that 'it would not be a strengthening of presidential power, it would be an attempt to introduce, through the president, chaos and limitless authority which would inevitably lead to civil war'. Mr Khasbulatov, who was reported to have been taken ill last week, has returned to work this week. His despatch of the guards to Izvestia came after a decision by both houses of parliament to take back control of the paper - which has Mr Yeltsin's backing to remain independent.</p>

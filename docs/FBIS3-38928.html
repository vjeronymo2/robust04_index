Cevheri was speaking at a meeting with Enest Drakovic,  Bosnian minister of education, science, culture, and sports.  Cevheri stressed that Turkey displays its stand at every  opportunity. He pointed out that the death of 68 people as a  result of a Serbian artillery attack on Sarajevo deeply wounded  the Turkish people, adding: We know that grieving is not  enough. We will continue to be on the side of  Bosnia-Herzegovina with whatever is necessary and with all the  possible means.    Drakovic said, in turn, that the ties between the peoples of  the two countries go back in history, and asked for Turkey's  help in preparing an Islamic encyclopedia.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRA RIOTERS HURL BOMBS IN ULSTER; N.Y. LAWYER SEIZED  </P> <P> Masked rioters hurling gasoline bombs and rocks clashed with riot police in the  streets of Londonderry today, the 20th anniversary of the deployment of British  troops in the city. Officers arrested an Irish-American activist.  </P> <P> Martin Galvin, a New York lawyer and publicity director of the Irish Northern  Aid Committee, was accused of violating a ban on entering British territory.  </P> <P> Police say the group collects money to buy arms for the outlawed Irish  Republican Army, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.  Galvin said the money is for families of victims of the province's violence.  </P> <P> The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the British police force, said three hours of  predawn violence occurred in the city's Roman Catholic Bogside area, where two  decades ago crowds barricaded streets in battles with police.  </P> <P> Police fired dozens of plastic bullets to disperse rioters, who wore masks to  hide their identities from authorities. Two men were hit but were not believed  to be seriously hurt, police said.  </P> <P> The British domestic news agency Press Assn. said that at one stage gunshots  were heard, apparently fired at police, and that officers were later reported  to have fired in the air to scare off the rioters.  </P> <P> The news agency quoted a local resident as saying rioters ran down a street  throwing gasoline bombs and rocks: "This is the worst (violence) we have had  for four to five years. People were expecting trouble, but no one knew what."  </P> <P> Sporadic violence was also reported in Belfast.  </P> <P> Galvin, 39, was bundled into a police jeep and driven away after taking a  well-publicized walk through Londonderry.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in London said Galvin will be flown to the  British mainland and handed over to immigration officials. The spokeswoman said  Galvin is expected to be deported.  </P> <P> Galvin has visited the province at least four times since 1984 despite being  ordered by Britain to stay out.  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Ashdown calls for ethics in public office bill Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for an ethics in public office bill, saying this was the only way to address the growth of 'sleaze' in government. Amid continuing allegations of corruption against senior Tories Mr Ashdown said that comprehensive legislation was needed if the reputation of parliament was to be saved. The bill, which would be modelled on legislation passed in the Irish Republic, would set out rules on commercial and non-parliamentary business for MPs and government officials. It would also set up structures whereby MPs could be censured if they were found guilty of any wrongdoing. The Irish government has recently introduced a measure which provides for fines of up to Pounds 20,000 and three years' imprisonment for offenders. He said: 'Public faith in Mr Major's administration and trust in parliament and its process is not going to be restored by denials and promises to root out future wrongdoings.'</p>

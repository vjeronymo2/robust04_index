Hastings promptly filed today as a candidate for  governor of Florida in 1990, saying his removal from the bench for conspiring  to accept a bribe had made him "at least well known" throughout the state.  </P> <P> "I believe myself to be a man of honor and integrity. I have not committed any  crime at any time. And therefore, I'm satisfied that, in spite of the actions  of the United States Senate, I can go forward and address issues in this  state," Hastings said.  </P> <P> Hastings, a Democrat, said he had been considering a run for the office for six  months.  </P></p>

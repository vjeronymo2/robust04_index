			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg jumpy as it scales new peaks - This week's changed sentiment Wednesday's reports that the African National Congress and the National Party were close to an accord with the Freedom Alliance, enabling the right-wing coalition to take part in April's elections, turned investment sentiment around in South Africa this week. The overall index jumped 127 to 4,899, with the industrial index up 120, or more than 2 per cent to 5,679 and, by last night, the respective closes were 5,021 and a new high of 5,822 respectively. In the three weeks prior to this the deluge of foreign investment in South African equities, which had seen records tumble on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since October, had dwindled to a trickle. Foreigners were net buyers of shares worth R1.2bn (Dollars 350m) between Christmas and mid-January, but bouts of selling saw net purchases shrink to R43m in the last week of the month. The JSE's overall index scaled the 5,000 level for the first time in the New Year before falling more than 5 per cent to 4,784 by the beginning of February. This week, say JSE floor dealers, local institutions have returned to the market and overseas investors have started 'to nibble' at blue chips again. The roller-coaster performance of equities since sanctions were lifted at the end of September - clearing the way for US fund-managers to build up portfolios at will on the JSE for the first time in nearly 10 years - has confirmed that the stock market, though firmly in a bull run, remains no less susceptible to fears about the transition to the new South Africa. Any thoughts that the surge in foreign ownership of South Africa equities amounted to a free lunch have been dashed by the JSE's heightened vulnerability to overseas investment sentiment. The deadlock in pre-election negotiations coincided with the release of the final draft of the ANC's reconstruction and development programme. Over-hasty interpretations of the ANC's poorly worded draft mining policy raised fears - now abated - that a potential government was bent on wresting control of mineral rights from the private sector, and interfering in minerals marketing. James Capel put out a sell recommendation on South African stocks including the country's leading mining industrial group, Anglo American, which sank to R192 after foreigner buyers had pushed it from R90 to R239 in the a year. The condition of the gold market continues to play a critical role in JSE affairs. By mid-January bullion was up at Dollars 393, set to test Dollars 400 for the first time since July, when, with the help of a Gold Fields Mineral Services report showing a sharp decline in physical demand for the metal in 1993, it lost momentum to slump to Dollars 377 at the end of the month. The metal's weakness knocked JSE gold shares at the same time as the mining industry and investors reacted violently to the ANC's first statements on mining policy. Gold prices are back above Dollars 385, a sign if any was needed that medium-term outlook for shares remains bullish. The stream of fund managers and investment banks visiting South Africa has continued. Mr Richard Stuart, of stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co, says that US funds are still in the early stages of accumulating local stock. By pushing share prices up, they have been able to winkle out tightly-held quality scrip from local institutions. On the economic front, there is little bad news to dissuade them. The economy pulled out of recession in the third quarter of 1993, with annualised quarter-on-quarter growth of 8 per cent; summer rains promise a bumper maize crop; and inflation fell to 9.7 per cent in 1993, its lowest level in 20 years. Growth in December's money supply convinced economists that recovery was entrenched. Mr Stuart said that the real support for an upbeat outlook is the coincidence of the lifting of sanctions with the explosion of US interest in emerging stock markets. Not only are JSE yields through the financial rand, the foreign investment currency unit, particularly attractive compared with markets in Latin American and south-east Asia, but the JSE - currently capitalised at about R700bn (Dollars 205bn) - is about to be incorporated in the International Finance Corporation and Morgan Stanley emerging market indices, which will give added importance to South African equities in international portfolios. Foreign investors are looking at the JSE through a different lens, no longer restricted to its distinctive gold, platinum and diamond mining counters, but focused on industrial stocks which can offer appealing, if not as lucrative returns as their counterparts in Argentina, Malaysia and Taiwan. 'Reconstruction, consumption and resources are what investors are looking for', says Mr Stuart, explaining US investors' thirst for shares in Anglo, the steel-maker Iscor, the construction group Murry &amp; Roberts, and South African Breweries. However, Mr Doug Ellish, head of research at brokers Anderson Wilson, points out the cloud on the horizon: 'South Africa faces a window of opportunity of four years of steady GDP growth, but then an ANC government will have to balance meeting populist demands without losing the sound macro-economic principles it promises it will follow. Any recklessness, and the foreign funds will go.'</p>

He said the  kwaZulu government would not safeguard the lives of South  African security forces deployed in the territory without  permission from the kwaZulu Police [KZP] commissioner.    Speaking in Ulundi at a passing-out parade for KZP recruits,  Mr Buthelezi repeated that kwaZulu did not recognise the TEC's  authority. The TEC could make "as many rulings on kwaZulu as it  likes but it will not be able to implement those rulings, except  by force".    He also reiterated that any attempt to deploy South African  security forces in kwaZulu without permission from the KZP  commissioner would be viewed as an invasion. The IFP leader has  previously said such an "invasion" would be resisted.    Mr Buthelezi said the TEC's request for deployment of South  African forces in kwaZulu amounted to "interfering in our  internal affairs and compromising the sovereignty of kwaZulu".    The TEC last year requested the SAP [South African Police]  be  deployed in four violence-ridden areas of northern Natal/kwaZulu  policed by the KZP. The decision followed a Goldstone  Commission report on the existence of a hit squad in the KZP.  Mr Buthelezi said the kwaZulu government was "deeply hurt" by  the report and again denied there was such a hit squad.    The TEC this week made a third request for KZP Commissioner  Gen Roy During to appear before it to report on the finding that  at least one KZP hit squad had been responsible for several  deaths, including those of African National Congress members.    An employee at Gen During's Ulundi office said he was on  leave until the end of January.</p>

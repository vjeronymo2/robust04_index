			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR VETOES GAS TAX INCREASE  </P> <P> Gov. Bob Martinez vetoed a $4.7-billion transportation tax hike and  construction bill as road builders ringed the Capitol with heavy equipment to  protest his decision. The first-term Republican governor said the bill's  4-cents-a-gallon gas tax increase was unacceptable. Martinez favors allowing  local governments to make the tax decision, and he said the Legislature's bill  allowed the people no voice in imposing the levy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOB VILA CLIMBS BACK UP TELEVISION'S LADDER  </P> <P> Bob Vila got kicked out of the "House" and decided to go "Home."  </P> <P> For 10 years, Vila was host of "This Old House," the highest-rated show on  public television, teaching viewers home renovation and remodeling techniques.  </P> <P> Then he was fired for making too many commercials.  </P> <P> This fall, he'll be back on the job -- on commercial TV.  </P> <P> "The new show is aptly named 'Home Again' because, in many ways, it puts me  back on TV where I started 10, 11 years ago," Vila said from BVTV, his  production company in Massachusetts. "I'm doing construction and remodeling  stories that are relevant to the remodeling homeowner and home builder."  </P> <P> That wasn't the case on the Emmy Award-winning "This Old House," which spared  no expense when it undertook costly renovation projects, he said.  </P> <P> With 15 million viewers, "This Old House" made Vila a celebrity among  do-it-yourselfers. He cashed in with a string of TV commercials for Time-Life  Books and various home improvement products.  </P> <P> That grated on his show's corporate underwriters and on Boston's WGBH-TV, which  produced the show. The underwriters saw Vila speaking for the competition. WGBH  said Vila was hurting public TV's image.  </P> <P> To put it kindly, he was nailed.  </P> <P> "It was tough for me for three months," said Vila, who found a new sponsor in  Sears, Roebuck and Co.  </P> <P> "Home Again," syndicated by Group W, will air starting in September in 85% of  the country, including on network affiliate stations in 24 of the top 25  television markets.  </P> <P> "As far as public television is concerned, I gave them 10 great years of my  life," Vila said. "I feel like I've done my duty for public TV."  </P></p>

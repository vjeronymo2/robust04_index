			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 27 Mar (PL) -- Today, Colombian  newspaper EL TIEMPO amended a report in which it linked the  Cuban Government as well as a Colombian bishop to an alleged  guerrilla summit. The newspaper also issued apologies to  Havana, the prelate, and its readership. [see item PA1803032994  in 22 March Terrorism Report]    After comparing and determining the credibility and  authenticity of its source that prompted reports on an alleged  trip to Cuba by Bishop Nel Beltran and a guerrilla summit being  held on the island, EL TIEMPO decided to retract the report and  apologize to the bishop and the Cuban Government.    The two-page apology published in Section 1 of the newspaper  says, ``it was the victim of an ill-intentioned machination, the  intellectual origins and objectives of which have yet to be  determined.''    The newspaper was referring to evidence alleging that a  Colombian guerrilla summit took place in Cuba in January and in  which Beltran participated. Reports on the alleged summit were  published several days running, beginning on 10 March.    With respect to the summit, Prosecutor General Gustavo de  Greiff also said he possessed ``irrefutable evidence,'' which EL  TIEMPO itself indicated ``contributed to the disinformation.''    The newspaper acknowledges the falsity of the reports,  ``despite the apparent accuracy of the information handed over  by the initial source, confirmation by a reliable second source,  and a state security agency's intelligence report that had been  disclosed by a high-ranking government official.''    EL TIEMPO also claims it relied on ``an endorsement from the  Prosecutor General's Office.''    It adds: ``By not contacting Bishop Nel Beltran, regardless  of how difficult it may have been, Chief Editor Francisco Santos  authorized the publication of the report without first  subjecting it to essential screening to determine its accuracy.''    The apology also indicates that ``the aggressiveness in what  is known in journalistic circles as `fast breaking news'  prompted this newspaper, its chief editor, and, in particular,  its Legal Editor Edgar Torres to make erroneous decisions that  ultimately led to the publication of false reports and  subsequent recurrent reports on the same issue, which today we  proceed to rectify.''    The Santa Fe de Bogota paper adds: ``This, however, does not  excuse the mistake, because by way of professional and sincere  screening, as well as by meeting with those individuals  mentioned in the report, we would have unmasked the source and  avoided publishing misleading reports.''    The Cuban Government, its embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota, and  some of the highest-ranking Colombian authorities had repeatedly  denied the disclosures.    Nevertheless, in light of certain evidence gathered by the  Prosecutor General's Office, the Colombian Government decided to  request an explanation from the Cuban Government.    Sources hostile to Cuba tried to take advantage of the  election campaign in Colombia and even suggested breaking off  diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were fully restored in  October.    In explaining the incident, EL TIEMPO claims its source was  a  person who had been a former guerrilla member, an associate of  Pablo Escobar (the slain chief of the Medellin drug cartel), and  had served as an informant for state intelligence services. It  adds that this source has now admitted he manipulated the  newspaper, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Colombian  Government.    EL TIEMPO notes that as a result of the incident, the legal  editor has presented his letter of resignation and the  newspaper's Board of Directors is reviewing possible  disciplinary measures.    Meanwhile, the chief editor also presented his resignation,  and EL TIEMPO says that in due time it will disclose its  decision on the matter.    In summarizing its correction, which it describes as  significant and unusual, EL TIEMPO points out that ``the big  question now is who manipulated the former guerrilla, and who is  the person or persons who masterminded this -- the real  intellectual mastermind behind this manipulation of  information?''</p>

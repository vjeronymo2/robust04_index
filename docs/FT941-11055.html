			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / French Socialists win polls France's Socialists, routed in a general election last March, won two by-elections yesterday and made gains in a third, Reuter reports from Paris. Socialist candidates took the Loire valley town of Blois and a Paris working-class constituency in the second and final round of the by-elections, with centre-right candidates trailing. In the Alpine town of Digne, the centrist UDF candidate, Mr Francis Galizi, won 52.92 per cent of the vote against Socialist Mr Francois Massot's 47.08 per cent. The by-elections were ordered by the Constitutional Council, which ruled that the holders of the three seats had spent more than FFr500,000 (Pounds 57,000) in the 1993 election campaign.</p>

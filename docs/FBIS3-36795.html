			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A meeting of the Georgian Parliament was held  today. The first issue on the agenda was the law on firearms.    This draft law was submitted by the Judicial Commission and  was introduced to deputies by Givi Lominadze [the chairman of  the Provisional Committee for Emergencies in western Georgia].    There is also an alternative draft prepared by the Law and  Order Commission.    Members of parliament are unanimous that it is very  important  for the country to adopt a firearms law. However, the process  has been going on for quite a long time.    Before discussing the agenda, parliament started a debate on  MP Vazha Otarashvili's proposal on the handover to parliament of  the construction of the Cabinet of Ministers. Some members of  parliament even called this proposal provocative. It was noted  that issues like this could not be decided so simply. There  were quite a few ethical and technical difficulties. It was  also necessary to take into account the Cabinet of Ministers'  opinion about the issue.    In examining the draft law on firearms, deputies mainly  debated articles of the law relating to arms manufacturing and  trade. Some deputies were in favor of a state monopoly on both,  the manufacturing and trade. There was also the different view  that supported the issue of licences to the private sector to  conduct both these activities.    In the opinion of Givi Lominadze, one of the members of the  judicial commission, the private sector should be allowed to  manufacture arms, while only the state could trade in arms.  [passage omitted]    After a break, parliament continued work. However, voting on  the issue was postponed because of Deputy Speaker Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili's announcement that Abkhazians had attacked  villages in Gali Rayon. Civilians, including women, children  and the elderly had fled to the woods for shelter.    The Georgian Parliament decided to prepare an appeal to be  sent to the United Nations, Russia, and the other countries that  are playing the role of peace guarantors in Abkhazia.</p>

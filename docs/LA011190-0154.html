			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIFFED OVER TAX, FIRM TO DESERT BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> BUSINESS: AN AIRCRAFT-LEASING COMPANY ANNOUNCES IT WILL MOVE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY  TO LOS ANGELES, WHERE ITS BUSINESS TAX WOULD BE MUCH LESS.  </P> <P> After months of unsuccessful negotiations with the city of Beverly Hills over  its business-license tax bill, one of the world's largest aircraft-leasing  companies announced this week that it will leave its home of 15 years and  relocate a few blocks away in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We owe it to our shareholders to move if the tax code makes staying here much  more expensive," said Lou Gonda, executive vice president of International  Lease Finance Corp.  </P> <P> Gonda's company, which got a modest start in Beverly Hills in 1973, generated  more than $200 million in revenues in 1988 by leasing large commercial aircraft  to airlines.  </P> <P> Said Gonda: "We lease all over the world. We just happened to have our office  in the city of Beverly Hills, but it could be in Fiji. They (Beverly Hills)  want to put us in the (tax) classification of a car-leasing company that has a  showroom on Wilshire Boulevard."  </P> <P> The firm's attorney, Barbara Brown, said the vast majority of the firm's planes  don't even fly in the United States, and that state law prohibits cities from  taxing corporations on revenues that come from outside their jurisdiction.  </P> <P> City Council members said they were loath to create a precedent by amending the  tax code, but they acknowledged that the nature of the firm's business was  unique in the city. They instructed Finance Director Donald J. Oblander and  City Atty. Greg Stepanicich to study whether accommodations could be made.  Ultimately, they authorized a compromise.  </P> <P> According to Oblander, Beverly Hills originally estimated the firm's 1990 tax  liability, under the current code, at $400,000, based on gross receipts. When  the City Council later considered a revision of the municipal code, the revised  tax estimate was less than $150,000. But the corporation said it would be  willing to pay no more than $88,000, said Oblander, the amount it calculated it  would owe under Los Angeles tax codes.  </P> <P> When Stepanicich reported to the council Tuesday afternoon that the company had  rejected the compromise proposal, Mayor Max Salter said, "If it's not worth it  to these people to be in this city -- where police response time is three  minutes, where we have well-taken-care-of trees and beautiful sidewalks -- they  should seriously restudy their position."  </P> <P> The other Council members concurred that no further compromise would be sought.  </P> <P> Notified by The Times of the Council's reaction, Gonda said, "Who cares? The  city of Beverly Hills is attractive and so on. All the principals of the  company are longtime residents of Beverly Hills. But when you look out (the  office window), you see the exact same thing that you see from a block and a  half away in Los Angeles. In fact, you see less here, because of the (building)  height restriction. We can't justify staying here to our stockholders, because  of fast fire trucks and pretty trees."  </P> <P> He said the firm had looked into leasing a 23rd-floor office at 6500 Wilshire  Blvd. and a 37th-floor office in Century City, both with superior views. Its  current headquarters is in the Great Western building at Wilshire and La  Cienega boulevards.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An ABC of 103,000 mt was recommended by the Plan Team for Pacific cod. The 1995 ABC is double the 1994 ABC for this stock because a higher natural mortality rate was assumed and because the stock assessment model was changed. The model for assessing this stock was changed to a stock synthesis model, which resulted in a higher estimate of exploitable biomass. The SSC expressed some concern over the large increase in ABC and recommended a range from the 1994 ABC level of 50,400 mt to the Plan Team's recommended 1995 level of 103,000 mt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new biomass estimate for POP resulted in a 1995 ABC that is more than twice the 1994 ABC. Age composition data also indicate an exceptionally strong 1986 year class, especially in the Central and Western Regulatory areas. New biomass estimates for POP indicate that POP is close to the rebuilding level, as established by the POP rebuilding plan, authorized under Amendment 32 to the FMP. The assessment authors determined an ABC of 8,830 mt, which was then adjusted according to established guidelines by the Plan Team, to provide a buffer between the ABC and the overfishing level. The resulting ABC was 6,800 mt. The SSC did not agree with the guidelines for the downward adjustment of the ABC and recommended an ABC of 8,830 mt, equal to the overfishing level. The SSC believes that adjusting the overfishing level upwards to create a buffer between ABC and overfishing might be more appropriate. The Council accepted the SSC recommendation and set the 1995 ABC at 8,830 mt. The TAC amount for POP is set by the POP rebuilding plan and is not affected by the ABC amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new biomass estimates for shallow-water flatfish were greater than the previous estimates and the 1995 ABC (52,270 mt) is greater than the 1994 ABC (34,420 mt). The 1995 ABC for arrowtooth flounder (198,130 mt) is lower than the 1994 ABC (236,240 mt), based on new biomass estimates. New survey information indicated declines in biomass levels for some flatfish groups, resulting in associated declines in ABCs. The 1995 ABCs for deep-water flatfish (14,590 mt) and for flathead sole (28,790 mt) were both lower than the 1994 ABCs (16,510 mt and 35,850 mt, respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new assessment model for thornyhead rockfish resulted in a Plan Team ABC recommendation of 2,320 mt, which is double the 1994 ABC. Because rockfish are vulnerable to over-exploitation and because the model is new, the SSC recommended phasing in the new ABC. A 4-year stair-step approach to implementation of the Plan Team's recommended ABC was recommended so that the new assessment model can be reevaluated after the 1996 trawl survey. For 1995, the ABC was set at 5/8 of the Plan Team's ABC because the 1994 ABC was about one-half the new ABC. This procedure results in a 1995 ABC of 1,450 mt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1995 ABC for Atka mackerel, recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council, is similar to the 1994 ABC. The Plan Team recommended an ABC of 6,480 mt. However, in 1994, when Atka mackerel was separated from the ``other species'' category, the Plan Team's calculated 1994 ABC was reduced to 3/6. This reduction factor would increase by 1/6 per year (stair stepping) and be multiplied by subsequent annual calculated ABCs. The SSC recommended that this procedure be continued to maintain consistency of approach for the management of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area and the GOA Atka mackerel resource. Continuing the stair-step approach for the 1995 fishing year, the calculated ABC should be reduced to 4/6 of the Plan Team's 1995 ABC. Using this approach, the SSC recommended an ABC of 4,300 mt. This approach also takes into account concern about survey variability and concerns for northern fur seals and Steller sea lions, which feed on Atka mackerel. Even though the stair-step approach provides some protection to this stock, the SSC expressed concern that other management measures be considered to reduce the potential impacts on marine mammals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New assessments for other rockfish, northern rockfish, shortraker/rougheye and pelagic shelf rockfish resulted in slightly lower 1995 ABCs for these groups, compared to the 1994 ABCs. Because there were no new assessments for DSR and sablefish at this time, the ABCs for these two groups remain unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plan Team and the SSC recommended removing redbanded rockfish ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sebastes babcocki <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from the DSR group and placing it in the ``other rockfish'' category because this species can constrain the DSR fishery and it is caught as bycatch in the ``other rockfish'' category. This would not affect the ABC recommendation for either group. The Plan Team had recommended removing black rockfish from the pelagic shelf rockfish group but the SSC did not agree, because not enough biological data exist on black rockfish biomass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090_533,690 mt. The range accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock, rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000 mt) recommended by the SSC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AP recommended a 1995 TAC that was lower than the 1995 ABC recommended by the SSC, and that was equal to the 1994 TAC, for deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, shallow-water flatfish, and Atka mackerel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the POP biomass was higher than in 1994, the 1995 TAC for POP is higher than in 1994. As mentioned above, the TAC for POP is specified in the rebuilding plan and the apportionments are based on the biomass distribution in each of the GOA regulatory areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AP increased the 1995 apportionment from the 1994 TAC for arrowtooth flounder in the Central Regulatory area by 5,000 mt, to 25,000 mt. The TAC amount for arrowtooth flounder in the other regulatory areas is the same as the 1994 TAC amount, resulting in a total of TAC of 35,000 mt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony. The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of slope rockfish, the TACs as recommended by the AP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However, NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment. Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented, no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line fisheries typically do not harvest slope rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by which time the final specifications will be published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the 1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740 mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total GOA TAC of 326,242 mt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Management 'to blame' in half of company failures Management is to blame for half of businesses failures, according to a survey published today. And three-quarters of businesses are beyond rescue by the time they enter insolvency. Mr Ian Bradbery, president of the Society of Practitioners in Insolvency, said its annual survey showed better management training was vital to avoid corporate failure. Mr Bradbery said: 'Management failure is rising as both a principal and a contributory cause of company insolvency. Management helps push its own enterprise over the edge in more than half of all cases.' The survey showed that in one case in ten management was principally to blame for the failure through fraud, bad planning, imprudent accounting, or lack of information. Mr Bradbery added: 'There must have been a time in the history of most of these companies when failure was avoidable. Management often seems incapable of seeking advice until it is too late.' Dr Anne Robinson, head of policy at the Institute of Directors, said she was not surprised by the figures. 'We have to have better trained managers. It is absolutely essential,' she said. It was vital for businesses that incorporated to have a sound business plan as many companies that failed were 'doomed from the start'. Dr Robinson said the IoD opposed the Budget proposal to introduce a 28-day moratorium for companies in trouble. 'If poor management is the problem this will make no difference,' she said. The survey, based on nearly 3,000 cases in the year to June, showed that loss of market caused failure in 37 per cent of cases - down 9 per cent. Unavailability of finance was a worsening problem, up 3 per cent to 22 per cent. Mr Bradbery said managers should realise that calling in a licenced insolvency expert could save jobs. The survey showed that one in three people working for a failed company kept their jobs - compared to one in four in the survey for 1992-93. Small company insolvency was also growing, with companies of less than Pounds 1m turnover representing 45 per cent of the liabilities of insolvent companies - 9 per cent higher than in the previous year. More than 1,500 companies went into liquidation in November this year, a 14 per cent fall from the same month last year, according to Austintel, the insolvency data group. The number of personal bankruptcies fell 30 per cent to 1,800.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Xingbo: "Milestone For Foreign Firms Hit by SEZ"] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen--The number of foreign-funded enterprises  in South China's Shenzhen Economic Zone topped 10,000 by the end  of May this year.    Latest statistics from the city's Industrial and Commercial  Administration showed that the figure reached 10,015 by the end  of the month. Of the total, Sino-foreign joint ventures  numbered 5,761, co-operative firms 1,412 and solely  foreign-funded enterprises 2,842.    Total investment in these enterprises amounted to $26.9  billion; foreign investment reached more than $11.2 billion.  The numbers come from Gong Peilian, director of the  administration.    Gong said that from January to May this year,  newly-registered foreign-funded enterprises numbered 710. Of  these, 49 enterprises had investment exceeding $5 million.    The rapid development of foreign-funded enterprises in the  special economic zone has accelerated the city's economic  development.    In 1993, the total value of the city's industrial was more  than 48 billion yuan ($5.7 billion) or 575 times that in 1979.  Sixty per cent of industrial products from the zone are  exported.    In the past 12 years, the scope of foreign investment has  expanded. Besides investing in such fields as industry, real  estate and public utilities, overseas businessmen are also  pouring funds into commerce, service trades, food and  warehousing.    This year's newly-registered enterprises are putting their  money in real estate, highway construction and cultural  facilities.    Local government officials attributed the rapid overseas  investment to the city's good investment environment.    In the past 14 years, local government has attached great  importance to Shenzhen's infrastructure construction.    The city is the only one in the country with marine, land  and  air trading ports. It has seven marine ports, four land ports  and one airport.    In 1993, these ports saw 13,300 people, 18,900 vehicles and  60 ships arriving and departing every day.    Transportation within the city is also very convenient.    Shenzhen Railway Station connects Hong Kong with the  mainland; it has 180 train arrivals each day.    With nearly 100 trunk lines and some flyover crossings, the  city has highways with a total length exceeding 1,000 kilometres.    There are eight harbours, 12 goods docks and 84 berths, with  an annual handling capacity of 58.7 million tons.    The city also has good water and electricity supplies and  convenient telecommunications facilities.    The local government has done a lot to safeguard the legal  interests of foreign investors and to create a fair competitive  environment.    For the convenience of overseas investors, the Industry and  Commerce Administration has simplified the procedures for  registering foreign-funded enterprises.</p>

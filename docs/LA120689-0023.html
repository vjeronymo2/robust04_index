			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> New Comedy Lineup: MTV Networks, which owns cable TV's Nickelodeon and a new  all-comedy channel scheduled to start April 1, said Tuesday it has bought  rights to 15 former network shows, including the acclaimed "Mary Tyler Moore  Show," "The Lucy Show" and "Love, American Style." Thirteen of the shows are  situation comedies going to MTV's "Ha! The TV Comedy Network" channel. Eight of  the comedies and one comedy miniseries, the six-part "Fresno," were made by  Moore's production company, MTM, which also made the CBS' drama series, "The  White Shadow." That series will air on Nickelodeon. But Moore's old series and  repeats of MTM's "The Bob Newhart Show" won't air on 'Ha!" until 1992 because  those shows still are in syndication to television stations, an MTV spokesman  said.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau May 30 TASS -- The leader of the Federation  of Independent Unions of Moldavia, Serafim Yrekyan, warned Prime  Minister Andrei Sangheli about the possibility of mass protest  actions as a result of the republic's extremely difficult  economic situation.    The union leader said the mass protests might occur despite  the six-month moratorium on strikes which was announced by the  labour unions in order to give the new government the chance to  undertake measures to overcome the crisis. The problem is that  several unions which are hostile to the Cabinet of Ministers did  not agree with the general decision on the moratorium.    The conditions are more than ripe for exciting mass unrest  in  Moldavia. According to the labour unions, the physical  subsistence minimum (in May prices) is 133 lei (30 U.S. dollars)  per month. The minimum consumer's basket, which includes  several industrial goods in addition to the necessary food  products, is now around 260 lei. If one compares this with the  average monthly wage in Moldovia of about 82 lei, one can  understand the reasons for dissatisfaction. Pensioners have it  even worse, since the average fixed pension is only 18.8 lei per  month.    But even these crumbs are not received by the population  regularly. Following the advice of the International Monetary  Fund, the Moldavian Government is implementing a fairly strict  financial and credit policy and sharply limiting the currency  supply. In light of the continuing decline in production, this  policy has led to systematic delays in the distribution of  salaries and pensions.    According to the statistics department, the government  already owes its people about 80 million lei (20 million  dollars). Of that sum, more than 60 million lei have not been  given to agricultural workers, who form the backbone of the  Moldavian economy. Experts say that these debts account for  more than half of the salaries earned by Moldavia's four-million  strong population in the first quarter of this year.    Due to fears of a social eruption, the government has had to  put off a price increase on communal services (heating,  electricity) three times. Local authorities would like to raise  these prices in response to the fact that energy prices are  constantly on the rise. The Cabinet of Ministers is now holding  negotiations with the labour union leaders and entrepreneurs in  the hopes of letting the steam out of the situation.</p>

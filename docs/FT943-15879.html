			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Heritage secretary receives praise Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, yesterday received a wide measure of praise for the long-awaited white paper as well a few jeers from unrepentant privatisers who greeted the announcement with cries of 'shame', 'rubbish' and 'cop-out'. Mr Tim Renton, a former broadcasting minister, congratulated Mr Brooke for resisting the temptation to go for too much change. At a time when there was a vast increase in the number of television and radio channels in the UK people 'actually welcome the BBC as a sort of friendly 'rock of ages',' he said. Mr David Mellor, former heritage secretary, emphasised that the present outcome had been possible only because of radical changes introduced at the corporation. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, welcomed the government's endorsement of the licence fee but said she was concerned because there was no commitment to index it to retail prices. Mr Robert Maclennan, for the Liberal Democrats, welcomed the renewal of the royal charter and licence fee but called for an independent regulator for all television. Mr Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the Commons heritage committee, said the BBC should consider creating links with telecommunications organisations. He told Mr Brooke: 'What the BBC has to do is either dwindle into a low-audience public service broadcast service or become what you have rightly said it should become, an international multimedia enterprise.'</p>

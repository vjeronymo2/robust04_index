			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Clearer statements urged PROPOSED regulations on the contents of summary financial statements are too prescriptive, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has warned. In a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, the institute's company law committee argues that summary statements should be able to improve communication by using simpler language than required in full accounts. It also says there should be separate disclosure of securities and investments such as loans and advances to banks and to customers in the proposed summary balance sheet. The submission follows a consultative document issued by the DTI last month on summary financial statements which proposed extending the guidelines to debenture and loan stock holders and partial owners of shares. The statements - permitted since April 1990 - must cover basic profit-and-loss accounts, directors' remuneration and an outline balance sheet with contingent liabilities. In a letter to Companies House, the government's corporate information depository based in Wales, the company law committee calls for clearer guidance on filing accounts for EC member-state companies with UK branches and also non-EC companies which have a 'place of business' in the UK.</p>

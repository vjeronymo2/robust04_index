			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Scale back urged if Scottish electricity sale oversubscribed THE GOVERNMENT is being urged not to offer shares in the two Scottish electricity companies to overseas institutions so as not to disappoint individual Scottish investors if the issue is heavily oversubscribed. Torrie &amp; Co, the Edinburgh stockbroker which handles large numbers of individual applications for privatisation shares, said it believed the issue will be so popular that it risks embarrassing the Scottish Conservative party and is calling on its customers to lobby MPs to block a foreign sale. 'It will be politically disastrous to sweet-talk the canny Scottish investor into applying for sensible numbers of shares only to be offered nominal allocations,' the broker said, especially if it is then perceived that Japanese, American and European institutions have made 'guaranteed profits.' About 20 per cent of recent privatisation issues, including the regional electricity companies and the generators, have been sold to foreign institutions. The government has appointed advisers to prepare the way for offering shares in Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric to institutions in Europe, Japan, the US and Canada, but no decision has been taken on whether to sell the shares overseas. Torrie said interest among Scottish electricity customers was running high. The issue is expected to raise between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn.</p>

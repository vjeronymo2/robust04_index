			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- The following is the  official translation of the prepared text of South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam's address to a joint session of the  Japanese parliament Friday.    (Toward a new era of friendship and cooperation)    The honorable Takako Doi, speaker of the House of  Representatives, the honorable Bunbei Hara, president of the  House of Councilors, distinguished members of both houses of the  Diet,    Today, I have the honor of standing on the podium of the  Diet, a major symbol of Japanese democracy. I am especially  moved by this because I have been a firm believer in  parliamentary democracy all my life.    First, I would like to take this opportunity to convey warm  and friendly greetings from the Korean people to the people of  Japan. I am grateful to you for having arranged this  significant occasion for me. And I salute you for pressing  ahead with political reforms in your country.    Distinguished members of the Diet,    It was 100 years ago, in 1894, that Japan and China fought  against each other on the Korean peninsula. Having won this  Sino-Japanese war, Japan eventually crushed Korea under its  feet. Though Korea was liberated in 1945, it was quickly  divided into the South and the North and subsequently suffered a  horrible fratricidal war. Korea still bears the national pain of  being the only and last divided land on earth. As such,  Korea-Japan relations for the past 100 years have tended to be  marked more by strife and friction than by goodwill and  cooperation.    On behalf of the people of the Republic of Korea, I hereby  propose to you and the Japanese people that we close this  century of strife and friction and open a new era of genuine  bilateral friendship and cooperation.    In recent times, the Japanese people have achieved  glistening  national development. I believe the spirit of hard work and the  unity of the Japanese people have combined with outstanding  government and business leadership to make Japan as it is today.    Japanese citizens from all walks of life greatly encouraged  and supported me during the difficult times of my struggles for  democracy. The steady advancement of Japanese democracy  inspired me with the confidence that democracy could thrive in  the Republic of Korea also, and I was able to refute the  allegations that Asian soil was not fit for democracy to take  root. I came also to be convinced that rapid growth could be  achieved under democracy. It is my belief that increasingly  close ties have been developing between the Republic of Korea  and Japan on the strength of our shared ideals not only of  market economics but of democracy as well.    Over the past year, the Republic of Korea has pursued  drastic  change and reform in all aspects of national life. In  particular, our determination to carry out political reforms and  root out misconduct and corruption has never wavered. The  enforcement of the law requiring public officials to register  and disclose their assets has eliminated room for corruption  among government officials and politicians. The real-name  financial transaction system has severed collusive links between  politics and business. Political reform bills have become law,  fundamentally transforming electoral practices and political  behavior.    Korean democracy has thus come of age. Political reforms  in both Korea and Japan are sparking reforms throughout Asia.  Prime Minister Hosokawa and I have congratulated each other on  the successful pursuit of reforms in each other's country. This  is fostering a fine tradition of amity between the leaders of  Korea and Japan. I would like to take this occasion to pay  tribute to you once more for having embarked on an avenue to  reforms in response to a call of the times.    Distinguished members of the Diet, citizens of Japan,    The world is now changing ever more rapidly. It is moving  away from an age of distrust and confrontation and into an era  of reconciliation and cooperation. Our planet is shrinking into  one global village. National borders are being lowered, and  global and regional cooperation is gaining force.    The prediction of Toynbee that 21st century would be a  Pacific century is coming true. Koreans and Japanese should now  share new dreams -- dreams of a new Korea-Japan relationship, of  a new Asia-Pacific region, of a new world. We should share a  lofty and grand vision encompassing the spacious Pacific that  can strike a responsive chord in the minds of two billion  Asians. We must work together with a new attitude in order to  realize such dreams.    Saneatsu Mushanokoji, a noted Japanese novelist, painted a  tomato and an eggplant on a large white dish and wrote on it: "I  am I, you are you, but we should get along." But we should move  beyond the implications of this beautiful work of art. Now is  the time to build a larger regional community with a spirit of  coexistence and shared prosperity, even while maintaining our  own identities and diversity. In this way, we should be able to  March into an Asia-Pacific age of peace and prosperity.    Distinguished members of the Diet,    Now, the peoples of Korea and Japan must open their hearts  and minds to each other. We must put the past completely behind  us. The Korean people are willing to look ahead and build a  brighter future. To help forge a new Korea-Japan relationship  crucial to ushering in a new Asia-Pacific age, the Japanese  people should also muster the courage to squarely face the  truths of history and live up to their lessons. We must not  allow emotional residue or ethnic prejudices to remain unabated  and obstruct the development of a mature bilateral partnership.    In this context, I believe it is very important to promote  goodwill and amity between the Korean residents in Japan and  Japanese citizens. We have a saying in Korea which goes, "your  neighbors are your cousins." Korea and Japan have long been  "cousins." Should such close neighbors fail to build genuine  mutual trust, it would be difficult for them to win the trust of  others.    Our two countries must now forge new ties of cooperation  with  new attitudes and new visions. The imperatives of the post-Cold  War international situation urgently call for such a cooperative  relationship. In particular, complementary bilateral economic  cooperation is a mandate of the new times. We must endeavor to  build ties of economic cooperation according to economic, rather  than political, logic.    Distinguished members of the Diet,    Our two nations should work closely together to remove  impediments to the peace and prosperity of this region with a  new spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. In this regard, I  take this occasion to thank your country for cooperating with us  in the efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The  Republic of Korea firmly adheres to the position that the terms  of the South-North Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of  the Korean Peninsula must be implemented without fail. We have  thus been patiently endeavoring to peacefully resolve the North  Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Recently, however, North  Korea has dishonored its international commitments: It has not  only failed to properly deal with IAEA inspections but has also  unilaterally broken off South-North dialogue. It is most  regrettable that in that way the North has exacerbated  suspicions about its nuclear intentions.    Both the Korean and Japanese peoples have acutely  experienced  the horrors of war. Japan is the first and only country ever to  suffer a nuclear attack. Korea is the first country to undergo  a fratricidal ideological war. Spurred on by this shared bitter  experience, we must strive together to take the lead in building  lasting peace throughout this region. We must cooperate even  more closely to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction and bring under control arms races in the  Asia-Pacific region. The time has come to initiate multilateral  cooperation to ease tension and promote the common security of  this region.    Korea and Japan should also more closely pull together to  induce openness and reform in North Korea and to promote the  cause of peaceful unification of South and North Korea. Korean  unification would greatly contribute not only to easing regional  tension but also to boosting regional exchange and cooperation.  This would serve to develop northeast Asia into the hub of  prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.    My view is that such developments would certainly be in  the national interest of Japan as well. I am certain that a  unified Korea would be a trustworthy partner for Japan. I hope  the people and Government of Japan will even more actively  support Korean unification.    Last but not least, I want to emphasize that our two  countries must work closely together to promote coexistence  among and the shared prosperity of all countries in the  Asia-Pacific region. My view is that the future of the  Asia-Pacific will be largely swayed by the triangular  cooperative ties among Korea, the United States and Japan as  well as cooperation among all Asian nations. The triad of  Korea, the U.S. and Japan is the key to the coexistence among  and shared prosperity of Asian nations and is central to the  development of a Pacific community.    By furthering these ties of cooperation, our two countries  should be able to advance the peace and prosperity of Asia as a  whole. Moreover, such efforts would lead to an early  materialization of an Asia-Pacific community. The Republic of  Korea is willing to join forces with Japan and China in playing  responsible roles to that end.    The world is keenly watching Japan's efforts to sharply  change its course: Changes in Japan are bound to have a major  impact not only on Asia but also on the world at large.    As long as each and every member of the international  community remains obsessed solely with its own prosperity, we  will hardly be able to develop the whole world on a genuinely  communal basis. Without a balanced development of this region,  we can hardly expect genuine regional peace. To this end, we  must also redress any excessive and persistent imbalance in  economic relations between nations.    Korea, Japan and China must join forces to play a joint  central role to create a new Asia that will be able to  contribute ever more greatly to the betterment of mankind. In  the past century, the Pacific was often battered by political  typhoons and quakes. Anticipating a Pacific age in the early  21st century, Korea and Japan should take joint responsibility  for leading the effort to turn the Pacific into an ocean of  peace and prosperity.    To that end, it is imperative first to make the strait that  divides our two countries into a sea of friendship and  cooperation. I believe that before long, Koreans and Japanese  will be able to travel to each others' countries as if they were  traveling around their own lands. I believe that Tokyo, Seoul  and Beijing will become truly next-door neighbors in the near  future. Let us dash together toward that goal.    I hope from the bottom of my heart that my speech today will  be a new landmark in our progress toward a genuine Korea-Japan  partnership.    Thank you.</p>

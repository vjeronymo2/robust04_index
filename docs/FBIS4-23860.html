			<p>BFN     [Text] Zambia and Namibia have signed a road transport  agreement and are working out plans to build a bridge across the  Zambezi River to easy transborder crossing. Speaking during a  signing ceremony to mark the end of the first session of the  Zambia-Namibia Joint Permanent Commission of Communication,  Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications Gilbert Mululu  said the commission noted the importance of Zambia utilizing the  Walvis Bay in the transportation of cargo. In energy, the  minister said Zambia expressed willingness to consider Namibia's  interest to import more electricity above the current supply and  the introduction of border passes to facilitate border crossings  for people living around the border boundaries.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust turns in surge for quarter Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank, reported a further surge in profits from trading in financial markets in the final three months of last year, at a time when easing volatility in European markets cut into trading profits at other big US banks. Like JP Morgan, which reported its 1993 earnings last week, the bank boosted its trading profits in the emerging country debt markets, and bolstering dwindling income from the European currency and interest rate markets. The value of debt securities issued by a number of Latin American and emerging Asian countries rose strongly last year on stronger economic fundamentals and demand from US investors for high-yielding investments. Income from trading rose to Dollars 449m in the last quarter of 1993, up from Dollars 101m a year before and ahead of the record Dollars 431m of the previous quarter. In all, trading income contributed 36 per cent of the revenues in the latest quarter. Further unspecified trading profits, made in interest rate markets and accounted for as net interest income, further lifted this portion. The results boosted the bank's net income in the final three months to Dollars 279m, or Dollars 3.25 a share, up from Dollars 133m, restated as Dollars 1.49 a share, the year before and well ahead of analysts' estimates. Earnings per share calculations for the latest and previous periods were adjusted to take account of equity-related items like stock options the bank has issued, diluting the final eps figure. After-tax profits for the year as a whole reached Dollars 1.07bn, or Dollars 12.40 a share, up from Dollars 639m, or Dollars 7.22 a share, in 1992, before various accounting changes in both periods. Both Bankers Trust and JP Morgan have shaken off the revenue slowdown faced by other US banks by moving heavily into trading activities and growing their fee and commission-related business.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Traumatic week for modest Dutch: Troubles at Daf, Fokker and KLM have hit home hard THE perpetually-modest Dutch are disinclined to seek the limelight. But, during a traumatic week for the economy, they have been thrust into international prominence. Three of the Netherlands' corporate heavyweights - Daf, the truck maker, Fokker, the aircraft company, and KLM, the national airline - have been battered by adversity. This well-managed, free-trading economy, running a large trade surplus and tipped as a likely winner from the EC's single market, is now worrying about the future. 'All in all, it was an awful week,' says Mr Be van der Weg, leader of the FNV industrial union. 'It highlighted our international vulnerability, and created an awareness that there is more restructuring to come.' On Tuesday, Daf, the last remnant of Dutch ambition in the European motor industry, announced financial collapse and sought protection from creditors in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK. The following day, it was Fokker's turn. The troubled aeroplane manufacturer confirmed reports that it is seeking a state bank loan of up to Fl 1bn (Pounds 373m) as its liquidity position worsened. On Thursday, KLM turned in a massive loss, was forced to cancel Fl 750m in new aircraft orders and announced another round of rationalisation. Despite the strength of multinational giants such as Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever and the chemicals specialist Akzo, the country's industrial course is now a matter of concern. On Monday, Philips, the country's leading electronics company, shelved plans to introduce a European-standard high-definition television (HDTV) on which it had pinned recovery hopes. Over the past three years, Philips has cut its workforce by about 50,000. Amid flat demand for its electronic products, this has had little effect on overall performance. Dutch business culture, sometimes unwilling to anticipate change, had little influence on the basic factors behind this week's events. Daf, Fokker, and KLM are all suffering from changes in global industrial demand. Nor is the country's industrial policy entirely at fault. The Dutch government has mixed pragmatism with expediency in recent years - privatising where possible, intervening with limited aid where practicable and productive. But, in a gloomy economic environment, the Netherlands is seeking ways of combining relatively high labour costs and commitment to free markets with measures to gain international comparative advantage. While its expertise in agri-business, transport and the entrepot business has stood it in good stead, these are hardly the vigorous industries of the future. The country needs to finance education and infrastructure, as well as to stimulate high technology, amid budgetary constraints caused by slower growth. One important influence has been the recession in Germany, by far the Netherlands' most important trading partner. The Netherlands' latitude in monetary affairs, as a senior Dutch central bank official acknowledges, is 'severely restricted'. This year industrial investment is expected to fall 4 per cent, according to the CBS statistics bureau. This contrasts sharply with industry's own forecast of 5 per cent growth, released as late as last summer. The EC's latest economic forecasts see Dutch GDP expanding by only 0.6 per cent in 1993. This is still ahead of Germany, but well below accustomed rates of around 2 per cent in recent years. At present, one in seven of Dutch workers are employed by a loss-making company. In 1993, the percentage will grow to one in four, predicts the VNO industry federation. 'These are alarming figures,' says Mr Evert Elbertse, a VNO economist. 'Our ideal European landscape has always been one of laissez faire. But when we look around, this is not what we see.' Pressures for more interventionist government policies are on the rise. On the high street, too, the atmosphere has changed. Fluorescent 'Special Clearance' signs shine from shop windows, as the traditional January sales drift into the second week of February. While several industrial sectors, including base chemicals and metals, face further difficulties, some of the gloom is exaggerated. There is a chance, for example, that parts of Daf will emerge from the salvage operation in a sufficiently attractive form to woo a foreign buyer. But it seems likely the Dutch will not have to wait much longer for more examples of a transition into a less secure industrial future.</p>

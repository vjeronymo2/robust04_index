			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: The pricing of CDs in the US and the UK Sir, I am sorry to see that in the case of the music business you do not exercise the same rigour as you do in your analyses of other sectors. CD prices are not 40 per cent higher in Europe than in the US. Even if there was any relevance in making comparisons based on exchange rates, the figure would be around 10-15 per cent. Contrary to your assertion, there are very good reasons for this. Cultural products are not like soap powder and selling music into 15 different countries with 15 different languages requires a fresh approach to packaging and marketing, and higher costs in each territory. In the US, any record, American or not, is marketed over an area five times the size of the UK with one coherent campaign. The potential for costs savings is clear. The British record industry has always budgeted on the basis of UK sales alone and then entered into licensing agreements with foreign record companies for export. Even if we wanted to export directly to the US we could not - their very high import taxes mean it is not feasible, a situation your advocacy of the abolition of import controls in the other direction, into Britain, fails to take into account. John Deacon, The British Phonographic Industry, 25 Savile Row, London W1X 1AA</p>

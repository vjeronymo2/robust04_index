			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEISMAN PROMISES $3 MILLION TO U. OF MINNESOTA ART MUSEUM  </P> <P> Los Angeles art collector Frederick R. Weisman has pledged $3 million to the  University of Minnesota in the hopes that his alma mater's art museum will  finally get a home of its own to be designed by Santa Monica-based architect  Frank Gehry.  </P> <P> "I went to the University of Minnesota and I was born in Minneapolis, so  there's a lot of strong ties there," Weisman said. "Minnesota means a great  deal to me, and the city of Minneapolis is important to me."  </P> <P> Although he said that he was "very excited" about plans for the new museum,  Weisman stressed that the donation through his Frederick R. Weisman Foundation  of Los Angeles must still be approved by the university's board of regents,  which he is scheduled to meet on Friday.  </P> <P> If approved by the board of regents, the $8-million structure will occupy a  conspicuous site at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. Gehry's firm  was selected in November after a two-year search. Gehry was in New York on  business and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "My feet haven't touched the ground since I heard about (Weisman's gift)," said  Lyndel King, director of the university art museum. "This means that we will be  able to build a new museum here at the University of Minnesota, and that has  been a dream of mine for a long time."  </P> <P> Weisman's $3-million gift would qualify for a matching grant from the  University of Minnesota Foundation. The foundation has already matched $1  million previously raised. With the Weisman grant and match, the museum would  have the $8 million estimated cost for the building.  </P> <P> "I don't want to presume that this is something that's really going to happen  until they approve it," said Weisman, whose foundation holds workshops on art  and architecture-related topics, presents traveling exhibitions and loans works  to American embassies overseas. "But they're talking about starting work on the  building later this year, and they're talking about it taking about three years  to finish the museum completely."  </P> <P> Weisman hinted that his relationship with the University of Minnesota and  museum officials, might continue.  </P> <P> "If we're going to assist them with building this museum, then we're going to  be awfully sure that they have art to show in there," said Weisman, whose  foundation has sizable holdings in post-World War II art. The name of the  building would be determined by the Weisman Foundation, he said.  </P> <P> Founded in 1934, the museum has spent its entire existence in the university's  Northrop Auditorium, where it is hampered by inadequate office and exhibition  space, insufficient security and lack of climate control for displayed artwork.  Its collection, which over the years has grown to some 12,000 objects, is  stored in four scattered locations, according to reports.  </P></p>

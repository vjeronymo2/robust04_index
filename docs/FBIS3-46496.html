Finally, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh delivered  a  speech concluding the Fourth Session of the Ninth National  Assembly. He evaluated the results of the session and pointed  out the achievements made by our party, people, and soldiers in  the socioeconomic field this year. At the same time, he also  pointed out limitations, shortcomings, and difficulties that the  entire country must strive to overcome in the coming period.    National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh said:    [Begin recording] Stemming from the aforementioned  situation,  and in view of the new situation, the National Assembly  discussed and passed the resolution on tasks for 1994, the  resolution on the 1994 state budget estimates, the resolution  approving the final balance of the 1992 state budget, and the  resolution on the movement for thrift and against waste,  corruption, and smuggling. These are important documents. The  National Assembly outlined major and practical measures to  mobilize forces and concentrate the energy and resources of the  entire country on socioeconomic construction and development and  on restoring national order and discipline. It also clarified  the responsibility of the National Assembly Standing Committee,  government, departments, echelons, National Assembly deputies,  and citizens with regard to implementing these resolutions.    We have to affirm that the fight against corruption and  smuggling is a continuous fight for all of society. We must be  resolute in obliterating this harmful practice gradually, thus  creating a healthy environment for socioeconomic development and  for the construction of a law-abiding Vietnamese Government of  the people, by the people, and for the people. The first task  is gradually to build and perfect a uniform legal system that  will concretize the party's renovation line in all fields of  social life.    During this session, the National Assembly passed the Law on  Environmental Protection, a law amending and supplementing some  articles of the Law on Organization of People's Courts, and the  Law on Business Bankruptcy. These are important and necessary  laws to create a legal foundation for socioeconomic development  and provide a guarantee for business activities, accelerate  national renovation, and protect our living environment.    The National Assembly also evaluated the past legislative  situation and the resolution on legislative work for 1994. It  offered opinions and directions for the legislative program  spanning from 1995 until the end of the official term of the  Ninth National Assembly. It also outlined the draft labor code  and the draft law on the state budget. The National Assembly  tasked responsible organs with conducting further studies before  presenting these bills at the next session.    The National Assembly highly evaluated our government's 1993  foreign affairs activities, which actively contributed to the  common struggle of people around the world for peace, national  independence, democracy, and social progress. This was done in  the spirit of Vietnam seeking friendship with all nations in the  world community that are striving for peace, independence, and  development. In order to develop these achievements in the  future, we will accelerate the implementation of our foreign  policy, which stresses independence, sovereignty,  diversification of multilateral relations, and consolidation of  the friendship and multi-faceted relations will all nations --  especially our neighbors, countries in Southeast Asia and the  Asia-Pacific region, and international organizations. This will  create more favorable conditions for our national construction  and protection.    Having been a victim for centuries of human rights  violations  committed by invading forces, our government and people are very  earnest about independence and freedom. We are resolute in  fully observing the fundamental rights of human beings, which  are regulated by the 1992 Constitution.    Dear National Assembly deputies, with a sense of national  pride and in order to develop our tradition of diligence and  creativeness, our entire Army and people are determined to  overcome all difficulties and challenges and carry out the  directions and tasks for 1994 as outlined in the National  Assembly resolutions. These are: To solidify achievements made  in our renovation; move ahead with industrialization and  modernization; grasp opportunities for rapid acceleration of the  economic development rate, so as to bring our country into a new  period of development; create an important change in the fields  of culture and society; maintain political stability; broaden  our foreign relations; and protect our national independence,  sovereignty, and integrity.    In that spirit, the National Assembly calls on people and  soldiers across the country as well as our overseas compatriots  to unite in heart and in strength, quickly grasp opportunities,  eliminate all dangers, practice thrift in production and  consumption, increase development investment for material  production, and mobilize their resources and abilities to make  our country even more beautiful than our beloved President Ho  Chi Minh hoped.    Dear National Assembly deputies, the success of the Ninth  National Assembly's Fourth Session is the result of the active  contributions of the government, National Assembly deputies,  National Assembly organs, related government organs, and voters  in the country. The National Assembly sincerely thanks  high-level leading comrades, revolutionary senior citizens, and  former National Assembly deputies for their keen interest and  their opinion during this session. It welcomes the efforts  exerted by mass media agencies in their timely reflection of the  National Assembly's vivid activities, which met the interests of  people inside and outside the country. It thanks the  wholehearted and enthusiastic contributions of all organs that  provided services during this session.    As we enter 1994, I warmly wish the National Assembly  deputies, distinguished guests, people, and soldiers across the  country -- as well as our overseas compatriots -- a new year of  good health and happiness so as to record more achievements. I  declare the Fourth Session of the Ninth National Assembly  closed. Thank you.

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: UK bonds rally as rate cut hopes are rekindled LONG-dated UK government bonds rose sharply yesterday as investors moved from shorter-dated paper, reversing some of the recent steepening of the sterling yield curve. A general feeling that gains in short-dated gilts had been overdone, and that fears of a resurgence of inflation had been overstated, helped to encourage the move, observers said. The market was also buoyed by growing confidence in an interest rate cut, probably of half a percentage point, in the near future, and the stability of sterling. The currency ended above DM2.52, up from around DM2.51 the day before. Figures released yesterday showed producer price inflation unchanged in September, at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent. With further evidence of the weakness of the UK economy expected in the next two days, and an unexpected move by Abbey National yesterday to cut its mortgage rate again, the belief gained ground that a base rate cut was imminent. Index-linked gilts did not participate in the best of yesterday's gains, despite a general perception that the rally in inflation-linked instruments still has some way to run. These bonds should perform well if interest rates fall or if inflation fears resurface, said Mr Nigel Richardson, sterling bond economist at S G Warburg. Yesterday, with longer-dated gilts gaining more than a point, index-linked paper rose by only around a quarter of a point. Long gilt futures on Liffe also jumped a point, ending the day at 97 1/4 , compared with Monday's close of 96 9/32 . OTHER European markets generally strengthened yesterday on the back of a half point rise in the German market. Demand for D-Mark paper - as evidenced by the flood of new issues in the Eurobond market - continues to be strong, while the market was also said to have been led higher by a sharp technical rise in bund futures. The French market moved up in line with Germany in late trading, with OATs showing a rise of a third of a point. US Treasury prices were mixed to slightly lower late yesterday despite early gains on renewed, if still faint, hopes of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  3/16 at 96 19/32, yielding 7.532 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32, to yield 3.966 per cent. After the market reopened following Monday's holiday prices got off to a firm start, a delayed reaction to comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, on Sunday which suggested that the monetary authorities may not, after all, have ruled out another rate cut before election day on November 3. Although most of the market still doubts there will be another policy ease, there was enough short covering to boost prices across the board in early trading. By the afternoon, however, a rise in the weekly Johnson Redbook report on store sales sparked retail selling and pushed long-dated prices into negative territory. JAPANESE government bonds rose yesterday, breaking out of their recent narrow trading range as traders sensed the possibility of easing of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan. In Tokyo, overnight rates fell below 4 per cent at one stage, dipping out of their current range, and although nothing on the Bank of Japan's part encouraged the fall, the dip in market rates encouraged hopes of a cut. This was enough to lift the JGB futures contract, which rose from 106.20 to 106.42 before falling back to 106.33. Japan's banking industry is studying a new method to promote the sales of corporate loan holdings in a bid to meet international capital adequacy standards, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, said: 'We are studying various measures, and the measure (which will make use of commercial paper) is one of them.' Under the plan, a bank will set up a paper company in a tax-haven country and also establish a Tokyo branch. The Tokyo branch will buy corporate loans from the bank and the company in the tax-haven country will then issue CP overseas, backed by the corporate loans as collateral.</p>

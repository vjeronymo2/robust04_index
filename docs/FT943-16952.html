			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Close finish likely in battle for Lasmo Enterprise Oil's increasingly bitter takeover battle for fellow explorer Lasmo ends today, with both sides saying that the result is too close to call. 'There will be a few sweaty palms' among Lasmo and Enterprise executives and advisers as the counting of votes gets under way in London, according to one of Lasmo's larger institutional investors yesterday. Many institutions are unlikely to tip their hands until close to the 1pm deadline for votes to be received by the registrar. Phillips and Drew Fund Management, the biggest single shareholder, yesterday decided against making a public announcement of which side they would support. PDFM, which sold 77m Lasmo shares in Enterprise's controversial share raid on Wednesday, is thought to be uncomfortable with the notion that undecided investors might simply follow its lead. The two sides spent much of yesterday dealing with the fall-out from the share raid, in which Enterprise picked up 9.8 per cent of Lasmo's shares. The head of investments for the US's largest pension fund reacted angrily yesterday to the fact that US investors were excluded from Enterprise's cash offer. Mr Virgil Cummings, chief investment officer of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund (Tiaa-Cref), said: 'It's very, very frustrating. But this is nothing new. This is something we continually experience in the UK.' Mr Cummings said restrictive legal interpretations obtained by UK companies frequently resulted in US investors being excluded from some transactions, such as tender offers and dividend reinvestment schemes. Similar problems did not arise in other European capital markets, he added. The Enterprise camp though, maintained that regulators in the US had prevented Lasmo shareholders there from participating, rather than the company's own legal interpretation. Such partial cash offers during takeover bids are not permitted under US takeover law, forcing Enterprise to obtain a special exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its action. That exemption did not extend to Lasmo shareholders in the US, the Enterprise supporters said. Enterprise sounded out some of Lasmo's US shareholders before paying cash for 10 per cent of the company's shares on Wednesday. However, it later told them that they could not accept the offer for legal reasons.</p>

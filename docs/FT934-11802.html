			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Observer: Good eggs and sugar The mushroom-pickers may not have their jobs back. But the taunts of the gaggle of women, dressed as plantation slaves, who gathered outside this week's Booker prize ceremony to protest at their dismissal after an industrial dispute, seem to have wounded the food company to the quick. Booker is actually rather proud of its liberal tradition. Chairman Jonathan Taylor 'leans towards the soft centre' himself, while one of his predecessors was the progressive Labour peer, Lord Campbell. The company even used to give money to the Alliance. But, 'surrounded in fiction and myth', Taylor sees references to the company's origins in slavery and the slave trade wherever he turns. All jolly inconvenient, given the sugar interests in Guyana and the management consultancy business to assorted third world agricultural ministries. Well, the history books are on his side, just about. For Booker Bros &amp; Co was founded in 1834 in Demerara, now Guyana, by George and Richard Booker, Liverpool merchants trading in sugar, hardware and dry goods. This was a year after slavery had been abolished throughout the British empire, and 27 years after the trade in slaves had been halted. The brothers may have traded in sugar pre-emancipation, but that makes them no 'more involved in slavery than people who ate the stuff', Taylor reckons. However, it was their elder brother Josias, who, having worked as an attorney on a Demerara cotton estate, was awarded a gold medal for his relations with the 'negro' by the Anti-Slavery Society. 'But one senses they were all quite good eggs,' Taylor continues.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang You-feng; from the "Hookup" program -- </F> passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] In a sign of respect and hospitality for President  Li's visit, Jose Maria Figueres, president-elect of Costa Rica,  specially convened a joint news conference on the morning of 7  May local time, at which the leaders of the two nations answered  correspondents' questions. Because of the imminent changeover  of government in Costa Rica, the conference hall was packed with  correspondents from various countries who came to cover the  inauguration. Asked about democracy in Costa Rica and what we  can learn from Costa Rica's experience of democracy, President  Li said: Costa Rica has been a model democracy of late, because  all the institutions in Costa Rica are founded on the idea of  power belonging to the people. Power is being transferred  peacefully in Costa Rica from the outgoing president to the  incoming president, and there is no uneasiness over the  changeover of political power.    Aware of the presence of a XINHUA correspondent, President  Li  changed the subject by pointing out: The foremost problem on  mainland China is who is going to be the successor. Looking at  the democratic institutions in Costa Rica, we should know that  lasting peace and stability must be founded on institutions. It  would be ideal for politics to be founded on institutions.  President Li said:    "The expression that power belongs to the people is an old  saying; it is, as a matter of fact, also very timely. Let us  talk about it. I believe a representative from mainland China  is present here. The biggest problem facing mainland China is  who is going to be the successor. [words indistinct] will tell  you that the democracy we are promoting is such an institution.  We should know that lasting peace and stability refers  precisely to the establishment of such institutions. The  establishment of institutions [words indistinct]. I believe  that this is the best and soundest approach."    At this point, President Li said with emotion that he has a  dream. His dream is avert transferring power only after his  death. He would be happiest to oversee a peaceful transfer of  power while he is still alive.    "I have a dream. I hope that some day I can hand over power  to another person. I would be happiest doing that. There has  never been a president in China, in the ROC, who has handed over  power to another a person while he was still alive. In the  dynasties of old, a new emperor would emerge only after the old  one died. I hope this will not happen again. This is precisely  the goal of our constitutional reform. Only then will the  country enjoy stability. Development is possible only when there  is stability."    [Words indistinct] his ideas of democracy and power  belonging  to the people and his wishes to establish a political system of  lasting peace and stability, the XINHUA correspondent present at  the news conference told ROC correspondents that what President  Li said was very sensible. China indeed needs to become more  democratic and scientific. The practice in the past of one  person designating another as his successor should never be  repeated.    (Shu Chih-cheng), director of the Secretariat of the  Presidential Office who was a member of the government  delegation, also told the XINHUA correspondent that the  president's words were from the bottom of his heart, saying that  he hoped that they would give full coverage to his remarks.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Go-ahead for Opera House scheme The Royal Opera House was given the go-ahead on its Pounds 150m redevelopment scheme last night by the planning and transport committee of Westminster City Council. The committee voted to give planning consent to the scheme - the third master plan to emerge from the Royal Opera House in an 18-year battle to secure public funding and planning permission to modernise its facilities, some of which date from 1858. The proposals approved last night were significant revisions of previous plans. Most significantly, the opera house has dropped its controversial proposals to build commercial offices to fund the project after the it was advised that the plan would not work due to the decline in the property market. Mr Jim Monahan, chairman of the Covent Garden Community Association planning committee, which has opposed all proposals, said: 'We will continue to protest because the scheme is bad for the area.' Westminster planners also gave the go-ahead last night to a controversial scheme to create a pedestrian plaza in front of Buckingham Palace. The local authority said it was concerned about the number of accidents at the site, and had taken the views of the palace into consideration. However, the Royal Fine Art Commission said it had doubts about the scheme.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ENGAGING FALK PROVIDES LIFT FOR A WEARYING 'TUNE IN TOMORROW'  </P> <P> Movies about the fine line between reality and fantasy are usually arty,  self-conscious horrors. "Tune In Tomorrow . . ." isn't in that category. Its  faults are of a reverse sort; it makes so little of the mystery of the  reality-fantasy interchange that it comes across like a great big rambunctious  cartoon. Fantasy knocks reality out of the box.  </P> <P> Based on the 1977 Mario Vargas Llosa novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,"  the film is about what happens when a dotty, inspired radio writer named Pedro  Carmichael (Peter Falk) is hired by WXBU, "the Voice of New Orleans," to spark  its low-rated soap-opera. This he does, and, in the process, sparks the lives  of his co-workers -- specifically the 21-year-old Martin (Keanu Reeves), an  aspiring radio writer who is in love with Julia (Barbara Hershey), his  35-year-old, twice-divorced aunt by marriage.  </P> <P> The film's scenario whittles down Vargas Llosa's narrative, in which real-life  chapters alternated with Pedro's soapsuds fantasies. The film settles on one of  Pedro's plot lines: a complicated story compounding adultery, incest, mistaken  identity -- the works. (Such well-known faces as Henry Gibson, John  Larroquette, Dan Hedaya, Hope Lange, Elizabeth McGovern and Peter Gallagher  turn up in this story line.)  </P> <P> The film's not-too-subtle conceit is that the romantic entanglements of Martin  and Julia inspire Pedro's perfervid imagination; he sets up liaisons between  them and then, employing various disguises ranging from charwoman to rabbi,  eavesdrops on their dialogue, which then ends up in his radio drama,  influencing the couple's real-life affair.  </P> <P> For Pedro, writing isn't just a job, it's a mission. When he directs the actors  in the radio studio, he whips them into a frenzy to match his own. "I want your  souls to enter the microphones," he says, and he means it literally. Pedro may  appear to be a hack, but, in the film's terms, he is also the soul of creation.  His soaps are low-grade but they're entertaining as hell; they fulfill the  first requirement of any story -- we want to know what happens next.  </P> <P> And Pedro goes a step further; he uses his dramas as a way of making reality  happen. At one time or another all writers probably feel like they're playing  God. Pedro actively courts godliness. He's the writer as cosmic matchmaker.  </P> <P> Pedro's antics are more entertaining than the soap opera that we see, or even  Julia and Martin's budding romance. The soap sequences are lively camp but  they're overblown; even though the film (throughout San Diego County) is set in  1951, the scenes have the floridness of some of the more batty episodes of  "Dallas" or "Dynasty." A more straightforward approach to these sequences might  have worked better. Jon Amiel, who directed from a script by William Boyd,  doesn't seem to recognize that soaps already contain a built-in component of  self-satire. He overdoes what was overdone to begin with.  </P> <P> Keanu Reeves has some problems with his New Orleans accent, but he has a  breezy, engaging presence and a winning, hangdog lyricism whenever his  love-struck Martin is moping about the beloved Julia. Barbara Hershey makes his  love for her believable. Although born in New Orleans, she's currently a New  York refugee, and we can see how her brittle, citified ways might stir him up.  </P> <P> Julia's tough-gal cynicism is pretty transparent, though, and Martin spots her  frailty. It's what finally wins her over to him. Hershey is one of those  comparatively few performers whose talents have deepened with age. Julia isn't  a major role, but Hershey attacks it as if it were. This is the same actress  who was so extraordinary in "A World Apart" and, on television, "A Killing in a  Small Town."  </P> <P> Peter Falk has a small field day as Pedro. Even though his scenes are scaled to  be funnier than they actually are, he sashays into his multiple roles with  glee. But Amiel doesn't encourage him to bring out the nightmarish quality in  the changeovers, the way, in "Lolita," Kubrick and Peter Sellers collaborated  to bring out the creepiness in Nabokov's Clare Quilty. (That's still probably  the greatest multiple-personality performance ever.) The film is so resolutely  jokey that Falk never has a chance to demonstrate the scary potential in  Pedro's cosmic matchmaking.  </P> <P> Vargas Llosa's novel, which was set in Lima, Peru, and based on his own early,  scandalous marriage to his aunt, had a denser, more mysterious texture. "Tune  In Tomorrow . . ." (rated PG-13) is a gagster's movie, and, like most gag  fests, you sit back and sort out the good skits from the bad. You learn to  settle for less.  </P> <P> 'TUNE IN TOMORROW ...'  </P> <P> A Cinecom Entertainment release. Executive producer Joseph Caracciolo Jr.  Producers John Fiedler and Mark Tarlov.

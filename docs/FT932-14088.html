			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Record PSBR pushes deficit beyond Pounds 36bn THE GOVERNMENT ended a grim financial year by borrowing Pounds 9.5bn last month, the highest monthly borrowing requirement on record. The figure took the full 1992-93 fiscal deficit to Pounds 36.5bn, dwarfing the previous year's Pounds 13.8bn public sector borrowing requirement. This represents a significant turnround from only two years ago when the government's finances were in small surplus. The sharp rise in borrowing was partly due to the heavy cost of recession, but the latest figure will fuel fears that the public sector deficit is structural and will not decline significantly with economic recovery. The high level of borrowing is likely to increase pressure on the government to decide on cuts in public spending in negotiations between the Treasury and spending departments to fix expenditure totals for the 1994-95 financial year. The news prompted surprise in the City, which had been expecting a PSBR of Pounds 8bn for the month, in line with the latest government forecast. In the Budget last month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, reduced his forecast for public sector borrowing in the latest financial year to Pounds 35.1bn from the Pounds 37bn forecast in the Autumn Statement. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR was Pounds 10.9bn, compared with Pounds 6.48bn in the same month last year. The Treasury shrugged off criticism of its forecasting record. It said it was difficult to estimate the traditional end of year surge in spending. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said there was nothing which would lead him to revise substantially the borrowing projections made for the financial year just starting. The latest official forecasts predict a PSBR of Pounds 50.1bn in this financial year - about 8 per cent of national output. Although the March PSBR is usually the highest figure of the year, last month's deficit was Pounds 3bn higher than the previous record of Pounds 6.48bn in the same month last year. The large shortfall mainly reflected a sharp jump in spending by central government departments. Net departmental outlays were Pounds 23.3bn last month - 30 per cent higher than in March last year. Total cash receipts for 1992-93 were Pounds 200.7bn, a decrease of 0.5 per cent compared with the previous financial year. Inland Revenue receipts were 4 per cent lower than a year ago, Customs and Excise receipts were 2.5 per cent higher and social security receipts were 3 per cent higher. The government collected Pounds 5bn of income tax last month compared with Pounds 4.5bn in March a year ago. The government bond market reacted badly to the news, although gilt prices at the long end recovered later to close just  1/8 of a point lower.

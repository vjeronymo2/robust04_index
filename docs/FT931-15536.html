			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago lumber prices soar as weather cuts supplies ENVIRONMENTAL constraints on logging in the US Pacific north-west have gradually slowed lumber deliveries to the US housing industry, and now heavy snows and frigid weather in logging and saw mill regions have cut lumber supplies to a trickle. Tight supplies of Canadian spruce turned up the heat in the lumber futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week, with prices hitting their highest levels in the 15-year life of the contract. Lumber futures for delivery this month reached an all-time high of Dollars 304.60 per thousand board feet Friday, and climbed to Dollars 315.50 yesterday morning. The normally sleepy lumber futures pit at the CME has long been a barometer of US economic health. Strong lumber demand generally reflects a healthy US housing market. Lately, low interest rates and slow but steady economic growth have helped set a bullish tone in lumber prices as traders have anticipated a revival in home-building. However, volume and volatility caught fire in late November as logging channels in Oregon and Washington state timber regions were hit by extreme winter weather. The freeze continued through the Christmas holidays, with temperatures so cold that saw mills could not operate at full capacity even when they had timber on hand. The weather caused a supply squeeze just as demand was perking up. Mr Curt Cunningham, an analyst with Pacific Futures Trading in Seattle, Washington, said lumber wholesalers started the winter season with low stocks. 'Dealers depleted inventories all through the fall, and then in November had to buy up enormous amounts of wood to keep up their stocks,' he said. And while adverse weather in the Pacific north-west was shutting down lumber production, in most of the rest of the US it was warmer than usual, and conducive to building, stepping up lumber demand. Wholesalers are reporting that the normal three-week order backlog has grown to five weeks. Mr Cunningham thought the recent price run-up in lumber futures might be reaching its peak, as the January contract goes off the board this week. While some may worry that the lumber futures price may be distorted by its relatively small size - only 1,252 contracts were traded on Friday  - analysts say futures prices have been tracking underlying cash indices faithfully. Analysts say a fundamental shift in north-west logging practices may continue to keep the heat on in the lumber futures pit in Chicago. The US logging industry depends heavily on federal timber lands. Pressure from environmentalists and outdoorsmen has limited availability, with sales of federal timber down 51.6 per cent in 1992 from 1990.</p>

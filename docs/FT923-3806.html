			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Observer: Mandarin switch If any restless mandarins think they're too old to switch careers, they should take comfort from Peter Middleton, Lloyd's new chief executive. He was 45 when he quit the foreign office and had never made a loan in his life. Yet within a year or so of joining Midland Bank International he headed banking operations, and at 47 was given the job of turning round Midland's Thomas Cook. While not at Midland long enough to prove whether he'd make a good banker, he has certainly done well at Cook. The travel company is again the brand leader, its demoralised management has been revitalised and it is one asset Midland has been able to sell at a handsome profit. All this was done with minimum self-publicity and it is a measure of Middleton that when he announced his resignation a few weeks ago, he said he wasn't sure that his colleagues would notice he had gone. Admittedly, he has been helped by friends in high places. Sir Michael Palliser, a former head of the diplomatic service and Midland director, smoothed his path, and Frenchman Herve de Carmoy, a suave ex-Midland banker with a high opinion of himself, used Middleton as a guinea pig. De Carmoy wanted to see if it was possible to take British civil servants and teach them another job in the private sector, as often happens in France. It was one of de Carmoy's better experiments at Midland Bank. Middleton has proved that ex-civil servants can make effective managers as opposed to non-executive directors.</p>

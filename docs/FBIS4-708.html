			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Calm has returned this  morning to the eastern Brazzaville industrial district of Mpila,  where a brief clash occurred yesterday between opposition  supporters and security forces. Traffic has resumed in the  area, where businesses had remained closed yesterday because of  the prevailing tension after an exchange of gunfire. No  gunshots have been heard by journalists. This return to  normalcy follows President Pascal Lissouba's message warning all  Army and police officers against any act that "would jeopardize  the peace process and the security of people and property."    Former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's supporters are  opposed to the deployment of security forces in the district,  fearing that this could serve as a pretext to attack the  residence of the former head of state, who has been living for  several months now in his native village, Oyo, 600 km north of  Brazzaville. According to the police, the security forces were  deployed in Mpila to check the activities of armed robbers, who  have been attacking goods trains.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Computer fraud rises sharply Attacks on public-sector and private-sector computer systems by thieves, hackers and virus writers have increased dramatically in the past three years, the Audit Commission said yesterday. The rise is a consequence of the spread of personal computers and networks but also the result of managers neglecting or refusing to put into practice measures which could contain or reduce computer fraud and hacking. The commission says the total value of losses caused by computer abuse has risen 183 per cent since the last survey - the average loss per incident caused through fraud is now Pounds 28,170. The study - involving returns from more than 1,000 companies - shows that the number of incidents of computer abuse reported has increased from 12 per cent of organisations canvassed in 1991 to 36 per cent. There has also been a 38 per cent increase in reported fraud and an eightfold rise in the use of illicitly obtained software. Incidents reported to the commission range from an employee who gained access to her own and her husband's debt records and reduced them, to a nurse who hacked into a hospital's computer system and prescribed potentially lethal drugs for one patient and altered treatment records for others. The figures almost certainly understate the problem - organisations are notoriously shy of admitting incid-ents. Management, it says, does not impose adequate controls. It found almost 25 per cent of organisations had no internal auditing procedures, 60 per cent did not carry out security awareness training, 50 per cent had no computer audit skills and more than 80 per cent did not practise risk analysis.

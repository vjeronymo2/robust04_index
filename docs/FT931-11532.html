			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Britain cleans up THE DISPUTE about the transfer of work from Hoover's vacuum cleaner plant in France to its plant in Scotland has been long on political rhetoric and short on facts. Contrary to political rhetoric in Brussels and Paris, the transfer has little to do with 'social dumping' or Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter. Social dumping is the theory that in barrier-free economic zones capital will flow to areas where labour is cheapest and least protected, triggering downward pressure on standards in other regions. There is no evidence for the second part of the theory and little for the first, regrettably for the low wage economies of southern Europe where investors have learned to balance cheap labour against low productivity. By recruiting the EC's social dimension to the cause of economic nationalism French politicians also risk discrediting a feature of European integration that they have done so much to promote. A balance has to be struck. It is legitimate to enforce minimum standards of civilised behaviour on employers by banning child labour or insisting on basic safety standards. It is also essential to ensure state aid does not give companies an unfair advantage. But it is absurd to regard every aspect of competitive advantage across the EC as dumping. The Hoover episode has struck an understandable anti-British nerve but the row says something about the increasing fragmentation of the EC as well as the state of French politics. It is easy to see why the 'sweatshop' of Europe is in the dock following its social chapter opt-out and sterling's devaluation since September. In reality, Hoover's restructuring decision was made in Scotland's favour because the company had spare capacity there and because, it says, non-wage labour costs are only about 10 per cent of wage costs in Scotland compared with 45 per cent in France. Despite the crowing of some British politicians neither the social chapter opt-out nor devaluation has much to do with that. The social chapter does not cover wage or non-wage labour costs and Hoover says it did not make a long-term investment decision based on a short-term devaluation. The labour market culture of the Thatcher era may have enhanced the UK's attractiveness, but it has for decades claimed the largest share of external investment in the EC. Easier hire and fire can also work against British jobs when it is much cheaper to close plants in the UK than in Spain, France or Germany. By EC standards Britain is a low labour cost economy, partly because citizens pay for healthcare through general taxation. In those parts of industry where productivity is not correspondingly low the UK is an attractive investment site. British workers should thank Mr Delors for advertising that.</p>

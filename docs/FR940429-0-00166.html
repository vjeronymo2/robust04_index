			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triad members and institutions to exchange information about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gatekeeping process and to discuss how the triad is functioning,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both in identifying institutions whose performance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionable and in reporting requirements that have proven to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the functioning of the triad, as it is implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through these and other regulations governed by part H. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary will seek improvement, where possible, within existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute itself if experience indicates those changes are both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Substantive Changes to the NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A_General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.2&blank;General Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Academic Year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on how to implement the technical amendment that provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a case-by-case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, the required minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not less than 26 weeks of instructional time in the case of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program of instruction for which it awards an associate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baccalaureate degree. The Secretary did not propose specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria to implement this technical amendment in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 28, 1994 NPRM, but instead requested comments on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``good cause'' and requested comments on ways of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this provision that addressed the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern that reductions in the award year would encourage many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions to seek that treatment routinely. After reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments on defining good cause, and developing safeguards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to discourage routine requests for reductions in the academic year, the Secretary has implemented this technical amendment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new &sect;668.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this section, for the purpose of awarding Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA funds, the Secretary may reduce the length of an academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year for an institution that submits a written request to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary. Section 668.3 provides for a two-year ``phase-in''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period for institutions that are currently participating, have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic year of 26&hyph;29 weeks, and meet the other applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of the section. The Secretary will consider all other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests for a reduction in the minimum number of weeks of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructional time to not less than 26 weeks on a case-by-case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis in accordance with the requirements of &sect;668.3. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 668.3 is discussed in greater detail in the section of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that addressed the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (&sect;668.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the February 28, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on how to address an abuse of the definition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> whereby an institution that has programs that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in credit hours without terms could claim that it meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements for the minimum amount of work to be performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a full-time student over an academic year by giving a full- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time student a minimal amount of instruction over a 30-week (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more) period, which the institution claims to be equivalent to 24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semester or 36 quarter hours. The Secretary requested comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a minimum full-time workload for students enrolled in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these educational programs should be established to address this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse. Several commenters agreed that this abuse should be addressed. However, rather than changing the proposed definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of full-time student to require measurement of student workloads,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a modification has been made to require that, for educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs using credit hours, but not using a semester, trimester,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or quarter system, a week of instructional time is any week in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which at least five days of regularly scheduled instruction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations, or preparation for examinations occurs, as opposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to one day of regularly scheduled instruction, examinations, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation for examinations for all other programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes it is important to ensure that full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students are performing comparable workloads regardless of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of institution they are attending, and that such work should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be ratably allocated throughout the period of instruction. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary notes that this is an area of abuse that is not fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed by the implementation of the ``clock hour/credit hour''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. A corresponding change has been made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> eligible program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One-third of an academic year and two-thirds of an academic year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, the Secretary has defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-third of an academic year and two-thirds of an academic year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to clarify the procedure for prorating awards under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL and NDSL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Undergraduate student. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because the Secretary recognizes that, at this time, there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legitimate reasons supported by statute for separate definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> undergraduate student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> under the various Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program regulations the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> undergraduate student  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been deleted in these final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.8&blank;Eligible Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualitative factors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.8(e)(1)(iii) requires that, for a short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, the length of the program may not exceed by more than 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent the minimum number of clock hours required for training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the recognized occupation for which the program prepares  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, as established by the State in which the program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered, if the State has established such a requirement. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to public comment, this provision has been amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also prohibit a short-term eligible program from exceeding by 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent any applicable minimum number of clock hours required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> agency for training in the recognized occupation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the program prepares students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.8(e)(2) has been revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clarify that, since a certified public accountant cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify the accuracy of an institution's completion or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement-rate calculations, the institution shall substantiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these calculations by having the certified public accountant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follow the procedures of an attestation engagement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of completion rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.8(f)(4) has been amended to require that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student must complete the educational program in which he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is enrolled within 150 percent of the published length of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational program in order to be counted as a completer for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of this calculation. This change was made to conform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the calculation of a completion rate under the Student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Right-to-Know provisions. The Secretary notes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department will continue to evaluate the feasibility of replacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this methodology with the methodology developed relative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Student Right-to-Know Act once that methodology has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

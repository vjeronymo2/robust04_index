			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A workaholic - but only during opening hours Sir, Your self-assessment test on workaholism (Management: 'Are you a workaholic?', February 18) certainly reflected the current, familiaphobic obsession with quantity of work, rather than quality. The questions were designed mainly to assess how much our work encroached on our private lives, but none of them asked how productive we were during our normal working hours or how well we thought we did our jobs. I scraped into the 'You certainly take things easy' category. No, I work hard when I am at the office so that I do not have to do it at home. Conversely, if I twiddled my thumbs for part of the day, so that I had to catch up with work at the weekend, I might make it into the 'reasonable balance and healthy lifestyle' category. You can still be an alcoholic if you only drink during opening hours. Why is it not the same for workaholics? John Raymond, 11 Kirkley Road, London SW19 3AZ</p>

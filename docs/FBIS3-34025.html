He was received at Amman Civilian Airport by Talal Sat'an  al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, senior Foreign  Ministry staff, and the Omani ambassador in Amman.    Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah spoke to our correspondent  Muhammad al-Hajaya, and said:    [Begin Bin-'Abdallah recording] I have an oral message from  his majesty the sultan to his brother His Majesty King Husayn  Bin-Talal. The message concerns issues of joint interests and  consultations over various issues. Oman, like Jordan, is  concerned about all dimensions of the Arab interests and we hope  the joint effort of the two kings will, God willing, be a  blessed effort and bear fruit to benefit the Arab and Muslim  nations.    Consultations between the leaders are continuing and I  believe that circumstances are now better than what they were in  the past. We hope that the efforts will, God willing, bear fruit  for the benefit of common interests. [end recording]</p>

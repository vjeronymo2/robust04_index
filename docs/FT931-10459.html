			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Whessoe seeks Pounds 14.3m to fund Norwegian buy WHESSOE, the acquisitive engineer and controls company, yesterday launched a surprise Pounds 21.8m bid for Autronica, the Norwegian instrumentation group, and called on shareholders for the second time in 13 months to help fund its expansion. The bid marks the first attempt by a foreign company to acquire a Norwegian group without prior agreement. Autronica's board, which under Norwegian law has no obligation to advise shareholders on any offer, has said it will consider the offer at a board meeting on February 18. The UK group launched a 1-for-4 rights issue at 260p to raise Pounds 14.3m towards the purchase of Oslo-quoted Autronica. The balance would be funded with Whessoe's cash resources, leaving it with neither debt nor cash in the ank. The issue, which follows an Pounds 8m rights in 1991 to purchase Varec, a US tank gauge manufacturer, is not conditional on the purchase. If the bid fails, the proceeds would be used for further acquisitions. Mr Christopher Fleetwood, chief executive, said Autronica would 'significantly extend the horizons of Whessoe'. The Norwegian company had a recognised name in engine controls, radar gauges and fire detection systems. Its products would complement those offered by Whessoe in its instrumentation division. However, Autronica incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 28.7m for the eight months to August 31. Debt was Pounds 7.2m at the end of December 1991. The company, which recently lost its financial director and managing director, had already taken steps to restructure, Mr Fleetwood said. Its own board expected to break even in the full year. Mr Fleetwood said if the bid was successful, Autronica expected to make a positive contribution in its first full year. Whessoe is offering NKr85 per Autronica share. The Norwegian group's shares closed NKr40 higher in Oslo at NKr81. Whessoe has also paid Pounds 255,000 for call options over 56.8 per cent of Autronica's shares at NKr85. The bulk of these options were granted by Securitas, one of Autronica's largest customers and a significant shareholder with two board representatives. Whessoe said it had agreed a minimum purchase deal with Securitas, assuming the bid succeeds, in return for offering a volume discount on Autronica's products. The offer is conditional on receiving acceptances from two thirds of the issued share capital, and approval from both Whessoe shareholders and the Norwegian authorities. Whessoe's shares fell 10p to close at 304p. The share price, which fell to a low of 208p this summer, has recovered sharply since the announcement of a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last December.</p>

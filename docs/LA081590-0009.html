			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> WE'VE GONE AS FAR AS WE CAN;  </P> <P> U.S. DEPLOYMENT: THE WEST'S OIL IS SECURE, SO LET ARAB FORCES TAKE OVER THE  TASK OF PUNISHING IRAQ.  </P> <P> The problem now is the notorious difficulty of sitting on bayonets. President  Bush says that the objective of the United States in the gulf is "restoration  of Kuwait's legitimate government." That also is what the United Nations  Security Council demands.  </P> <P> The President says that U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia are not there "to drive the  Iraqis out of Kuwait." Why, then, should the Iraqis leave?  </P> <P> The Security Council intends them to be forced out by economic and political  pressures. Hence the U.N.-mandated embargo on commerce with Iraq.  </P> <P> However, the list of successful embargoes is short. This one has near-universal  support from the United Nations' member governments, but it is opposed by  millions of individuals in the Middle East who believe that Iraq's Saddam  Hussein is the man to lead them out of poverty and end the humiliations Arabs  have experienced throughout modern times.  </P> <P> Iraq has land borders with Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Turkey  and Saudi Arabia are committed to the embargo, the latter with little  enthusiasm but no choice, as the victim of the piece.  </P> <P> Jordan is trapped, and King Hussein would surely be grateful if Saudi Arabia  and Israel, his other neighbors, and the Western powers at sea, would enforce  the U.N. embargo for him, which they are in a position to do.  </P> <P> Syria's is a complex and brutal game of regional rivalry. Its president, Hafez  Assad, has joined the embargo and is sending a contingent to the Arab forces in  Saudi Arabia to advance Syrian interests and check his enemy, Saddam Hussein.  Syria, though, is heavily engaged in Lebanon, where enthusiasm for the Iraqi  leader is incandescent; and Lebanon is not a place today where one can be  optimistic about enforcing embargoes. In Lebanon nothing is enforced.  </P> <P> Iran's is a complex game, too, as it has every reason to wish its old enemy  Saddam Hussein destroyed, yet every reason to wish him success in provoking a  high international price for oil -- which is what he was doing when the United  States stepped in.  </P> <P> The Iraqi president now is waging a successful political struggle by merging  Islamic militance with pan-Arab nationalism. In modern times there have been  two movements for pan-Arab renewal and "liberation," both utopian in  intellectual and emotional appeal, the two in conflict with one another. One  wanted theocracy, re-creation of the society that existed when the caliphs  ruled an Islamic empire reaching from southern India to Spain. It includes  Iranians and Islamic fundamentalists everywhere. The other movement is pan-Arab  nationalism, which originated among Syrian and Lebanese intellectuals between  the two world wars. One version has become the ideology of the dictatorships in  both Syria and Iraq. Another was that of the most important modern Arab  nationalist leader, Egypt's Nasser. His is the mantle Saddam Hussein wants to  assume -- or usurp.  </P> <P> Hussein went to war against Iran a decade ago to fight Islamic fundamentalism.  Today he proclaims that he is defending Islam's holy places against American  and Western infidels -- and he is taken seriously. (It is a politically  incendiary fact that the American build-up takes place not far from Mecca and  Medina, while Jerusalem, Islam's third holy place, is in Israel's hands.)  </P> <P> If the U.N. embargo and Anglo-American blockade do not make Saddam Hussein  disgorge Kuwait -- and they are not likely to do so -- the United States  confronts a prospect either of military action in increasingly difficult  political circumstances, or eventual withdrawal of its expeditionary force with  whatever grace as can be managed.  </P> <P> If the oil market stabilizes, as a result of increased Saudi and gulf  production and of resumed measures of fuel substitution and conservation in the  West, military action to free Kuwait will run against U.S. domestic political  opposition to anything that risks U.S. casualties. And there is no way to take  Kuwait away from Iraq by force that will not produce substantial American  casualties.  </P> <P> This being so, the American military buildup seems increasingly  disproportionate both to the current threat to Saudi Arabia and to the policy  options before the United States. Forces now reported on the move or on alert  include the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the 7th Light Infantry, the 24th  Mechanized Division, two Marine Expeditionary Brigades, a battleship, four  aircraft carriers, plus 50 or so other major fleet units, B-52s, Stealth  bombers and fighters, F-111s, etc.  </P> <P> Are they all eventually to be redeployed home with nothing accomplished?  </P> <P> If the United States is not prepared to take Kuwait away from Iraq, the Arab  League's decision to put troops into Saudi Arabia should have been accepted as  evidence that the problem now was in Arab hands. The U.S. fleet could continue  to monitor the embargo and the threat to Saudi Arabia, but American ground  forces come out as Egyptians, Syrians and Moroccans go in.  </P> <P> A considerable test has arrived of the seriousness, steadiness and policy  competence of the Bush Administration. President Bush has made his point about  America being a reliable ally. Saudi oil is secure for the present, and the  international community is mobilized against Saddam Hussein. What now is the  American aim? If it is the liberation of Kuwait, is this really within the Bush  Administration's -- or the country's -- political means? Or will this huge and  continuing deployment end on a dying fall, an exhibition without effect?  </P></p>

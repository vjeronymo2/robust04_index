			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE MIXES SIGNALS ON 'PEACE DIVIDEND'  </P> <P> In the first skirmish of a new battle over how to spend the so-called "peace  dividend," the Senate sent preliminary and somewhat mixed signals Wednesday on  how it will allocate savings from anticipated major reductions in U.S. defense  costs this year.  </P> <P> A lopsided 79-19 majority first approved a Democratic plan that would earmark  the multibillion-dollar savings in Pentagon outlays to balance the budget and  then raise spending for "urgent national priorities" such as education, health  care and anti-drug programs. Tax reductions for "working men and women" would  get third priority under this plan.  </P> <P> Minutes later, the Senate narrowly defeated a Republican alternative that would  devote all of the savings from the defense budget to tax reductions, including  a cut in the capital gains tax rate, once the federal budget is balanced. The  vote was 50 to 48.  </P> <P> In a way, the skirmish was a sham battle since the sense-of-the-Senate  resolution adopted Wednesday is not binding and, as several senators said in  the debate, a "peace dividend" may not emerge for years, if ever.  </P> <P> But it indicated how closely the Senate is divided on whether tax cuts should  have a higher priority than additional spending as Congress considers the  budget in the wake of rapid easing of East-West tensions and the toppling of  Communist regimes in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> It is not entirely a party-line issue, either, as the vote on the second  resolution, sponsored by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), showed. Eleven Democrats  voted with Gramm and seven Republicans voted against his proposal for  allocating a "peace dividend" exclusively to tax reduction.  </P> <P> On the resolution that passed -- sponsored by Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.),  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee -- 54 Democrats and 25 Republicans  supported it while the 19 dissenting votes were all cast by GOP senators.  </P> <P> While the vote was mainly symbolic, however, the debate was a preview of the  controversy that is likely to go on for months and years over what to do with  billions of dollars that would have gone for military spending except for the  reduced Soviet threat in Europe.  </P> <P> "It's high time we quit squandering the treasury of this nation for overly  sophisticated weapons systems," said Sasser. "We need to take this peace  dividend and apply these funds wisely."  </P> <P> Gramm countered that any funds cut from the Pentagon should be "returned to  America's taxpayers" in the form of a higher personal exemption, a child care  tax deduction, a lower long-term capital gains rate, repeal of the Social  Security earnings test for retired persons, expanded research and development  tax credits and other incentives for savings and investment.  </P> <P> "Yes, we're all for tax cuts," Sasser replied. "I wonder why tax cuts for the  wealthy are so wonderful and tax cuts for working Americans are not." His  proposal advocated a third priority to tax cuts for "working men and women" in  distributing defense savings.  </P> <P> The Sasser resolution passed by the Senate also calls for using defense savings  for balancing the budget first, followed by higher outlays for anti-drug and  anti-crime programs, education, health care, the environment, rebuilding the  nation's roads and bridges and giving aid to emerging democracies.  </P> <P> Gramm argued that it would be "a great tragedy" to use any funds from defense  cuts for expanding government programs.  </P> <P> "The fruits of the success of freedom . . . should go to the people who won the  Cold War, not to the government," Gramm said.  </P></p>

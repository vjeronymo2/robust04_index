Starting from the provincial capital of Nanchang in the  south  and ending at Jiujiang, a port city on the Chang Jiang in the  north, the industrial corridor is expected to become the pillar  of the local economy in the foreseeable future.    The corridor's total industrial output value topped 26  billion yuan last year, with a growth of about 40 percent over  that of 1992.    The amount of foreign investment utilized, which was 135  million yuan, has also more than doubled that of the previous  year.    First established in 1992, the corridor has witnessed a  conspicuous improvement in its investment environment since then.    Nanchang-Jiujiang first-rate highway and the second phase of  Jiujiang electricity factory project have been put into  operation in succession.    The 2,780-meter-long Nanchang Bridge over the Ganjiang has  also opened to traffic, alleviating local traffic jams.    Thirty-seven communication projects have been completed and  the number of computer-controlled telephone sets installed have  reached 143,500.    The eight provincial development zones along the industrial  corridor totally earmarked 200 million yuan for infrastructure  constructions last year.    By now, blessed with the best transportation and  communication conditions and most advanced energy industry in  the province, regions along the corridor have aroused interest  of more and more foreign investors.    In 1993, newly-approved foreign-invested projects reached  764, with a contracted investment of 610 million U.S. dollars.  Among them, 145 have started business and been put into  operation and 250 of them are under construction.</p>

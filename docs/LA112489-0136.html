			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION RINGS IN SEASON OF SPENDING;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING FINDS HORDES OF AMERICANS HUNGRY FOR HOLIDAY  BARGAINS.  </P> <P> Customers clutching credit cards and wish lists joined by children eager for a  glimpse of Santa Claus crammed into stores around the country today in the  traditional start of the post-Thanksgiving buying spree.  </P> <P> Old-fashioned holiday spirit mixed with a hunger for bargains sent shoppers and  browsers out in force, promising to produce a day worthy of its billing as the  busiest one of the year for merchants.  </P> <P> The six B. Altman &amp; Co. department stores in New York, New Jersey and  Pennsylvania that are closing down -- financially struggling parent company  Hooker Corp. couldn't find a buyer for the chain -- drew hordes of people to  their liquidation sales.  </P> <P> The crowd clamoring to get inside B. Altman's main store in Manhattan was so  heavy that shoppers had to be admitted in shifts.  </P> <P> "We're having an unbelievable day," said Brenda Smith, secretary for the  manager at Altman's in Short Hills, N.J.  </P> <P> Other store managers in many areas reported customers lined up outside waiting  for doors to open, a hopeful sign in the most crucial season of a year that so  far has been slow for retailers.  </P> <P> At Bloomingdale's department store in Manhattan, customers lined up early in  numbingly cold weather to get a jump on their holiday shopping, and surged  inside when the doors opened at 9 a.m.  </P> <P> "We're filling up with people rapidly," Bloomingdale's spokeswoman Ann Stock  said. "As always, we expect this to be the busiest day of the year."  </P> <P> Early shoppers at Bloomingdale's grabbed mittens, gloves, scarfs and hats.  Others made a beeline for the coat department. New York's first Thanksgiving  snowfall in 51 years combined with sub-freezing temperatures apparently put  people in the mood to buy warm clothing.  </P> <P> Shoppers streamed into suburban malls and downtowns nationwide hoping to get as  much gift buying done as possible at the start of the peak shopping season. Big  markdowns on merchandise at some troubled stores lured bargain-hunters while  shoppers elsewhere scanned the aisles for hard-to-find items, such as the  popular Nintendo video games.  </P> <P> The Santa Claus at Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh, N.C., said most of the  several dozen children that had confided their requests to him this morning  asked for Nintendo items.  </P> <P> Operators of Southern California malls extended their hours today, but found  shoppers already waiting when they opened for business.  </P> <P> "There were people waiting for us to open when I got here at 7:20 this morning,  even though we weren't going to open until 8," said Clair Griffith, general  manager of the 180-store Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry in eastern  Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the region, parking lots were jamming up early.  </P> <P> "The day after Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas are the two days each  year that we fill up the lot," said Nora Levy, marketing director of the  140-store Santa Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, which has 5,200 parking spaces.  </P></p>

Japan is  expected to import as much as two million tons of rice,  including supplies from the United States and Thailand, to make  up for a shortage resulting from the worst postwar harvest in  1993.    A major rice wholesaler in Yokohama said Thai rice will be  sold at 300 to 320 yen per kilogram, about half the price of  domestic rice. Californian rice will sell for about 408 yen per  kilogram.    The government is expected to start delivering Californian  rice to wholesalers around February 10.    Yamatane Corp., a leading rice wholesaler, said it will sell  imported rice without blending it with domestic rice, giving  consumers a chance to taste a variety of rice.</p>

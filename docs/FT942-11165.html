			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Hellenic Republic FRN meets strong demand Greece's long-awaited D-Mark offering provided the highlight of another torpid day in the Eurobond markets. As expected, the Hellenic Republic issued DM1bn of seven-year floating-rate notes, with a call and a put option after five years. Paying a coupon of six-month Libor plus 75 basis points, the notes were priced at a discounted margin of 112 basis points over Libor at their 98.42 re-offer price. CS First Boston and Deutsche Bank were joint lead managers. According to one of the leads, the issue met strong demand from German and Austrian investors who benefit from their countries' double-taxation agreement with Greece. Some UK and east Asian demand was also reported. Empresa Distribuidora Sur (Edesur), an Argentine electricity distribution company, issued Dollars 150m of two-year floating-rate notes paying a coupon of three-month Libor plus 395 basis points and carrying a call option in May and November 1995. According to lead manager Chase Investment Bank, the deal met with healthy demand from investors keen on high-yielding short-term floating-rate paper. Primary market activity is likely to remain subdued ahead of today's US April jobs data, and is expected to be further crimped by next Thursday's Ascension holiday in most parts of Europe. However, there is some talk of further short-dated dollar deals as well as yen issues targeted at Japanese investors when they return from the Golden Week holiday. IBCA, the European rating agency, issued its first credit ratings for Depfa-Bank, Germany's largest mortgage bank. It awarded Depfa's unsecured Eurobonds a double-A rating and its mortgage bonds and government-guaranteed liabilities a triple-A rating. Depfa commissioned the IBCA rating after receiving an unsolicited Aa3 Eurobond rating from Moody's in February. After Moody's disappointing rating, 'we are pleased about our double-A rating' from IBCA, said Mr Gerhard Bruckermann, chief financial officer. Depfa's lending activities are substantially German-based, long-term and mostly to the public sector. Since the main part of its business is subject to the German mortgage law, its profits are low compared with those of the commercial banks. However, according to IBCA, the quality of its lending is higher. Moreover, its profitability has improved over the last four years, and this trend is continuing. Depfa has about DM60bn in mortgage bonds and some DM5bn in Eurobonds outstanding. Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating on the long-term debt of the Province of Newfoundland and on the provincially guaranteed debt of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador to triple-B plus from single-A minus. Some Dollars 2bn of debt is affected. The new rating is equivalent to Moody's Baa1 rating of the province, which was confirmed by the agency.</p>

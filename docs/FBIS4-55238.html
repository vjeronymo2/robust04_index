			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Over the last 24 hours, Serb forces carried out  sporadic provocations on the Stolac front. In Stolac the  [Croat-Muslim] Vienna negotiations are being followed with great  attention.    [Raguz] This is Ivo Raguz reporting for Herceg-Bosna Radio  from Stolac. Over the last 24 hours, members of the Serb army  carried out several provocations from their Ljubljenica  stronghold by firing fragmenting ammunition from antiaircraft  guns at the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] defense lines on the  Hodovo plateau, but fortunately with no serious consequences.  [passage omitted]    The negotiations between the Croatian and Muslim delegations  in Vienna are being followed here with a great deal of  attention. Reports full of stereotyped phrases and cliches  coming from Vienna speak about particular attention being paid  to the disputed areas of central Bosnia and the municipalities  of Stolac and Mostar in Herzegovina.    As to Stolac, it is a well-known fact that the Croatian  Democratic Community [HDZ] scored a convincing victory here at  the first multiparty elections, that HVO units comprising  exclusively Croats and including -- and this should be stressed  -- one Albanian, were instrumental in liberating the Stolac area  from the [Serb] aggressor. While the Croats fought to liberate  these areas, others, at the explicit recommendation of Alija  Izetbegovic, strutted around saying this is not their war, while  at the same time being very eager to accept humanitarian aid.    The evident difficulties in the distribution of power and  the  allocation of the leading posts in the [Muslim-Croat] federation  indicate that the other side's attitude is: What is mine will  remain mine, and what is yours will be both mine and yours; even  on your territory I will be the one in charge and you will be  subordinate to me. Aware of the lessons of the past, we can  still hear the words which translated into reality mean:  outvoting, dominating, and negating everything that is Croat.  Has not the other side, despite the specific nature of the  Washington agreement, tried -- by copying the Serbs -- to build  the collective guilt of the Croatian people into the issue of  the distribution of the leading posts in the federation and to  declare who the victims and who the beneficiaries are. We must  learn from history to ensure that it does not repeat itself.    In conclusion, even if these were relevant steps toward  peace, in view of all that has happened so far and without the  involvement of the third side, it all looks like counting one's  chickens before they are hatched.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Institutional concern over a top banker's dual role - A look at efforts to split the jobs of chairman and chief executive at Barclays SOME OF Barclays' biggest shareholders plan to meet senior management after the bank's half year results are announced today to voice concern about Mr Andrew Buxton combining the two roles of chairman and chief executive. Heavy provisions are likely to have driven first half profits well below the Pounds 378m pre-tax figure returned at the half-way stage last year. While Barclays normally talks to its shareholders after its results are announced some of the institutions are planning a 'vigorous campaign' to persuade the bank to split the two top jobs. One of the bank's institutional shareholders said: 'Barclays is the only UK bank to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive. We will not be content until the roles are split.' Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking subsidiary of Barclays where he is also deputy chairman, believes the issue is only one of semantics. In a recent interview he said: 'The words chairman and chief executive do not mean anything. Simply using these words does not give you any clue as to how management works. 'To say that Andrew Buxton is chairman and chief executive of Barclays does not mean he will take every decision. I think he would be shocked if he was expected to do it all.' Mr Buxton, a descendant of one of Barclays' founding families, became chief executive in May after the bank's non-executives put pressure on Sir John Quinton to reduce his responsibilities. Mr Buxton, who had been managing director, will assume the role of chairman at the end of the year. Since 1896, there have only been two exceptions when the chairman was not drawn from one of the founding families - one of them being Sir John - and in all cases they have combined their role with being chief executive. Sir Peter, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury whose civil service career began in 1962, was appointed chairman of BZW in November. He plans to take a greater role in the group, akin almost to being Mr Buxton's partner. One of Barclays' biggest institutional shareholders said that while it welcomed Sir Peter's new role, precedent warned that 'enormous problems' could occur when one person combined both roles of chief executive and chairman. Sir Peter believes the shareholders' arguments boil down to two main issues: that the roles should be split because chief executives run business while chairmen plan for the future; the fear that anyone combining both roles becomes too powerful. As to the first argument Sir Peter believes there are management similarities to the planned demerger of Imperial Chemical Industries and Barclays. 'Just as ICI is planning to have one chairman and two chief executives (when it demerges into two companies) so Barclays has one chairman and three chief executives of its three main divisions, Mr Alastair Robinson at banking, Mr David Band at investment banking and Mr Joseph De Feo at service businesses.' Mr Buxton, however, remains chief executive of the overall group. In countering the second argument Sir Peter points out that Mr Buxton's powers are kept in check by a strong executive committee and by him. 'I have a powerful role in the bank and he (Mr Buxton) listens to me. According to Sir Peter the most important thing for shareholders is to explain how the group is organised and what powers the various individuals have in the organisation. 'I think this is more important than who has what title', he says. Some of Barclays' institutional shareholders have yet to be convinced. Some have other strategic concerns. In particular, they are unhappy at the bank's hefty exposure to troubled property companies. In the current year, some of Barclays' big corporate customers, such as the property companies Heron International, Speyhawk, Mountleigh and Olympia &amp; York, have run into difficulties. As a result, Barclays is likely to face big losses on loans to some of these companies. Sir Peter believes there is a simple lesson to be learnt. 'The banks are primarily in the business of taking risks. The banking system did not think hard enough about the risk. You can easily fool yourself about the risk.' In the US Sir Peter does not believe the group should try to compete with the well-established domestic banks in commercial banking. 'I think we need to try to become more specialised in which clients we want to look after.' He says the great lesson that Barclays has learnt is that it needs a clear strategy about what businesses it wishes to offer and in how many countries. Part of that strategy is deciding how far the bank can spread its resources in offering any one particular service. In retail banking, for example, Sir Peter says the group has no ambitions to offer a European-wide service. Instead, the group is to concentrate its resources in the UK and in selected areas on the continent, such as Spain and Portugal. The first thing he decided to do when he took up his post was to streamline BZW. One of the most important decisions was to merge investment banking with the bank's international treasury operations. 'We shall be offering a complete range of services to our clients,' says Sir Peter. This is an area where Sir Peter said the group did want to be everywhere in terms of the range of services offered.</p>

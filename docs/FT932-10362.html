			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Search and Destroy - Andrew St George hails Howard Korder's play at the Royal Court WHY CAN'T the English write vibrant plays like the sizzling American piece, Search and Destroy by Howard Korder at The Royal Court? Here is a sharp modern morality play, alive to contemporary issues and knowing about contemporary forms, a Pilgrim's Progress for the 1990s, Death of a Salesman for the information age. It makes exciting, energetic drama. Korder centres the action on his Everyman, one Martin Mirkheim, on stage or video throughout the play. He is a small time businessman from Boca Raton, Florida. He is besotted by a self-help book called 'Daniel Strong' (a reference to the real 1990s best-seller, Iron John), and wants to produce the movie of the book. So in quest of a moral end - making lives better - he sets about money raising. This takes him to New York and leads him into drug dealing with los Colombianos and on to homicide. Martin and his partner Kim kill a traffic cop; then Martin clubs Kim to death. Later, Martin goes West, trades his tan suit for a lilac jacket and turquoise shirt, and makes it in Hollywood. Then a blackmailer turns up brandishing unpaid taxes and subpoenas. Martin meets him, holds a gun in the right hand and a cash envelope in the left; he says, 'One of these is for you.' The blackmailer chooses the envelope - 'I believe this is mine' - and leaves Martin to burn up the papers, excise the past. Morally, the play feeds off the self-help movement: forget the past, change yourself, look to the future, believe in possibilities, be all you can be. But Korder shows how the no-past theory breaks down when forgiving yourself means ignoring your murdering, drug-dealing, tax-evading past. Technically Search and Destroy (1990) combines the plot of Robert Altman's fine movie, The Player (1992) with David Mamet's early play Edmond (another one-way ticket from prosperity to wretchedness) and American Buffalo (1975) which also erupts into violence. Korder has the sharp dialogue of novelist Elmore Leonard and the Miami sass of journalist Carl Hiaasen. What emerges is a play which brings together film and fiction. Throughout, the dialogue is pared down, elided. The more intimate the scenes, the further apart the actors, carrying the energies across the stage. The set, in the refurbished Royal Court Upstairs, is a blank glossy tiled surface, with four TV screens and a lowered ceiling which serves as a table and doubles as a car. The director, Stephen Daldry, is into design details. Martin's yuppie partner smokes Camels and lights them with a Zippo; Ron, the link with the Colombian narcos, wears leather jeans and Nike hi-tops (he says, 'I don't look good in clothes'). Elsewhere, the Raybans and margueritas are perfectly matched, the swimsuit aptly encrusted with Zirconium, and the lounge suits appropriately pinstriped or plain. David Bamber as Martin is excellent; he moves from fear through incomprehension to violence with ease. Andrew Woodall as the suave Kim is a wonderfully outdated 1980s model American. Other highlights include Cathryn Bradshaw as a scriptwriting secretary and Danny Webb as a twitchy Media cocaine addict. The best line is shouted by an apoplectic shrink: 'Get me . . . something chocolate.' At the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs</p>

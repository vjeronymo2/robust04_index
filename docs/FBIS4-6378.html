			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["'UN Security Council Must Retract `Presidential Statement' </F> at Once' " -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The anti-DPRK moves of  the United States has been denounced by political parties and  organisations of different countries.    The Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist) in a  statement April 3 said that the United States is egging the  International Atomic Energy Agency on to demand an  unwarrantable "inspection" of the nuclear sites of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "This is contradictory  to the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-USA contact in  New York for a package solution to the nuclear issue and is a  crafty artifice to deploy its 'Patriot' missiles in South  Korea," it noted.    It said current developments showed that the United States  does not have the slightest intention to solve the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way but still schemes to  stifle the DPRK by the policy of strength.    The Arab Progressive Baath Party in a statement on April 5  denounced the anti-DPRK moves of the United States in creating a  grave crisis on the Korean peninsula and urged the United States  and South Korea to stop the "Team Spirit" joint military  exercises for good and all.    The Luxemburg Committee for Support to Korea's reunification  in a communique pointed out that the socalled "nuclear issue" of  North Korea must be solved through dialogue and negotiation  between the parties concerned. The Burundi-Korea Friendship  Association and the Burundi Group for the Study of the Chuche  Idea in a joint message of protest said that the United States  and its followers were motivated by an intention to stifle the  DPRK in bringing the "nuclear issue" of the Korean peninsula to  the international rostrum and demanded that the UN Security  Council retract the "presidential statement" at once.    A statement of the all-India trade union congress warned  that  the United States must bear full responsibility for the  consequences of its acts of threat to the peace and security of  the Korean peninsula.</p>

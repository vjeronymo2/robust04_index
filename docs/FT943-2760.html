			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Next advances 60% to Pounds 37m - Shares shed 15p on cautious statement about second half trading Cautious statements on future trading led to a 15p fall in the share price of Next, the fashion retailer, to 243p, in spite of a 60 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 23m to Pounds 36.9m. The profits exceeded forecasts of between Pounds 32m and Pounds 35m, and the interim dividend is raised 83 per cent from 1.5p to 2.75p - beating the highest forecasts of 2.5p. Next also said sales were currently running 13 per cent ahead of last year. However, the market seized upon a warning from Mr David Jones, chief executive, that Next would come up against 'more demanding' comparative sales figures in the months before Christmas, which might make it difficult to maintain the same percentage growth. He said sales at this stage last year were running 10 per cent ahead of 1992, but by Christmas the total increase had reached 18 per cent. His caution led to fears that Next's recovery since the early 1990s was largely complete and that future growth would be slower. 'They made it quite clear it is going to be difficult to get much more out of the business,' said Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at Kleinwort Benson. Next is trying out four stores in the US, but said it would not decide whether to expand there until next year. US trading losses and start-up costs were Pounds 900,000, down from Pounds 1.1m last year. The group is also launching the natural cosmetics chain Bath &amp; Body Works in the UK, in a 50:50 joint venture with The Limited, the chain's US parent. It expects to have five stores trading by Christ-mas. Group sales in the six months to July 31 increased from Pounds 233.2m to Pounds 274.5m, and operating profits from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 32.9m. That represented an increase in operating margin from 8.6 per cent to almost 12 per cent. Mr Jones said there was little inflation in selling prices, and the amalgamation of Next's high street and mail order ranges had enabled it to get better buying terms from suppliers. Sales in Next's 302 stores increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 191.6m (Pounds 160.9m), with operating profits up from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 19.1m. Mr Jones said Next would continue to try to increase the size of some of its stores. Turnover in Next Directory, the mail order division, also rose by 19 per cent, from Pounds 46.5m to Pounds 55.3m, and operating profits from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 5.9m. Total profits from the Club 24 credit management business were unchanged at Pounds 5.9m. Profits from other activities, including property and the Callscan software business, were Pounds 2.9m. Net interest receivable was Pounds 4m (Pounds 2.9m). After tax of Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 2.6m) earnings per share worked through at 7.3p compared with 5.5p.</p>

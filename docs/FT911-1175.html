			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Accounting proposals under fire NEW accounting proposals issued last month by the Accounting Standards Board could discourage productivity growth in the UK company sector, according to Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. The ASB's proposals envisage a radical overhaul of UK company profit and loss accounts, including the virtual abolition of the distinction between extraordinary and exceptional items. Goldman argues that companies will be discouraged from undertaking necessary restructuring of their businesses. Under the ASB's proposals, all costs will have to be taken 'above the line' and earnings per share, and share prices, will suffer as a result. According to Dr Sushil Wadwhani, an analyst at Goldman, the companies most likely to be affected are those that regularly report extraordinary charges  -costs taken below the line. In this category are: Lucas Industries, Trafalgar House, Simon Engineering, Fenner, Portals Holdings, GKN, Macarthy, Molins, Grampian Holdings, Howden Group, Bunzl, Costain, Fisons and Pilkington, all of which have reported net extraordinary items in at least four of the last five years. Dr Wadwhani says that the stock market is fixated on reported earnings per share. Although the economic reality is the same however the restructuring is accounted for, Dr Wadwhani argues that the cosmetic change will affect investors' attitudes to companies.</p>

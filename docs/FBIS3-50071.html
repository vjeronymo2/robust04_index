			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic </F> Party, Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement,  Andras Agoston, leader of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina  Hungarians, and Milomir Minic, secretary general of the  Socialist Party of Serbia, by unidentified correspondent  following talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in  Belgrade on 21 Jan -- recorded]    [Text] [Djindjic] The president expressed a will to see  the future government consist of people regardless of their  party affiliations, a government of national unity, a government  that will get the support of all the parties, a government whose  program will be supraparty and directed at solving economic and  social problems and restoring order to those services that are  indispensable to the citizens' lives.    [Correspondent] Did he perhaps discuss the prime minister?    [Djindjic] No, no. It was quite clearly stated during the  conversation that the prime minister must be someone who can be  a man of consensus.    [Correspondent] On the basis of this conversation, do you  expect that the assembly will be stabler than the former one?    [Djinjdic] I believe that this idea of a government of  national unity can have a very calming effect on all party  conflicts, and on the balance of power generally. This is -- so  to speak -- a strong point around which the parties can now  gather, and every one of them can say what they are ready to  invest into this, and what they expect in return. This is a  very good start, and I believe that this can calm the situation  both in the parliament and on our political scene. Therefore,  this conclusion and the expressed desire to assemble all those  who can contribute to the situation in one government in any  case promise a stabler and calmer parliament and calmer work in  this parliament, which will be dedicated to solving concrete  existential issues rather than interparty conflicts.    [Correspondent] In any event, are you optimistic?    [Djindjic] Yes, in any event.    [Draskovic] When it comes to fighting poverty, winning the  battle against hunger and crime, lifting the sanctions, ending  the war, and achieving economic recovery and progress, there can  be no opposition and government. These must be the shared aims  of everyone. These shared aims call for a political strategy  that will be in accordance with all this.    [Correspondent] Do you expect the new parliament to be  stabler than the former one and will produce a stabler  government?    [Draskovic] Such a parliament could give us a stabler  government only if the post of assembly chairman were given to  the opposition, and of course, the Democratic Movement of Serbia  [Depos] is the strongest political group in the opposition.  This would constitute a complete recognition of the electoral  result. We have reached an agreement in principle, and I do not  see that we could have disagreed in principle, that the  parliament should be permeated by a spirit of tolerance, that  facts are what is to be disputed, that facts should clash rather  than people, that parties and party vanities should clash, party  positions on the list, but only facts [sentence as heard].    [Correspondent] Mr. Draskovic, since this is your first  meeting with Mr. Milosevic, and since you have said certain  rather uncomfortable things about him as a person, how do you  personally see this meeting?    [Draskovic] I have never said anything about him as a  person.    [Correspondent] Saddam, Saddam.    [Draskovic] That was [pauses], let me just see [pauses], I  would like someone to come up with a single piece of evidence  that I have ever said Saddam, Saddam, or anything similar. It  was others who said this, students, young people, citizens, not  me. However, when it comes to criticizing President Milosevic,  he heads a state, our fate frequently depends on his actions,  and whoever holds a public post must also be exposed to the risk  of being criticized. The president is a charming man, with a  sense of humor, but okay, that has nothing to do with the  political side, but since you insist on the atmosphere of the  talks, I believe that the atmosphere was mutually open, trusting.    [Agoston] We also agreed that -- even though this is the  first time I have ever heard of this idea -- the idea of  electing a government of national unity was a good idea, a  government comprised of experts from various parties. I believe  that it is important that precisely at this point, in these  times, such unity is achieved, which will make it possible for  all of us to transcend this difficult situation.    [Correspondent] Could you define more clearly your position  -- that is, the party's position in relation to the ruling party  and the opposition?    [Agoston] Well, I think that this relation -- for us at  least -- has always been clear. We believe that, considering  our demands, the opposition is also an opposition for us.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minic, since President Slobodan  Milosevic has lately been increasingly insisting on a government  of national unity, how does the Socialist Party [of Serbia], as  the strongest party and the one with the greatest number of  deputies in the parliament, see this?    [Minic] After both the first and second multiparty  elections, and today, President Milosevic quite openly and  clearly insisted on the unification of political forces in  Serbia, as has been defined, he favors a government of national  unity. [sentence as heard] We believe that, after the third  multi-party elections in Serbia, conditions have been met for  surpassing the first -- so to speak -- infant diseases of  parliamentary life in the republic and that we should strive to  conduct such a political struggle that will unify the forces in  Serbia. As far as the forming of new republican governments is  concerned, the president always felt that -- at the time of the  former elections, too -- we should be open to accepting people  into the government on the basis that they are competent people  who are successfully dealing with problems in these times, so  that we see this government of national unity as completely open  to the most competent and expert people who will assemble in  such a government, so that we can solve social, economic, and  political problems which we face.    We believe that after these elections, conditions have been  met for furthering parliamentary life in the republic, for  having a parliament where parties will compete in trying to find  those legal solutions which will be best suited to solving the  economic and social interests of our people, as we have said,  for Serbia. [sentence as heard] Therefore, we consider  political life to be a way for parties to clash over such  projects. [sentence as heard] There will be a competition  between projects in the parliament, arguments will clash, and  they will be taken into consideration, rather than who is saying  what and what they are striving for. [sentence as heard]  Therefore, we believe that the parliament will have its  function.    [Correspondent] Are the Socialists ready to be without a  prime minister?    [Minic] We believe that the paramount thing right now is to  constitute the republican parliament, while [pauses] as the  strongest party, since we have convincingly won the elections,  that the president will keep in mind [pauses] to give the  mandate to someone from the Socialist Party of Serbia, or  depending on the concept. [sentence as heard] We will see how  this call for a government of national unity will be reflected  [in the public], and depending on this concept, after the  parliament is constituted, we will discuss the government in the  following days.

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sale Tilney shares suspended at own request SALE TILNEY, the loss-making mini-conglomerate which had its banking facilities extended at the beginning of December, has applied for its shares to be suspended - at 4 1/2 p - 'pending clarification of the company's financial position'. The group, which has interests in food, industrial products, insurance and financial services and has borrowings of about Pounds 24.5m, would not talk to the press yesterday, though it is thought that the current discussions with its banks concerning a financial restructuring have not yet been concluded, or indeed resolved. The restructuring, as mooted at the beginning of the month, was believed to involve a debt-for-equity swap, which would dilute existing shareholdings. The facility agreed in January 1991 with its banks, led by National Westminster, expired on November 30. In May, when announcing a cut in pre-tax losses to Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 9.62m) and a reduction of group debt to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 27.1m) for the year to November 29 1991, Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said: 'The group's solvency and the seriousness of the group's financial position are the main issue for the board,' adding that the order books in the industrial companies gave 'cause for concern'. Since then Sale Tilney reported pre-tax losses further reduced to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 3.68m) for the half-year to May 27. However, Mr Coppel said that trading had been disappointing and that net liabilities had risen to Pounds 11.6m. At the previous November year-end they stood at Pounds 9.76m.</p>

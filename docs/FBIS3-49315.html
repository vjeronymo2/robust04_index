			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by  correspondent Beate Mueller-Blattau; place and date not given;  from the "Villa Bonn" newscast -- recorded; Silajdzic and  Mueller-Blattau speak in English with superimposed German  translation; passages in italics processed from English]    [Text] [Mueller-Blattau] Welcome, Mr. Silajdzic.    [Silajdzic] Hello.    [Mueller-Blattau] Are such peace talks at all meaningful if  some of the warring parties involved, that is the Serbs, are not  participating?    [Silajdzic] Of course, there are questions that could be  solved only among three parties, but there are also questions  that can be discussed bilaterally.    [Mueller-Blattau] Which would you discuss bilaterally  tomorrow; what are the most important points?    [Silajdzic] Well, unfortunately we have many points. Allow  me to begin with the humanitarian convoys. Then there is a field  hospital that we have been wanting to bring to Mostar for three  months. But the Croat extremists do not want to let the  hospital in. Then, there are the territorial issues and the  status of Mostar. We have all agreed, of course, that the town  is to be under EU [European Union] administration. Of course,  we have to restrict to what extent the EU will administer the  territory, and then there are many other things that we must  discuss tomorrow.    [Mueller-Blattau] It seems that talks with the various  political parties always only deal with territorial issues.  Aren't the people far more important?    [Silajdzic] Yes, I hope you argue with the Croat side,  because we always offer them no lines [boundaries] between  us. It is the lines that lead to problems for the people.  But they reject this, and they do not want to live together  with us in one state. That is the problem. And when I say  they, I mean those who have the guns and the power. I am not  that sure whether the people themselves really want to live  apart. For that kind of ideology is after all what caused the  bloodbath; it started in Belgrade. It is a reality that they  just do not want to live with us in one state. And I mean the  Croats, who are the ones with the power.    [Mueller-Blattau] Lord Owen has savagely criticized the  three  parties. He said that all three only talk about peace, but do  not really want it. What do you think of that?    [Silajdzic] Yes, I have heard this comment, and it is a very  strange thing to say. I must say that it a major surprise for  me, because he knows the truth, after all. Only two days ago,  he said that Croatian troops and tanks are in Bosnia, and that  amounts to intervention by the Croatians on Bosnian territory.  Lord Owen said that himself. And he knows perfectly well -- we  all know it -- who started the war there. It was the regime in  Belgrade, with its expansionist desires and its intervention and  aggression against Bosnia. Thus, there are two foreign armies  in Bosnia. And on the other hand, there is a legal Bosnian  armed force in Bosnia itself. If Lord Owen and others think that  we are a helpless victim, it seems to be the case that we are  only accepted when we are helpless victims. But that will not  be true, because we will have to fight back.    That is why we are particularly angry at such comments.  Those people that are dying in Sarajevo, and there is heavy  shelling there, but also in Doboj, Tuzla, and Mostar. Lord Owen  does not even regard it as particularly worthy of mention to  discuss it. He discusses quite different things. Let me  summarize: Bosnia-Herzegovina was attacked by the Belgrade  regime and by Serb troops, and then by the Croat extremists.  And now they [Bosnia] are unfortunately being attacked by the  legal Croatian Army -- by the official Croatia, that is. Those  are the facts. They all know that, and nobody denies it.    The aggression against Bosnia was facilitated by the arms  embargo against Bosnia, against the legitimate Bosnian  Government. Now we are producing arms in order to fight, but it  looks as though they do not want to allow us to do so. And when  we fight back, then they call us the aggressors, in our own  country, on our own territory. And it looks as though some will  prefer to see a Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia  installed there at the expense of Bosnia. When we fight back,  well, then they are frustrated, because we should have  surrendered to them one year ago, but that is not going to  happen.    [Mueller-Blattau] Lord Owen even said the Muslims are only  striving for a military solution.    [Silajdzic] What he means is that the Muslims, or rather the  Bosnians -- he always prefers to call us Muslims for certain  reasons...    [Mueller-Blattau] For what reason?    [Silajdzic] The reason is to remind us what Islam means in  historical terms in Europe, we have our name, we are Bosnians.  But all this greatly surprises me. Are we allegedly supposed  to want a military solution? Are the victims without arms  really supposed to want a military solution? Isn't that a bit  too illogical? One should consider what lies behind those  words. It is as follows. We should have surrendered long ago.  We should have made it easy for the Serbs to set up a Greater  Serbia. That, at any rate, is what some governments in Europe  believe, and unfortunately one of the mediators also thinks,  from time to time, that we should have surrendered, that Greater  Serbia and Greater Croatia should be created, all at Bosnia's  expense and then we could all live together happily ever after  in large tribes.    The reality, however, is that so far 200,000 people have  been  killed, and that is forgotten by Lord Owen and his friends in  Europe. But we cannot forget and we will fight back. We must  be permitted to produce weapons, because thanks to people like  Lord Owen and others, there is an illegal and immoral arms  embargo against Bosnia.    [Mueller-Blattau] You criticize Lord Owen very strongly. Do  you believe he should give up his role as mediator?    [Silajdzic] Yes, after what he has said I think he should  retire.    [Mueller-Blattau] Why?    [Silajdzic] Exactly because by what he said he showed that  he  does not want a Bosnia to exist, it is a Greater Serbia that  must be installed.    [Mueller-Blattau] What do you expect from the United  Nations?    [Silajdzic] That it respect its own decisions.    [Mueller-Blattau] Meaning?    [Silajdzic] There are a great number of resolutions by the  UN  Security Council that are nothing but pieces of paper. The  United Nations is just like a piece of paper. If that is what  it wants to be, OK. But if it wants to be a world organization  that does something and does not just cover pieces of paper with  writing, then it is a different matter. More than 100 states in  the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of Bosnia.  No attention was paid to that. If the United Nations is only  there to help a few big rich countries when they need it,  alright. But I think that should be changed.    [Mueller-Blattau] Today I talked with a representative from  the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]. She says that  all three warring parties are blocking the UN aid convoys.    [Silajdzic] For us in Bosnia the most painful things are not  shells, the most painful things are lies. They come from two  sides; one side watches as shells fall on us and the other side  targets the shells at us. The point has been reached where the  credibility and morality, specifically of the European  governments and international organizations, are called into  question.    If 200,000 people die because of one aggressor, then these  dead can only be on one side and those they have killed on the  other. There is an attacker and there is a victim. They want to  forget that because they do not want to get involved. That is  the problem.    [Mueller-Blattau] Are there cases where your soldiers, your  troops, have been hindering the UN aid convoys?    [Silajdzic] I do not think so, because who needs it? The  Bosnian population is now being encircled, is living in ghettos,  mostly surrounded by Serb units. It is quite clear who needs  aid and who is hindering that aid. The international  organizations have to be precise. If you hear that again from  the UNHCR representative, ask for details. Who, for example, is  preventing the Danish troops from reaching Srebrenica? Who is  preventing Tuzla airport from being reopened? Who is preventing  the field hospital from being brought to Mostar? Ask her, and  then you will hear the answer.    The United Nations only ever talks about all three warring  parties. You know why? Because they do not want to get  involved. For them the 200,000 people, among them 14,000  children, are the same as those who killed them. That is  Europe, that is a disgrace. But that is European bureaucracy,  those are not people. That has to change because these people  are bringing us into difficulties, they are bringing the whole  of Europe into difficulties. These incompetent European  bureaucrats might just drive us into a third world war. I do  not know whether you realize that, but it is important for us  recognize this. This is about human lives, this is about our  future, the future of the region, the future of Europe, and  these incompetents must go. This is the time to tell them to go.    [Mueller-Blattau] You say they must go. What is to happen  after that?    [Silajdzic] The European Community should finally implement  the UN Security Council resolution, immediately.</p>

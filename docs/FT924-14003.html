			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / MMI in talks with Zurich Insurance HOPES of a solution to the difficulties of Municipal Mutual Insurance rose yesterday after an announcement that the stricken insurer is in talks with the Swiss company, Zurich Insurance. In a joint statement, the two companies said they were 'in talks to provide ongoing commercial insurance cover for local authorities'. No binding agreement has yet been reached, and the companies would not say whether Zurich was offering to assume MMI's existing insurance liabilities. MMI stopped underwriting new business late last month after earlier rescue talks with the Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Foncionnaires broke down. MMI has been faced with an escalation of claims on its public and employers' liability business. Its losses in 1991 amounted to more than Pounds 200m. Zurich, the third-biggest non-life insurer in Europe last year, has designated the UK as a strategically important market for expansion. Its existing Portsmouth-based subsidiary, which underwrites both life and general insurance business, had a 1.1 per cent share of the non-life market and ranked 20th in size in the general insurance market in 1990. Mr Dennis White, chief executive of Zurich's UK operations, said: 'There are still a number of issues, but subject to these being resolved we shall be able to offer insurance cover to local authorities on realistic terms before the year-end.' Zurich is also one of a number of companies discussing with MMI the provision of private car and home insurance for council employees and other MMI customers. Mr Brian Wright, group chief executive of MMI, said that if the plans were successful 'it would result in a large number of staff at Farnborough and in regional offices throughout the country continuing with their present jobs but as part of Zurich Insurance.' Local-authority associations offered a cautious welcome to the news but said they would 'need to be satisfied that existing contracts with MMI would be honoured in full'.</p>

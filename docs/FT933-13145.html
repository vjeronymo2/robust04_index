			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Inquiry casts cloud over Washington budget talks THE fate of President Bill Clinton's budget package has fallen under the shadow of a federal investigation into the finances of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House of Representatives' ways and means committee is the dominant budget negotiator. Mr Rostenkowski, a Chicago politician who has become one of Washington's premier deal-makers, has been the most prominent target of a probe that began with allegations of drug dealing over the counter of the House's private post office before turning its attention to charges of embezzlement by members of Congress. Mr Robert Rota, the former House postmaster, pleaded guilty on Monday to three misdemeanour charges of embezzlement and conspiracy, admitting he had aided and abetted two congressmen in wilfully and knowingly embezzling government money. While the two members are identified only as A and B, documents filed with the guilty plea show dates and amounts of vouchers submitted to the post office which match vouchers already in the public record from Mr Rostenkowski and Mr Joseph Kolter, a former congressman from Pennsylvania. Mr Ramsey Johnson, the US prosecutor handling the case, said Mr Rota's plea, made in exchange for an agreement to drop additional charges, 'will greatly aid our ability to resolve the allegations of corruption at the House post office'. Despite the two-year investigation, however, no charges have been filed against Mr Rostenkowski or Mr Kolter. Mr Rostenkowski made no comment yesterday but has in the past described the investigation, initiated by Mr Jay Stephens, a Republican appointee with political ambitions, as a 'fishing expedition and political witchhunt'. Mr Rostenkowski's importance as an ally in Mr Clinton's battle to win passage for the budget bill was underscored by the bill's mauling in the Senate. Where Mr Rostenkowski was able to win passage for a bill that closely resembled the original version proposed by Mr Clinton, Senate Democratic leaders were unable to rein in their oil state members, who gutted the legislation of its proposed energy tax. In negotiations to reconcile the different versions passed by the two chambers, which get under way in earnest this week, Mr Rostenkowski's role is expected to be critical. If indicted, however, he would be compelled by House Democratic rules to step aside as chairman of the ways and means committee - a prospect which terrifies members looking for a quick resolution of the budget battle.</p>

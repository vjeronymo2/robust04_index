			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> ARREST IN U.S. HERO'S DEATH  </P> <P> Philippine police have arrested a Communist rebel officer in connection with  the murder of U.S. Army Col. James N. Rowe last month, the U.S. military said.  It said Ricardo Prestosa was picked up at his home in Bataan province, 30 miles  east of Manila but that he denied any role in the killing. Authorities said  that Prestosa, 29, alleged chief of the Communist New People's Army's political  section in Bataan, was identified by police through a sketch of the attackers  made from witnesses' descriptions. Rowe, 51, a Vietnam War hero, was killed  when he was ambushed and shot by gunmen on his way to work April 21. The  Communists claimed responsibility, accusing Rowe of aiding an anti-insurgency  campaign.  </P></p>

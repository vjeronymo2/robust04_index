			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT AGREES TO DECIDE ON FLAG-BURNING LAW  </P> <P> The Supreme Court agreed today to decide the constitutionality of an anti-flag  burning law enacted by Congress last year and to issue a ruling before its  summer recess.  </P> <P> The court will hear the case on an emergency basis, a move that guarantees it  will be decided in plenty of time to become an issue in the fall congressional  elections.  </P> <P> The court's action, in two cases from Washington state and the District of  Columbia, was announced after the court's usual Friday conference. In a  three-paragraph order, the justices set arguments in the case for May 14, a  month after the court's regular session for oral arguments ends.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration had sought immediate review of the constitutionality of  the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which was passed in anger over a June, 1989,  Supreme Court ruling that burning the flag as a political protest is a  constitutionally protected form of free speech.  </P> <P> According to court officials, the last time the Supreme Court set such a rare  special session was in June, 1981, when the justices heard arguments testing  the legality of the Iran hostage deal.  </P> <P> The 5-4 ruling in a case from Texas sparked a controversy that saw President  Bush push for an amendment to the Constitution. Instead, Congress passed the  Flag Protection Act, although backers of the amendment warned a law would not  protect the flag.  </P></p>

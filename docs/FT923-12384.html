			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Settlement close in Pounds 1bn Channel tunnel row EUROTUNNEL and contractors building the Channel tunnel are close to settling their dispute over claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn, according to both sides. Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French contractors, had claimed Pounds 800m at 1985 prices to cover the increased cost of fitting out the rail tunnels and building passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent and Sangatte, northern France. Eurotunnel has disputed the size of the claim, which it says has still to be substantiated by TML. The gap between the two sides, however, is understood to have narrowed from about Pounds 350m to between Pounds 90m and Pounds 120m. One British contractor said last night: 'There are still important differences to be resolved, but the gap between us has narrowed considerably. Provided the talks continue to go well, we could have a settlement within weeks.' Negotiations which are continuing will also consider how the claim is to be paid. TML has said it would be prepared to accept a small part of the money it is owed in the form of Eurotunnel shares or some kind of equity-related instrument such as convertible loan stock. Eurotunnel and TML are under pressure to reach an agreement from international banks which are providing the bulk of the finance for the project. The banks have been required to grant a waiver permitting Eurotunnel to draw down further funds to allow construction to continue because Eurotunnel is in technical breach of loan covenants. The waiver is due to run out next month. The breach has been caused by the increased cost of the project - which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn - and lower revenues expected in the first year of operation because of a delay in receiving sufficient rolling stock to operate a full service. The opening date of the project has been put back from June next year to September or October. To achieve that, Eurotunnel will need the goodwill of contractors during final construction and commissioning. Contractors take the view that their strongest bargaining card will disappear once the project is operating and their co-operation is no longer required. In an attempt to maintain the pressure on Eurotunnel, TML has separately asked the independent disputes panel established under the terms of the contract to set a price for the installation work. Eurotunnel has appealed against an earlier ruling by the panel that trebled monthly progress payments to contractors to Pounds 75m.</p>

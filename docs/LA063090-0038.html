			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLAND;  </P> <P> POLICE USE FORCE TO END FARMER SIT-IN  </P> <P> About 200 uniformed police and riot troops used a sledgehammer to break into  the barred entrances of the Agriculture Ministry, clearing the building of  hundreds of farmers in the third day of a sit-in strike to protest low prices  for their crops. It was the first show of force by the Solidarity-led  government since it came to power last August.  </P> <P> After authorities entered the Ministry in central Warsaw about 7:30 p.m., the  majority of farmers went peacefully. A few put up a vigorous defense, many of  them weeping openly. Police said there were no arrests or injuries. Earlier,  the farmers were holding a top Cabinet member as a symbolic hostage. It was not  immediately known whether the minister was released.  </P></p>

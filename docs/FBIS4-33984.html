			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuba has termed 20 people's entry into the German  Embassy in Havana a provocation and an illegal act and carefully  planned and executed to coincide with the Mexican president's  arrival in Cuba and with the eve of the fourth Ibero-American  summit. Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has confirmed  for PRENSA LATINA that 17 men and three women illegally entered  the Embassy by ramming a truck with Camaguey Province license  plates into the Embassy's metal garage door.    This took place early on 13 June. German Ambassador Georg  Trefftz reported the incident to Cuban authorities a few minutes  later, summoning Foreign Ministry officials. Luis Garcia  Peralta, deputy director of the Europe Directorate, [name and  title as heard] showed up to represent the Cuban Foreign  Ministry. The ambassador told him that the people occupying the  Embassy refused to leave, even though he himself had asked them  to leave immediately. Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso  reiterated the well-known Cuban position of not approving the  violation of a diplomatic mission accredited to Cuba as a means  to supersede normal procedures to travel abroad.</p>

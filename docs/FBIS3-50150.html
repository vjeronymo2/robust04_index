			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Martin </F> Danes; place and date not given: "We Will Be a Member of NATO in  a Few Years"]    [Text] In the wake of President Clinton's visit to Prague,  we interviewed Foreign Minister Zieleniec on the Partnership for  Peace and the Czech Republic's future security situation.    [Danes] What is your assessment, a week later, of the visit  to Prague by the U.S. President and of the Partnership for Peace  plan?    [Zieleniec] I think that President Clinton's visit was  important not only for us and for designing the new security  architecture in Europe but, from a certain point of view, also  for the United States. The very fact that the visit took place  and that President Clinton chose Prague as one of the places to  hold talks during his first visit to Europe was also significant  for us. This is recognition of what we are doing, recognition of  the success of our reforms, and is a manifestation of the  friendly relations between the United States and our country.    In my opinion, this visit was also important for the United  States. U.S. foreign policy has been seeking a specific form  ever since President Clinton came into office. It has often had  to endure harsh accusations from European politicians and media  that the country is again seeking isolation, that it is becoming  wrapped up in itself, or that it is reorienting itself toward  Asia. At the same time, it is obvious that, from the security  point of view, Europe was, is, and will be for a long time a key  continent. Clinton's European visit, the way it was planned, and  its results prove that Europe remains a central feature of U.S.  security policy.    The visit was also important for us because it acted as a  major stimulus in the debate on expanding the Western security  system. It demonstrated that the anxiety about the West's  reluctance and inability to gradually fill the security vacuum  in Central Europe was unfounded. The Partnership for Peace plan  originally offered, in principle, only joint exercises and the  possibility of other military activities with NATO. What the  NATO summit in Brussels finally approved and President Clinton  outlined in Prague is much more. The plan now contains a serious  offer of political cooperation.    [Danes] What does this offer of political cooperation  consist  of?    [Zieleniec] The approved document contains a relatively  detailed definition of the political values on which Partnership  for Peace is based. This is important because the North Atlantic  Alliance defends the West European, if you like, Western  Christian, system of values--freedom, democracy... So as not to  use any high-flown words, it defends our way of life. This  specification is also the basis for future differentiation  between the individual partner states. If the Partnership for  Peace is established explicitly on this value basis, a basis  that also serves as a criterion for the success of the bilateral  agreements, I have no doubt that it will lead to our country's  membership in the Alliance. Since the beginning, Czech diplomacy  has been striving actively to ensure that, for these practical  reasons, the plan attained a substantial political dimension.  The fact that this has happened is undoubtedly a result of this  endeavor.    Moreover, during his visit to Prague, President Clinton put  forward other specific projects in support of the new European  democracies, projects that should intensify the ties between our  republic, the other Central European countries, and NATO  countries. It is apparent from all of this that the Partnership  offer is not a decoy or a blind alley but is a real step  forward--a step that, at the same time, also relates to Russia  and presents alternatives in the event of unfavorable security  developments in our region.    [Danes] Did you get, for instance, an indirect promise from  the U.S. President of involvement in our security, and were  specific dates mentioned in this regard?    [Zieleniec] No promise of specific involvement was made, and  no dates were mentioned, but I do not think this is what is  important here. The visit by the U.S. President and the talks as  a whole mean that they are taking us into consideration.  Moreover, President Clinton said very decidedly that the  security of the Czech Republic is important for the security of  the United States.    I would also like to refer to the reverse aspect of this  issue, an aspect that is often overlooked. If we feel like a  future NATO member--and I believe justifiably so--we should  think about it within the scope of its future efficiency. That  is, one day the Alliance will also guarantee our state's  security. I admit, therefore, that, in reply to a question of  whether NATO should be opened up immediately to all the  countries of East Europe, I personally do not come up with the  answer as easily as some Czech journalists. Perhaps it would be  worth thinking about this, about whether it would be better to  wait a while--as far as our entry into NATO is concerned, of  course--with the aim of maintaining the Western alliance's  efficiency. The immediate incorporation of inconstant Eastern  states, many of which do not yet have a deep-rooted system of  Western values and are economically and politically unstable,  into the Alliance could seriously impair its defensive strength.  No such considerations are ever published in the Czech press.    [Danes] How distant does the prospect of signing a  bilateral treaty with NATO within the framework of Partnership  for Peace seem to you? When, thereafter, will we join NATO?    [Zieleniec] I generally estimate our entry into NATO within  a  few years; the entire process, however, is to a considerable  extent associated with the development of the security situation  in Europe and throughout Eurasia. As far as signing our  bilateral agreement with NATO within the framework of  Partnership for Peace is concerned, I think this is a matter of  a few months. The government has to discuss the NATO offer  formally and submit its proposal to the NATO secretary general.  The Alliance will then submit its proposal on the basis of this.  These two proposals create the bedrock for treaty-based  relations. The government must also consider how much money we  want to spend on this.    [Danes] According to the decision made in Brussels, the size  of the financial investment each country is willing to make in  the Partnership for Peace will also influence the extent of its  cooperation with NATO. How much money will our government  earmark for this plan?    [Zieleniec] I will intentionally not answer the question of  "how much." The issue does not only involve money as such. Our  participation in the plan must reflect our willingness to take  part in the activities of the NATO countries and our  coresponsibility for defending the region of democracy. This is  an important matter (it is possible to declare anything  verbally), but we recognize real will according to the  willingness to make sacrifices. On a specific level, this means  conducting an analysis of the costs and comparing them with the  possibilities. Inasmuch as we have not used up our military  budget, we will draw the money, first and foremost, from it, and  perhaps we will also add something from other sources.    [Danes] Prague has shown a more enthusiastic attitude toward  the Partnership for Peace than the other Visegrad Four  countries. Is this because our prospects for exchanging the  partnership for membership are greater than the prospects of the  other countries?    [Zieleniec] I want to speak not about prospects but, rather,  about a real estimate of the situation. Of all of the Visegrad  countries, we had the most unequivocal policy toward NATO. The  aim of joining the North Atlantic Alliance was expressed, if not  immediately, then relatively soon after the revolution--as an  element of the state's political orientation, of course. It  would be hard to find such unequivocalness in the policy of  other countries. In some places, I observe a chopping and  changing--from rejecting NATO and seeking salvation in the CSCE  to joining NATO immediately.    [Danes] I cannot completely agree with you on the issue of  the unequivocalness of our stance. Your predecessor, Mr.  Dienstbier, preferred, in contrast to you, a concept for  creating a single Eurasian security zone and organizations like  the CSCE....    [Zieleniec] Our stance has been stable since 1992, at least,  when we won the election. Of course, the Civic Democratic Party  had an unequivocal stance on this issue before the elections; it  has had one virtually since its establishment.    The Czech approach of steady orientation toward NATO was  eventually accepted as the most practical one during the Prague  summit. This does not mean that I could not imagine a better  option, for example, with a specific entry date and so on. Of  course, when there is more than one partner, not all of them can  ever be 100-percent satisfied with the result. If I gauge  development in the Partnership for Peace plan from the point of  view of the potential for influencing its final shape, we have  achieved above-average results.    [Danes] A meeting of the Visegrad countries' defense  ministers, which our Minister Baudys refused to attend, was held  in Warsaw just before the summit. Polish representatives, in  particular President Walesa, then accused the Czech Government,  which was rejecting military cooperation within the framework of  the Four, of shortsightedness and egoism. The West still views  these countries as a single geopolitical zone. Are you not  concerned that the West may interpret our veto on military and  political coordination within the Four as a destabilizing factor  in the region?    [Zieleniec] We have to confront absolutely this evaluation  of  the situation. I would consider the "all or nothing" stance of  some countries to be more dangerous for stability in the region.  It is difficult for more than two partners to agree upon the  "all or nothing" principle. For multilateral cooperation, it is  always essential to define the areas in which all of the  participants will agree.    The Prague summit, however, also contributed to clarifying  this issue. It is necessary to deal with security cooperation on  a bilateral basis--that is, each country with the North Atlantic  Alliance separately--on account of the very nature of this  cooperation and to prevent the creation of alternative blocs.  The Czech Republic cannot accept such a risk.    [Danes] Are you aware of any attempts to create an  alternative military bloc?    [Zieleniec] The way things are in policy, if you take the  first step, logic will push everything forward. The example of  Visegrad is typical of this. You can see how much passion our  decision to exempt one aspect from it is arousing in such a  loose association--in fact, a symbolic association. I agree that  integration with the North Atlantic Alliance is in our common  interest, but, if we look farther to the East, our ties and  those of Poland with the East are not the same. This is because  our geopolitical situation is different.    I think that we would be making a bad job of defending our  interests if our security interests were exactly the same as the  security interests of all of the countries in the region.  Incidentally, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher left his  colleagues from the Visegrad countries in no doubt about the  importance of regional cooperation, but cooperation in the  security sphere must consist, first and foremost, of bilateral  ties between these states and NATO. This point of view was also  expressed in the speech delivered in Prague by President  Clinton. It is essential within the framework of Visegrad to  execute regional cooperation by carrying out specific deeds, for  example, in the trade and economic spheres, and not just hold  ostentatious summit meetings at which the perfidy of the West is  cursed.    This is not our policy. We are transforming our state so  that  it becomes a typical element of the West. This cannot be  replaced by the "banging on the doors" kind of behavior. It is  not true that, if four fists bang on NATO's doors together it is  more effective than one fist. We are not banging on doors. We  are orienting ourselves toward the West definitively and  straightforwardly.</p>

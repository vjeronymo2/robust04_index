			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: FT assumes a comic outlook Sir, The battle of words reported by Observer ('Top of the pops', September 24) reminded me of my years in solitary confinement in Iran when there was all the time in the world for anagrams. I discovered to my dismay that the FT was 'semi-infantile chat'. Roger Cooper, Wardington House, Nr Banbury, Oxon OX17 1SD</p>

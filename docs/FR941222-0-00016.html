			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is not exposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to external water. Laboratory experiments have indicated a general corrosion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate of less than 0.00001 inches per year for similar stainless steels. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC believes these experiments more accurately bound DSC corrosion than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiences in unrelated industries. For the 50-year design life of the DSC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expected corrosion would therefore not result in exceeding a corrosion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depth of 0.0005 inches. This will not affect the DSC performing its intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety functions. Because of the low corrosion rates expected for stainless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steel, periodic inspections for deterioration of the DSC are not considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. Therefore, inspections are not required. The support rails for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DSC have an extremely hard-alloy steel applied to the sliding surface, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground to a smooth finish, and are coated with a dry film lubricant to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion and to reduce the coefficient of friction. Furthermore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment inside the HSM is protected from rain and it is kept dry by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat load from the DSC. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that corrosion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the stainless steel and the hard alloy steel surface of the support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rail will occur to any significant extent. These conclusions and analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the very small likelihood of corrosion indicate that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable assurance that the DSC can be removed from the HSM when required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter questioned whether the screens between the casks, which are essential to cooling, will remain clear of debris and how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they can be cleaned if they become partially clogged. Another commenter was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned about how the roof screen was inspected, stating that it seems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely that insects, animals, and birds will be attracted to the warm air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coming from the outlet vents. Several commenters remained concerned about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vent blockage that can completely cover and block screening and vents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly from insects such as paper wasps, that build huge nests, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> swarms of midges that are common to the Great Lakes. How are the screens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attached?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated in the Certificate of Compliance, a licensee using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standardized NUHOMS must conduct a daily visual surveillance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exterior of air inlets and outlets (front wall and roof bird screen). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the licensee must perform a daily close-up inspection to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no material accumulates between the modules to block the air flow. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance shows blockage of air vents, the licensee is required to clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vent blockage by following procedures developed by each user of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS. If the screen is damaged, the licensee must replace the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screen. The required daily surveillance and temperature measurements should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily detect blockage of the vents or screens by insects, animals, or birds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a timely manner, leading to the removal of the obstruction before damage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs from high temperatures. The bird screen is made of stainless steel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wire cloth tack-welded to stainless steel strips, which are attached to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HSM with stainless steel wedge anchors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter expressed concern about the presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burrowing and other nuisance animals that have posed problems at other waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Burrowing and other nuisance animals are not expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pose problems for the Standardized NUHOMS. Because of the robust system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design, animals will not be able to get to the radioactive material or cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage such that water could cause movement of the radioactive material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Burrowing under the concrete pad would not cause damage to safety-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components. Further, large-scale burrowing would likely be detected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily surveillance or other activities related to the operation of the storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted additional radiation monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the calculated higher dose rates over previous NUHOMS designs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter stated that these higher dose rates are not consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective of maintaining occupational exposures ALARA, and that site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications should provide detailed procedures and plans to meet ALARA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines and 10 CFR Part 20 requirements with respect to operation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No additional radiation monitoring has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically identified or required for the Standardized NUHOMS. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Parts 20, 50, and 72 require that licensees comply with ALARA. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, 10 CFR 72.212(b)(6) requires each licensee to review its radiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection program to determine that their effectiveness is not decreased by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the Standardized NUHOMS. Further, 10 CFR 72.212 (b)(9) requires each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee to conduct storage activities in accordance with appropriate written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. If the results of these licensee activities indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional procedures are required then the licensee is required to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter was concerned about the optical survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment used to align the transfer cask with the HSM before transfer. What  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks are made on this optical equipment and what regulations apply?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The optical equipment used to align the transfer cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the HSM is optional and is an operational convenience. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee must meet Technical Specifications 1.2.9 in the Certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance. Therefore, only appropriate calibrations or checks to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with this technical specification are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

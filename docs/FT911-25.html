			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Two Venezuelan airlines register losses THE TWO state-owned Venezuelan airlines due to be privatised this year suffered financial losses in 1990, according to figures published by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. Viasa, the government's international flag-carrier, lost USDollars 34m in 1990 on overall revenues of Dollars 268m, compared with Dollars 4.6m profit in 1989 on revenues of Dollars 266.7m. Another state-owned airline, Aeropostal, which flies domestic and international routes, suffered a 1990 loss of Dollars 7.3m on revenues of Dollars 82.1m. In 1989, Aeropostal reported net earnings of Dollars 2.8m on revenues which totalled Dollars 68.8m. (Dollar figures were calculated using free-market exchange rates for the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of each year.) The government of President Carlos Andres Perez is keen to privatise Viasa and Aeropostal this year to demonstrate that its slow-moving privatisation programme is finally getting off the ground. Since the government took office over two years ago, it has privatised only two commercial banks from a long list of companies it plans to sell off.</p>

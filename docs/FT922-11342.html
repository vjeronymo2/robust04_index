			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Sillars condemns '90-minute patriots' MR JIM SILLARS, deputy leader of the Scottish National party and a leading campaigner for Scottish independence, has said that he now doubts whether Scots have the 'character and ability' to face up to the responsibility of making their country independent. Mr Sillars, who lost his Glasgow Govan seat to Labour in the general election, said in an interview on Scottish Television that Scotland had too many '90-minute patriots' whose national outpourings were confined to big sporting events. The strength of popular demand for a referendum will be tested tomorrow when Scotland United, the newly formed grouping of all non-Conservative parties, holds a rally in Glasgow.</p>

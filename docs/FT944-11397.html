			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Strike changes news habits in San Francisco San Franciscans are getting a taste of the future - at least the future as predicted by those who believe that the daily newspaper is dying. Last Tuesday night, 2,600 workers at San Francisco's two leading newspapers, the morning Chronicle and the afternoon Examiner, went on strike. Most of their more than 600,000 daily subscribers have been without their daily fill of a local newspaper. There is no shortage of news. Local radio and TV stations have taken up the cause by expanding their regular news coverage. Striking journalists have made guest appearances on the airwaves to talk about the subjects they normally write about. Not to be outdone, the management of the Chronicle and Examiner accelerated plans to create an on-line news service this week. The Gate, which combines stories from both papers, was to have been introduced on the Internet, the computer network, later this month. Instead, it made its debut last week. The strike is a classic labour dispute about pay, working conditions and job security. It comes after the newspaper's unionised employees have worked for a year without contracts. The Chronicle and Examiner, although separately owned, are both printed and distributed by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency. The bosses want to streamline distribution, eliminating 150 drivers and hundreds of 'youth carriers', the boys and girls who hurl newspapers on to driveways in their neighbourhoods each day. Employees object to the cuts and are fighting for a pay rise bigger than the 3.5 per cent increase on offer. Privately, they say that the strike has been precipitated by fears of 'union busting'. Resorting to radio is one way around the strike but, as Mr Herb Caen, the renowned SF Chronicle columnist puts it, the feeling 'isn't the same'. 'You can't re-read it once, to try to get the meaning, or twice, to look for typos (and) mistakes. . . In short, it isn't as much fun.' Mr Caen's column appeared in the San Francisco Free Press, a newspaper cobbled together by striking journalists using borrowed computers and telephones. A hundred thousand copies of the Free Press were distributed on Friday, the newspaper unions claim. While distribution of the Free Press was limited, several thousand more readers picked it up via their computers on the Internet. Media Futures, Page 15</p>

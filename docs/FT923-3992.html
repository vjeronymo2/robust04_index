			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Better margins boost Adscene to Pounds 1.61m Improved margins enabled Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, to show annual pre-tax profits more than doubled on decreased turnover. For the year to May 31 profits increased from last year's depressed Pounds 705,000 to Pounds 1.61m. Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 15m (Pounds 16.9m). A proposed final dividend of 2.5p returns the total to the 4p paid in the year to May 1990 and doubles the 2p paid last year. Earnings per share were 8.5p (3.6p). Gearing had been reduced to 32 per cent (59 per cent) enabling net interest costs to be cut to Pounds 481,000 (Pounds 774,000). Mr Harry Lambert, chairman and chief executive, said that publishing margins had improved from 7.1 per cent to 12.9 per cent helping that division almost double profits. Printing margins were maintained although there was a 26 per cent fall in turnover. On the present year he said there was no sign of a return of consumer confidence but total advertising revenue in the first quarter had stayed at the same level as the previous year.</p>

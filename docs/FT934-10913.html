			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Observer: Shopaholics? Japanese salarymen, believed to beat world records for workaholicism, may soon be legislated into relaxing more often. Some members of the new Japanese government think that too much work could be a source of economic as well as personal exhaustion. So ministers agreed yesterday to study proposals by Koshiro Ishida, a cabinet member heading the management and co-ordination agency, to change the dates of national holidays to Mondays or Fridays. The aim is to encourage people to take long weekends more often, so that they spend more money - badly needed in the recession - and 'enrich their lifestyles', Ishida says. Japanese staff would never dream of using even a mid-week public holiday as an excuse for an extra long weekend. Hence the need for government action. However, do not expect any progress today. This is culture day, when people are encouraged to refresh their spirits with a good dose of art. But be sure all will be back to work on Thursday.</p>

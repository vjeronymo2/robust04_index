			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sharp setback at the close of a quiet session - Market Report The holiday closure yesterday of markets in Germany and France left London to bear the brunt of a setback in global bond prices following comments from the president of the Bundesbank. Herr Tietmeyer's comment that the Bundesbank was not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the time being brought sharp falls in UK gilts, US Federal bonds and German bunds as inflation fears resurfaced in fixed interest markets. UK stocks, which had been no more than mildly easier at mid-afternoon, fell sharply after New York opened, bringing the FT-SE 100 Share Index at one time to within 6.4 points of the 3,100 mark from which the London market has been struggling to escape for the past six weeks. The final reading on the FT-SE Index of 3,108.4 showed a fall on the day of 18.9. The Footsie stock index future quickly fell below 3,100, showing a discount to the underlying stock market. Traders hastened to point out that, in the absence of the leading European markets, London stocks had been only lightly traded and that prices for many leading stocks had been barely tested. Bond prices will face a more significant test this morning when German markets re-open and brace themselves for both this week's money market repo auctions and M3 money supply figures. However, it was clear yesterday afternoon that UK stocks remained highly vulnerable to developments in bond markets, especially in the US Federal bond sector. With gilts easier from the opening of trading, share prices had slipped from a firm start to show a 6 point loss on the Footsie. But trading volume was slow and it was left to individual company situations to provide the highlights. News of a modest reduction in Britain's non-EC trade deficit helped bond and share prices to steady briefly. In spite of a modest increase in business following Herr Tietmeyer, the day's Seaq total of 417.1m shares was around 40 per cent down on the day. Friday's 708.2m shares were worth Pounds 1.38bn in retail business. As usual, the late-afternoon downturn was led from the futures markets, and the broader markets were to some extent left behind. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed only 5.3 off at 3,709.3 having moved only narrowly throughout the trading session. Among the international stocks, Eurotunnel units weakened as the market sensed that some institutions were calling for a unusually large discount on the Pounds 850m rights issue widely expected later this week. Unexpectedly good trading figures helped British Airways, although enthusiasm was restrained by uncertainty over the prospects for Airway's Dollars 400m investment in USAir. The renewed concern over inflationary pressures on interest rate policies was discouraging for many consumer stocks, and the mood was not helped by a trading report from Ladbroke, the hotels and casino group. Breweries and food manufacturing shares gave ground and some building and construction stocks, with fortunes closely tied to interest rate prospects, also turned lower, albeit in very thin trading. This week, the second of an extended three week trading account in UK equities, brings a batch of trading reports from leading British companies which will be scanned for evidence of the progress of the domestic economy.</p>

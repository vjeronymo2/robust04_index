			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By KHOVAR news agency correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe March 11 TASS -- The procurator's office of  Tajikistan on Friday circulated a statement about the atrocious  assassination of the republic's vice-premier Moyonsho  Nazarshoyev.    The statement points out that the assassination was  "committed in the Tajik capital by two members of an anti-state  criminal gang headed by Mullo Kasym."    The assassins fled from the scene of the crime. On their way  they stopped an oncoming VAZ-469 car being driven by a  policeman. The criminals seized the policeman's gun and  inflicted gunshot wounds on him. Later on the criminals  attacked a food-laden truck, brutally beat its driver and rode  the vehicle in the direction of Semiganch village of Kofarnikhon  District.    The law enforcement agencies of Tajikistan brought it to the  notice of the general public that Said Abdullah Nuri, leader of  a self-proclaimed "government-in-exile," who is now in  Afghanistan, had urged individual groups, who avoid prosecution  for particularly grave crimes against their state to put  vigorous pressure on the Tajik Government in order to  destabilise the socio-political situation in the republic and  fan up ethnic strife by using measures of intimidation, terror  and physical removal of persons unwelcome to the opposition,  particulary democratic-minded people and to work out plans for  armed actions and other acts of sabotage.    The Tajikistan prosecutor-general's office has instituted  criminal proceedings against the assassins of the vice-premier.  A manhunt for the assassins was launched.</p>

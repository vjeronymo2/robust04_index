			<p>BFN     [Text] Militias of Golboddin and Dostam killed a number of  each others men in Kabul as a result of differences on dividing  up looted goods. Reports received by Bakhtar Information Agency  say the clashes have mainly occurred between the militias of  Golboddin and Dostam for the looted goods of Kabul residents.  As many as three Dostam's militia have been taken prisoner by  Golboddin's militia, and the prisoners were later killed.  According to another report, in the course of clashes between  Haji Zarif's men--who are associated with Golboddin's  militia--and Dostam's militia, 19 Dostam militiamen were killed  and three Golboddin militiamen were badly injured. Another  report says that some days ago a cousin of Zardad, a commander  of Golboddin's militia, was captured by Dostam's militia, and in  retaliation, Golboddin's militia killed Sofi Karim, a Dostam  militia ringleader, in Karta-e Naw area. Reports say the motive  of the clashes between the militias of Golboddin and Dostam have  been the dividing up of looted goods and the sale of weapons;  this has increased their previous differences.</p>

Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt was accompanied by Lt. Gen. Maung Thint,  minister of progress of border areas and national races and  development affairs; Lt. Gen. Kyaw Min, minister of mines; Vice  Admiral Than Nyunt, minister of health; Brigadier General Myo  Thant, minister of information; Colonel Pe Thein, minister of  education; U Soe Tha, minister of communications, post, and  telegraph; responsible officials from the Office of the SLORC;  directors general and managing directors from departments  concerned; and other responsible officials. [passage omitted]    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt and his entourage proceeded to the  Northern Military Command headquarters where they were welcomed  by Kachin national leaders. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, SLORC  secretary-1; and Major General Saw Lwin, chairman of Kachin  State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the  Northern Command, then held a separate meeting with the KIO  [Kachin Independence Organization] leaders -- U Mali Zut Zaw  Mai, U Lamon Tu Jai, U Gori Zaw Saing --and intermediaries -- U  Lawan, U Sabwegyun, and U Khun Myat in the office of the  commander. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Khin Nyunt] Today can be described as an  auspicious day for the Union of Myanmar [Burma], for the entire  national people, for Kachin State, and for the indigenous people  residing in Kachin State. I describe today as auspicious  because the peace talks between our SLORC delegation and the KIO  delegation have reached a successful conclusion [nyein-chan-ye  sway-ne-hmu aungmyinhmu ya de achay-ahne myo yauk te atwet].    This is attributed to our mutual consultations and talks  following the state's goodwill invitation to the armed  organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold. The  KIO held honest and sincere talks after realizing the genuine  goodwill of the state. Following these talks, our two sides  reached an understanding and we were able to realize peace as a  result. [end recording]    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that since Myanmar's  independence 40 years ago, there has been armed conflict with  the KIO for over 30 years due to differences of views. However,  conditions have changed under the SLORC administration. He said  there can be a problem in a family due to differences of opinion  among the family members, but such a problem is only temporary  and they are not antagonisms which last for a lifetime.       He said it is our conviction that the time has come for  indigenous people to reunite and reconcile. Therefore, the  SLORC has invited the indigenous armed organizations to return  to the legal fold. He said the two sides have reached  agreements and achieved peace because the KIO, which welcomed  the government's invitation, has held honest and sincere talks  with mutual understanding.    [Begin Khin Nyunt recording] We have reached this stage.  So, what do we do for the next stage? We must work for  progress and development of the Kachin State and the ministers  and senior departmental heads have come along with me to do this  work. We will work for the progress and development of Kachin  State with these persons.    I estimate that Kachin State has lagged behind in  development  for over 20 years. We will all work in unison with momentum and  cooperate in order to make up for the backwardness. The  government will provide assistance and the indigenous people  residing in the Kachin State as well as the KIO must cooperate.  I dare say that if the three sides cooperate and work in  unison, the development of Kachin State, which has lagged  behind, will accelerate. [end recording]    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that in setting  priorities for development projects, priority will first be  given to construction of roads and bridges, opening of hospitals  and clinics under the health sector and schools under the  education sector, and promotion of appropriate technology and  crops which are suitable to local conditions under the  agriculture and livestock breeding sector. He said there is  plenty of land suitable for forestry and cultivation of crops in  Kachin State, but land has not been cultivated due to armed  conflict. If these lands are reclaimed and put under  cultivation, the economy of the state will develop at an  accelerated rate.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that endeavors for national  development schemes and national unity during the SLORC  administration of over five years are known to all. Endeavors  are being made with the objective of developing Myanmar into a  modern and developed nation on one hand, while efforts are being  made for the emergence of a firm constitution while upholding  the three cardinal causes -- nondisintegration of the union,  nondisintegration of national unity, and perpetuation of  national sovereignty. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that  priority is being given to border region development with a view  to promoting unity among national people while drug eradication  is also carried out. At the same time, he explained, the state  has been working for peace with genuine goodwill by inviting the  armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold.    He said mutual understanding has been reached with the KIO  today and that outstanding success has been achieved and he  attributed the success to the mutual goodwill and sincere  efforts of the state government and the KIO. He said he  believed that peace could certainly be achieved if the remaining  Karen, Mon, and Karenni armed organizations in the jungles hold  frank, cordial, and sincere talks with the state government with  genuine goodwill.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that the KIO will have to continue  to work in order to participate legally in the process of  emerging a firm constitution. He said once there is a  constitution, Kachin State will be led by Kachin nationals and  other states will be led by their nationals concerned. In order  to have such leadership, it is necessary for all nationals to  participate in working for a firm constitution.    Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the National  Convention has obtained 104 basic principles on which such a  firm constitution should be based and that panel discussions are  being held to discuss details of the basic principles relating  to each chapter. Once the discussions are completed, [the  reports] will be submitted to a plenary session of the National  Convention. Details relating to the 104 basic principles such as  the chapter heading on the state, state structure, and head of  state are currently under discussion. He said the KIO needs to  observe the National Convention.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said the ministers and departmental  heads  in his entourage have prepared for the development of Kachin  State. He disclosed that the Ministry of Progress of Border  Areas and National Races and Development Affairs has allocated  over kyat 20 million for building Myitkyina-Tanai-Nanyun Road,  Mogaung-Kamaing-Longin Road, Hopin-Kontha-Nyaungbin Road and  that electric generators, motor vehicles, and assistance have  been collected for distribution. He said priority will be given  to agriculture in working to develop Kachin State and the state  will provide technology, machinery, seeds, and fertilizers in  the areas where the state wants the KIO to give priority. If  the peasants work hard the development of Kachin State, which  has fertile lands, will accelerate. He said the state will set  up economic enterprises which are viable. He explained that as  Kachin State becomes peaceful and prosperous, travel throughout  the state will become possible and international tourism will  develop. He said international tourists will be interested in  Indawgyi region and confluence point [of Irrawaddy River] and if  these areas are made attactive, the development will take place  in a short time.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that if the people of Kachin State  endeavor and work together in unity, and if the KIO cooperates  in areas where it is able, then Kachin State will certainly  develop.    In conclusion, he said, the SLORC is striving with genuine  goodwill to reestablish solidarity among the national peoples,  ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, prevent any  loss of national independence, and strive toward the emergence  of a modern and developed nation. He said now that the KIO has  joined hands with the SLORC in these endeavors, there will be  greater momentum in our work. He said he could see that the  Union of Myanmar will emerge as a modern and developed nation in  the near future if the remaining indigenous armed organizations  come to realize the genuine goodwill of the national government,  as the KIO has, and work hand in hand with honesty and  sincerity. Therefore, he said, the time has now come for the  national peoples and indigenous armed organizations to join  hands with the state government with genuine goodwill, the  correct attitude, and honesty.    Next, Kachin national leader U Zaw Mai [KIO deputy chairman]  delivered a speech. He said the KIO took up arms and went  underground in the jungle in 1960-61 when its demands for the  rights the Kachins lost prior to 1962 and during the era of the  AFPFL [Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League] government were  rejected. He said there was a plan to establish a separate state  at that time. After much political experience, however, we  conducted a review to determine whether our policy was correct.  We then adopted a policy of not seceding from the union. But  there are still groups that have not accepted this decision.  They are observing the situation. They will gradually develop  faith in the government when they witness the success of  projects carried out with genuine goodwill by the state  government.    [Begin Zaw Mai recording] What kind of goodwill does the  SLORC government currently have toward the country? We will  observe whether these are only words or if they are carried out  in practice. I have studied the state leaders' speeches in  detail. I have also studied the radio and newspapers as well as  the (?personalities). Only after four or five years, the SLORC  government's goodwill toward the national peoples and the  nation. [sentence as heard] Of course, there is one thing: The  SLORC government is human; we are all human. We cannot say  everything done by humans is correct and complete.    Then there was the state government's invitation to the  armed  organizations in the jungles to come out and hold talks. They  went to the extent of saying that if we did not like it we could  go back and continue to fight. At first, I thought they could  possibly be correct. U Bran Seng, our chairman, submitted it to  the Central Committee, and it was discussed thoroughly at the  central level. We deliberated whether the time had come to make  peace; whether it was supported by the people. The government  side welcomed it, but what was the people's view? We  deliberated for two years, considering what our views were  toward the present government. We sent people throughout Kachin  State. We sent them everywhere -- Putao, (Hopet), Tanai,  Mogaung, Mohnyin, Bhamo, Shwegu, and the Kachin region in  Northern Shan State -- and asked for the people's views. We did  not ask everyone. We asked people who had political knowledge or  were interested in politics. These people included veteran  politicians, former senior public servants, and educated people.  The general view was that the situation was good, and we were  urged to try. We were advised to watch what they were doing,  and if it did not work to go back to the jungle, as allowed by  the Myanmar Government side. We were urged to try, and our  Central Committee took the matter under consideration.    After that, our Central Committee adopted a policy that  said:  Do not promise what you cannot fulfill, but once a promise is  made follow through; that is, do not go back on your word. Once  we decided to undertake something, we must implement it  accurately. Once we decided to undertake something, we must  adopt a policy -- a plan -- on how to proceed from one step to  another. We must set a goal. We adopted a policy of  participating in some capacity in an endeavor to obtain genuine  peace and establish a new nation. It is believed that a  peaceful and prosperous Kachin State will contribute to the  union. We decided to begin in accordance with this policy. Now  it has been over a year since we began the peace talks with the  government. The government and our intermediaries -- three  people -- patiently initiated this work. That is why, at this  moment, I would like to say that I will work for the peace and  prosperity of the entire Kachin State as well as the peace and  prosperity of the entire union. [end recording]    Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman of the Kachin  State Law and Order Restoration Council, then explained about  the renovation and construction of roads and bridges in Kachin  State. After his explanation, the secretary-1 presented gifts  to the Kachin national leaders and took a group photograph with  them.    The State Law and Order Restoration Council, with a view to  reestablishing national unity and building peace, held sincere  and frank talks with the KIO delegation that were marked by  perseverance and mutual effort. The two sides held five rounds  of talks in 1993 in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State.  Understandings and agreements on a cease-fire were reached on  the morning of 23 February 1994 [apyit-akhat yat-saing-ye  saing-yar nar le thabawtunhyi-hmu-myar ko].    In the evening, Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, commander and chairman  of  the Kachin State Law and Order Restoration Council, hosted a  dinner at the Malihka Mansion in honor of the secretary-1,  ministers, and national leaders.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 17 Jan, CANA -- St  Kitts-Nevis Prime Minister Dr Kennedy Simmonds has reiterated  that his minority coalition government will not resign in  response to opposition pressure to make way for fresh elections.    Speaking Sunday at a special convention of his ruling  People's Action Movement (PAM) which forms the government with  the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP), Simmonds said his  administration would continue to promote economic development to  make the twin island state a land of opportunity for all  citizens.    General elections last November 29 produced no clear winner  but PAM which won four seats -- the same number as the main  opposition St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party -- teamed up again with  the NRP which won one seat to form the government for a fourth  consecutive time.    The Labour Party, which polled a higher percentage of votes  than both partners in the coalition government, says PAM and NRP  have no moral authority to govern and is continuing a campaign  to force fresh elections.    Simmonds told PAM supporters his government was  "constitutionally, morally and properly constituted" to run the  affairs of St Kitts-Nevis.    "The opposition has the right to move a vote of no  confidence  in the National Assembly or demonstrate peacefully if they wish,  but order must be maintained and the laws of the land will be  respected," he added.    For a no confidence vote to succeed, Labour would need the  support of the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens Movement which won  two seats in the November 29 poll, but turned down approaches  from both PAM and NRP to form a coalition government.    Simmonds said PAM was formed to unite the nation and erase  what he said were the memories of victimization and suppression  by the Labour Party when it was in government, especially  against the people of Nevis.    He said his government would not be intimidated by threats  of  violence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has decided not to grant seats in the  Congress by decree to former guerrillas because of differences  among the political currents in how they are divided. The  executive branch believes such an important decision, from a  political and legal standpoint, can only be made if there is a  certain degree of consensus among the possible beneficiaries:  M-19 [19 April Movement], EPL [Popular Liberation Army], PRT  [Revolutionary Workers Party], and Quintin Lame Commando Unit.    Government Minister Fabio Villegas explained that because of  this situation, the government cannot accept a Senate proposal  to give back the seats to the movements, which struck an  alliance with the M-19 Movement Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19],  which they lost in the 13 March elections. "We do not wish to  create more differences and political confrontations," the  minister pointed out.    The government position was adopted for several reasons.  First, Presidential Candidate Antonio Navarro opposed the Senate  proposal, although he clarified that he did so on a personal  basis. Second, militants of former guerrilla groups, such as  Bernardo Gutierrez and Gerardo Ardila, criticized the proposal  and described it as "shameful for democracy." Although Navarro  criticized the media for having consulted people who are no  longer AD/M-19 members, they are former guerrillas however.    AD/M-19 President Carlos Franco said he personally opposes  political favoritism, which is the name commonly given to the  concession of seats by decree, because the Senate is not the  only political forum that exists and because he is convinced  that his movement suffered an electoral defeat on 13 March due  to its own mistakes. He, nevertheless, thanked the government  and Congress for "their gesture of admitting that the peace  process, which has not yet concluded, and although it produced a  Constitution, had a high cost of about 400 dead."    He, however, pointed out that the Congress, with the same  disposition with which it proposed the application of  provisional Article 12 of the Constitution, should consider the  possibility of giving to the opposition some watchdog  organizations (Office of the Attorney General or Office of the  Comptroller General)," because it is not logical for the  traditional parties, which are the ones that govern, to  supervise themselves.    The government minister said the position assumed toward the  Senate proposal in no way affects a political agreement that was  just signed with the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS]. The CRS  secured two seats in the Chamber of Representatives and the  government will soon make them available.</p>

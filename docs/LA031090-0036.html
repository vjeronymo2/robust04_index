			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ROMEO HE'S NOT, BUT PENN'S GOT A HANDLE ON ELOQUENCE  </P> <P> So what if Michael Penn was Romeo in black jeans? What if he was Heathcliff?  </P> <P> Well, he's not. At least that's the answer to those questions (posed by Penn  himself so tunefully in his recent rookie hit "No Myth") as gleaned from his  Roxy debut Thursday, the first of three shows in two nights for the Angeleno.  </P> <P> Penn seems more the kind of guy whose shirt and hair never quite fit right,  whose shy reservedness could easily be mistaken for brooding awkwardness --  hardly the kind to express his passions with grand gestures a la the two cited  romantic heroes. His performance was nothing if not understated and low-key,  even at several junctures when the music (powered by a band that now includes X  drummer D.J. Bonebrake and Lucinda Williams' guitarist Gurf Morlix along with  long-time collaborator/keyboardist Patrick Warren) rocked flat out.  </P> <P> But he is the kind to express his passions with grand eloquence, a la the folks  who created Romeo and Heathcliff. He's the rare writer who can make the mundane  sublime -- the song "Big House," he said, is "about a big house," and  "Invisible" inspired by a favorite Santa Monica coffee shop, the explanations  taking nothing away from their agitated and aching qualities, respectively. His  restrained demeanor only helped bring these out. Grand gestures would have  squashed them. And, for the record, he was wearing blue jeans.  </P> <P> Penn made one grand gesture, though, in letting opening act Peter Blegvad take  over for one encore. Blegvad -- who's been in such art-conscious bands as Slapp  Happy and the Golden Palominos -- tends to pack his songs with thicker irony  than Penn (he's the kind of guy who brings his brother on stage to help do a  song that begins, "I'm my father's only son"). But the twists of melodies and  words yield plenty of pleasures. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Far-right violence continues unabated ATTACKS on asylum-seekers in east and west Germany failed to abate over the weekend despite official demands that assailants be punished more harshly. Ten persons, including six Vietnamese asylum-seekers, were injured late on Sunday night when right-wing east German youths threw petrol bombs at their flat in the city of Halle. Three Germans also received burns in the attack which set the flat on fire as well as other parts of the apartment building. Police said nearly 20 youths between the ages of 14 and 16 were believed responsible. Earlier in the evening 15 men gathered before a flat occupied by Vietnamese and threw stones and flaming objects through the window. A Vietnamese woman suffered burns. Four men were arrested in Hanau, west Germany, and accused of attempted murder and arson. They were said to have planned to set ablaze a nearby barracks housing nearly 1,000 asylum seekers. The men, aged 19 to 23, were said to be skinheads but did not belong to a political group. Spiegel TV said it had new documents from the files of the former East German Stasi security police showing that Mr Manfred Stolpe, prime minister of Brandenburg state and east Germany's most prominent politician, was given the East German Medal of Merit at the personal order of Mr Erich Mielke, the Stasi chief, who is standing trial in Berlin. Mr Stolpe said last week that he regretted having accepted the medal. Spiegel TV said the Stasi document contained Mr Stolpe's code name 'Secretary' and number under which he was registered as a Stasi informer. Mr Stolpe previously said he never knew that he was registered by the agency as an informer, although he admitted to frequent meetings with Stasi officers.</p>

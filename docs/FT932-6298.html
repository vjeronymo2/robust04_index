			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (3): New broadside for companies - The changes in business rates IN THE depths of recession, companies were hit by a new broadside of rising costs called the uniform business rate. They wriggled, they screamed, they protested that higher expenses at a time when profits were collapsing would drive many to the wall. They were right. The south saw most casualties, which was inevitable considering the way the new tax was structured. Although introduced in 1990, it was based on property values set two years earlier - the peak of the surge in property prices. The valuations also caught up with huge changes that had taken place since the previous assessment almost two decades before, so the jump was that much more severe. Now a new broadside is being loaded, as the business community faces a revaluation due to come into force in 1995. This time the guns will face a new direction, however. Property values were assessed last month, and again show enormous changes but they are heavily in favour of the south. At one time every business fleeing London seemed to quote soaring local authority rates as a main reason for the move. By the same logic, plunging bills under the new system should bring them flocking back. Relocation is not as simple as that, of course, yet the cuts could have an important input into decisions about future moves around the country. 'In general terms the 1995 revaluation will reverse the shift in burden that occurred in 1990,' says Robin Goodchild of Gerald Eve Research. 'The winners are primarily in the south-east, especially office occupiers.' Losers are spread across the rest of England and Wales (Scotland has its own system), particularly offices in rival centres. In other words, the occupation cost gap, already narrowed by convergence of rents, will be closed even further. The changes will be nowhere near as severe as last time around because they will not be making up for almost 20 years of neglect. But property values have still shifted dramatically since 1988. In Birmingham, for instance, they have almost doubled, compared with a 40 per cent drop in the City of London. 'Most areas are likely to experience an increased level of rateable value in 1995 though this will often be modest,' says Stephen Tutcher of Gerald Eve. 'Central London is the principal exception, with values reducing to 50 per cent or less of current values.' Rate bills for prime office space in the City will fall from more than Pounds 24 a sq ft to less than Pounds 15.50, says Sandra Jones of Herring Baker Harris Research. A West End block will drop from just over Pounds 21.50 to Pounds 14.21, Southwark from just over Pounds 13 to Pounds 8.12 and Hammersmith from Pounds 9.25 to Pounds 7.31. 'The relative benefits that the impending revaluation brings to the London market are accentuated when compared with some of the increases in rates payable expected in provincial cities,' she says in an HBH report, Shifting the Burden, which looks at the impact of the changes on 66 UK centres. Milton Keynes, for instance, will see a 40 per cent rates rise, Manchester as much as 73 per cent while in Cardiff they will more than double. Industry will also feel the wind of change. Good industrial space in Newcastle will have a current rates bill of 70p a sq ft based on a rent of Pounds 1.75 in 1988. Today the rental value is around Pounds 4.50, implying a 100 per cent rate rise to Pounds 1.83 a sq ft in 1995. Staines, near London, on the other hand, has a current bill of Pounds 2.41 based on a 1988 rent of Pounds 6 a sq ft. Those rates should rise only 25 per cent to just over Pounds 3, although the absolute cost of an extra 53p a sq ft will still be on a par which a Manchester or Liverpool business will have to find. This shows that decisions on relative location advantages will not be simple. Shops, which saw an immense upheaval in 1990, will be less affected this time but a retail building in Manchester will still see rates rise more than 50 per cent to almost Pounds 67.83 for Zone A space. London bills will creep up only marginally because rents have remained stable since the boom. There will still be a big gap, as a West End shop will be paying more than Pounds 91 a sq ft, and the narrowing that does take place will have little influence on relocation trends. Retailers are not great players in this field. But it could give a boost to decisions over investing in new stores outside the south-east. Office-based business will be affected far more because the changing balance of rate burdens will exaggerate the same trend in rents. 'If open market rents for prime space are around Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 a sq ft at present and we assume a 5 per cent growth (by 1995/6), this will mean a decrease of more than 20 per cent in the cost of occupying new office space in the capital,' says Ms Jones. This combined impact of lower rents and rates will slow even further the drift away from central London, particularly as tenants realise they will be able to take advantage of lower local authority charges for a further five years, even if rents begin to rise again. All sorts of other complications muddy the picture, however. For instance, a company considering whether to move today already has to calculate the costs of being stuck with existing older space it cannot sub-let. At least revaluation will set rate bills according to current rent values, which are likely to be much lower than the amount passing to the landlord. Whether that is enough to tip the balance in favour of a move remains to be seen.</p>

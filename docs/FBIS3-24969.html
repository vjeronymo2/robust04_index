Generals Olusegun Obasanjo and Mohammadu  Buhari charged Abacha with being the "biggest disciple,  supporter, and principle beneficiary" of the "corrupt" former  regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. By their silence,  Nigerians were "accomplices" in the new military regime, the  former heads of state added in an address Wednesday in the  northern town of Kaduna.    Government plans for a constitutional conference in the  first  half of the year were a "dangerous diversion," General Obasanjo  said. Only a national conference, in which all elected  representatives took part, would set Nigeria on a secure course  for the future, he added.    Obasanjo, president from 1976 to 1979, was one of the first  military leaders in Africa to hand over power to a  democratically elected head of state, President Shehu Shagari.  In 1983, Shagari's regime, discredited by a series of political  and economic scandals, was ousted by Buhari.    President Abacha took power in August last year when he  succeeded a short-lived civilian government which in turn had  taken office after the eight-year regime of General Babangida.  Babangida annulled the outcome of a long-awaited presidential  poll last June which threatened to bring Moslem millionaire  Moshood Abiola to power.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Inflows spur China's inflation China said a record inflow of foreign capital had fuelled inflation and admitted to poorly managing the influx. 'This year we did not sufficiently prepare for managing this huge inflow of foreign capital,' Mr Xie Ping, deputy director of the policy and research department of the People's Bank of China, wrote in an analysis in the Financial News. China's net inflow of capital amounted to Dollars 23bn in the first 10 months of 1994, with foreign investment comprising Dollars 22.7bn, Mr Xie said. Chinese leaders repeatedly cite foreign investment figures as proof of the success of their socialist market reforms, and boast of their aim to overtake the US as the world's top destination for inward investment. China says it now ranks second only to the US as a target for such investment. Much of the foreign money flowed into real estate and capital construction, whose 40.4 per cent annual growth in the first 10 months was a main cause of inflation, Mr Xie said.</p>

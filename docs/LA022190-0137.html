			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5-A BOYS;  </P> <P> EL TORO FINDS IT'S HOT OUTSIDE, 85-76  </P> <P> Cajon High School Coach Mark Lehman was well aware of El Toro's outside  shooting before their Southern Section 5-A quarterfinal playoff game Tuesday  night. But when El Toro struggled from the perimeter in the first half, Lehman  felt fortunate.  </P> <P> His feeling didn't last.  </P> <P> Sparked by the outside shooting of guards Kevin Martin and Rob Johnson, El Toro  held off Cajon, 85-76, at Laguna Hills High School. The Chargers (22-5) will  meet Mater Dei in the semifinals Friday night.  </P> <P> The significance of the win wasn't lost on El Toro Coach Tim Travers, who  walked calmly into his team's locker room before shouting, "Final Four, baby."  Travers said Friday night's game will mark the first time El Toro has reached  the playoff semifinals.  </P> <P> "The mood of this team is the best it has been all year," Travers said. "I  think we're playing real good basketball. We saved our best for last."  </P> <P> Just as El Toro, shooting about 39% of from three-point range during the  season, saved its best outside shooting for the second half. The Chargers made  only two of eight three-pointers in the first half, but thanks to a strong  inside game, they led, 36-34, at halftime.  </P> <P> In the second half, El Toro was 15 of 26 from the field, including six of 11  three-pointers.  </P> <P> "Outside shooters are usually streaky and they got a streak going," Lehman  said. "They weren't hitting those shots in the first half. We had a guy right  on them. We couldn't have played any better defense."  </P> <P> Despite foul trouble in the first half -- three starters had three fouls by  halftime -- Cajon rallied from deficits of 11 points in the second half and 10  points in the third quarter to keep the game close.  </P> <P> Two free throws by Cajon guard Amar Washington, who scored a game-high 29  points, tied the game, 66-66, with about five minutes left.  </P> <P> But three-pointers by Johnson, who scored 27 points, and Martin gave El Toro a  72-70 lead. Another basket by Johnson pushed the lead to four points and Cajon  (23-4) came no closer the rest of the way. The Chargers clinched the win by  making nine of their last 10 free throws in the final two minutes.  </P> <P> "I didn't think they could defend us," Travers said. "It wasn't a defensive  struggle, but we played better defense than they did."  </P> <P> "They gave us a lot of gaps inside and we tried to take advantage of those,"  said El Toro forward Greg Everett, who finished with 15 points. "And our  outside shooting came through."  </P> <P> Such shooting will be needed against Mater Dei (28-1). Everett said he knows  what to expect from the Monarchs, who finished the regular season as the  county's top-ranked team.  </P> <P> "They're just tough everywhere," he said.  </P></p>

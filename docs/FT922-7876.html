			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major issues stern warning on spending THE PRIME minister yesterday warned the cabinet that this year's public-spending round would be especially tight. Details of Mr Major's caution to his colleagues were released as it emerged that Mr Michael Portillo, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, will call in 14 ministers for unprecedented talks on departmental budgets soon after Whitsun. Mr Major's warning, at the end of a 75-minute cabinet meeting, was clearly a deliberate effort to dampen expectations of extra departmental funding as the costs of high unemployment bite into exchequer revenues. Downing Street took the unusual step of relaying his message yesterday, adding that the prime minister had said it was 'right for the chief secretary to examine all spending proposals very rigorously'. While such admonitions are not unusual, Mr Major's efforts to lend his weight to his chief secretary and Mr Portillo's move to call in ministers - months before the final round of bilateral negotiations in September - underline the high level of concern. On Wednesday Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted in a Commons debate on the economy that he was sticking to his forecast of a Pounds 28bn public-borrowing target this year. Speculation has been mounting among City analysts, though, that that, along with next year's Pounds 32bn figure, may have to be revised upwards. Mr Major is determined that borrowing should be reduced sufficiently to allow room for further income tax cuts towards the end of this parliament. But with yesterday's unemployment level showing 2.7m jobless, there are doubts whether a forecast average rate of 2.4m for the current financial year can be achieved. For every 100,000 jobless over that figure, the government must find Pounds 330m to cover unemployment and other benefits this year, rising to Pounds 360m in 1994-95. Civil servants now privately concede that the strain on the social security budget is substantially higher than first expected. The official word remains that there is no spending crisis, but rather that departments are being made aware of the insistence on good housekeeping. Efforts are under way to speed up the implementation of policies to contract out public-sector services and push through privatisation plans. A leaked letter from Mr Portillo to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, earlier this month illustrated how ministers are also under pressure to improve productivity in their departments. Ministers are expected to have filed their bids for departmental budgets by about the end of this month. After their meetings with the chief secretary after Whitsun, the horse trading will begin in earnest after the summer recess and be completed in September before the autumn statement in early November. If ministers fail to reach agreement with Mr Portillo, they will face the humiliation of going to the so-called Star Chamber, where senior Cabinet ministers adjudicate on disputed issues. The last meeting was in 1986.</p>

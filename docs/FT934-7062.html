			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Dixons to challenge warehouse retailers Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, Britain's leading high-street electrical retailer, said he would compete 'ruthlessly' with new US-style warehouse clubs which undercut goods in his shops. But he denied telling suppliers at an annual gathering that they would have to decide whether they would sell to Dixons or warehouse clubs such as Costco, which offer cut-price shopping to members. Mr Kalms said last night: 'At an annual dinner which we always give for our suppliers . . . I said I could not see how they could supply complex goods like video cassette recorders, camcorders which require a high degree of service to cut-price stores and ourselves. There is a contradiction here. We include pre-sales and after-sales service in our prices. Suppliers cannot work with high service retailers with a national network and low cost operations.' Mr Kalms said that he was not going to give his market away. 'We are going to compete ruthlessly with anyone who tries to undercut and that includes on price if needs be,' he said.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television Although the autumn season is grinding into gear, there are still lots of repeats, especially on BBC2 which manages only 15 minutes of original matter between 5.30 and 9.00. Some of the old stuff is retro-telly, kitsch nonsense such as Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons which broadcasters like to call 'cult' series. This implies passionate dedication but usually means that only a few people actually want to watch. At 9.00 on BBC2 comes World Cup Athletics, which, for me, will be a meeting too far. Linford Christie's poor showing since the Commonwealth Games suggests that television's keenness to promote the sport has resulted in too many meetings. BBC2's most interesting programme promises to be The Longest Walk, in which Janet Street-Porter joins Ffyona Campbell on the final stages of her journey. It is tempting because Campbell's mother describes her as pig-headed and her former support driver as horrible (10.00). Two other programmes also depend upon strong characters making journeys: Tom Vernon in Fat Man In France (7.30 BBC1); and John Betjeman in The Lost Betjemans (8.00 C4).</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Sheppard in a minor key It is commonly held that as a jazz musician you must pay your dues before moving into the premier league: you have to earn the right to do your own thing. British saxophonist Andy Sheppard has worn out more than a few reeds on the way up and is now expressing himself vigorously and variously all over the place. Last Saturday his Small Co-Motion - a duo with keyboard player and composing partner Steve Lodder - filled Norwich Arts Centre. A new and funky recording from the quintet In Co-Motion is out now on Blue Note and a live recording of the 10-piece Big Co-Motion is released next month. Sheppard likes to chop around. In Paris he used to play on forklift trucks with performance art troupe Urban Sax. He sits on the front row of adventurous big bands led by George Russell and Carla Bley and plays opposite pianist Keith Tippett in turbulent free improvisation. Last year Big Co-Motion travelled to Nigeria and Outer Mongolia on British Council tours. For his foray into the Near East, however, Sheppard came equipped for congenial self-indulgence and intimate riffing with Lodder's synth. Opening with the soprano and a swarming bee tone layered over twinkling accompaniment before moving on to the soulless fuzz metal effect of the Ewi (electronic wind instrument), Sheppard showed his considerable firepower. Dank soprano improvisation with delay gave way to well punctuated excursions from Lodder and some tenor madness. But minor key ruminations were the theme for most of the evening. Linear improvisation run along a repeating and recurring folky mantra is a feature of much jazz, and indeed modern music in general. The melancholic, wistful effect created by Sheppard and Lodder here is mildly stimulating because they are both fine musicians. But, as if you had been listening in to two friends jamming gently at home, you do not go away with much of substance to remember. Sheppard is always good value in any shape or form - however blurred the outline. But his solo exertions in the context of a fierce brass section and the exhilarating writing of the Big Co-Motion are more rewarding. Small Co-Motion at the Blackheath concert halls tonight. Big Co-Motion at the Barbican, February 25.</p>

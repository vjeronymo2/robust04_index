			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) Technology: Japanese elevator girls bow out Correction (published 21st January 1994) appended to this article. For many Japanese, one of the pleasures of shopping in up-market department stores has been riding the lifts, operated by 'elevator girls' - smartly dressed in designer uniforms, bowing and smiling while pressing the buttons to each floor. Selecting the floors of the automated lifts has long been considered an important 'service' by both retailer and customer. But due to the consumer slump and new technology, Japanese shoppers may soon find themselves pressing their own lift buttons and being greeted instead by a computerised screen. Many department store operators are now being forced to restructure their operations because of the sharp fall in retail spending, especially on luxury items. The economic downturn has brought about a radical change in consumer spending patterns, and even the most prestigious operators are falling into the red. Fujitec, a leading elevator maker, claims to have the answer for the department store operators caught between the need to cut costs and customers who still consider a smile and a warm welcome as an important attraction. The company has developed jointly with Sanyo Electric a computerised information system for department store lifts where a female attendant on screen smiles and bows, reciting wares to customers. A system for four elevators costs around Y10m (Pounds 595,200), which Fujitec claims is cheaper than hiring four elevator girls. A customer entering the lift will be greeted by a female attendant on a screen display above the lift door. While the lift is moving, the screen will display product and shopping information, and when the lift stops, floor information will flash on to the screen followed by a bowing attendant. Fujitec says it has received inquiries from several department stores. The company says the system can also be used for screening advertisements or scenery in lifts in ordinary office buildings, providing something for people to look at. CORRECTION In the article on January 14 headed 'Japanese elevator girls bow out', the sterling equivalent of the Y10m cost of the lift information system was given wrongly as Pounds 595,200 instead of Pounds 59,520.</p>

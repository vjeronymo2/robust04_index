			<p>This     Foreign Media Note reports on progress and problems  encountered in establishing Ukraine's Navy and Naval Air Force.      Presentation of New Navy Commander      On 13 October Minister of Defense Colonel General Vitaliy  Radetskyy presented the new Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral V.  Bezkorovaynyy, to the Navy command component in Sevastopol.  Radetskyy expressed gratitude to outgoing Navy Commander B. Kozhyn  for his significant contribution to the establishment of Ukraine's  Navy and stressed that Ukraine, as a maritime state, must have its  own navy.  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 14 Oct 93 p 1)      New Navy Commander Chairs Council Meeting      The newly appointed Commander of the Navy Vice Admiral Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy chaired a meeting of the Military Council in  Sevastopol.  Head of the Directorate for Cadres Captain 1st Rank V.  Polevoy delivered a report to the Council on progress in bringing  the officer corps up to strength and eliminating the shortfall  between navy requirements and the projected number of graduates out  to the year 2000.  He noted in particular that staffing for the  Navy, Rear Services, and the Naval Aviation Directorate was at 60  percent.  In his address to the Council Commander of Naval Aviation  and Deputy Naval Forces Commander for Aviation Major General Mykola  Volovin discussed the role of reconfiguring the Sevastopol Naval  Institute in bringing naval aviation up to strength and training  aviation specialists.  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 20 Nov 93  p1)      Navy Commander Assesses Progress, Prospects      In an interview prepared on Ukrainian Armed Forces Day, Navy  Commander Bezkorovaynyy pointed out that starting from almost  nothing in April 1992 the Navy today has surface ship formations,  marine sub-units, and almost 20 units of various types and staffing  for the Navy Rear Services and the Naval Aviation Directorate is at  6O percent.  He assessed the situation as follows:      "During the 1993 training year Naval Forces continued their work  in forming and establishing control organs, guaranteeing the timely  conducting of plant and state tests of ships under construction and  their introduction to the body of forces on constant readiness, and  also in guaranteeing control over navigation in the Black Sea Basin.  Plans for combat, operational and mobilization training have been  almost completely carried out.  Analysis of measures showed that the  level of training of staff and command organs in the Navy has risen  markedly in comparison with past years.      "An important result of this was the Navy's attainment of  international recognition; foreign political and military leaders  relate to us as to a state structure and an armed service branch of  a maritime power.  Participation of Navy representatives in  international symposia on military policy questions, speeches,  exhibits of naval equipment and armaments, visits to Ukraine by  warships of other countries, visits to our ships by highly placed  personnel from several states, and meetings at Ukraine's naval  headquarers with military and naval attaches bear witness to this.      "The concept of establishment of Naval Forces was made more  precise in Ukraine's Basic Military Doctrine.  We have a clear view  of this problem.  The basic principle in establishment and  development of Ukraine's Navy is the optimum composition of a combat  nucleus, sufficient to defend the State's interests against any  possible agressor by sea.  Therefore, well-planned work must proceed  for establishment of naval force sub-branches, especially surface  and submarine forces, naval aviation, costal defense forces,  formations and units of combat, special and rear services, and a  scientific program."  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 6 Dec 93 P  3)      Funding Problems      In an article commenting on difficulties in establishing the  Navy, Captain 2nd Rank Myroslav Mamchak noted that the construction  and repair of many ships has been frozen due to a lack of funds in  the Ministry of Defense.  One "flagrant" example cited by Mamchak is  the as yet unfinished aircraft carrier "Varyah," whose sale would  generate substantial hard currency for the State, he noted.  The  author further stated that the absence of a State program for  establishing a Navy has precluded concentration of national security  efforts against a threat from the-sea.  He discussed local  contributions from the public to build and outfit warships bearing  the regional name an alternate source of funds.  (Kiev NARODNA  ARMIYA in Ukrainian 23 Dec 93 p2)      NARODNA ARMIYA cited such an example of moves to solicit funds  from the populace to equip warships.  By agreement between rayon  leaders and the naval command a campaign was begun in Syanynskyy  Rayon, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, to collect funds to equip a newly  built warship to bear the name Pokuttya.  A special bank account was  established and 3.8 million karboantsy collected, of which 3.7  million have been allotted to equip the ship.  According to the  report, the remainder is in an account in the Ukraina Agrarian Bank  for additional contributions at a later date.  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA  in Ukrainian 14 Nov 93 p 1)      Naval Air Arm      The Ukrainian Naval Aviation Directorate was established in  accordance with a Ministry of Defense decision and a Headquarters  directive.  Major General Mykola Volovin was named Naval Aviation  Commander, and experienced aviators were appointed to 60 percent of  the positions.  The directorate is based at an air garrison near the  city of Skay (Crimea).  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian 6 Oct 93 p  1)      Battalion Established in Sevastopol      A new battalion was established under the Sevastopol garrison  commandant Vladimir Zverev to guard military installations, conduct  patrols, and accompany freight trains. It was scheduled to begin  service in mid-September.  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Russian 10 Sep 93  p 1)      New ASW Ship Added to Fleet     Commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces Vice Admiral Vladimir  Bezkorovaynyy, Ukraine's presidental representative in Sevastopol  Ivan Yermakov, and Hero of the Soviet Union Vice Admiral (ret.)  Vladimir Pilipenko greeted the arrival in Sevastopol of the new ASW  (anti-submarine warfare) ship "Lutsk" on 21 November.  The "Lutsk"  had just successfully completed sea trials in the Black Sea and was  reported to be the fifth ship to fly the Navy flag.  Ship commander  Captain 3rd Rank Viktor Zaremba praised the performance of his  youthful crew, only 20 percent of whom had previously been to sea.  (Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Russian 23 Nov 93 p 1)      The "Lutsk" was referred to as the fourth, rather than fifth such  ship to fly the Ukrainian flag in an article published two weeks  later.  Elaborating on the impact of economic difficulties on the  ship's building, the article reported that for a time the fate of  the "Lutsk" was in doubt:  construction was brought to a halt  immediately after independence due to funding problems.  The fine  points of funding--problems which were formerly resolved in Moscow-  -were "not well understood in our newly established Ministry of  Defense," and as a result the ship stood idle at the Kiev Ship  Building plant.  The problems were subsequently resolved through the  efforts of the Kiev shipbuilders and Military Acceptance Commission  representatives Captain 1st Rank Petro Polyakov and Captain 3rd Rank  Ihor Tyshchenko.

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE HIGH COURT TO HEAR DRUG-TEST APPEAL;  </P> <P> ATHLETICS: ACTION SETS ASIDE RULING THAT NCAA PROGRAM VIOLATES RIGHT TO PRIVACY  UNDER CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court agreed today to hear an NCAA appeal to allow drug  testing of college athletes in California.  </P> <P> The court's action sets aside a lower-court ruling, in a suit by Stanford  University athletes, that the NCAA drug-testing program violated the right to  privacy under the California Constitution.  </P> <P> Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justices Edward A. Panelli, David N.  Eagleson and Armand Arabian, forming a majority on the seven-member court,  voted to grant a hearing on the NCAA's appeal. No hearing date has been set.  </P> <P> It is also the first private drug-testing case accepted for review by the  court, and could determine the scope of the state constitutional guarantee of  privacy as it applies to drug testing.  </P> <P> California privacy rights, unlike those recognized under the U.S. Constitution,  have been interpreted to protect individuals from intrusions by private as well  as governmental entities. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the NCAA is a  private organization.  </P> <P> The ruling Sept. 25 by the 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose was the  first by any appellate court in the nation against the drug-testing program. It  prohibited involuntary drug testing of Stanford athletes in any competition  inside or outside the state.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court's ruling will apply to all California college athletes.  </P> <P> The NCAA since 1986 has conducted random drug testing of athletes in  championship contests and postseason football games, looking for six categories  of drugs, including steroids. To be eligible during the season, all athletes  must sign forms consenting to be tested.  </P> <P> Last year, the NCAA began year-round testing of football players for steroids  and two other types of drugs.  </P> <P> The appeals court's 3-0 ruling said the NCAA had failed to show that the  testing program was necessary or effective, that there was significant drug use  by college athletes or that testing would protect athletes or the integrity of  the competition.  </P> <P> The court also said the NCAA had not tried alternatives, such as drug  education.  </P> <P> In seeking Supreme Court review, NCAA lawyers said drug education could not  assure athletes their competitors were not using drugs.  </P></p>

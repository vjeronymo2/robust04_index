			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Laing chairman hits out at banks Banks and institutional shareholders which have supported 'enfeebled contractors' have added to damaging over-capacity in the UK construction industry, Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, said yesterday. His remarks, which accompanied the the construction group's annual results for 1993, were made as rival contractor Mowlem launched a Pounds 63.1m rights issue to refinance the group. Laing, which announced a 57 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.3m, has previously complained that the efforts of banks and shareholders to prop up ailing companies has left too many contractors chasing too few orders in the recession. Mr Laing said that highly borrowed contractors needing a regular flow of cash payments to meet interest charges were desperate to win work 'at the expense of profit'. He estimated that there was up to 30 per cent over-capacity among UK contractors. The comments run contrary to traditional criticisms that banks are too quick to call in receivers. Mr Laing stressed he was not aiming his comments at any particular contractor. In response to low UK profit margins, Laing was seeking more work overseas. It was also increasing its involvement in privately financed infrastructure projects where these provided satisfactory returns. Laing was prepared to take small equity stakes in these developments if required.</p>

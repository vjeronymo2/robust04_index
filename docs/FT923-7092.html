			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Book Review: A prophet of loss ACCOUNTING FOR GROWTH By Terry Smith Century Business Pounds 12.99. 223 pages It's bold, it's brash, it's labelled 'the book they tried to ban'. And a month before it was due to be published, it is already on the shelves. Rarely has a technical business book attracted so much advance publicity. The decision by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, to suspend Terry Smith, the author and head of its UK research department, has been well reported. UBS has issued a writ against him and his publisher after complaints from at least one of the companies cited in the text. Readers may find that the book does not deliver all it promises. It begins with a clear and important question: how can a company fail when its most recent set of accounts show a profit? Recent examples include Polly Peck, British &amp; Commonwealth and Maxwell Communication Corporation. During the past decade, there have been many more. The book sets the scene with a brief historical tour through the 1980s, which it calls the decade of the deal. Corporate finance activity expanded sharply, mergers and acquisitions surged and debt soared. After the party, the hangover of the 1990s. Companies are trying to reduce their debt burden in favour of raising money through share issues. But many are too late, says Smith, leaving 'bleeding balance sheets, soaring bad debts, devastating bank profits and penniless shareholders. The scene is littered with tarnished reputations and broken careers . . . and jail.' Accountancy, Smith argues, must take a share of the blame. Its flexible rules have allowed companies' financial information to be presented in ways that provide few warning signs to investors of the true position. In 12 chapters Smith explains a series of accounting techniques which have had the effect of improving the profits or reducing the significance of the debt on many UK balance sheets. None breaches existing standards. Smith does a good job of describing the techniques and their effects, illustrated with extracts from company accounts. He also provides three more detailed case studies of collapsed companies in appendices. The final chapter is probably the most useful. It lists six 'survival techniques' for investors in the 'accounting jungle'. Above all, Smith stresses that lack of cash is the reason companies fail - profits are secondary. He says investors should read accounts from the back forwards, looking for discontent in the resolutions at the annual general meeting, and the note on contingent liabilities, while skimming over the often uncritical chairman's statement at the front. Most of the controversy surrounding the book has been generated by a single 11-page chapter towards the end. Smith publishes a series of tables showing the top UK quoted companies, with blobs against each to show which of them uses the 12 techniques he has described. He is careful to issue provisos, stressing that inclusion 'does not automatically mean that the company is indulging in creative accounting'. But the implication - reinforced throughout the book - is clear: companies which use the techniques are massaging their figures. Unfortunately, his case is not proven. The techniques he lists are not only legal but also widely used. A case can be made for 'capitalising' costs by putting them on the balance sheet in certain circumstances, for example, a technique he attacks. Indeed, the practice is compulsory in the US. Most of the methods he highlights have either been changed or are under scrutiny by the new Accounting Standards Board and its associated bodies. This means the book's interest is historical and it is of little use as a predictive tool for identifying future collapses. In fact, Smith fails to establish the link between accounting practices and financial difficulty. He cites the poor share performance last year of a number of the companies which used at least five of the techniques. Yet his evidence is selective. He does not compare these figures with the worst-performing shares on the stock market during the period. He does not even include all the quoted companies which used at least five techniques. An analysis by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, shows that the average share performance of companies which did not use any of the techniques was worse than those which used at least five. There is a more fundamental problem. Smith draws heavily on public information in company accounts. Analysts ought to be able to extract this information and recalculate if they disagree with the accounting treatment adopted. Admittedly, this may be more difficult for less-qualified investors. The whole thrust of reform by the Accounting Standards Board is that investors should be less concerned with a single number - particularly earnings - and more with the accounts as a whole. It is the concentration on profits which has encouraged companies to inflate that figure. The book reveals at least as much about the readers of accounts  - particularly analysts - as it does about their compilers.</p>

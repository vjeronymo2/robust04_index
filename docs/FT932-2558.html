			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Timex strikers reject severance payments THE BITTER industrial dispute at the Timex plant in Dundee is set to continue after sacked workers yesterday rejected the company's offer of severance payments in exchange for a return to work by some employees and an orderly rundown of the factory before it closes at Christmas. A mass meeting voted overwhelmingly not to accept Timex's offer of work for 50 to 100 of the workers and subsequent negotiations on severance pay for all 343 dismissed members of the AEEU engineering union. The offer involved accepting what the workers see as a 27 per cent cut in wages and benefits. Mr John Kydd, union convener at the plant, said: 'There was no way we could accept this offer for some of our members on terms that have already been rejected, particularly as the company has treated us like garbage for the past 20 weeks.' Timex said: 'An opportunity to achieve a lasting settlement to the conflict has been lost. Our former workforce could have benefited from a settlement negotiated with the company or through Acas which would have meant them leaving the picket lines with dignity and a just financial settlement. Local union officials have failed to grasp the reality of plant closure and have again failed their own members.' Timex faces continued picketing and an intensified campaign to have its products boycotted. Without a negotiated return to work the workers will receive no compensation or redundancy pay since they are deemed to have dismissed themselves by going on strike in January. Mr Stuart MacIntosh, who has been with the company for 10 years, said on leaving the meeting: 'The dispute goes on. We will fight for our jobs and proper redundancy.' A first step will come this weekend with a mass demonstration outside the Timex plant. Organisers hope that 10,000 people will attend from all over Britain. Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trade Union Congress, said the demonstration 'was to have been a static demonstration outside the plant but now we are going to have a march'. Five windows were smashed at the Oslo offices of Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipping operator, yesterday. An employee said the damage may have been a protest against the decision to close the Timex factory in Dundee - Timex is owned by Mr Olsen.</p>

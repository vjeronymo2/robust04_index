			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Golden Vale shares drop 30% on warning Shares in Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, closed 30 per cent down at 69p yesterday, after plunging as low as 55p during the day, in reaction to its profits warning on Thursday evening, delivered after the market close. The company said its pre-tax profits for 1994 would be about one third down on 1993's IPounds 19m because of falling prices for its products, tighter margins being forced on it by multiple retailers, unanticipated rationalisation costs, and a strengthening Irish currency. These factors have not been 'fully matched' yet by a reduction in prices paid to its farmer-suppliers for its milk supplies, directors said. Dublin analysts do not anticipate similar profits revisions for the other Irish food companies.</p>

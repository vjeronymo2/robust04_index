			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Canada turns in top performance Canad a was the top performing government bond market last month, as a combination oflow inflation, high unemployment and an easing in short-term interest rates prompted a rally and provided investors with a return of 2.05 per cent in local currency terms. 'Investors' appetites for Canadian fixed-income securities have been whetted by widespread expectations that Canadian bonds would continue to outperform their US counterparts . . . these expectations have been reinforced by better inflation performance and persistent high unemployment levels in Canada, along with further gradual easing of short rates by the Bank of Canada,' says J. P. Morgan Securities in its monthly report on government bond performance. Spanish government bonds ranked second with a return of 1.88 per cent in January, helped by an improving inflation picture and a 25 basis point cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate. In general, the higher-yielding European government bond markets remained firm at the start of the year, while thecore European government bond markets showed only small gains, as market participants became less optimistic about the prospects of a near-term easing by the Bundesbank. Japan was the worst performing government bond market, showinga fall of 3.34 per cent in local currency terms. The strong performance of bond markets last year boosted turnover on Euroclear, the world's largest international securities clearing house, to a record Dollars 17,300bn, up 77 per cent on 1992, writes Tracy Corrigan. Euroclear is expected to have increased its shareof the market with rival Cedel to more than 70 per cent. Average daily turnoverrose from Dollars 37bn to Dollars 66bn. Euroclear gave rebates totalling Dollars 12m to the market, since it does not retain profits except for further investment in development.</p>

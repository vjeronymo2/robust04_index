			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] According to Sifo polling between 24 and  27 January, 47 percent of Swedes now believe their countrymen  will approve EU [European Union] membership in a referendum; 37  percent believe they will reject it. The increase in those  optimistic about approval -- 17 percent -- is the largest  recorded thus far. Mattias Bengtsson writes in the 4 February  SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 3 that this is an indication that the  membership debate has entered a new stage: The yes side has been  gaining momentum since January polls showed an 8 percent  increase in support for membership. Bengtsson cites several  reasons for increased optimism. An upturn in the economic  situation in Sweden has given people more confidence in the  future. At the same time, reporting on the EU accession  negotiations has made membership a more concrete and less  frightening prospect. About 25 percent more respondents now  believe that the negotiations are being handled well: 55  percent in January versus one-third in October.</p>

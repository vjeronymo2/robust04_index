			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Aeroflot airlines to be sold off Russia's Aeroflot, once the world's biggest airline monopoly but split into 321 small airlines since the Soviet collapse, plans to sell a 49 per cent stake at a privatisation auction, officials said, Reuter reports from Moscow. The former flag carrier would sell its shares for cash at an investment tender soon but no final date has been set, Aeroflot officials said yesterday. The government would keep a majority 51 per cent stake in the Russian state's international carrier, which became a joint stock company this week to allow privatisation after two years of chaotic reorganisation. Aeroflot's privatisation was delayed by a dispute between airline officials and the government over whether it should be split up or sold as a single lot. But airline officials said Aeroflot's 'daughter' companies would also be privatised. The proceeds of the sell-off would go towards purchases of new equipment and spare parts. They gave no details about the sell-off, but privatisation officials say public offerings for cash - due to start from July 1 after the expiry of the voucher privatisation - will involve sales of block shares to foreign and domestic investors. Russia's Aeroflot to sell 49 per cent of stakes. Hundreds of domestic and international airlines have been set up since Aeroflot was broken up as part of post-communist market reforms, plunging civil aviation into chaos.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Denmark looks ahead to resurgence of new issues - The market is awaiting the privatisation of Teledanmark later this year The performance of shares listed on the Copenhagen stock exchange may not match that of other Nordic countries over the past year but, given that profits expectations for Danish companies have received no beneficial boost from foreign exchange depreciation, it remains remarkably good. The all-share index rose 39 per cent in 1993, climbed a further 13.7 per cent to reach a new high on February 2, and is currently about 11.2 per cent ahead since December 31. Den Danske Bank's equity analysts predict an increase in profits averaging 13 per cent in 1994 and 19 per cent in 1995, only a fraction of the expectation which the bank has for profits in Norway, Finland and Sweden. This year is expected to see a resurgence in new issue activity after a long period with little action. Danisco, the food conglomerate, led off with a highly successful DKr1bn (Dollars 149m) convertible - later raised by DKr150m - while Unidanmark, the banking group, announced a new share issue, which will raise about DKr1.3bn, following a return to profits in 1993 after three years of losses. There will be a strong focus on the Teledanmark privatisation issue, due before mid-summer, when 49 per cent of the stock in the state's monopoly telecommunications group will be sold. The issue will be a record for the Copenhagen market, with estimates of the amount to be raised ranging from about DKr7bn to almost double that figure. Another, much smaller, privatisation issue, the sale of 25 per cent in Copenhagen Airport, is also under preparation for this spring, and could raise about DKr750m. The resolution of ownership of Baltica, the country's largest insurance group (including life assurance), will be another major event this year. Brought to its knees by ill-judged property and other investments, Baltica was rescued by Den Danske Bank last year, leaving Danske with a 32 per cent stake; the former Baltica Holding, now known as Gefion, has 24 per cent. These shares are up for sale, and it is an open question whether Danish investors have the means or the inclination to take on the domestic giant. If not, both Denmark's two top insurance groups (the other is Codan) will be foreign-owned. Unidanmark's return to profit of DKr885m in 1993 after a DKr4.66bn loss in 1992 is an indication that the worst is over for the finance industry. The strains on the sector, however, are still showing, as the insurance concern Topdanmark was forced to concede this month after the Finance Industry Supervisory Authority told it to increase bad loss provisions in its banking subsidiary Aktivbanken, which will, therefore, make a loss again; the group's profits forecast was reduced from DKr148m to DKr100m. Among the larger and more liquid shares, FLS Industries, supplier of cement mills and technology, aircraft maintenance services and building materials, has put on 18 per cent since the end of the year. The share price was helped by comments from Mr Birger Riisager, its chief executive, who told analysts that the market was undervaluing the group, which has a large order book for cement mills around the world. But FLS Industries 'B' shares, presently priced about DKr554, are still way off their 1993 peak of DKr615. Among smaller companies, a return to profits in the half-year ending November 30 by Bang &amp; Olufsen, the manufacturer of up-market television and audio equipment, sent the 'B' stock to a high of DKr780, compared with a 1993 low of DKr110 and a year-end DKr552, before receding to its current DKr703. The group implemented a tough rationalisation programme and introduced a new product strategy at the end of 1992 under a new chief executive, Mr Anders Knutsen, which paid off with first-half profits of DKr30m, after several years with losses, and a sales surge of 18 per cent.</p>

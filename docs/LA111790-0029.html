			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALITY AND YOUTH  </P> <P> What a joy to read Raspberry's column.  </P> <P> While our politicians for self-interest will continue to sell their voters on  the notion that "it isn't your fault, we only need more federal money," a  columnist has come straight.  </P> <P> There will always be racism, but to use that fact for an excuse to not go to  school or work, or to go late with a negative attitude, and/or to abuse others,  drugs and sex only fuels the racist.  </P> <P> Racism has never been so muted in this country or opportunity all that wanting  (ask some recent immigrants), yet an ever-increasing number of parents are  developing a subculture that precludes their children from a meaningful future.  The bigger problem is not hopes dashed on the rocks of racism, but no hope that  has been learned from parents.  </P> <P> Until negligent parents have been made aware of their invidious role in  creating a no-culture culture and have to face other consequences for the  results of their parenting, there is little hope for change.  </P> <P> In the community in which I work with high school students, many parents  denounce intervening authority and lie for their child until the youngster is  failing in school, pregnant, beaten up, shot or is going behind bars. Then a  few will break from supporting anger to tears and plead, "What can I do?"  Institutions and individuals should be answering that question, even before it  is asked.  </P> <P> D.L.

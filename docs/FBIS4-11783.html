			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Henceforth Blame-Free" by 'Abd al-Jabbar Muhsin] </F>   [Text] In coping with aggression and the blockade, our  ancient people, interacting with their leadership, have lined up  a number of mechanisms that have brought the crisis to  manageable proportions, and thus thwarted the primary objectives  of the aggression and the blockade.    Not a single Iraqi has even entertained the possibility of  kowtowing to the aggressors or conceding their demands. Nor has  any Iraqi ever thought of abandoning his people's interests or  sovereignty. Our first mechanism was the armed struggle to ward  off aggression and rout its first line in the south of the  country, where the men of the demanding missions attached to the  Republican Guards proved they were not sitting targets for  invaders, but men standing ready to defend their land. Iraq did  not provide the example of a nation crushed by the United  States, but rather an example of a people who, with the benefit  of the right leadership and a willingness to sacrifice, can hold  out and stand firm. Then came the rebuilding mechanism that  proved to the enemies they could not possibly set Iraq back to  the pre-industrial age.    However, as Iraq patiently pursued the jihad and  reconstruction effort, it also followed a political line of its  own that fragmented the opposing forces, increased its own  supporters, and denied the enemies any justifications for any  fresh aggression on its infrastructure. Iraq has proved that it  is not a discordance in international relations, but the  repository of legitimate hopes. It has shown itself to be a  champion of freedom, security, advancement, and peace.    The aggressors have been waiting for any false steps by Iraq  to justify retaining the sanctions, but they have been denied  this opportunity by Iraq's judiciousness.    Thus, Iraq is now free to say and do what it will in defense  of its security and interests, and has left scope for no one to  fault the way it is conducting itself.</p>

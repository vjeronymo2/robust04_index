			<p>BFN     [Text] The Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] team appeared at the 29th Karate Championship  taking place in Birmingham, England, with a new flag. At the  beginning, the Skopjeans told organizers that they had lost  their flag. But a short while later they presented a new one.  The new flag has a yellow sun with 42 rays and six lines  connected together in the form of an X over a red background.  The team paraded as The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  The team captain later revealed that the new flag was given to  them by his country's Sports Ministry.    ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports that the fact that Skopjeans  changed their flag indicates that they are ready to present an  alternative solution and perhaps they are ready to abandon the  Sun of Veryina which they had presented as their symbol.</p>

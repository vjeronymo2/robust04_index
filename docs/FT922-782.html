			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (6): The scandal that just had to happen - The financial system is ripe for abuse. In recent weeks, the stock market bubble has burst after a share purchase scandal that centred on the Bombay interbank market THE SCANDAL that has engulfed India's financial establishment this year threatens to stop the reform of the country's financial markets in its tracks. Centring on the Bombay interbank market, but spilling over into the stock market, the scandal is a typical product of careless financial deregulation: markets were allowed to develop faster than either regulators or market infrastructure were able to cope with. Mr Harshad Mehta, a young broker who won a cult following for his aggressive share buying over the past year, exploited this weakness to the full. For months, the financial community had been asking where Mr Mehta raised the money to make his daring share purchases. The answer is now clear: he and other brokers succeeded in drawing Rs30bn illicitly out of the interbank market, according to the Reserve Bank of India. The victims were banks which traded through Mr Mehta and other brokers, among them State Bank of India, National Housing Bank and Standard Chartered. Officials from the first two banks are among those who have been charged with fraud, along with Mr Mehta and others. The scandal has emanated from the market for bankers' receipts - the product of a uniquely Indian blend of excessive administrative control, inadequate regulation and antiquated systems. Banks are forced to put 30 per cent (until April, 38.5 per cent) of their deposits into low-yielding government debt. This has prevented the creation of a normal interbank market, in which banks deposit surplus cash with each other. In its place has grown a market in repurchase agreements (or 'repos', known in India as 'ready forwards') - arrangements under which a bank sells securities to another bank and agrees to buy them back up to 90 days later (or vice versa). That way, banks can raise short-term cash without incurring the statutory reserve requirements. The second peculiarity of the Indian financial system is that transfers of government securities are still entered by hand in a ledger maintained by the Public Debt Office. Powerful unions have held back computerisation, though the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, says it hopes to have automated the process by this summer. The delays in delivery of stock that result - and the cartloads of paper that banks have to pass between themselves when they buy or sell securities  -have prompted banks to issue receipts to each other, promising to hand over securities at a later date. When repurchase agreements are unwound, the receipts can simply be torn up. The system is ripe for abuse. Banks (or brokers acting in their name) have often created receipts not backed by any securities holdings. Some banks knowingly lent their names to such deals to allow brokers to raise cash. At the same time, banks' controls over the issuing of receipts have in some cases been appallingly lax: they have been issued (and accepted) in photocopy form, with no serial number, and in some cases bearing only the signature of a junior bank official. The Reserve Bank knew of problems similar to these, though on a smaller scale, a year ago, and tried to put the lid firmly on the market. It failed. In early 1991, the State Bank of India, the country's largest commercial bank, was dealing in the interbank market at a rate of around Rs10bn (Pounds 500m) a month. By this March, that had shot up to Rs87bn. With little external regulation or internal control, bank officials and brokers colluded to suck as much as Rs30.8bn out of this over-charged market, according to the Reserve Bank. Much of the extra bank credit that was created in the process is thought to have been drawn into the stock market, helping to drive the Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index (Sensex) up from just over 1,000 early last year to a peak of 4,500 in April before the scandal broke. Share prices lost touch with reality. The average price/earnings ratio of the market peaked at 57 at the end of April. Most observers of the market claim to be glad that the stock market bubble has burst - but they do not want to see share prices fall further from what is still a heady level. With the Sensex standing at around 3,000, the price/earnings ratio of Indian companies averages just over 30. By almost any standards, the p/e still looks high. And even then, there is widespread disbelief in many of the numbers being reported by listed companies. Share ramping (against the by-laws of only some of India's exchanges) and insider dealing (still not an offence) are publicly acknowledged to be rife. The financial scandal that has come to light in recent weeks has given a new impetus to the overhaul of financial regulation that was already being undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India. This is centred on three areas: The interbank market. The Reserve Bank has agreed with banks active in the market a series of restrictions aimed at preventing a recurrence of the fraud. These include, for instance, restricting trading to government securities (in the past, banks have actively traded bonds issued by public sector companies and units in the Unit Trust of India as well). Also, banks are being encouraged to separate trading, settlement and custody activities to make it more difficult for frauds to occur. The stock market. The SEBI is putting pressure on the country's stock exchanges to regulate their markets better. According to Mr G. V. Ramakrishna, SEBI president, investors often receive no contract note for their deals and so often do not know on what day their brokers have dealt or at precisely what price. There are sometimes long delays in delivery of shares or cash. SEBI is also looking over the exchanges' shoulders as they open up their markets to corporate broking firms for the first time, due within the next month. Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, has been hired by the Bombay Stock Exchange to advise on capital adequacy rules for brokers, to replace the unlimited liability currently imposed on partnerships and sole traders. The supervision of markets and the regulation of brokers is being left largely to the exchanges - with SEBI breathing down their necks. 'They know that if they don't do it, we'll get it done,' says Mr Ramakrishna. Banking supervision. Discussions are under way about the creation of a new board of banking supervision independent of the Reserve Bank - a recommendation contained in a official report on the financial system at the end of last year by Mr M. Narasimham, a former central bank governor. At the same time, the Reserve Bank's own relationship with the commercial banking system has come under scrutiny. It directly owns two banks at the centre of the scandal in the securities markets, the State Bank of India and the National Housing Bank. Mr R. Janakiraman, its deputy governor - the man charged with investigating the fraud - is himself a member of the State Bank's board. Mr Venkitaramanan denies that the Reserve Bank has any responsibility for the way these banks have been run - but he admits the position makes him uncomfortable. 'There should be separation of ownership and regulation,' he says. While attention is currently focused on an overhaul of financial regulation, the progressive deregulation of India's capital markets has been continuing apace. Two steps taken in recent weeks indicate the direction and pace in which things are moving. The first was the abolition last month of the post of Controller of Capital Issues, an official whose job it had been to stipulate the price at which shares could be offered to the public and the interest rates that companies could pay on their debentures. This had given rise to the lottery in which investors lucky enough to be allotted shares at par in a new issue were assured of a hefty paper profit once secondary trading started. Now, issues are expected to be priced at closer to their likely market price. The second step has been the move to free up the country's government debt market, with the Reserve Bank for the first time inviting tenders for short-term bills. Interest rates on long-term government debt could also soon be set by the market, says Mr Venkitaramanan - if wholesale price inflation falls from its current level of 12.5 per cent, and the country's fiscal deficit falls towards 5 per cent. These are two very big 'ifs', but at least interest rates have been moved steadily upwards in recent months to something more like a true market level. These and other liberalising moves are now too far advanced for India to turn back to its old ways, reformers claim - adding that the securities scandal should not be allowed to prevent further development. 'I don't think we should restrict capital market activity,' says Mr Venkitaramanan. 'But the regulatory structures have to catch up.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Russian State Statistics Committee,  industrial output in the country in the first quarter of this  year fell in comparison with the same period of last year by  nearly 25 percent. A year ago the analogous index amounted to  only 19.3 percent. About 5,000 enterprises were forced to  suspend production in the first quarter in the majority of cases  because of problems with the sale of output. INTERFAX notes  that at the beginning of last year the analogous stoppages  occurred for lack of components, fuel, and raw materials.</p>

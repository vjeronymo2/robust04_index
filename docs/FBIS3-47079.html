Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki  Kumano  said at a press conference, "I don't think our potential to  attain 3 percent level economic growth has changed so much,"  despite the current business conditions.    While noting cyclic factors, Kumano stressed the need for  implementation of middle- and long-term policies, both  macroeconomic and microeconomic, so as to realize the nation's  economic potential in the 21st century.    Kumano said the recent drop in the yen's value against the  U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets was not yet enough from  the viewpoint of corporate profitability.    "Companies were a bit relieved by the recent trend toward a  weaker yen, but you should not be too optimistic," Kumano said.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Channel 5 television 'should be digital' Plans to launch television channels using existing technology should be frozen until a full analysis can be carried out of the economics of digital television, a report being published today suggests. Mr Dermot Nolan, a director of Convergent Decisions Group, a new consultancy, argues that the launch of a new Channel 5 service in the UK using present analogue technology would be trapped in 'a twilight era'. Mr Nolan, who until recently specialised in digital broadcasting and telecommunications issues at consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says digital channels - broadcast from terrestrial transmitters - will be operational in five years. The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that it wants to readvertise a Channel 5 licence but it has asked the government if the frequencies are still available. Both the National Heritage Department and the Department of Trade and Industry are looking into the issues involved. There is a growing belief in industrialised countries that the radio spectrum is a vital resource and that it is inefficient to use it for analogue rather than digital television.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Action against two BCCI directors is dropped Two of five Abu Dhabi directors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have had litigation against them in the French courts dropped in exchange for a payment of FFr12m (Pounds 1.4m). Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, head of the private department of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, and Sheikh Khalifa Nasr Al Mansoori, a director of BCCI's French subsidiary, made the offer earlier this year to the Commercial Court of Paris. The deal, which has been accepted by the courts but is subject to appeal, still leaves charges outstanding against three other BCCI directors, who face a renewed hearing at the end of this month. Lawyers had originally made the offer in exchange for the release of all five directors from the action which had been brought by the French liquidators to BCCI, but reversed their position after the other three started legal action against Abu Dhabi. Mr Alfred Hartmann, Mr Yves Lamarche and Mr Johan Van Oenen sued Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder, at the end of June in what they said was an attempt to restore the damage which had been done to their reputations by the bank's collapse. After BCCI was closed by banking regulators in July 1991, lawyers were appointed to advise the board members of the different companies within the group. The three directors have been sued by the bank's liquidators in Luxembourg and this action continues alongside the litigation in France. Simmons &amp; Simmons, the law firm which acts for the government of Abu Dhabi, confirmed last week that Abu Dhabi had paid the legal bills until the time of the directors' action against it. The three non-Abu Dhabi directors switched in advance of their action to a US law firm. The correspondent firm in the UK, Warner Cranston, launched legal action earlier this month in an attempt to gain access to papers it claims relate to its clients.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER LAWN AND GARDEN MAINTENANCE  </P> <P> Yards are at a point where, unless you are bringing in food from the garden,  mowing the lawn and watering is about all you really need to do. By now you  should have mulched everything and the amount of water you need to use is  rather small, in spite of the heat. The lawn has had a light feeding so that it  stays green but doesn't outgrow the borders between mowings.  </P> <P> You've found that a watering that goes deep enough to throughly water the roots  only needs to be done once a week or perhaps twice, if the temperatures stays  in the 100s for too many days.  </P> <P> A few of your plants are making great strides in growing although the majority  of annuals are still plugging along. If they look tired, trim them.  </P> <P> If the lawn has been played on a lot and the soil seems to be compacting so  that water runs off rather than enters the ground, get the golfer in your  family to wear cleated shoes as he walks around the yard.  </P></p>

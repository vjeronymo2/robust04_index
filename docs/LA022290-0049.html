			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAIL CARRIER CONVICTED OF KILLING DOG  </P> <P> A Pacoima postman was convicted Wednesday of cruelty to animals for shooting a  dog to death while delivering mail on his Arleta route in December, saying the  dog had bitten him earlier.  </P> <P> Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, pleaded no contest to the felony charge in San  Fernando Municipal Court after the Los Angeles County district attorney's  office agreed to drop felony charges of carrying a concealed weapon and using a  firearm in a grossly negligent manner, Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. Lopez said.  </P> <P> Sterling had pleaded not guilty in January to all three charges. He could have  been sentenced to three years in state prison if convicted of all counts, Lopez  said. He now faces a maximum sentence of one year in county jail, 36 months  probation and a $20,000 fine, Lopez said.  </P> <P> Sentencing was scheduled for March 29.  </P> <P> "Our office felt the crux of the matter was felony cruelty to animals," Lopez  said. "It's a good disposition."  </P> <P> Sterling was arrested Dec. 26 after he shot Skippy, a German shepherd mixed  breed, just as the dog's owner, Tammie Brody, emerged from her house to give  him a bottle of vodka for Christmas. Brody said Sterling "freaked out" and  fired a .22-caliber revolver at the dog, which she said was not menacing him.  </P> <P> But Sterling's attorney, Salvatore P. Ciulla, said the dog attacked him, and  Sterling told police after his arrest that the dog had bitten him on previous  occasions.  </P> <P> An examination by a private veterinarian, at the family's request, concluded  that Skippy had been hit by one bullet in the left side from the rear,  indicating that he was facing away from the gun when hit.  </P> <P> Brody, in an interview, expressed satisfaction with the plea arrangement.  </P> <P> "I'm just very pleased with the Postal Service and the Foothill Division of the  Los Angeles Police Department for the support I've gotten, and I think it's  because of that that he was convicted," she said. "I just wanted justice done,  not blood."  </P> <P> Prosecutors said felony charges were brought against Sterling because he was on  probation for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place and because he had  been convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse in 1982.  </P> <P> Skippy was buried Jan. 3 at a Calabasas pet cemetery in an elaborate $685  ceremony. The Postal Service picked up the tab.  </P></p>

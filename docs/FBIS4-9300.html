			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bukoshi: Future Peace Talks on </F> Balkans Should Include Kosova" -- issued by the Democratic  League of Kosova]    [Text] In a statement issued yesterday, prime minister of  the republic of Kosova Dr. Bujar Bukoshi said that an  international summit on Bosnia, proposed Tuesday by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and endorsed by President Clinton should  be broadened to also include the Kosova question. "Peace will  never come to the Balkans until the repression by Serbia of 2  Million Albanians in Kosova is lifted and independence is  granted to the republic of Kosova. The Kosova issue must be in  the agenda of any international conference on the Balkans." Dr.  Bukoshi called on the United Nations, the U.S., the European  Union to fully include Kosova in the peace process. "No true  peace can occur in the Balkans until there is an end to the  brutal Serbian repression which continues unabated in our  republic," the statement says.</p>

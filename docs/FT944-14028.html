			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Tourists lose their taste for Pollards Cornish ice cream One of Britain's last independent manufacturers of Cornish ice cream, the traditional seaside treat, has gone into receivership, blaming tourists' lack of appetite. Pollards Cornish Ice Cream has been churning out the high fat product - estimated calories 100 per cone - for more than 50 years, but it called in KPMG Peat Marwick after seeing demand melt away. 'It's not been a good ice cream year despite the hot summer weather,' according to one of the directors at the St Blazey plant in Cornwall. 'Tourist numbers in the south-west have fallen and they're spending less.' The failure of the company, which produced 150,000 litres of ice cream a week in the peak summer season, follows a shake-out across the industry. Mr Geoffrey Molloy, chairman of the Ice Cream Federation, said: 'It's a very difficult business. Manufacturers with limited resources will find it difficult to survive because it is so weather-dependent, and the best of the summer came before the school holidays.' The federation, representing companies supplying 80 per cent of the market, warned that unless Pollards can be sold as a going concern, there would be only one large ice cream manufacturer left in Cornwall - Jeffrey's, the Allied Foods subsidiary. The St Blazey company is no stranger to financial upset. Pollards Confections, its former parent, went into liquidation last year with borrowings of Pounds 1.6m. Mr Trevor Pollard, a former director of the family business, blamed its collapse on lenders who encouraged it to over-expand ahead of a possible stock market flotation. 'We sold the ice cream business to a management buy-out team, but they have obviously had a difficult time. It's a very sorry state of affairs,' he said.</p>

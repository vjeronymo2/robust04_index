			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Blagg to cut debt with rights issue Blagg, the building suppliers merchant, is to reduce borrowings with a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise about Pounds 318,000. The issue is of 15.9m new ordinary 2p shares at par. The USM-quoted group also announced a substantial fall in pre-tax profit from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 8,000 for the six months to April 30. The fall, on turnover down from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 1.25m, was because of an exceptional credit of Pounds 1.49m the previous year, arising from group restructure. Earnings per share were 0.01p (9.47p); excluding exceptionals, the previous year's figure was 0.1p.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / BSkyB's posters 'trivialise violence' The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld two separate complaints against British Sky Broadcasting about its poster advertising, accusing the company of trivialising violent crime. The ASA findings, published today, follow a request on Monday by the Independent Television Commission for BSkyB to purge images of Joseph Stalin from future television advertisements. The first poster objected to by the ASA was headlined 'The Simpsons. You saw it first on Sky' next to a police photograph of OJ Simpson, the former American football player accused of murder. The photograph was captioned 'Sky News. On the hour, every hour, 24 hours'. The ASA said it considered it offensive 'to trivialise a crime of this nature by linking it with the cartoon series' of the Simpson family. The second complaint concerned a poster featuring the chalk outline of a dead body with an erect penis. The poster was headlined 'Cause of death: Madonna' and advertised a film on Sky's movie channel. The ASA said it was concerned about the use of the image, 'particularly in the context of a poster advertisement'. BSkyB said the poster was part of a campaign 'characterised by irreverence, youthful energy, wit and sense of fun'. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB.</p>

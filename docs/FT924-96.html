			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Nordic currency support The Nordic central banks' revision and expansion of their short-term currency support system was not linked to the floating of three Nordic currencies, said Mr Kjell Peter Soderlund, head of the Central Bank Policy Department at the Bank of Finland, Reuter reports from Helsinki. He said the existing agreement was revised because it was outdated. Under the revised agreement the Finnish, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian central banks are entitled to borrow the equivalent of Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.6bn) and the central bank of Iceland up to Ec200m. Also each central bank is obliged to provide support up to the equivalent of Ecu1bn and Iceland up to Ecu100m.</p>

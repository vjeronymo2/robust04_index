			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Observer: Vox pop Elizabeth Symons is that unusual creature, a popular civil servant. Well, popular enough to be re-elected general secretary of the First Division Association, the senior civil servants' union. Symons, aged 42, has sometimes seemed a voice in a veritable wilderness, speaking out for an independent, impartial civil service in an era of privatisation, market testing and greater competition for Whitehall's top jobs. An effective television performer, she has defended the values of the independent British public service. Her 10,700 members are clearly grateful; normally they are unable to defend themselves in public, a galling situation when daft political decisions not of their taking are pinned on to them. Her re-election should also ensure the continuation of a little brightness at the Trades Union Congress. The printers' Brenda Dean and the university lecturers' Diana Warwick have gone; Symons is now the sole remaining female general secretary on the ruling general council.</p>

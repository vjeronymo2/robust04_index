			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 13 Apr (MENA) -- The newspaper AL-WAFD writes  that the nondeterrent NATO strike against the Serbs allowed the  Serbian reaction to be tyrannical and frightful. Using various  types of weapons, the Serbian troops poured their wrath on the  Muslims surrounded in Gorazde, the paper says.    In an editorial today, the mouthpiece of the opposition Wafd  Party blames the UN Security Council for what is happening to  the Bosnian Muslims, saying the UN resolutions lacked the  necessary measures to deter the aggressors.    The paper expresses surprise at the stance by NATO, the  owner  of the biggest military force, which sent one plane once and two  planes another time to attack Serbian positions.    It describes the American stance as insufficient, the  international stance as feeble, and the Russian stance as odd,  because it tolerates the slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia and  threatens a fierce war if the air strikes against Serbs continue.    AL-WAFD notes that Russia's stance costs it the sympathy of  the Third World, sympathy that it has gained over the years,  because it is turning from a state that defends peace into a  state that propagates war and the killing of innocent people.</p>

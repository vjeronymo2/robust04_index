			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, the  governing coalition's chief tactician, on Monday [17 January]  ended his two-month-long, all-out war with the media and resumed  his regular news conferences.    "Today I resume my press conferences as were held  previously," Ozawa told a crowd of reporters, breaking silence  for the first time since November 8 last year.    Reflecting Ozawa's political clout, a number of reporters  asked the Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general for  comment on wide-ranging issues.    Ozawa said nothing new, however, sidestepping all questions  on his alleged entanglement in a widening money scandal  involving the nation's leading general contractors.    Concerning 5 million yen he accepted from scandal-ridden  Kajima Corp. in December 1992, the coalition's key strategist  repeated his earlier statements that he took the cash as a legal  political donation, not as a back-door fund.    In the November 8 press briefing, he acknowledged the  acceptance of the money but stated he received the 5 million yen  in accordance with the law.    Ozawa had since refused to hold news conferences following  the clash between him and the press, which first broke in  October.    The row erupted after Ozawa barred the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  and the SANKEI SHIMBUN from his regular press conferences,  accusing the national dailies of carrying inaccurate stories  without asking him for comment.    Ozawa dismissed demands by journalists from the two news  organizations and 14 others to lift the ban, insisting his news  conferences were "a service to the press" rather than a duty to  the public.    The lawmaker, who is said to have masterminded the ouster of  the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from power last August, had  scrapped the practice of holding briefings with reporters on his  beat and met the press only at his "open" news conference.    The journalists from 16 major Japanese news organizations  insisted Ozawa's action ran counter to his policy of opening his  press conferences to all media, including magazines and foreign  media.    At the outset of Monday's 30-minute press briefing, Ozawa  said he decided to resume his news conferences because he and  the 16 news organizations reached an accord that they will try  to resolve future differences through dialogue.    On the issue of political reform, he voiced confidence in  the  passage of a package of government-sponsored political reform  bills before the current Diet session ends January 29.    Ozawa said that after the passage of the reform legislation,  on whose enactment Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked  his political fate, economy-spurring measures and administrative  reform would be high on the agenda.    He declined comment on a reported shakeup of the Hosokawa  cabinet after the passage of the reform package, saying only  that the premier has the authority to reshuffle the cabinet.    Last June, Ozawa broke away from the LDP with his loyalists  to create Shinseito, which subsequently joined hands with six  other parties to deprive the LDP of its 38-year hold on power.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: North Broken Hill takes Dominion Mining stake North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and equipment group which has been debt-free since selling its paper manufacturing and merchanting operations last year, has acquired a 14.9 per cent interest in Dominion Mining, a smaller Western Australian gold mining company. The stake was purchased in two parts. A 4.95 per cent holding was built up through market purchases 'over recent weeks'. A larger, 9.9 per cent interest was then bought from Gold Mines of Australia, a small mining company which earlier this year launched a bid for Dominion. North acquired the latter stake at GMA's entry cost of ADollars 19.4m (USDollars 14.2m), or about 45 cents per Dominion share. GMA decided not to press ahead with its ADollars 182m bid for Dominion last July, after the target company granted NBHP an option to take an 80 per cent interest in Dominion's ADollars 500m Yakabindie nickel project in Western Australia.</p>

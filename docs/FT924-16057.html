			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (7): Between Tees and Tyne - The North-East CAR MAKERS Nissan, semiconductor manufacturers Fujitsu and bearings producers NSK have more than Japanese ownership in common. All three have big European manufacturing plants between the Tyne and the Tees, in the three former new towns of Washington, Aycliffe and Peterlee. The plants' proximity is not a coincidence; the positive experience of NSK, north east England's first Japanese company when it set up in Peterlee in 1976, was influential in Nissan's choice in 1984 of Washington for its European car plant, at Pounds 900m Europe's biggest single Japanese investment. In 1989, the growing number of Japanese companies operating successfully in north east England was a factor in Fujitsu's choice of Aycliffe for its Pounds 400m microchip plant. So too - as well as the clean water needed in microchip manufacture - were good road communications, a greenfield site and the availability of suitable labour. It is sobering, however, to reflect that after the decades of effort and money put into creating these three new towns, even after their proven success in attracting inward investment from many countries and fostering home grown companies, their areas suffer unemployment well above the national average. Without the towns, the painful consequences of the rundown of traditional heavy industries would have been much more acute. But although the three fought successfully to postpone their winding up until 1988, Peterlee especially could argue that the end of new town status came much too soon. Created in 1948 to offer better housing for miners' families and jobs for their wives, Peterlee's job creation remit broadened as the Durham coalfield declined. By 1988 its industrial estates provided more than 7,000 jobs. Yet, says East Durham Development Agency chief executive Mr Eddie Morley, the town cannot keep up with the new tide of pit closures. In the last 18 months two collieries have closed in East Durham, where Peterlee is located, costing 2,000 jobs, and the district's last two, together employing 2,400, are under threat. Moreover, Peterlee faces stiff competition for investment from the new Enterprise Zone in nearby Sunderland and two government-funded Development Corporations, in Tyne and Wear and Teesside. And Easington district council is still having difficulty maintaining the new town's flat-roofed housing. Aycliffe, near Darlington, and Peterlee each has a population of about 25,000. At winding up, Aycliffe, designated in 1947, had just under 10,000 jobs. Today it has 9,700, having suffered several substantial closures including GEC's telephone handset plant, since refurbished and relet to a number of smaller companies. On the plus side, Aycliffe has Fujitsu, employing 425 in a plant in which Pounds 240m will have been invested by the end of 1992. The company hopes eventually to employ 1,200. Unified in 1963 under a single development corporation, Peterlee and Aycliffe's residual assets are now owned by Helical Bar. About 150 acres of industrial land remains on Peterlee's estates and 40 acres at Aycliffe's. Asking price is Pounds 60,000 per acre. Washington, designated in 1947, now forms part of the borough of Sunderland within Tyne and Wear. The capture of Nissan was a team effort by North East councils, economic development bodies and trades unions. The project has had tremendous impact on the entire region, by creating jobs, boosting morale and influencing attitudes to quality and working practices. The Nissan plant, due to employ 4,600 at Sunderland by the year end, is now one of north east England's largest workplaces, exporting 80 per cent of its cars to 30 countries including Japan. Another 1,400 people work on the Pounds 900m site in related ventures. Other Washington employers include outdoor clothing manufacturers Berghaus and hologram specialists Applied Holographics. The town's residual assets are managed by the Commission for the New Towns. Substantially bigger than Peterlee and Aycliffe - its population is now 61,500 - Washington has a larger shopping complex, the Galleries. Strategically located near the A1(M) and A19, Washington is also currently a focus for new hotel development. Campanile UK is building an 80 bedroom hotel. And imposing Usworth Hall, once the National Coal Board's regional base and then Washington Development Corporation's HQ, was in July sold for Pounds 3.5m to Persimmon Homes (NE) and DJA Properties. The purchasers plan to turn the hall into a luxury hotel and build houses in its grounds.</p>

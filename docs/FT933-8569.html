			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Banks taken to task - At a Glance The voluntary Code of Banking Practice, introduced last year and currently under review, has been too limited, too flawed, and banks have been too slow to implement it, the Consumers' Association said. In a submission to the review committee, it said banks had adopted a 'parsimonious approach' to interpreting and applying the code, particularly regarding services it did not specifically deal with, such as the administration of wills. New areas which should be covered by the code included advance notification of charges and interest, compensation for home banking customers affected by fraud, and informing customers if their savings accounts were superseded by new accounts paying higher interest rates. The association warned that if standards of consumer protection did not improve, a statutory alternative to the code would become essential.</p>

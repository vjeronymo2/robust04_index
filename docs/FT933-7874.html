			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Airlines set to lose Dollars 2bn this year THE WORLD'S airlines will lose another Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) this year in spite of a steady recovery in passenger traffic, Mr Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said yesterday. This is a sharp improvement on last year's Dollars 4.8bn loss but will bring the total lost by the world's airlines to Dollars 13.5bn over the past four years. The forecast will add to the pressures facing the administration of President Bill Clinton to act on airline losses. A US commission is scheduled today to submit a report on ways 'to ensure a strong competitive airline industry'. Mr Jeanniot blamed governments for the 'sorry state' of the airline industry. 'Some governments, particularly in North America and Europe, have confused deregulation or liberalisation with laissez-faire,' said Mr Jeanniot, a former president of Air Canada. He attacked the imposition of fuel taxes, as planned by President Clinton's administration, and said governments should consider measures such as guaranteeing loans to troubled carriers. He conceded that the airlines had contributed to their problems by adding too much capacity in the face of limited demand. Capacity on airlines rose 7 per cent in the first half of 1993, while traffic grew at only 6 per cent, according to Iata figures. 'There is 4 per cent more over-capacity now than four years ago,' said Mr Tom Murphy, a senior director at Iata. 'That's the equivalent of more than 400 Boeing 747s flying empty across the Atlantic Ocean every day.' The over-capacity was likely to fall slowly and airlines would not return to significant profits until 1995, said Mr Jeanniot. The latest figures from Iata indicate the slowness of recovery in demand. The first half of 1993 saw a further decline in companies' travel budgets. Surveys of business travellers show that 28 per cent have seen budgets cut this year. This year's response to lower budgets is to travel less; last year, the tendency was to buy a cheaper ticket. However, Mr Jeanniot said that when the upturn came airlines would recover quickly. 'Fuel prices and interest rates are about as low as they have ever been - we should be making a lot of money right now. We have been passing on productivity improvements to passengers. We must hang on to them for a few years. Fares don't have to go up.' Mr Jeanniot said there were still obstacles to further productivity gains. Airports and the world's air traffic control networks, for example, had not improved efficiency as much as the airlines. Airlines paid Dollars 12bn in airport fees and air traffic control charges in 1991. Total revenues that year were more than Dollars 200bn. He said recovery was also being inhibited by the uncertainty of future government regulations. As well as the US commission, the industry is being studied by a European Community comite des sages (committee of wise men), the EC council of transport ministers and the OECD.</p>

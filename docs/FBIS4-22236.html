			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mart Laar, Prime Minister of Estonia, by </F> Grant Gukasov, under the "Estonia" rubric; place and date not  given: "Finland Is Not a Model for Us"]    [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar answers questions  from MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI's staff correspondent in the Baltics.    [Gukasov] If Russia had not proclaimed itself the legal heir  of the USSR, would relations with the Baltic countries be so  strained?    [Laar] They undoubtedly would have taken on a completely  different tonality, without the bass notes, in any case. The  difficulty of today's situation consists in that Russia is  actually not the legal heir to the USSR, whose legacy includes  the numerous crimes of the previous regime, but is the heir  mainly when it is advantageous to it, the great empire with all  the claims to a mighty past. It is no accident that recently  Russian politicians have been speaking more and more openly at  the highest levels about restoration of the empire, masking this  objective with the idea of protection of the Russian-speaking  population in the countries of the former USSR. It is precisely  on this soil that there are frequent disagreements between  Estonian and Russian diplomats.    [Gukasov] Why did the collapse of other empires--the  British,  the French--take place in a much more civilized way? In any  case, the colonists were decent people and were in a condition  to determine their own fate for themselves.    [Laar] I would like to believe that, but my specialty is  history, and therefore I can say that the disintegration of any  empire has always been bloody. Our peculiarity lies in the fact  that Bolshevism made everyone equally poor.    [Gukasov] Estonian politicians love to use Finland as an  example. But after World War II, Presidents Paasikivi and  Kekkonen did everything possible to maintain normal relations  mainly with their great neighbor to the east. It was because of  this that Finland achieved economic prosperity and well-being.    [Laar] Undoubtedly, the postwar Finnish leaders were able to  draw the country away from the well-known Czechoslovak scenario  and derive economic advantage for all of their people. It is  useful for us Estonians to study the history of relations  between Finland and its great eastern neighbor because we are  very similar in terms of national character. But we must see  that there are many difficulties in this country's economy and,  incidentally, precisely because of its former orientation toward  the USSR. Orientation toward Russia alone is very dangerous,  especially for small countries. We cannot tie our destiny to  such a large ship, on which anything could happen. All it has to  do is list, and we will sink to the bottom.    [Gukasov] Is it possible to consider nationalism a struggle  for privileges for a particular group of people?    [Laar] We in Estonia have no privileged nationality, because  we are creating a rule-of-law state, where social relations are  built on the basis of citizenship. And this--I want to  emphasize--is in no way linked to nationality. I was surprised  by the statement from Andrey Kozyrev to the effect that the  Baltic states give citizenship according to nationality. I do  not know about anyone else, but the Russian foreign affairs  minister is quite well informed particularly about the Estonian  law on citizenship. And I do not know what kind of country  Estonia would be if all the leading posts were by directive  filled only by Estonians.    [Gukasov] Your attitude toward the Representative Assembly  (PA) of the Russian-speaking population of Estonia.    [Laar] Favorable. Recently the PA has been playing a useful  role in Estonian society. A positive change has been made in the  Russian society of Estonia. We are no longer arguing about  whether they have to learn the Estonian language or not. We are  speaking about how to do this better.    [Gukasov] On 31 August 1994, the Russian Army will leave  Estonia. Will that put an end to all the problems?    [Laar] I hope that this event will take place at the  scheduled time. We demand the withdrawal of the troops at all  forums because this "sticking point" in the Baltic region is  only to Russia's disadvantage. That same Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs is constantly irritated: How is it that such  little children create such big problems? Many Western diplomats  have told me that whenever they want to break off a conversation  with their Russian colleagues, all they have to do is mention  Estonia or Latvia. The Russian diplomats immediately fall silent  and leave without concealing their irritation.    Long ago we prepared entire files of documents that would  put  things in motion immediately after the troop withdrawal. A year  ago I sent Mr. Chernomyrdin a draft agreement concerning  transit. And there was no answer. There is no logic in this. If  the military problem is solved, the other spheres will approach  the norm one after another.</p>

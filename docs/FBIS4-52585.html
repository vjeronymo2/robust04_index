			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Koshiro Ishida, director general of the </F> Management and Coordination Agency and Komeito chairman, by an  unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How will secession of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition affect an  administrative reform program?    [Ishida] When the former cabinet decided on a midterm  administrative reform outline, cabinet ministers from the SDPJ  were also among those who agreed on it. SDPJ Chairman Murayama  also said the party will take responsibility for what it is  responsible for. Thus, the SDPJ has to fulfill its  responsibility for administrative reform. As for deregulation,  the government plans to submit 40 relevant bills to the Diet as  one package during the current session. As for the information  disclosure system, the government will ask the administrative  reform committee, which will soon be established, to fully  discuss the establishment of the system and its legislation.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet is called "a cabinet led  by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito."    [Ishida] It was inevitable for Prime Minister Hata to give  many cabinet posts to these two parties. But we do not need to  feel so badly about it. The important thing is for the  government to administer state affairs by placing emphasis on  its policies. Tax reform is also a demand from society. The  government has to promote reform while hearing opinions of the  opposition parties.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does Komeito plan to participate in the  new parliamentary group Kaishin [Innovation]?    [Ishida] I think our party should consider joining the group  and fully discuss it. From now on, each party should work to  reorganize the existing parties into two forces. Otherwise,  small parties will be defeated in the general election to be  held under a single-seat constituency system.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think there is a possibility that  the next general election following the dissolution of the lower  house will be held under the current multiple-seat constituency  system.    [Ishida] Some people have said it is inevitable to hold the  general election under the multiple-seat system. This opinion  is problematic because if the election is held under the current  system, political reform will be delayed for two or three years.  The people will never allow such a delay. We should deal with  this issue after enacting at an early date the bills on new  constituency boundaries for the single-seat electoral system.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The chief cabinet secretary said it is  possible that the general election will be held in July under  the new electoral system and without a period needed to make the  new system known to the public.    [Ishida] Unlike the past, there are many news organizations  covering political affairs. I think what he said is possible if  the government informs the people of the new system through the  news media.</p>

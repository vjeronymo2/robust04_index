			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the IWC adopted this method of quantifying need, members of the IWC Aboriginal Subsistence Subcommittee noted that the quantification was based on a large but incomplete series of data on historical bowhead landings. It was also noted that the quantification used an inconsistent data base period. The DOI study was initiated to correct these deficiencies. To complete the series of data on historical bowhead whale landings to the extent possible, the study undertook a comprehensive review of available published and unpublished sources of bowhead landings. Remaining gaps are unlikely to be significantly reduced with further searches for historic data on bowhead landings. The data resulting from this study also permitted the use of a consistent historical base period for the calculation of need. In the prior analysis, the base periods varied from 1940 to 1970 and 1950 to 1970. The base period now begins in 1910, the year following the cessation of commercial whaling in the Arctic, and ends in 1969, prior to the period of unusually high bowhead harvests in the unique economic circumstances of the 1970s. Therefore, applying the additional landed bowhead data and the longer period to the accepted method of quantifying need, results in a current cultural and subsistence need of 41 landed whales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

Given the above-stated estimates of replacement yields of 92 (lower bound) to 254 whales for the point estimate recruited into the population annually, an aboriginal/subsistence catch can be permitted in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The catch limit for bowhead whales for the years 1992&hyph;1994, established by the IWC, is 141 strikes plus 13 strikes carried over from the previous block quota with no more than 54 whales struck and no more than 41 landed in any one year. Of the 154 total strikes for 1992&hyph;1994, 50 bowhead whales were struck and 38 were landed in 1992, and 52 were struck and 41 landed in 1993. Therefore, the number under consideration for allocation to the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission for the 1994 catch limit is 52 strikes or 41 landed whales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

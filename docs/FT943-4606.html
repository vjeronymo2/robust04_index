			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / 85% concerned by 'green' problems Eighty-five per cent of people are concerned about environmental problems, but most are optimistic about improvements, according to a government survey of public attitudes to the environment. The national survey showed that most people thought environmental clean-ups should be paid for by those causing them, even if this meant that the cost of goods and services had to go up. Many of the respondents said they were trying to help the environment by recycling paper and glass, but only a quarter were cutting back on car use, and just 8 per cent said they had switched to public transport.</p>

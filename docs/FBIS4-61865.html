			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Pakhomov] </F>   [Text] New York May 11 TASS -- The U.S. National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to launch  automatic space probes to the planet Pluto and the sun with  Russia's help. Alan Stern, representative of the  administration, told ITAR-TASS by telephone that this project,  dubbed "fire and ice", was now being discussed at top level in  the United States and Russia.    According to Stern, the idea of enlisting Russian scientists  and experts in the programme for the exploration of Pluto, the  only planet of the solar system that has still not been reached  by automatic probes, is explained by NASA's current financial  straits. According to expert calculations, the cost of launching  two space probes by means of the most powerful American "Titan"  carrier-rockets, would by far exceed one billion dollars. This  made the Americans think seriously about the possibility of  launching the Pluto probes by means of the Russian "Proton"  carrier-rocket.    However, Stern said that NASA's policy towards international  scientific missions is that every side involved in them should  make its own contribution, not merely provide its technology or  render paid services. The Russians, he noted, did not like the  idea of exchanging their Proton rocket for the right to instal  on board the American probe its instrument, weighing not more  than two kilograms, and to paste a label with a Russian symbol  on the external surface of the probe. The Space Research  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences moved to "add" a  Russian jettisonable sonde to each of the two American probes.  They are to be released from the probes approximately 40,000  kilometres from Pluto and to descend: one on the surface of the  planet and the other -- on Pluto's natural satellite Haron. The  sondes are to carry either equipment for measuring the  composition of Pluto's atmosphere or photo- and cine- cameras.    NASA has still not decided what American equipment will be  installed on board the probes, but experts of the Pasadena Jet  Propulsion Laboratory in California, who specialise in long-term  projects for the exploration of planets of the solar system,  move to install only four instruments.    Pluto is the most distant known planet from the sun. It was  discovered 62 years ago. Its period of revolution around the  sun is 250.6 years. The composition of the planet's atmosphere  is unknown. Welsy Huntress, chief of the NASA department for  studying the solar system, is sure that the Pluto fight  programme should be among the first on the list of scientific  priorities. NASA believes that it is inexpedient to further put  off its elaboration. In order to direct a probe towards Pluto  it is necessary to use Jupiter's gravitational field to boost  it. This will be possible only if the space vehicle is launched  in the period between 2001 and 2003.    The solar project also stipulates the launching of an  American probe, which would split in two upon approaching the  sun: into a Russian part carrying an optical telescope, and an  American part -- with instruments to study the physics of the  plasma on board.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brooke determined to act on press THE almost insuperable political difficulties for any government in taking a firm stance on press regulation were tacitly underlined yesterday by Mr Peter Brooke's Commons statement on Sir David Calcutt QC's report. The national heritage secretary's gratitude for the review of what he described as an 'exceptionally difficult and controversial subject' may have been heartfelt. But, while legal steps safeguarding personal privacy will be taken, his claim that the review has 'significantly' moved forward the public debate on press self-regulation is less credible. The Calcutt report proposed not self-regulation, but statutory controls enshrined in law. By rejecting that, the government is back at the drawing board. Mr Brooke's statement signalled that the government will act on the report's proposals for new criminal legislation to cope with trespass, electronic bugging and photographic invasions of privacy. He agreed to take up, among other things, a proposal to examine a civil remedy - the law of tort - to protect victims of undue intrusion. The government risks opening a legal Pandora's box by examining how the Data Protection Act might contain provisions relevant to the debate - a move that raises the question of the public's right to scrutinise newspaper files. Mitigating provisions to protect legitimate press scrutiny on the grounds of public interest or informing the public about an individual's discharge of his public functions were also accepted. In his statement, Mr Brooke broadly endorsed Sir David's caustic views of the Press Complaints Commission. Commending the report's conclusions as 'compelling', he said that the PCC was not an 'effective regulator' or truly independent. On Sir David's central proposal - the creation of a tribunal with legal powers to punish breaches of a code of conduct - Mr Brooke was unable to agree. Citing the constitutional significance of such a change and arguing that it would depart from the country's traditional approach to press regulation, he declared: 'The government would be extremely reluctant to pursue that route.' Instead, the government has promised to outline its conclusions more fully on January 29 when Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP for Hammersmith, presents his bill to create a right-of-reply law. Final decisions will also await the findings of the Commons national heritage committee and views of the press on the Calcutt report. Responding to questions, Mr Brooke indicated sympathy for suggestions that the PCC should be strengthened by the introduction of independent members and for additional powers to impose fines on publications that breached the standards it laid down. There was support from some Conservative backbenchers for a suggestion by Mr Joe Ashton (Lab Bassetlaw) that those who suffered at the hands of the press should be able to resort to a legal body with a similar status to industrial tribunals. Mr Brooke said a central consideration for the government must be how the private individual could receive efficient and financial redress. Officials added later that the question of the availability of legal aid was one of the central issues to be resolved when the question of creating a civil tort on privacy is examined.</p>

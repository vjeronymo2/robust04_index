			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, June 13 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croats and  Muslims continue violating the latest truce by repeatedly  attacking the territory of the Bosnian Serb Republic, Bosnian  Serb military sources said on Monday [13 June]. The truce was  signed by the Bosnian belligerents in Geneva last week and came  into effect at noon on Friday. The same sources told TANJUG's  reporter that the Croats had stepped up attacks in northern  Bosnia and that Muslim provocations had been reported in many  areas.    Bosnian Croat forces and regular army troops of neighbouring  Croatia continuously opened fire from small arms along the  entire line of separation in the area of Orasje, a Croat enclave  in northern Bosnia. Croatian artillery also shelled Serb  settlements and the town of Brcko. The Serb side lodged a  strong protest with the U.N. command and special U.N. envoy  Yasushi Akashi, warning them that the attack on the Bosnian Serb  Republic from Bosnian and Croatian territory might have serious  consequences.    The Muslims were opening fire from small arms and tanks on  Serb positions in the areas of Gradacac and Teslic in northern  Bosnia. Provocative actions, mostly from snipers, directed  against Serb civilian targets on the right bank of the Drina and  check points on the line of disengagement were renewed from the  U.N.-protected Muslim enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    Muslim provocative actions in the areas of Olovo and Kladanj  in eastern Bosnia also continued, Bosnian Serb military sources  said and added that a part of the Serb municipality of Zvornik  had come under Muslim mortar fire.    In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb military sources reported sporadic  Muslim sniper and infantry fire aimed against the Serb sections  of Nedzarici and Grbavica, while the suburb of Ilijas was  shelled by rifle-grenades.</p>

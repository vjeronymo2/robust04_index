			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / PNG warns on mining interference PAPUA New Guinea (PNG) yesterday warned foreign governments and environmental organisations to stay out of a controversy over the impact of mining on its river systems and coastal waters. The warning followed revelations that Mr Paul Keating, the Australian Prime Minister, delivered a letter during an official visit in April which criticised environmental standards at the Ok Tedi copper and gold mine. The mine has been strongly criticised by local politicians in PNG's remote western province, close to the border with Indonesian Irian Jaya. The provincial government has threatened to close the mine, but has not yet carried out its threat. Ok Tedi Mining (OTML), the company which operates the mine, claims any environmental damage which has occurred is outweighed by the economic benefit to PNG of substantial gold and copper production. OTML is owned by BHP, (30 per cent), the PNG government (20 per cent) and a group of smaller shareholders. The mine is operated under an environmental agreement between OTML and the central government.</p>

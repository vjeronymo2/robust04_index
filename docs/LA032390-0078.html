			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEIZED TAPES MAY BE EXCLUDED IN MENENDEZ MURDER CASE  </P> <P> Tape recordings believed to be the central piece of evidence in the case  against Beverly Hills brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, accused of murdering  their parents, may be excluded from their trial because of legal proceedings  initiated by the defendants' psychologist.  </P> <P> Therapist L. Jerome Oziel, who already is on probation with the state  psychology committee for ethics violations in another case, is contesting the  constitutionality of the seizure of records from his home and the breach of  doctor-therapist confidentiality their admission as evidence would create.  </P> <P> "He is obligated (by California law) to submit the issue of confidentiality to  a Superior Court," his attorney, Bradley Brunon, explained to reporters after a  90-minute closed-door meeting with Santa Monica Superior Court Judge James  Albracht, attorneys for the Menendez brothers, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott  Alhadeff, who will prosecute the case.  </P> <P> Albracht said the situation is so unusual that he was at a loss as to what to  call the motion, which seeks the records' return. The judge set a hearing on  the matter for April 4, and ordered that all related documents and motions be  sealed in the meantime.  </P> <P> "This is a very serious issue," the judge added, because it involves "potential  prejudice to the defendants and violation of legal rights."  </P> <P> The prosecution contends that the confidentiality usually accorded  therapist-patient exchanges does not apply "where there is a continuing threat  of violence to others," in this case alleged threats against Oziel.  </P> <P> The defense argues that such exchanges are protected by law and should neither  be made public nor used in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Last August, the two brothers reported finding the bodies of their parents,  entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty, in their Beverly  Hills mansion. Both victims had been hit repeatedly with shotgun blasts fired  at close range.  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege that the two were slain by their sons for financial gain, an  estate estimated at $14 million. A $400,000 life insurance policy already has  been paid to the brothers.  </P> <P> The defendants are to be arraigned Monday in Beverly Hills Municipal Court on  two counts each of murder with special circumstances that, if they are  convicted, could send them to the gas chamber. They are being held without  bail.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has characterized the psychologist's  tapes as "very important."  </P> <P> However, Alhadeff said the prosecution has other evidence and will go forward  with or without the tapes, which were seized in a search of Oziel's Sherman  Oaks home hours before the arrest of Lyle Menendez, 22, earlier this month. His  19-year-old brother, Erik, was playing in a tennis tournament in Israel, but  returned to Los Angeles to surrender.  </P> <P> The search was carried out by a "special master" -- an independent attorney  appointed by the court when a search warrant involves the records of a  psychotherapist who is not a suspect in a crime.  </P> <P> Under the procedure, the special master is to seize and seal such records, then  take them to court.  </P> <P> However, in the Menendez case, the police reviewed the materials before they  were turned over to the special master, according to a law enforcement source.  The defense contends such a review violates their clients' right to a fair  trial.  </P></p>

Let us hear a  telephone report by the spokesman of the President's Press and  Information Office, Aida Shehu:    [Shehu] Yesterday evening, President Berisha held a meeting  in the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce. Besides members of the  Malaysian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  representatives of firms that are members of the Chambers of  Commerce and Industry, foreign investors operating in Malaysia,  representatives of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Chinese and  Indian businessmen, etc., were present.    President of this chamber Mr. Vanazmi gave the opening  speech. In his welcoming speech, he expressed pleasure at  President Berisha's visit to the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce  and stressed the possibilities of expanding economic relations  between our two countries, the interest of Malaysian and foreign  firms in the Albanian market, investments in Albania, and so on.    In his speech, President Berisha stressed that his visit to  Malaysia serves not only to expand relations at the political  level, but economically as well. He also expressed his  satisfaction over the great number of businessmen participating  in this meeting and their interest in Albania. Later, President  Berisha pointed out the arguments that favor foreign investors  operating in Albania, and precisely the economic reform that  destroyed the collective sector not only in the economy, but  also in the collectivist mentality of the people in our country.  He also mentioned the political stability created by the  support of the majority of the population for the Meksi  government and the new Albanian legislation, which offers  absolutely attractive possibilities for foreign investors, such  as the possibility of transferring capital and dividends,  renting land, a free hand with labor, and a young population  capable of work.    In the meeting with the president, the managers of the best  known Malaysian firms and foreign firms operating in Malaysia  expressed their intention to come to Albania and get acquainted  with the specific cooperation possibilities, especially now  after the creation of the complete legal framework for economic  cooperation between the two countries with the signing of five  agreements that guarantee security. President Berisha also  inaugurated the Center for Malaysian Promotion in Albania.    This morning, President Berisha held separate meetings with  Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and His Majesty  Sultan Azlan Shah, who guaranteed President Berisha the  agreements and their application. They also told Berisha that  the Malaysian Government will encourage investors and  investments in Albania and promised to help in the construction  of housing for the population, the education of students,  cooperation between the Albanian and Malaysian  telecommunications, and so on.    This morning, too, President Berisha left Kuala Lumpur after  ending his successful visit and departed for a one-day visit to  the island of Langkawi. The country authorities organized a  meeting at which the general region development manager gave a  briefing on the island's development prospects.    Later, the president paid a visit to a crocodile farm.    Tomorrow, Berisha will again hold talks in Langkawi and at  midday he will leave for Brunei.</p>

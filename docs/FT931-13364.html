			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Keeping it in the family has been the key to success - Investment trusts / Philip Coggan considers Lowland Investment Company THERE IS a distinct family air about the Lowland Investment Company, which is managed by the Henderson Administration group. The trust derived its name from the Henderson family's origins in the lowlands of Scotland. Its largest investment is in the Henderson management group (4.8 per cent of the portfolio as of September 30); and Lowland's largest shareholder (with a 23 per cent stake) is Witan, another Henderson-managed trust. The current manager of the trust is James Henderson, a member of the founding family, and eldest son of Lord Faringdon, chairman of Witan Investment Trust. Henderson, 31, who studied economics at Pembroke college, Cambridge, took over the trust management in mid-1990. Lowland was founded in 1963 as a means of giving younger fund managers within the Henderson group a trust to look after. Raymond Cazalet, the current chairman, was the first manager to take the helm. These familial links have brought success. Lowland produced the third best share price performance of all investment trusts over the last ten years, with a rise of 735 per cent*. Share price performance figures can be distorted by the effect of discounts but the trust is also top of its sector (UK income growth) in terms of net asset value growth over the same period. The objective of the trust is to produce an above-average dividend, which increases over time. James Henderson says his investment approach is to look for companies which can produce income growth, rather than opting for the ultra high yielders. He searches for companies with undervalued assets and earnings and ends up with some of the duller stocks that have not been in the headlines. Compared with TR City of London (profiled last week) the trust has a much greater concentration on the medium and smaller companies sectors. Only 40 per cent of Lowland's portfolio is in FT-SE 100 Index stocks, while 30 per cent is in medium-sized companies and 30 per cent in smaller. This concentration, says Henderson, has played a crucial part in the trust's success over the last decade. 'We've had exposure to the medium and smaller companies without being completely committed to them' he says. The trust's ten largest stakes are: Henderson, British Gas, British Airways, National Power, Prudential, Boots, GKN, Thames Water, Morgan Crucible and AAH. In terms of sectors, the trust currently has a heavy weighting in capital goods (29 per cent versus the All-Share weighting of 13 per cent). The rest of the portfolio is split 20 per cent consumer, 19 per cent financial and 32 per cent other groups. Although the trust is in the UK income sector, around 9 per cent of the portfolio is in Europe; but since getting income would be a problem if the portfolio had too heavy an overseas exposure, the trust is unlikely to put more than 25 per cent overseas. The trust's short term performance has been slightly less impressive than its 10 year record; as the graphs show, net asset value fell sharply in 1988 and 1990. Lowland has produced a slightly below average performance for its sector over three and five years. Currently the fund is taking a rather aggressive approach. It has a 15 per cent gearing level, having borrowed Pounds 6m of debentures and bank facilities of Pounds 4m (when a trust gears up, it hopes that equity returns will more than make up for the cost of borrowing money). 'This is the highest gearing we've had for a bit', says Henderson, 'over the last year, we became increasingly confident that we could find value in the medium term.' Analyst Hamish Buchan of County NatWest says Lowland is a much smaller trust than TR City and the shares are tightly held, with around 70 per cent of the equity in Henderson or Cazenove-related hands. This restricts liquidity, says Buchan but this is not too much of a problem for private investors. Buchan says Lowland is 'a sound and solid security for the individual', although he adds that the trust has been trading at a small premium to its asset value. Normally when investment trust shares go to a premium, investors start to look for alternative funds which are at a discount. However, Lowland's portfolio may benefit if the much awaited smaller company revival finally occurs. Key facts. The trust has net assets and a market capitalisation of around Pounds 54m, as of January 21. The net asset value was 230.7p, almost equal to the share price of 231p. The dividend yield is 4.9 per cent. The annual management charge is 0.4 per cent. Board. The board includes one Henderson employee, Richard Smith, who was the manager of the trust until 1990, and is still the managing director. The chairman is the first manager Raymond Cazalet, a former chairman of the Association of Investment Trust Companies; other directors are John Morrell, who is also a director of Law Debenture; John Kemp-Welch, a Cazenove partner; and Peter Troughton, a director of W H Smith. Savings scheme and Pep details. The minimum monthly investment for both the savings scheme and the personal equity plan is Pounds 100, with Pounds 2,000 for lump sums. There is a 1 per cent fee on both purchases and sales and an annual fee of Pounds 20. *According to figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Hasan Ali Mireh, the Somali Salvation Alliance  [SSA] spokesman in Nairobi, Kenya has described reports  published by THE NATION newspaper of Nairobi as unfounded,  fabricated lies. The reports said recently that representatives  of the SSA from the 12 organizations and the Somali National  Alliance [SNA] have met. The spokesman noted that the last  meeting between the SSA and the SNA was the one held in Addis  Ababa, Ethiopia in December, and that there had never been any  other meeting since. Dr. Hasan Ali described such reports as  having emanated from people who did not (?know) the truth, the  methodology of journalism, or the right of a person to express  factual truths.    Dr. Mireh said that the SSA committee for negotiations  responsible for talking with the SNA is meeting unilaterally in  Mogadishu, and is streamlining ways of continuing with  December's Addis Ababa talks.</p>

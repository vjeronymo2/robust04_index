Had it only been plaques and bosses... Growing tired of  spasmodic and senseless reforms, experienced officers are  leaving--those who did not go around chasing "skinheads" but  were doing serious work combating crime and espionage.    To explain what is happening at Lubyanka, Federal  Counterintelligence Service officers Sergey Bogdanov and Sergey  Vorobyev visited the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA investigations  department.    Yu. Shchekochikhin, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA investigations  department editor: What is really happening over there  these days?    S. Bogdanov, Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS)  officer: What is happening? The border troops are now an  independent service subordinate directly to the president. The  investigative department has been eliminated, as has the  administration for investigations and corresponding units on the  local level--in territorial administrations. These are probably  the most significant among structural changes.    Thanks to public pressure, so far rehabilitation work has  remained with us. GULAG veterans were extremely concerned that  corresponding units would be eliminated. So far this line of  work remains ours.    We now have about 75,000 staff members left.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: Where do your officers go?    S. Bogdanov: Staff reductions occurred mainly in  the border troops and the investigative apparatus. Keeping in  mind, however, that the former Ministry of Security [MB] was on  average 20 percent understaffed, those who want to be in the  service and pass the certification do not have any problem.    O. Blotskiy, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special  correspondent: What are the selection criteria?    S. Bogdanov: We were informed that the main  criteria are professional fitness and loyalty to the motherland.    D. Molchanov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special  correspondent: How does one determine professional fitness?    S. Bogdanov: I am not a commission member and do  not know how it is determined.    D. Molchanov: Do you see in the latest actions  regarding the MB an element of strengthening the president's  personal power?    S. Bogdanov: Theoretically--yes. In practice we  will only be able to tell after we get specific assignments over  a period of half a year.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: According to our information,  many state security functions have now been transferred to the  president's Main Protection Administration.    S. Bogdanov: In the past there was the KGB's Ninth  Directorate. Part of the work of a number of units in the rest  of the KGB was to support operational work of this directorate:  operational information, operational investigations, and so on.    In principle, the Ninth Directorate's task was physical  protection of the president. As to operational work around  protected objects, including protected routes, this was done,  among others, by staff members of the Moscow Administration.  When the Main Protection Directorate was created, this unit was  transferred there as a whole. Those who did not want a transfer  stayed in the Moscow Administration.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: Where is the pay better--over  there or with you?    S. Vorobyev, FCS officer: Over there, of course.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: Let us go back to politics.  There have been many complaints about the MB in connection with  the October 1993 events: The MB did not know what had been going  on, they said.    S. Vorobyev: An organization that does not know  what is happening around it would not be a special service. The  question is who is the consumer of this information and how is  it used. We knew, and provided this information.    S. Bogdanov: Materials of preliminary  investigation on the basis of mass media reports regarding  Barkashov were sent to the procuracy three times. But the latter  did not find sufficient grounds to initiate criminal proceedings.    Celestine Bohlen, NEW YORK TIMES correspondent: I  would like to go back to the October events. Do you think that  the MB reorganization is related to these events?    S. Bogdanov: Probably yes. Going back to these  events, I want to remind you that we knew about the plans, the  concrete disposition of forces, up to how many combat  detachments and commandos there were and which window bay or  corridor they would be guarding. Therefore nobody can say it was  an unexpected turn of events. The main issue is utilization of  information.    I can tell as an example how the information on Chernobyl  was  used. A year before the catastrophe, 76 documents were sent from  KGB units to various officials saying that these industrial  nuclear systems cannot be used for scientific purposes. Nobody  listened to us.    The same goes for the Bashkiria oil pipeline. While it was  still under construction we were getting alarming information  from foreign agents.    S. Vorobyev: We were sent a lot of materials, even  aerial photos taken from a helicopter. We showed those six bent  pipes on television. And what happened? I believe there is still  no decision on it.    S. Bogdanov: This is all about the past; what  about now? Have you even asked yourself how many times the  initials of our institution have been changed over the past  years? Do you know what this means? This means a change of  leadership from top to bottom, not only the head of the  organization, but all top officials. And from the day this all  started, it still goes on. Tell me, how can a special service  work under these circumstances?    Yu. Shchekochikhin: Will the latest change in  initials help to correct the situation you were talking about?    S. Bogdanov: It depends on how long these initials  stay.    S. Vorobyev: By the way, many officers are not  certain that things are not going to be reshuffled again.    S. Bogdanov: Every time there are elections, there  is change.    S. Vorobyev: Today our officers formally separated  from their work. This sitting and waiting, which has been going  on for the second month already, results in people's skills as  operatives gradually beginning to deteriorate. If this situation  continues for any length of time, we cannot be sure that a mass  exodus to the civilian sector will not begin.    O. Blotskiy: Your investigative department is now  being transferred to the procuracy. Cases have been transferred,  but the personnel do not want to. What is happening to the  investigative officers?    S. Bogdanov: Right now most officers do not want a  transfer. They will be found jobs in our organization.    C. Bohlen: Why do they not want to transfer?    S. Bogdanov: You know, it is the same as happened  to the Vympel unit. People came to work specifically for state  security. And they do not want to leave this organization. It  has its own traditions, its own system of relations, its own  perks after all.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: How do you feel about the fact  that investigations will now be carried out by the procuracy  instead of the KGB? Some jurists have been pushing this for a  long time, while others were against it...    S. Bogdanov: Right now, for instance, one of the  contraband cases has been transferred to the procuracy for  investigation, and the man in charge of it has specialized in  murders and rapes all his life.    D. Molchanov: How do you feel about the old KGB  times? From a professional standpoint.    S. Bogdanov: I will give a most routine example.  There was a Moscow Administration chief who could transfer his  aide out of sight if the telephone in reception rang twice and  nobody picked up the receiver. That is, on the third ring you  knew for sure that you had just lost your year-end bonus. Now  you can listen to the phone ringing for half an hour.    D. Molchanov: Now you cannot get through at all.  Nobody answers. Or you call, and they say that such and such is  not in. Pardon me, I ask, who am I talking to? The person on the  other end says: "I am just waiting here in the reception and  answering the phone." (Laughter)    Yu. Shchekochikhin: Seriously speaking, however. I  am convinced that the current government cannot do without the  special services for its personal needs. Whichever major Russian  politician I talk to, they are all convinced that their  telephones are tapped. Do our leaders not need today to have at  least a personal special service? After all, they are all  children of those times; they cannot do without it.    S. Bogdanov: Any politicians needs to have a  personal special service--regardless of whether he is an  offspring of a communist or another state. I have no doubt about  this.    As to telephone tapping, today the respective FCS unit can  simultaneously listen to 2,000 telephones across the entire  country of Russia. For comparison: Switzerland has the  capability of simultaneously listening to 10,000.    P. Shirov, "Echo Moskvy": has there been a  considerable personnel turnover, especially over the past two  years?    S. Bogdanov: We have come to the conclusion that  the number of resignation letters submitted has fallen off  considerably. Several years ago there were mass resignations.  Every time our plaque is changed, the number of resignation  requests immediately shoots up. Now, however, we have come to a  point where, in my opinion, the people who are there are  precisely the kind of people who should be working there.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: What happened to the  administration for combating organized crime and corruption?    S. Bogdanov: It became the administration for  combating smuggling and corruption.    O. Blotskiy: What is the FCS reaction to the  six-year sentence handed down in the case of a CIA agent who was  arrested and indicted a couple of months ago?    S. Bogdanov: The reaction to all these incidents  and sentences now that there have been traitors among ourselves  is--tiredness.    But when traitors became heroes--after this to talk about  the  fact that somebody got six years...    C. Bohlen: What about the Mirzayanov case?    S. Bogdanov: There is currently a temporary list  of items constituting state secrets, signed by the president.  Therefore, in principle, part of the information disclosed by  Mirzayanov may not fall under that list. If we look at the  substance, however, it has been established that the information  he made public constitutes a state secret, but it is not on the  list. Again, who defines the level of secrecy? It is defined by  the company doing this development. Not us. No. For us, it is  very important to have a document that says that this or that is  information that constitutes a state secret. A specific point.    In the past the whole thing boiled down to a company or  ministry classifying their work according to their list, at the  request of a laboratory or department. Our duty was to protect  these secrets. Now we are reaping very grave consequences of  that system, because at the time it was never considered  important to patent development work. We have concrete examples:  Suddenly, for instance, the SS-20 missile is being manufactured  in, shall we say, a certain large country in the east, and sold  on foreign markets. We are beginning to investigate how it ended  up there.    It turns out that a foreign delegation visited a certain  enterprise to sign a protocol of intentions. They promised  mountains of gold. The director was deliriously happy. (By the  way, amazingly, most of our directors, especially those of  defense enterprises, turned out to be great altruists.) He is  told: "You know, in order for us to figure things out better, we  need one or two `samples.'" The SS-20 missile alone incorporates  about 120 inventions. None of which, naturally, had been  patented.    Now, back to the Mirzayanov case. We signed an international  treaty on not producing new chemical weapons (this is more or  less what it is called). We violated the convention. But we do  not have a single word anywhere in the law on anybody's  culpability for violating an international treaty. On a global  scale, Mirzayanov has performed a service for humanity.    On the other hand, those who work on this problem are  carrying out the task set for them by the state, because it is  the state that finances them.    Yu. Shchekochikhin: During Brezhnev's times and  even afterwards, in order to conduct an operational action with  respect to a secretary of a provincial party oblast committee,  you needed the sanction of the party leadership. Now I know that  the operational work of some high-level Moscow officials has  been stopped at the very top. Is there a category of persons  today who are better left alone?    S. Bogdanov: Of course there is. Who is included  in this category depends on many factors. And also, let me put  it this way, on the professional and civic courage of the  operative and his boss. "Immunity," by the way, also stems from  imperfections in our legislation.    Such new forms of corruption have appeared on the scene now  that they absolutely do not fall under our criminal law.  Sometimes, though, the court's terrible inertia also plays a  role.    K. Belyaninov: Representations of the former  republics have now become embassies. But if there are embassies,  it means there are also intelligence units. Have you caught,  for instance, many Uzbek spies? I am quite serious.    S. Bogdanov: Uzbek? I do not recall any. With some  republics, treaties have been signed at the presidential level  on not conducting intelligence activities against one another,  interaction in matters of state security or information  exchange, transfer of cases, joint investigation of major  entities, combating drug trafficking, etc.    One head of an Estonian district counterintelligence was  detained when he was trying to break through in an "Ural"  vehicle with five tonnes of copper from Pskov Oblast to his  district. He stole the vehicle in the Pskov Paratroop Division,  the copper--somewhere else, and made a fighting attempt to get  across the border.    By the way, many of our current friends who used to be  enemies conduct intelligence operations from the territories of  former USSR republics.    Apprehending a spy or a foreign intelligence officer is not  the highest-class work. Foreign intelligence officers are  arrested in the event of political expediency. In any case, in  the past this was the only reason. For instance, two of ours are  expelled from Sweden--intelligence immediately runs to  counterintelligence: Guys, who do you have in your sights? Our  pleasure! As many as you need! In the Swedish Embassy alone a  total of six diplomats. Shall we expel them all together or one  at a time? A corresponding memorandum goes to the Politburo,  signed by the KGB chairman. We get the appropriate memorandum  from Gromyko. Relations with him were very difficult: Gentlemen,  you are spoiling my peace-loving policy. When Shevardnadze was  appointed minister of foreign affairs, things became easier. You  may recall: They expel ours from England--we expel some, too;  they expel more, we expel more. And on top of that we outwitted  them, because some wives of British diplomats had diplomatic  status. Therefore we selected husbands whose wives also were  diplomats, but expelled only the husbands. As a result they had  to recall more diplomats. The Americans expelled our people--we  took away their service personnel: Wash your own dishes. At this  point the fight was more or less on even ground. So, this is the  political case.    The other case is when the damage is already unavoidable. We  knew, for instance, in the case of Tolkachev, that he was  passing over material that would do irreparable damage. This  means we have to take him. But if we take him, we take the  American, too. Or, for instance, they take one of ours--we have  to respond so they will not get away with it. So we take one,  too. In short, the basic point is that you do this when you can  no longer play operational games. Because the highest level in  counterintelligence is operational games.    S. Smirnov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special  correspondent: Do you still use recruitment?    S. Bogdanov: We do.    S. Smirnov: I mean, through blackmail and...    S. Bogdanov: In intelligence or  counterintelligence?    S. Smirnov: Both.    S. Bogdanov: All right. Anyway, this goes for both  intelligence and counterintelligence. When the MB was still  there, a decision was made in keeping with the law on federal  organs of state security that we could pay agents. The KGB paid  agents only in rare instances. And rather small sums.    Nevertheless, both we and intelligence can pay. Intelligence  pays more, though. Still, we never had the kind of money to  outdo, for instance, the CIA.    When I was still going through training, one of our  still-current intelligence officers shared his experience:  "Guys, remember, the principle of our work is this (this was his  personal opinion, one of the methods of recruitment). We look  for a person who is not doing well, and make it even worse: turn  him into a spy. Before, he merely embezzled or cheated on his  wife; we make a spy out of him." Cynicism exists in every line  of work.    The most reliable agents (and this is recognized by all  intelligence services in the world without exception) are those  doing it for ideological and political reasons. For a CIA  officer, for instance, there existed only two compromising  points for which he could be dismissed from the service:  homosexuality and drugs. That was all! Ours were recruited, or  attempts were made to recruit them, on anything: drinking,  women, video and audio equipment he may have bought somewhere at  a discount, and so on, and so on.    How are things in our counterintelligence? We have no money,  trust me. Blackmail--on what? Theoretically, we can blackmail a  person threatening to say that he is our agent. But why would we  need him after we say this? And recruit him on this? It is  laughable.    O. Blotskiy: Russia has transparent borders with  practically all states. Can the FCS work effectively in the  current situation, where any citizen of any contiguous state can  travel unimpeded wherever he wants?    S. Bogdanov: To work effectively, we have to start  not with borders. What we need is for the state--through the  president, the Federal Assembly, the Security Council--to tell  us what the national interests of Russia are and what it is we  need to protect.    Let the president set the task to put an end to organized  crime. Within what timeframe? Half a year? Ten years? In the  FRG, for instance, it is considered normal to work on a criminal  group for five-10 years. Over there, however, both  counterintelligence and police work on it. But then they take  the entire group. With accounts in Bolivia, Switzerland, safe  houses, dead drops, and so on, and so on.    We are all worse off because we, in effect, do not have a  concept of national security--one that is serious and  comprehensive. [end Bogdanov]    Yes, the former KGB has been destroyed... This is the  truth. But not the whole truth. Read the opinion of Vadim  Bakatin in an upcoming issue of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA.</p>

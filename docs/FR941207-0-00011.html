			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Contract Extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 250.30(c)(1) and 252.4(b) of the proposed rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing contracts would continue to be required to terminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on June 30 of each year; however, contracting agencies (or FCS in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of NCP) would be given the option of extending contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for two 1-year periods. Section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule would also require that any changed information be updated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before any contract extension is granted, including pricing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yield information, bonding information, and the signature page.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed rule would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that contracts could be extended only if the processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed satisfactorily during the previous year, submitted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required annual reconciliation reports and had its certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public accountant (CPA) audit report closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A total of eighteen commenters responded to this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven commenters supported the provision as proposed. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter supported the option of two 1-year extensions, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added that requiring processors to submit the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconciliation report and requiring the closure of the CPA audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report as conditions for contract extension are not workable due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the submission and resolution time frames associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these reports. Another commenter supported the option of two 1-year extensions but stated that the annual reconciliation reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be eliminated as a condition since the proposal for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission of the monthly performance report with year-to-date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> totals would serve the same purpose. Four commenters were in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> favor of contract extension but recommended four 1-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensions to make processing contract extensions consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the food service management company contract duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements under 7 CFR Part 210. Three of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recommended that bids should be separate and distinct from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing agreement and not be subject to automatic renewal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter stated that contract extensions would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in reduced paperwork because distributing agencies would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to maintain separate active contract files for each year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the contract. This commenter added that if there were any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes from the original contract, the distributing agency would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to issue additional amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Department continues to believe sections 250.30(c)(1) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 252.4(b) of the proposed rule will reduce paperwork, facilitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract approval, and expedite the arrangement of early  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodity shipments directly to processors. Based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed rule, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department recognizes that the time frames for the submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certain reports, such as the annual reconciliation report or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closure of the CPA audit report, cannot practically be conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for contract extension. Annual reconciliation reports are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to be submitted to the distributing agencies until after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new contract year has begun. CPA audit reports are due prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extending a contract; however, the audit might not be closed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time of contract extension. Typically, distributing agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin negotiating contracts for the upcoming contract year in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March or April. Because distributing agencies need to have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recent data available to them in determining whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing contract should be extended, this rule will require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that distributing agencies ensure that any changed information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be updated before any contract extension is granted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including but not limited to pricing and yield information value,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonding information, and signature page. The distributing agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also must ensure that all required reports and any corrections to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports that are due up to the time that contract extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs have been submitted by the processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Accordingly, this final rule adopts section 250.30(c)(1) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed State processing regulations and section 252.4(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed NCP regulations without change, except that section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(c)(1) is modified to provide that as a condition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension, the processor must, in addition to performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactorily during the previous year, submit all required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports and any corrections to such reports up to the time that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract extension occurs and submit its CPA audit report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for Processing Contracts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed State processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and section 252.4(c)(1) of the NCP regulations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the requirement that the free on board (FOB) plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price be included as part of the State processing and NCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts. In lieu of the FOB price, the proposed rule would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit processors to provide any pricing information, so long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor thoroughly explained what this additional pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information represented. The processor, however, under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule would also be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the contract value of each USDA commodity and where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing was to be performed only on a fee-for-service basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as defined in the rule, the actual fee would be listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, section 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that information pertaining to yields and pricing of end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products be listed on separate pages of the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

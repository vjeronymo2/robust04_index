			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Birt saved 'just Pounds 810' tax: Hussey and Barnett pledge support for BBC director-general MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, claims today that he saved only Pounds 810 in tax in 1991 by being paid his BBC salary through his private company, John Birt Productions. Details of his tax affairs, disclosed in a letter to The Times, follow an independent investigation of the affairs of John Birt Productions by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm. The letter from Mr Birt and supporting statements from the BBC follow further press coverage of the affair and comments by Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, that the Inland Revenue should have 'a very close look' at Mr Birt's tax position. In his first full statement on the affair Mr Birt said the benefits were 'a close involvement in determining the nature of the work I should do and the flexibility and mobility of having my own company pension scheme'. He said the tax advantages were modest. In its assessment of the accounts of John Birt Productions in the year to August 1991 Ernst &amp; Young said that the total turnover of Pounds 163,141 not only included the reimbursement of specific expenses incurred on BBC business but also contributions to his company pension fund. 'Commentators have wrongly assumed that Mr Birt's company has been used largely as a vehicle to reduce his taxable income. This is not the case,' it said. Ernst &amp; Young said that in 1991, the last year for which figures are available, Mr Birt would have been liable for income tax and national insurance contributions of Pounds 45,551 if he had been a BBC employee. In the event he and his wife Jane paid Pounds 41,616 - a total saving of Pounds 3,935. After deducting the company's accountancy and administration costs 'the net benefit for the Birt household was Pounds 810 for the year'. Mr Birt said that day-to-day expenses incurred on BBC business were paid by John Birt Productions and charged to the BBC. This inflated the company's turnover and apparent level of expenses. He added that personal benefits received from the company were benefits in kind and liable for tax. He said that he accepted it was inappropriate for the director-general of the BBC not to be an employee of the corporation and added that 'long familiarity with contractual arrangements of this sort' had not prepared him for the 'dismay and unease that news of them generated'. Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman, and Lord Barnett, vice-chairman, described Mr Birt in a statement of support as 'a man of integrity and conviction' who had been subjected to a 'series of unfounded slurs'.</p>

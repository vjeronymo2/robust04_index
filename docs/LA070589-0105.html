			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JIM FINKS OF LOSERS-INTO-WINNERS FAME SEEN AS ROZELLE REPLACEMENT  </P> <P> Jim Finks, who once beat John Unitas for a quarterback job but is better known  for turning three losing teams into winners as an executive, is expected to be  chosen Thursday as the NFL's first new commissioner in 30 years.  </P> <P> According to several NFL sources, Finks, who will turn 62 on Aug. 31, will be  the only recommendation to the NFL owners by the six-member selection  committee. In fact, Finks met with the committee in New York on Tuesday to  finalize the details of his contract.  </P> <P> The vacancy was created when Pete Rozelle shocked the owners by announcing his  retirement in March after 29 years. Rozelle's tenure was the second longest of  any commissioner in a major sport; only the NHL's Clarence Campbell served  longer.  </P> <P> "We're going to recommend one man. We were told to identify a guy and that's  what we're going to do," Wellington Mara of the New York Giants, co-chairman of  the committee, said today. He would not confirm that Finks is that man and said  the other owners do not have to abide by the nomination. Nineteen of the 28  teams must vote for the candidate for him to be elected.  </P> <P> The three teams Finks took as losers and turned into winners are the New  Orleans Saints, the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings.  </P></p>

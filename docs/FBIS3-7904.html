Speaking at the conference, organised by the foundation of  the International Centre for the Development of Democracy and  attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Olechowski  said that this cooperation is designed to secure Poland and  Russia a "worthy place in the group of highly developed  democratic states." Olechowski explained that the key issue of  this partnership will be a better use of traditional trade ties  in order to fill in the vacuum left after the dissolution of the  Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.    Olechowski claimed that Poland and Russia should support  each  other in creating new trade law, compatible with international  standards, form a system of bilateral trade preferences and  cooperate in the development of banking and transport services.  He added that Poland has drawn up the concept of an East  European trade initiative aimed at organising such cooperation.    The Polish minister noted that stabilization of the  situation  in the region would be assisted by the Partnership for Peace  project as well as the development of bilateral and multilateral  cooperation on many planes.    In his address to the conference, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev presented a new Russian initiative of  all-European partnership. Kozyrev claimed that this partnership  should be based on the hitherto cooperation within the framework  of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).  According to the minister, the political and military  cooperation should be concentrated within the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council which would coordinate the efforts of NATO,  the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Western European  Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The Russian politician stressed the necessity to strengthen  cooperation within the North Atlantic Council and to implement  the "Partnership for Peace" initiative on an equal footing.  Kozyrev emphasized that Russia's security guarantees would be  included in the all-European partnership plan, along with  guarantees extended by western European states.    Kozyrev noted that if only some states of Central and East  Europe were admitted to NATO, this could create new political  barriers and make Russia take countermeasures, especially if  this led to Russia's isolation.    Speaking to reporters during a press conference held after  their talks Wednesday, both ministers said they had largely  convergent views on questions of European security. Olechowski  added, however, that the talks had revealed differences  concerning the road leading to that security.    Kozyrev declared Russia would join the Partnership for Peace  project, but this would take some time. Olechowski said that an  effective system of European security had to include Russia,  irrespective of whether NATO existed or not.    Kozyrev said the recent arrest in the United States of a  high-ranking CIA staffer charged with spying for the USSR and  Russia would not undermine the partnerly relations between  Russia and the USA.    The Russian minister dismissed statements by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy as unimportant, saying he did not represent anyone  in Russia.    Kozyrev confirmed he had accepted an invitation to pay an  official visit to Poland. The present two-day stay in Krakow  was a working visit which ended Wednesday.</p>

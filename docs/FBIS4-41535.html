			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Businessmen Union's President Arkadiy  Volskiy has dismissed as immoral Federation Council Chairman  Vladimir Shumeyko's recent proposal to prolong the mandates of  the Federal Assembly's deputies.    "Each of the deputies went to elections, knowing that he  would be elected for two years," Volskiy declared at a  news-conference in Moscow Friday, noting that the prolongation  offer was "very mean towards the State Duma and Federation  Council."    He also criticized the presidential anti-crime decree since  it presupposes the right of arbitrary rule. However, he quoted  a number of industrial managers as saying that most people are  in favor of the decree.    "The best thing would be to erase from the decree the  rubbish  like the right to detain people for 30 days," Volskiy said.    According to him, "it was in fact Russia rather than the  USSR  that collapsed" in 1991. "The rupture of economic ties was the  chief reason for production decline," he remarked.    In his opinion, Russia and other former USSR republics  should  set up a really workable economic union, if they want to  overcome the crisis as soon as possible. Otherwise, enterprises  will have to establish direct ties, he said. The problem could  also be resolved by forming transnational corporations across  the former USSR.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRASH CANS  </P> <P> That "eyesore" of orange trash cans at Zuma Beach would be a welcome sight for  most Los Angeles roads and streets. Apparently litterbugs cannot see green  cans.  </P> <P> I have seen up to five empty bottles along side trash cans in Griffith Park.  Surely hikers should be capable of tossing cans and bottles that far.  </P> <P> Trash cans with flashing neon lights might help.  </P> <P> Keep America beautiful.  </P> <P> VIVIANA ORTIZ  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

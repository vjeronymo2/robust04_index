			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Sharp increase in US output lifts shares to new highs US industrial production grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year, a further sign of the accelerating pace of economic recovery, figures from the Federal Reserve indicated yesterday. The news prompted a strong rise in share prices, which reached record highs in early trading. By midday the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.40 at 3,872.83. Bond prices fell on fears that faster growth would bring forward the timing of an interest rate rise. As the Clinton administration puts the final touches to this year's budget, due early next month, senior officials are increasingly confident about the economic outlook. In an upbeat address in New York yesterday, Mr Robert Rubin, chairman of the White House National Economic Council, forecast a robust, sustained recovery. He said there was 'very little probability of inflation reigniting' and predicted 3 per cent growth this year. Mr Rubin said economic conditions would also be favourable in 1995 and 1996 because, by then, the US would be getting a boost from economic recovery in Japan and Europe. In an apparent preview of the budget, Mr Rubin also predicted that the US would make more rapid progress than expected in reducing the federal budget deficit. The deficit would fall to 'substantially under 2 per cent of GDP' over five years, he said. Last year's budget projected a deficit of 3.1 per cent of GDP in 1998. The Fed report showed production up 0.7 per cent in December after strong gains in preceding months. Although led by a surge in car production, output strength appears broadly based. Nearly every industrial sector registered gains. Excluding cars, production was up 0.5 per cent last month, the same rise as in November. The rate of industrial capacity utilisation rose to 83.5 per cent, above its long-term average of 81.9 per cent but still below the 84.8 registered at the peak of the 1980s boom. Preliminary figures suggest that the first quarter got off to a good start. The University of Michigan's closely-watched consumer sentiment index was reported to have risen sharply in early January to 95.8 against 88.2 in December. The rise is a reassuring sign that consumers are not reducing their spending after the Christmas period. Separate data released yesterday showed business inventories up 0.6 per cent in November. However, they failed to keep pace with the growth in business sales, which rose by 1.1 per cent. As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio slipped to 1.44, its lowest level since 1982, raising the prospect of increased production if consumer demand continues to rise this year.

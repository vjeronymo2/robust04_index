This was disclosed by Colonel Manuel Cartucho, spokesman for  the Northern Operational Front. Col. Cartucho says over the  next few days UNITA troops also plan to occupy Caxito with the  backing of foreign forces.    [Begin Cartucho recording] Between 14 and 17 December our  forces were involved in heavy clashes. Enemy troops were  repulsed. Right now, there are large concentrations of UNITA  troops -- estimated at four battalions -- including foreign  elements. They are poised to attack the (Libongo) region  between 31 December and 1 January. If they succeed in taking  (Libongo), UNITA forces will have created the conditions for  moving into Caxito. The morale of our forces is high. They are  ready to repel the enemy. [end recording]</p>

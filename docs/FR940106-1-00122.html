			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal actions that may affect the splittail or its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized, carried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Marine Fisheries Service, and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection activities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are found to be inadequate. In 1991, EPA disapproved portions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has published in this same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  separate part proposed replacement standards for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 4 of the Act, listing the splittail will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional impetus for the development of a recovery plan to bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> together Federal, State, and private efforts to develop conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies for this species. The Service has convened the Delta Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishes in the Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recovery of the splittail and other fishes native to the Estuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ecosystem also will be described in this plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened wildlife not covered by a special rule. These prohibitions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdiction of the United States to take (including harass, harm,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in interstate or foreign commerce any such species. It also is illegal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service and State conservation agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

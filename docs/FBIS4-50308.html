			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman issued a statement today expressing appreciation for  the statement made by a U.S. State Department spokesman that the  United States does not recognize a Tibetan government-in-exile.  The Foreign Ministry spokesman also hoped that the U.S.  Government will conscientiously keep its promise.    On 16 May, a U.S. State Department spokesman issued a  statement reiterating: It has been the United States'  long-standing policy that Tibet is part of China. Neither the  United States, nor any other countries, regards Tibet as a  sovereign nation. The United States does not recognize a  Tibetan government-in-exile.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "We appreciate this  statement by the United States. We hope the U.S. Government  will conscientiously keep its promise."    The spokesman said: Everyone knows that Tibet is an  inalienable part of China. Tibetan affairs are entirely China's  internal affairs which do not tolerate interference by any other  foreign countries.    The spokesman reiterated: The Central Government's policy  toward the Dalai Lama and his followers has been consistent and  specific, and it has never changed. There have been avenues for  contacts between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama's  representatives. The door of negotiations has always been open.    The spokesman indicated: As long as the Dalai Lama  recognizes Tibet as an inalienable part of China, completely  renounces the proposition for "Tibet independence," and  discontinues the activities of splitting the motherland, the  Central Government is ready to negotiate with the Dalai Lama at  any time. Any issue, except "Tibet independence," is negotiable.</p>

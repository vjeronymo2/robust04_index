			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BORDEN DEFENSE AGAINST BUYOUTS  </P> <P> Borden Inc., the diversified maker of Elmer's Glue, today announced an unusual  takeover defense under which its 25 top executives will resign if any one of  them is fired after a buyout of the company at less than fair value.  </P> <P> The unusual plan, which could spread to other companies, goes into effect only  if a takeover group fails to pay shareholders the "fair value" for their  shares, including any potential profits from a breakup or restructuring. Borden  chief executive R. J. Ventres said that without the cooperation of top  managers, any takeover artist would have a hard time restructuring or selling  off parts of the company.  </P></p>

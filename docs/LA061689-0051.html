			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA BANS NEW NUCLEAR PLANTS OR WASTE FACILITIES  </P> <P> The Yugoslav Parliament on Thursday passed a law banning future construction of  nuclear power plants or facilities for processing nuclear wastes.  </P> <P> Tanjug news agency said the ban also applied to any planning for new plants.  The Parliament rejected a government proposal to ban new nuclear plants only  until the year 2000.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia has only one nuclear power plant, at Krsko in the northwest republic  of Slovenia. Plans to build four more by the year 2000 were shelved under  public pressure after the Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April, 1986.  </P> <P> The plant at Krsko, built by Westinghouse Corp., has suffered frequent  breakdowns that have prompted questions in the press about the technology.  </P></p>

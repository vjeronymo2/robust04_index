			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (8): How to win trade success in Japan - Prominent European businesses are finding new ways into a tough market A EUROPEAN moving to Japan can enjoy the familiarity of a wide range of consumer brands that are well - known at home. German cars dominate the import market and are everywhere on the streets of Tokyo. The Shell logo hangs outside some 7,000 petrol stations around the country. Yves Saint Laurent bags (and a host of look-alikes) hang from far more arms in Tokyo than they do in Paris. Industrious shoppers can buy Alpen cereal, and Body Shop cosmetics and browse for English imports at a local branch of Harrods. Competing for the slot as the top recorded music store in town is Virgin Megastores. The Japanese market has a just reputation of being extremely hard to crack, yet a number of prominent European companies - particularly those who have been doing business in Japan for a long time - have blended into the local business scene to a point where they are virtually indistinguishable from the Japanese competition. The oil industry is a case in point. The Royal Dutch/Shell group has been operating in Japan as Shell Sekiyu for decades and in 1985 merged its operation with Showa Oil. Shell now holds a 50 per cent stake in Showa Shell Sekiyu, one of the most prominent retailers of petrol in the country, and by far the most profitable refiner in an industry where profits are generally terrible. Its Formula Shell unleaded petrol proved a huge marketing hit in a country where innovative products are easily sold at a premium. (Formula Shell was withdrawn from markets elsewhere in the world because of possible problems in the product's leaded variety.) In short, Shell runs an integrated oil operation in Japan, including some overseas exploration, that is virtually indistinguishable from Shell's local operating companies elsewhere in the world. Yet the virtues of getting in early, are well illustrated by British Petroleum. BP has a corporate presence, a trading operation, and is active in the chemicals business, but the costs and risks of trying to enter the refining and retailing business virtually bar it from participating in one of the most important oil markets in the world. Trade statistics give a good indication of the sorts of industries where European companies have made an impact. Of the Dollars 15.5bn in European imports during the first half of the year, 11.3 per cent consisted of food products; 19 per cent of chemicals and pharmaceuticals; 7.2 per cent of textiles and clothing; and 14.6 per cent automobiles. Aside from chemicals and pharmaceuticals - industrial products where European companies often have a very clear technical and cost-of-production edge - European companies have tended to establish themselves on the basis of selling consumer goods that have a strong quality or fashion appeal. Among the most successful companies are the German car makers - Volkswagen/Audi, BMW, and Mercedes Benz - who together account for a disproportionate 59 per cent share of the imported car market. They are successful in part because of the many years they have devoted to burnishing the image of their products. Many educated Japanese will say that German cars offer superior engineering and more precise handling, as well as more distinctive style, than their Japanese counterparts even though consumers elsewhere in the world where Japanese cars have gained large market share would plainly not agree. VW and Audi together claimed 23 per cent of the market; BMW 16 per cent, and Mercedes 17 per cent. German car sales have been hit by the downturn in the market, particularly Volkswagen, which is in the process of ending a long-standing agreement with its principal distributor, Yanase. Yet sales declines have been roughly in line with the market, which was off 11.3 per cent in the year to August, while sales of French cars fell by 27.5 per cent and Italian cars by 28 per cent. Peugot, which had a market share of just 1.56 per cent and saw sales collapse by 46.6 per cent, has recently tied up with Inchcape, the British international distribution and marketing service company, in an effort to improve performance. Inchcape itself offers an interesting example of how to get going in the Japanese market, as well as a distribution route for other companies for whom costs of independent distribution are prohibitive. Indeed, Inchcape has begun distributing some products for foreign companies who have run afoul of Japanese joint venture partners. 'We've been here for a long time,' says Mr Paul Hobkinson, president and group representative in Japan. 'We are substantially a Japanese company.' Inchcape traces its first involvement in Japan to 1982. It now has a staff of about 1,500, only six of which are expatriate, and three of which have regional responsibility. Mr Hobkinson says longevity has several advantages. It helps when recruiting Japanese staff, who wonder whether their employer will be around not just next year, but when retirement comes. It even helps with the rent, where landlords often charge far below market rates to long-time tenants. As a long-time player, Inchcape is well integrated into Japan's complex distribution network, where contacts and detailed knowledge are key to success. Inchcape likes to handle products where it can carve out a substantial and secure market share. Inchcape, for example, introduced the first beer kegs into the Japanese market, which was dominated by bottles, and now has a majority market share. It handles Domino commercial ink jet machines, which take about 25 per cent of the market after Hitachi's 35 per cent share. It handles a range of other well-known products such as Royal Doulton, Mars Pet Foods and Filofax. For many companies, however, being in Japan is more than a marketing opportunity. Worldwide, Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has embarked on a worldwide restructuring and refocusing of the business, but this has involved expansion and greater commitment in Japan. It was, after all, the success of the Japanese consumer electronics companies that has in part led to Philips current financial difficulties. Philips has a high reputation among its competitors for technology and innovation but a low profile among consumers. Mr Hendrikus Hoksbergen, who run's Philips operations in Japan, says: 'When you can meet the competition in Japan, you can meet it anywhere.' Philips launched Digital Compact Cassette, its newest audio product, in Japan before anywhere else in the world. Mr Hoksbergen says Philips must be active in Japan because of the large consumer market and the fact that Japan is the place where trends in consumer electronics, fashion and technology are being set. Philips also has plunged itself into the complex web of parts suppliers that has been an underlying strength of the Japanese industry.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Northern Rock tops Pounds 89m despite heavier provisions Northern Rock building society, the UK's 11th largest society, yesterday reported a 29 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 69m to Pounds 89.3m in 1993, despite a 40 per cent increase in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. Mr Chris Sharp, managing director, attributed the rise in provisions,from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 17.1m, to a number of factors, including a fall in the valuesof repossessions below the society's expectations. Other factors reflected adjustments as a result of a switch in mortgage indemnity guarantee insurancearrangements from Sun Alliance to Commercial Union and the setting up of a general provisioning fund. Mr Sharp said that this last move was an innovation for the society. 'We intend to use highly profitable years, like 1993, to build up funds as a buffer for the future.' Mr John Wriglesworth, societiesanalyst at UBS, said that even though most societies would be reporting markedly lower provisions for 1993 compared with the previous year, the increase at Northern Rock showed a prudent approach. He added that the growth in profits was particularly impressive as it followed a sharp increase in 1992. There was also substantial balance sheet growth, despite a year in which societies have faced fierce competition both for mortgage lending and retail savings. Overal l mortgage balances rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 6bn (Pounds 5bn). Retail receipts rose from Pounds 717m to Pounds 738m, helped by the popularity of the society's postal accounts. Total assets grew from Pounds 6bn to Pounds 7.3bn. The ratio of costs to total income fell to 35 per cent from 38 per cent.</p>

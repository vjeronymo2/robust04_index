The union said: "We are facing a worrisome situation over  the  entry of 104 kg of radioactive material under the UN Development  Program through the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport."    The union added that the situation is worse because the  highly dangerous cargo left the airport jurisdiction under a  regulation called "cargo to be regularized" which can be  considered legalized smuggling.    The union commented that approximately 18 months ago two  small cans of radioactive material were found at the airport.  The case was made public but nobody knew anything about how  they appeared.    The union stated: "Documents now in our possession open the  way to a thorough investigation that could expose a new face in  the trafficking of prohibited merchandise through our airport."    The union believes several people are responsible for the  entry of nuclear material into the country: One is Colonel Ramon  Dardo Guerra, head of the DINAC. Another is Colonel Americo  Osorio, airport director, who authorized the delivery without  even the payment of the airport duties, and Victor Arevalo as  the professional who mediated in this shipment. The air cargo  ramp chief is also believed to be involved. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ryusuke Kawano, Yuji Kobayashi, et al.] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The demand for higher speeds in telecommunications and  information processing systems will continue unabated. This  holds especially true in the field of telecommunications, where  great expectations are being placed on semiconductor integrated  circuits (ICs) that employ ultra-high-speed devices as the  technology for supporting the broadband integrated services  digital networks (B-ISDN) expected to form the infrastructure  for our economy in the 21st Century.    Fully-customized designs offer the best approach to the  ultra-high-speed IC designs required to get the most out of  device performance, but when system development time and costs  are figured into the equation, employing fully-customized  designs for each and every IC would place a considerable burden  on IC development. This is where silicon emitter coupled logic  (ECL) gate arrays come in. Silicon ECL gate arrays, with their  semi-customized designs, not only enable development times to be  shortened and costs reduced, but also offer the most effective  means of developing ICs for use in ultra-high-speed systems  thanks to the advantages of silicon devices over compound  semiconductors from the standpoints of reliability, mass  production and a proven track record. There are current  reports[.sup]1)[/] of a 9.5 gigabits per second (Gb/s)  discrimination decision circuit and a 6.7Gb/s 4:1 multiplexer  (MUX) that employ 156-gate silicon ECL arrays.    This report discusses the results of studies on a 216-gate  silicon ECL gate array employing super self-aligned process  technology-1C (SST-1C)[.sup]2)[/] to fabricate 0.5m SST  bipolar transistors.    To evaluate gate array characteristics, we carried out  measurement evaluations on a chip equipped with D-type  flip-flops (DFF), toggle flip-flops (TFF), 4:1 MUX and other key  elements in optical transmission systems. The maximum operating  speeds of these various elements worked out to 10.0Gb/s, 10.1GHz  and 9.0Gb/s, respectively, achieving a 10Gb/s-class signal  processing IC on top of the silicon ECL gate array.  <H5>  Basic Cell Layout </H5>   The basic cells are comprised of 28 transistors and 28 sets  of resistors (three resistors to a set), and one basic cell can  form one master-slave flip-flop. Internal logic swing is a  standard 400mV, and the transistors inside the cells operate at  0.4mA and 0.8mA. As shown in Figure 1, there are three resistor  elements in the substrate of a basic cell for each transistor  emitter and collector, and the resistance value can only be  changed at line connections.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-16A>      Figure 1. Layout of Resistance Value-Variable Basic Cells </FIG>    Because the substrate of gate array ICs is determined prior  to routing, it is difficult to change current in accordance with  the type or purpose of a cell, and in the end, this results in  the power dissipation of the entire chip increasing to higher  than necessary levels. However, by using the above-described  resistance value-variable basic cell substrates, total chip  power dissipation can be held down by optimizing the power  consumption of each cell. In this study, in particular, so as to  obtain greater circuit current variation with fewer resistor  elements, we employed a three-resistor element resistance value  ratio of 1:2:4 to enable the realization of 17 different  resistance values.  <H5>  Chip Layout </H5>   The chip substrate layout is as shown in Figure 2 and  comprises 6 x 6 internal cells (basic cells) surrounded by  output buffer cells. The input buffers are configured using the  basic cells. There are 216 equivalence gates. The standard  voltage generation circuits are divided into those for the  internal circuits (V[.sub]CS[/]) and those for the output  buffers (V[.sub]CSX[/]), and are located in the four corners  of the chip. Output emitter follower transistors for when ECL  interfaces are used are located in the vicinity of the pads. The  chip is 2.5 x 2.5mm in size. Supply voltage is furnished via a  single -4.5V power source, with the standard voltage  (V[.sub]TT[/], V[.sub]CS[/], V[.sub]CSX[/] and  V[.sub]BB[/]) used inside this chip being generated  internally.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-17A>      Figure 2. Chip Layout </FIG>    Figure 3 compares the structure of the SST-1C device with  that of a SST transistor (SST-1B[.sup]3)[/]) with 1m  feature sizes. SST-1C made possible the introduction of 0.5m  lithography using ion beams, and an embedded collector electrode  structure[.sup]4)[/] using phosporus-doped multi-crystal  silicon. And element isolation was accomplished using a  flattening LOCOS[.sup]5)[/] and silicon-filled trenches.  These scaling techniques made it possible to reduce the area  occupied by transistors to roughly 60% of what it is for  similar 1m SST collector current transistors.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-17B>      Figure 3. </FIG>    And in forming the base, we achieved a high-density base  region with a steep impurity distribution by ion implanting  BF[.sub]2[/] into the thin oxide film and diffusing this by  means of rapid thermal aneal (RTA). And to suppress the Kirk  (phonetic) effect, we employed a selective ion-implanted  collector (SIC) structure.[.sup]6)[/] These high-speed  inducing techniques made it possible to achieve 40.7GHz  (f[.sub]T[/]) when V[.sub]CE[/] is  1V. We established collector-emitter voltage at around 3.6V.  Using the SST-1C process, we achieved a 22.4GHz 1/8 frequency  divider.  <H5>  Results of Measurement Evaluation </H5>   Each of the prototype chips was packaged in ceramic  packaging  developed for use with ultra-high-speed silicon ICs, and  measured using a dedicated jig.  <H5>  1. Transmitter-receiver Terminal-aligned Collector-level </H5> Output Buffer    As the ultra-high-speed circuit interface, there is a method  that derives the signal at the collector level, called the SCFL  interface.[.sup]7)[/] Contrary to the conventional ECL  interface, the SCFL interface doesn't require a terminal voltage  (V[.sub]TT[/]), enabling it to hold down on post-packaging  waveform deterioration, and making it especially suitable for  use on ultra-high-speed IC interface system.    When the transmission-reception terminals are aligned at  50_O_, using this system to establish an open emitter-style  logic swing of 0.8V requires 32mA of current and increases power  consumption. At this point, we looked at the achievements made  with GaAs MESFETs and strove to reduce power consumption by  making transmission terminal resistance 100_O_. Figure 4 shows  the circuit configuration of the collector-level output buffer  we designed. We went with a two-stage pre-buffer + main buffer  configuration because the basic cell final output is through a  0.8mA emitter follower transistor, and when direct drive is  applied to the 24mA transistor that forms the final stage of the  output buffer, fanout load increases excessively and output  waveform rise and fall weakens. Power consumption with this  output buffer is 236mW.     When we checked operating frequency sensitivity of the  output level, we found that the output amplitude began to decrease  slightly at around 6Gb/s. Figure 5 shows the output waveform at  10Gb/s. The chip measured was a DFF. The height of the  eye-pattern opening at 10Gb/s was around 530mV.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-18A>      Figure 4. Collector-level Output Buffer </FIG>  <H5>  2. ECL Output Buffer </H5>   We used the collector-level output buffer substrate to  configure an ECL output buffer, and did so in such a way as to  enable it to serve as an ECL interface as well. We configured  this ECL output buffer by adding a final-stage 24mA emitter  follower transistor to the collector-level output buffer in the  vicinity of the pad. The power consumption of this output  buffer, excluding that of the final-stage emitter follower  transistor, is 210mW.    We used an ECL terminator to measure the output waveform.  When we checked operating frequency sensitivity of the output  level, we found that the output amplitude began to decrease at  around 6Gb/s. Figure 6 shows the output waveform at 10Gb/s. The  chip measured was a DFF. The height of the eye-pattern opening  at 10Gb/s was around 500mV.  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-18B>      Figure 5. Collector-level Output Wave (10Gb/s) </FIG>  <H5>  3. Results of TFF Measurements </H5>   We utilized the resistance value-variable basic cell  substrate to design three types of TFF with different current  values. The transistors are the same size. Figure 7 indicates  the current sensitivities of the maximum operating frequencies  of these circuits. I[.sub]CS[/] as used here is  the current value vis-a-vis the ECL differential. Changes in the  current value, i.e. the basic cell substrate resistance value,  effected changes in the maximum operating frequency similar to  those exhibited during simulations, thus confirming the  advantages of a resistance value-variable substrate. The maximum  operating frequency of the TFF was 10.1GHz, and their  sensitivity was around 75mV at 6GHz.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-19A>      Figure 6. ECL Output Waveform (10Gb/s) </FIG>    We also confirmed that even low current circuits with  I[.sub]CS[/] of 0.25mA operated at 4.5GHz, and  could process signals in the multi-gigabit range at low voltage.  <H5>  4. Results of DFF Measurements </H5>   We measured a circuit to which we had added an input buffer  and collector-level output buffer to the master-slave DFF.  Figure 8 shows the operating waveform of this DFF at 10Gb/s. The  maximum operating speed of this circuit was recorded at 10Gb/s,  this being the upper limit of the measurement system used. These  measurements confirmed error free operation at a code error rate  of less than 10[.sup]-9[/] for psuedo-random signals with  data lengths of 2[.sup]23[/]-1. Data sensitivity suddenly  deteriorated around 6Gb/s. At 5Gb/s, data sensitivity was about  100mV. This sensitivity deterioration was probably due to the  lack of a dedicated input buffer cell. The phase margin at 5Gb/s  was 250, and at 10Gb/s was 50.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-19B>      Figure 7. Current Sensitivity of TFF Maximum Operating Frequency </FIG>  <H5>  5. Results of 4:1 MUX Measurements </H5>   Figure 9 provides a schematic diagram of a 4:1 MUX. This 4:1  MUX multiplexes four data elements by repeating the operation of  a 2:1 MUX two times. We configured this 2:1 MUX of a  master-slave DFF (MS-DFF), a tri-stage DFF (TS-DFF) and a 2:1  selector, and designed it so it would be able to assure a large  phase margin. We also fabricated a re-timing DFF at the stage  prior to the output buffer for waveform shaping. The output  buffer performs collector-level output. All signals in the  circuit, with the exception of input clock and data signals, are  differential signals. Also, by using a resistance value-variable  basic cell substrate, we attempted to decrease the power level,  reducing the power required by the low-speed block (first-stage  2:1 MUX) to 35% of that of the high-speed block  (second-stage  2:1 MUX) with the same function.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-20A>      Figure 8. DFF Operating Waveform (10Gb/s) </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-21A>      Figure 9. Schematic Diagram of 4:1 MUX </FIG>    Figure 10 shows the operating waveforms of the 4:1 MUX at  6.0Gb/s. These measurements confirmed error free operation at a  code error rate of less than 10[.sup]-9[/] after multiplexing  1/4-speed psuedo-random signals with data lengths of  2[.sup]23[/]-1 derived from a pulse pattern generator.  Maximum operating speed was 9.0Gb/s. The 1/4 dividing waveform  began to distort when operating speeds exceeded this maximum  speed, leading us to believe that the operation of the  first-stage TFF is restricting the performance of the 4:1 MUX.  Phase margins were 250 at 5Gb/s, and 100 at 8Gb/s. The  power consumption of the chip, including that of the I/O buffer,  was 1.2W.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-22A>      Figure 10. 4:1 MUX Operating Waveform (6.0Gb/s) </FIG>  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   We studied a 216-gate ECL gate array using a new silicon  bipolar transistor process called SST-1C. The maximum operating  speeds of the DFF, 4:1 MUX and TFF fabricated on top of this  gate array were 10.0Gb/s, 9.0Gb/s and 10.1GHz, respectively,  realizing a 10Gb/s-class signal processor IC on the silicon ECL  gate array.    We also studied a transmission-reception terminal-aligning  collector-level output buffer and ECL output buffer, confirming  that they both operated at favorable eye-patterns up to 10Gb/s.    Using a resistance value-variable basic cell substrate in  the  gate array basic cells, we configured a 4:1 MUX that controlled  the current value of the cell in accordance with block operating  speeds, and confirmed that this MUX is effective in reducing  chip power consumption.

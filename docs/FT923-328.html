			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Making a mark in currencies / A look at how companies can reduce the risks of foreign exchange fluctuations The foreign exchange dealers have taken their profits; the politicians appear to have survived the debacle; but what are businesses to make of the ruins of Britain's exchange rate policy? British Technology Group, the technology transfer agency which makes 80 per cent of its Pounds 25m-plus revenues abroad, says it now takes much greater care to hedge any surpluses or deficits which emerge in cash flows within Europe. 'While the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was in force, currencies varied within a very narrow band so it didn't make much sense to 'fix' our surpluses,' says Rusi Kathoke, finance director. Designers Guild, which makes 60 per cent of its Pounds 15m furniture, fabrics and wallpapers sales outside the UK, says it used the relative stability of the ERM to shift its borrowings to the currencies of countries with low interest rates. 'We could keep some of our liabilities in D-Marks because the interest rate was lower and there was little currency risk,' says Mark Naughton-Rumbo, financial controller. 'Now we can't do that. We have squared our positions off and if we have to borrow more in a high-interest currency, we just have to bear it.' In the short term, the suspension of Britain's membership of the ERM and sterling's fall may require companies to adjust their price lists. But in the longer term, the principles of sound foreign exchange management will still apply. The difficulty is in getting businessmen and women to understand the fundamentals of a subject which many regard as arcane. 'People often don't know what questions to ask,' says Michael Pearce, founder of a Hertfordshire-based treasury consultancy.* Business owners often only take into account their currency exposure on a particular sale to a foreign customer. Will they get as many D-Marks when the customer pays in three months time as they would today? But the transaction risk is only one of three areas where a business can be exposed. A company may also face translation exposure if it has assets or liabilities  -a factory overseas, the balance sheet of a foreign subsidiary - priced in a foreign currency which it must reflect on its sterling balance sheet. The third and least obvious risk is economic exposure. This may affect a company which does no foreign business just as much as one which does, says Pearce. If its competitors buy supplies from overseas and sterling strengthens, then the competition will enjoy a cost advantage selling into the UK. The creation of the single European market will increase the economic exposure of many businesses. Because companies face a combination of foreign currency exposures, they need to develop a coherent strategy for dealing with them, advises Pearce. British Technology Group makes handling its foreign currency exposure a key part of its cash flow management, explains Kathoke. The company took the decision to reduce its exposure to high UK interest rates and took out long-term dollar and yen-denominated loans, matched to its expectations of revenue flows from these two currency areas. 'We don't have to hedge because our debt is matched by the cash flows we expect over time,' says Kathoke. 'We don't look at our foreign exchange exposure in isolation.' Once a company has identified its foreign exchange exposures, it must then decide whether it needs to hedge them. If a company's sales, profits and competitive position will be unaffected by changes in the value of its home currency, then it need do nothing. But very few companies are so protected. An alternative is to hedge everything but this ignores the cost and the possibility that some hedges can put a company at a competitive disadvantage. A company which bought foreign currency forward to hedge the value of, say, wine shipments from France would be locking itself into a particular rate and a particular cost structure. If sterling strengthened against the franc and the company's competitors had not hedged the value of their purchases, they would be able to buy the wine much more cheaply. 'The importance of the competitive environment can often get overlooked when foreign exchange policy is being developed,' warns Derek Ross, partner in charge of treasury management at accountants Touche Ross. The third, and most commonly chosen, option is to hedge selectively. All of the companies contacted for this article did this and said they adopted a defensive approach to hedging. However, companies are sometimes tempted to speculate. Since this implies that the company believes it has a better insight into the future value of a currency than the dealers and economists whose job it is to take a view of the markets, it is better avoided. Once a company concludes that it needs to hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations, it will need to decide on which method or methods to use: A natural hedge may be available if assets and liabilities in the same currency can be matched. British Technology Group aims for a long-term match of overseas loans with revenue flows, while Designers Guild sets purchases of raw materials in foreign countries against sales to those countries. 'Fifty per cent of our cash flow has a natural cover,' says Naughton-Rumbo. The advantage of natural hedges is they can be 'fail-safe' and once in place are often simpler to manage. Forward contracts are a commonly used method of 'fixing' an exchange rate until delivery and payment are made months or even two or more years later. Thermomax, a Bangor, Co. Down-based manufacturer of solar heating equipment, frequently uses three or six months forward contracts to fix the value of foreign shipments. 'We are happy to lock ourselves in at an acceptable price,' says Ralph Keir, finance director of the 120-employee company. A drawback of such contracts is that they require the company to deliver or take delivery of the currency involved when the contract matures, irrespective of whether the delivery has gone ahead and even if the company has to buy in the currency at a less favourable rate. Currency swaps are similar, though usually cover longer periods, and are usually only available in larger amounts. A company will swap its debts through a bank with another company. The swap agreement sets a rate at which the currencies will be exchanged at a date in the future and until that time, each company pays the interest on the other's currency debt. The aim is to give the two parties a debt in their desired currency. Option forward contracts are similar to a standard forward contract but, rather than setting a single settlement date, provide a range of dates. This can be useful for the company which does not know when a bill will be settled but such contracts are very expensive because the bank will price it at the worst point in the range of dates covered. It is usually better to take a standard forward contract and, after it matures, put the funds on deposit until they are needed, advises Ross. Option forwards must not be confused with: Currency options. These confer the right but (unlike forwards) not the obligation to buy or sell the agreed amount of currency up to or on a set date in the future. If a deal falls through or currencies do not move adversely, then the company buying the option can simply let it lapse. Unlike a forward contract, where the 'price' is concealed in the rate offered, the cost of an option is a premium. The level of the premium depends on how close the exercise rate is to the prevailing exchange rate and the time to maturity. The workings of the foreign exchange markets are often confusing to the outsider. But there are techniques to reduce a business's currency exposure. Doing nothing is certainly not a risk-free option.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- A visiting delegation of  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Japan's No. 2 opposition  force, delivered a conciliatory message Monday [16 May] from  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata addressed to Chinese Communist Party  General Secretary Jiang Zemin, delegation members said.    The message, which touched on controversial remarks made  early this month by then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, was  delivered by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, leader of the  group that arrived in Beijing on Sunday.    In the message, which was received by Li Shuzheng, head of  the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department,  Hata called for development of Sino-Japanese relations and  reiterated his regret over Nagano's remarks.    The message followed a letter from Hata last week to Chinese  Premier Li Peng, in which the prime minister tried to ameliorate  the hurt caused by Nagano's denial of Japan's aggression during  World War II and assertion that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a  fabrication. Nagano has since resigned.    On Sunday, the SDP delegation met with Politburo Member Ding  Guangen, chief of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department  and a member of the secretariat of the Central Committee.    They conveyed to him Hata's assurances that Japan will  remain  mindful of its past aggression and colonial rule in Asia.    In Monday's talks with Li, Kubo urged that China assume a  more active role in facilitating a resolution on the issue of  North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development.    Li, however, was quoted as saying China's leverage is  limited  and that a resolution of the issue should be achieved through  dialogue between the parties directly concerned.    Kubo proposed that Japan and China participate in a  six-nation forum on security issues in Northeast Asia, which  would also include North and South Korea, the United States and  Russia.    But Li was said to have expressed some reservation about  U.S.  participation in any future talks.    The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with Jiang,  is  on an eight-day visit at the invitation of the Chinese Communist  Party to mark the 10th anniversary of exchanges between the two  parties.    The mission will return home on May 22.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Psion more than doubled at Pounds 2.9m Psion, the supplier of hand-held computers and communications equipment, maintained its recovery with profits more than doubled at the halfway stage. The pre-tax outcome for the six months to end-June was Pounds 2.92m, against Pounds 1.07m, achieved on turnover ahead 57 per cent at Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 18.1m). Earnings per share were 8.65p (3.41p); the interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 1.1p. The results were above market expectations and the shares improved 11p to close at 285p. Psion makes a range of hand-held computers, including the Series 3 family, aimed chiefly at consumer markets and the HC range for corporate use. Mr David Potter, chairman, said each product area had shown good growth. Sales of the Series 3 and 3a jumped to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 8.15m) while sales of HC products almost doubled at Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 1.88m). The older and cheaper Organiser II products saw sales decline just 15 per cent to Pounds 4.05m. The datacommunications division turned over Pounds 3.69m (Pounds 2m). Psion is a leader in credit-card sized modems  - devices used to allow computers to communicate over telephone lines. Mr Potter said the company now had 1,500 retail outlets in the US including Radio Shack and Office Depot. The market had been adversely affected by the relative failure of other manufacturers' 'personal digital assistants' using pen-based technology, however, and an advertising campaign aimed at establishing brand awareness was planned. Psion has cash of Pounds 842,000 and Mr Potter did not anticipate having to raise additional funds in the foreseeable future.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Several shots were fired this evening at the car of  Sami Abu-Samahdanah, one of the Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip.  The bullets struck the vehicle, but Abu-Samahdanah was unharmed.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that Abu-Samahdanah  lodged a complaint with the Palestinian-Israeli coordinating  committee. He asserted that the shots had been fired from  inside the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, in an attempt to  assassinate him.</p>

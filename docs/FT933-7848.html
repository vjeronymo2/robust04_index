			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / MPs back right to levy interest on late debts PRESSURE on the government to introduce a statutory right to interest on overdue commercial debts mounted yesterday with the results of a survey suggesting that four out of five MPs support the proposal. The Forum of Private Business published the survey alongside a draft bill that would allow companies to claim interest from late-paying customers for up to six years after the debt arises. Businesses that had failed to make payments on time would also have to record those payments as contingent liabilities in their accounts. The organisation, which represents more than 20,000 companies, said small businesses were owed about Pounds 50bn in overdue debts, with an average 81-day wait for payment. The organisation called on the government to tackle the issue and said there was wide support for the principle of statutory interest. The Department of Trade and Industry is examining measures to deal with late payments but has so far concentrated on a proposal for large companies to state in their accounts the average time taken to pay bills. Baroness Denton, small-business minister, has said she is not convinced that statutory interest will lead to an improvement in payment performance. The DTI said last night that the draft bill would be 'closely examined' to establish whether it was practical. Under the organisation's proposals, companies would remain free to agree their own contractual terms. Overdue Payment of Commercial Debt - the UK National Business Disease.

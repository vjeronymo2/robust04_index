			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview via satellite with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F> Sanchez de Lozada in La Paz by reporter Jacobo Zabludovsky in  Mexico City; from the "24 Hours" newscast--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zabludovsky] How has drug  trafficking influenced or interfered in Bolivia's political life?    Sanchez: Drug trafficking is one of the most  pressing problems confronting Bolivia. No one can explain why  we do not have narcoguerrillas or cartels similar to the ones in  Cali, for example. It is because social cohesion is very strong  in Bolivia. Family and community ties are very strong; at any  rate, the issue is one of concern, because we are a very fragile  nation. Our institutions are very vulnerable, and we are  apprehensive about this drug-trafficking issue.    We are struggling hard against drug trafficking and seeking  strategies to convince the peasantry to become involved in other  activities. It is not an easy task, because there is poverty,  and one of the few things that produces revenue is the coca  plant, especially when it is refined into drugs. Despite all  this, we believe that if we can create enthusiasm for  industrialization or an alternate economic activity, we will be  able to find ways for the Bolivian people to abandon this  activity. It is not an activity we are interested in promoting,  given that it is so dangerous.    Undoubtedly, this is one of the greatest challenges  confronting us, and we are all searching for solutions, not only  the government but society as a whole, because it is undermining  our youth. We are concerned that tomorrow it might undermine  our stability as well as our social harmony. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> TODDLER KILLED WHEN HIT BY RELATIVE'S TRUCK  </P> <P> A Fullerton toddler was struck and killed by his uncle's truck outside a  relative's Norwalk home in what officials said Sunday was a tragic accident.  </P> <P> Ryan Anthony Moss, 22 months, died less than an hour after he was hit Saturday  night by his uncle's 1985 Ram Charger, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Sgt. Matthew  McDannel.  </P> <P> Charles Vincent Simmons, the baby's 29-year-old uncle, was not cited.  </P> <P> "From what we can tell," McDannel said, "it was just a tragic accident, and the  uncle was not held in custody."  </P> <P> Authorities said Ryan was apparently being watched by an aunt, Judy Gaysford,  at the home in the 12600 block of Longworth Ave. when the accident occurred.  Neither the boy's father, James Moss, nor the mother was present.  </P> <P> There had been a party at the house, and several people had gathered about 8  p.m. at the curb outside to bid farewell, McDannel said.  </P> <P> As Simmons kissed his sister goodby, Ryan was in the front yard playing with  other youngsters but evidently stepped off the curb into the street, McDannel  said.  </P> <P> Because Simmons' truck "sits pretty high, he just didn't see him," McDannel  said. Ryan was struck by the truck's right front wheel. Ryan was rushed to  nearby Coast Plaza Medical Center in Norwalk, where he was declared dead.  </P></p>

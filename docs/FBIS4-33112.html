			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fabio Pahim Jr.] </F>   [Text] The record figures attained by industries like the  car industry and the recovery of the house appliances industry  are signs that the economy is progressing very well. "This  year's performance is better than expected," said Roberto Caiuby  Vidigal, president of the Confab [National Brazilian Steel  Forging Company]. "For the first time in recent years the  capital goods sector is registering an increase, and the  continuation of this increase will depend on the next  president," he added.    The idle capability of the capital goods sector is still  considerable (nearly 46 percent) but the amount of new projects  is also considerable: At the beginning of the year the Brazilian  Association for the Development of Basic Industries (Abdib)  estimated there were $38 billion worth of investment projects  requiring capital goods, engineering services, construction, and  assembly. An Abdib bulletin released this month states: "From  the first quarter of 1993 the investment rate and percentage  variation of Fixed Capital Gross Formation [Formacao Bruta de  Capital Fixo] that had accumulated during the four previous  quarters began to climb, thus reverting the negative trend of  1991 and 1992."    The number of new factories (industrial plants) still  remains  small, as in the case of Cenibra [Brazil-Japanese Cellulose  Corporation] [sentence as published]. Companies are, however,  investing in productivity, quality improvement, and the  environment. Caiuby said that Confab earned 20 percent of its  sales in a bad year from the sale of $14 million worth of  dust-removing systems for Usiba [Bahia Iron and Steel Mill] and  Acesita [Itabiera Special Steel Company]."    The largest steel distributor in the country, Rio Negro  company increased its sales of sheet steel by 34 percent during  the first quarter compared to the same period in 1993. During  the first quarter of 1994 Usiminas, Cosipa, and CSN [National  Iron and Steel Company] produced 1.616 million tonnes of sheet  steel, some 21.7 percent more than the 1.330 million tonnes  produced during the same period last year. The 286,000-tonne  increase relates to the direct consumption of the car industry  for four months," said Loureiro [not further identified].  "Consumption has dropped since April but will increase with the  implementation of the real," he foresees.    Faced with a favorable international market, coffee  producers  are experiencing an exceptional moment. Luiz Suplicy Haffers,  the vice president of the Parana Coffee Association, has said  that coffee is quoted at $130 per bag. Brazil produces 22  million bags, which totals $2.4 billion. This is more than was  obtained in 1993 when the Brazilian production of 25 million  bags realized $1.65 billion at an average price of $66 per bag.  Exports this year may range between $1.8 billion and $2 billion  compared with $1.064 billion in 1993. Considering the record  harvest figure of 76 million tonnes of grains expected for this  year, the farming GDP is estimated to rise to 6.6 percent this  year. This has prompted an increase in tractors and machinery  sales.    Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo  State Federation of Industries (FIESP) has said increased  investments are essential for long-term economic growth. He  said: "There are a lot of people waiting to invest and the scene  will be better defined after the elections," adding, "in the  electricity field, foreign businessmen seek us out, offering to  invest -- which has not happened for years." They want to  invest in mills like Serra da Mesa and in the privatizations of  Light [Power Services, Inc.] and Escelsa [Espirito Santo Power  Plants, Inc.].    Moreira Ferreira said: Industrial production dropped in  April  "but recovery is possible," adding, "the outlook is neither over  optimistic or pessimistic." He considers the increase of the  real salary value by 5.4 percent in April as healthy. The  economic recovery during the second half of the year depends on  the success of the Real Plan. "July will be the decisive  month," he said. Moreira Ferreira is optimistic over the  economic plan and praised the finance minister's "firm attitude"  in rejecting salary increases for public and state company  workers and his presidential support for the Federal Revenue  Office, which created a favorable atmosphere for economic  expectations. The FIESP president still has some reservations  over the policy of "very high" bank interest rates and over  state banks. He said: "They may increase the public deficit."  The reduction of import tariffs has created difficulties for  Brazilian industries.</p>

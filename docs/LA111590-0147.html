			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> GASTON GREEN DRAWS PRAISE  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson continued to praise little-used running back Gaston Green  Wednesday, saying that with his 31-yard run last week, Green is showing the  Rams that he deserves more playing time.  </P> <P> "He's not a verbal person," Robinson said.  </P> <P> "What he's doing now on the practice field, he's practicing his . . . off. So I  think he's saying nonverbally, 'Hey, put me in the game.' I'm very impressed  with the way he's handled things that haven't gone his way. So he's sending me  some nonverbal messages that I should respond to, and I'm trying to."  </P> <P> There still are about 2,600 tickets remaining for Sunday's game at Anaheim  Stadium against the Dallas Cowboys. If the tickets are not sold by 1 p.m.  today, the game will be blacked out locally.  </P> <P> The Cowboys released longtime Chicago Bear receiver Dennis McKinnon, a Plan-B  signee during the off-season, and activated rookie linebacker Dave Harper from  their practice squad Wednesday. McKinnon, who started the first three games of  the season, had lost his job to Michael Irvin. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Dalgety profits rise to Pounds 116.8m A STRONG performance from its consumer foods division helped Dalgety to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 110.9m to Pounds 116.8m in the year to June 30. Dalgety shares rose 10p to 395p. Mr Maurice Warren, chief executive, said trading conditions were still tough, though he did not think they were worsening, as some food manufacturers have reported. He said the group was 'set fair for 1993'. The group is seeking acquisitions in Europe, but Mr Warren said these were proving difficult to find at realistic prices. He said the group had benefited from selling its 'commodity' businesses such as eggs and meat last year, and backing its branded goods with a 10 per cent increase in promotional spending to Pounds 36m and rationalisation. Market share gains had been made in snacks and petfoods. Group sales rose 8.8 per cent to Pounds 3.98bn, and trading profits were 4.9 per cent higher at Pounds 122.8m. Trading profits from continuing businesses rose 7.8 per cent to Pounds 121.4m, with Sooner Snacks, acquired in February for Pounds 43m, contributing Pounds 2.5m, although related interest charges were more than Pounds 2m. Interest cost Pounds 9.7m, up from Pounds 8.7m, and pre-tax profits included Pounds 3.7m of profits on property and business disposals, compared with Pounds 2.5m a year ago. The consumer foods division, including Spillers petfoods, Golden Wonder snacks, Homepride grocery products and produce, increased trading profits from Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 59.8m. Food ingredients, which include milling and baking, suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 21.5m, as overcapacity in the industry caused pricing problems. A poor quality harvest this autumn increased wheat prices, though flour prices had yet to follow. The food distribution division, which supplies McDonald's and other fast-food chains in North America, increased volumes by 10 per cent. But extra costs involved in servicing new accounts cut profits from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 12m. Profits from agribusiness, which includes animal feeds, seeds and pig breeding, increased from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 28.1m. Net debt fell from Pounds 70m to Pounds 56m, cutting gearing from 18 per cent to 15 per cent, with Pounds 56m of cash generated from operations. Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 38.6p, and a final dividend of 12p, up from 11.35p, is proposed to give a total of 19.5p, a rise of 5.4 per cent. Lex, Page 20</p>

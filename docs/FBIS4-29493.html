			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Page 5 Report" by Sathit Manatsurakun: "Water Diversion </F> From Salween River To Replenish Phumiphon Dam -- Many Questions  Need To Be Answered"]    [Summary] "It appears that many obstacles face the program  to build seven dams in the Salween River basin in the  Thai-Burmese border area to draw water from branches of the  Salween River to branches of the Chao Phraya River to replenish  the Phumiphon dam in order to feed 22 central region provinces,  including Bangkok.    "In addition to opposition from the local people, which  already has started in some areas, the government program will  have to face scrutiny by private development organizations,  student environmental groups, and academics who have demanded  fair distribution of resources. The obstacles will be just as  intense as those found against the efforts to build other dams.    "The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand [EGAT] has  been assigned by the government to make a feasibility and  environmental impact study of the program, which involves the  construction of at least seven dams.    "They are: the Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project in Mae Sot  District, Tak Province; the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project in Mae  Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Nam Pai-Mae Taeng Project in Pai  District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Ngao-Mae Tun Project in the area  where Sop Moei Subdistrict, Mae Hong Son and Tha Song Yang  District, Tak Province merges; the Lower Nam Pai-Mae Chaem  Project in Muang District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Moei-Mae Tun  Project in Mae Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Salween-Mae Taeng  Project in Burma north of Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai.    "It is estimated that the seven projects will be able to  divert 6 billion cubic meters of water to Phumiphon Dam.    "Because the program will involve drawing water from  international waterways for domestic use, the program originator  has to employ 'offensive public relations' as well as tactics to  push ahead its program on the basis of international  geopolitical factors.    "According to a source in EGAT's Phumiphon Dam Replenishment  Project working team, Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's  Office Sawit Phothiwihok, who is in charge of EGAT, has a policy  to push ahead the program in three ways:    "First, the study for the projects which are located in  Thailand, such as the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project, can start  promptly. The project is located about 600 meters from the bank  of the Moei River on the Thai-Burmese border. A Thai-UK treaty,  signed while Burma was a British colony, stipulates that the  banks of the Salween and Moei Rivers serves as the border, with  the two rivers being neutral territory. Therefore, it should be  no problem to pump water from the Moei River that flows into  Huai Khanaeng Khito in the high tide season.    "Second, on the project which is located in the area  straddling the Thai-Burmese border -- the Nam Moei-Mae Tun -- an  agreement must be reached with Burma to enable Thailand to seek  loans confidently from international financial institutions and  to ensure that there will be no problem with the ethnic minority  groups waging a liberation war nearby.    "Third, Thailand should not ask Burma to permit it to study  the projects located in Burmese territory, such as the Upper  Salween Project, unless Burma wants such projects implemented in  order to sell water and electricity to Thailand. Only under  these conditions should Thailand negotiate with Burma on a  government-to-government level.    "The source said: `This policy was reached after considering  the question: what would we do if Burma asks to conduct a study  on the Chao Phraya River basin?'    "In any event, it appears that the EGAT will choose to  implement more simple projects based on engineering and economic  considerations first."    The EGAT organized a seminar recently to gauge reaction to  two projects -- the Mae Lamao and Huai Khanaeng projects -- on  which it already conducted preliminary studies. The people who  will be displaced by the projects clearly opposed the  construction, while academics and private development  organizations made many observations.    "The seven private development organizations which  participated in the seminar made the following proposals: 1. a  public hearing should be conducted regarding water needs and  resource management in the Chao Phraya River basin; 2. the study  on environmental impact should be expanded to cover the Salween  River basin as well; 3. an independent committee comprising  specialists, local leaders, and representatives of private  development organizations should be formed to monitor the  environmental impact. The committee should participate in every  stage of the projects until after completion of project  construction."    [Begin box]  <H5>  Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project </H5>   The dam is 60 meters high. It will dam Mae Lamao stream  about 15 km from where it merges with the Moei River in Mae  Lamao National Forest Reserve in Mae Sot District, Tak Province.  It will be located about 120 km west of the Tak provincial  town. The reservoir will inundate 4,190 rai of land and contain  94.3 million cubic meters of water. The project cost will be  5,342 million baht. It will irrigate 18,000 rai of farmland and  divert 356 million cubic meters of water through a tunnel to  Phumiphon Dam  <H5>  Huai Khanaeng Project </H5>   The dam will dam Huai Khanaeng Khitoe stream about 600-1,600  meters from where it merges with Moei River. The exact size and  site of the project is still under study. It will be located in  Mae Ramat District, Tak Province. The reservoir will encompass  about 1,400 rai and will divert 600-800 cubic meters of water to  Phumiphon Dam. The project is estimated to cost about 5,068  million baht. [end box]</p>

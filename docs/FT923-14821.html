			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Only outstanding question on Sunday trading relates to competition, not principle Sir, The comment by Lex about the Shops Act ('UK retailing', June 27), suggesting that the European Court of Justice is likely to 'fudge' the verdict if it does not declare the Act incompatible with EC law, seems to lean hard towards the improbable. It is something of a mystery how there has come to be a general impression that the Sunday trading restriction in S47 of the Shops Act 1950 is still at risk of being declared incompatible with Community law by the ECJ. The fact is that the ECJ has declared already not once but three times that the Treaty of Rome leaves member states free to legislate Sunday trading restrictions, whether that is by prohibiting shops from opening (the Torfaen case 145/88, decided November 23 1989) or by prohibiting the employment of staff on Sundays (the later Sidef Conforama case 312/89 and Marchandise case 332/89, March 1991). The question still left open for an ECJ decision expected later this year is not this issue of principle but a subsidiary question related to a rather odd qualifier to the ruling in the original Torfaen case. That left it open to the UK courts to find that S47 is incompatible with EC law if the actual Sunday trading restriction implemented in the Shops Act has disproportionately restrictive effects on Community trade, ie effects which 'exceed the effects intrinsic' to rules prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sundays. The meanderings of procedure have meant that no UK court has pronounced on the result of applying this proviso to the actual effects of the Shops Act. It is fairly hard to see how the Shops Act can possibly have effects that do 'exceed the effects intrinsic to' a prohibition on Sunday trading, since no other restriction is in issue. In this context, the High Court judge whose decision was restored last week by the House of Lords had commented cautiously that the prospects for eventual success by the council trying to enforce the Shops Act 'cannot be described as slight'. The question still before the ECJ is now whether it is still at all necessary for the UK courts to examine the applicability of the odd proviso in the Torfaen ruling, bearing in mind the later ECJ decisions on Sunday employment of staff. Presumably if the answer is no, then the Shops Act will be upheld. If yes, then the case would depend on proving that there are disproportionate restrictive effects on Community trade, in the absence of which, again, the Sunday trading restriction in the Shops Act would be upheld. While nothing perhaps in such a protracted legal saga is ever certain, the UK government seems to be at little risk of financial liability to the retailers due to the case going the other way. It might seem on the contrary that the retailers' original 'Euro-defence' against the simple enforcement of the law has been magnified to generate a procedural quagmire quite disproportionate to the likelihood of its ultimate success.

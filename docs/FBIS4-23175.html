			<p>BFN     [Text] Premier of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging], Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, received an unexpectedly  cordial welcome at three violence ravaged IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] hostels on the East Rand. Mr. Sexwale was greeted with  the title of Big Induna [chief] as an honor when he promised  residents that their place of residence would be improved and  upgraded. Totsi Msomi reports.    [Begin recording] [Msomi] Khumalo Street in Thokoza has been  until recently a no go area. Shooting incidents took place  daily and many people died in battles between the ANC and  Inkatha. However, a new beginning was made today. Tokoza's  community -- hostel dwellers, ANC and Inkatha supporters lined  Khumalo Street to welcome Premier Sexwale. Residents of the  Kwamadala Hostel also welcomed Mr. Sexwale's message of  reconciliation.    [Sexwale, in English] We are saying, all of us are now  working together. Nobody, nothing, must break the unity that we  are building today.    [Unidentified resident, in English] We are tired of what has  happening before and that we are looking forward to come  together and build our nation.    [Unidentified resident, in Zulu] I am very happy. Of course  what happened here today is a big thing.    [Msomi] A similar spirit of reconciliation was also evident  at Katlehong and Vosloorus hostels. The foundation has been  laid for peace within East Rand communities, but only time will  tell how long that peace will last. [end recording]</p>

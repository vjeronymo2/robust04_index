			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari said here today that a political solution has  prevailed in the conflict in the southeastern State of Chiapas  as part of a "new phase to achieve progress" in the search for  solutions for that zone. Maintaining a cease-fire that is  recognized by the Zapatist National Liberation Army and the  prevalence of a political solution are elements that  characterize the correct position assumed by the government  toward the conflict, the president added.    During a news conference that he offered after talks with  Cuban President Fidel Castro, Salinas de Gortari said his  government will try to consolidate peace in and guarantee  national sovereignty over that territory. He will also  reinforce social programs already under way in that zone,  especially those relating to health and supplies implemented as  part of the official policy, about which the Mexican Government  will offer more details later.    Salinas de Gortari added that besides those measures, the  political parties and society are participating in the debate  and efforts to achieve a consensus in the "country's political  and democratic progress." "We have already achieved a national  consensus in favor of peace," with regard to the situation in  the extreme southeastern area of Mexico, the president added.    Salinas de Gortari said he discussed with Castro the  situation in Chiapas, where an armed group occupied several  towns on the first day of this year, followed by a unilateral  cease-fire on the part of the government, and official peace  talks. A government peace proposal was rejected this week by  the armed group that, nevertheless, agreed to respect the  cease-fire. The armed group's reply "seems to be more  politically motivated than moved by social and justice  considerations," he added.    "Although there are no formal peace agreements, the  cease-fire is being maintained and a political solution  prevails," Salinas de Gortari said. "These two results alone  confirm that the strategy followed from the very beginning of  the conflict was the correct one," the president pointed out.    He also recalled that the government is implementing  projects  to solve social and economic problems in Chiapas, where there is  "important progress." Salinas de Gortari added that the work of  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and mediator Samuel Ruiz  -- a Catholic bishop -- led to the establishment of talks with  the armed group and the consolidation of the cease-fire.    President Salinas de Gortari visited Cuba for about six  hours  to meet with Castro before leaving for Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia, to attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit.</p>

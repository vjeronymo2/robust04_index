			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Shephard hints that rules on dole may be eased THE government signalled yesterday that it was ready to ease rules preventing the unemployed receiving dole payments if they were in full-time training or education or working in the unpaid voluntary sector. Under present rules payments are cut for those spending more than 21 hours a week on courses or working in such sectors as voluntary community work. But in a BBC radio interview yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard hinted that these regulations might be altered. The employment secretary said that the special cabinet committee on unemployment, chaired by Lord Wakeham, had completed its work and proposals would be tabled to the Commons within the coming few weeks. She added that the Whitehall-wide inquiry had involved joint reviews by the education and social security departments 'to see if there are more sensible ways of helping unemployed people to use their time constructively'. The government was now examining 'ranges of ways' to help the jobless make productive use of their time away from full-time employment, Mrs Shephard said. Meanwhile, Labour was stepping up its campaign for a Budget for jobs by charging the government with failing to take adequate steps to protect those still in work. In the same BBC programme, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said that as many as 300,000 jobs were now under threat. These included 100,000 in coalmining and related industries, a similar figure through local-authority budget cuts and the rest through post office and rail privatisation, defence cuts and in the London Underground and the National Health Service. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, added that new figures showed more than 3,500 job losses had been announced in the past 10 days with more due imminently as council services are cut back in the budget-setting period. An all-day meeting of the shadow cabinet in London today will also look at plans drawn up by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, for job rallies to be staged in Tory-held marginal seats, including Basildon, Swindon and Tynemouth over the coming weeks.</p>

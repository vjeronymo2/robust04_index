			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO GIVE UP TERRITORIAL CLAIMS, BAKER TELLS ISRAEL  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, delivering an unusually stern warning to  a major pro-Israel lobbying organization, called on Israel on Monday to  renounce its claims to territory that it has seized in wars with neighboring  Arab nations.  </P> <P> "For Israel, now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic  vision of a greater Israel," Baker said in a speech to the American Israel  Public Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> "Israeli interests in the West Bank and Gaza -- security and otherwise -- can  be accommodated in a settlement" that would involve trading land for peace,  Baker told his unreceptive audience. The Israeli government of Prime Minister  Yitzhak Shamir has steadfastly refused to swap land for peace.  </P> <P> "Forswear annexation," Baker urged. "Stop settlement activity" by Jews in the  West Bank. "Allow schools to reopen. Reach out to the Palestinians as neighbors  who deserve political rights."  </P> <P> Baker acknowledged that it would be difficult for Israel "to enter a  negotiating process whose successful outcome will in all probability involve  territorial withdrawal." But, he said, "continuation of the status quo will  lead to increasing violence and worsening prospects for peace."  </P> <P> In setting the tone for a series of meetings between Israeli Defense Minister  Yitzhak Rabin and senior Administration officials in Washington this week,  Baker said it was "high time for serious political dialogue" between Israel and  the Palestinians.  </P> <P> During their first months in office, senior Administration officials generally  have refrained from publicly joining the diplomatic effort to resolve the  Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip. But Baker recently dispatched a senior aide, Dennis Ross, on a  low-key visit to Israel, and the Administration has quietly begun to focus on  the region, following an introductory series of one-on-one meetings between  President Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhak Shamir and King Hussein of Jordan.  </P> <P> On Monday morning, Rabin conferred with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney about the  current military situation in Israel. Defense officials said Rabin sought  assurances that the United States would maintain promised levels of military  aid. He met with Baker later and is scheduled to meet with Bush on Wednesday  afternoon.  </P> <P> While Cheney and Rabin did not discuss specific weapons systems that Israel  hopes to buy from the United States, officials said that Cheney promised to  work for congressional approval of $1.8 billion in foreign military sales  financing in each of the next two years. The Defense Department administers the  foreign military sales program, which supplements $1.2 billion in proposed  economic support funds.  </P> <P> Baker, reiterating in his speech the U.S. preference for Palestinian  self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip "in a manner acceptable to  Palestinians, Israel and Jordan," said: "Such a formula provides ample scope  for Palestinians to achieve their full political rights. It also provides ample  protection for Israel's security as well."  </P> <P> But, he said, "the gap between the parties on key issues such as Palestinian  representation and the shape of a final settlement remains very, very wide."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Atmosphere of Violence  </P> <P> "Violence has soured the atmosphere," he said, referring to the deaths of 19  Israelis and more than 425 Palestinians since the uprising began in December,  1987. "So, a quick move to negotiations is quite unlikely.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a speech prepared for delivery today to the same group, Rep. Les  Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, seemed to echo  Baker's message, saying that "military dominance is not for eternity. . . . In  the end, a true and comprehensive peace settlement is required. Only that can  bury the menace."  </P> <P> Aspin will also say that U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation, as well as U.S.  efforts to stem the proliferation of chemical, nuclear and ballistic missile  technology to the Middle East, could "buy time" for Israel to make peace with  its neighbors.  </P> <P> "But we cannot turn the clock back. . . . Time is not in inexhaustible supply,"  Aspin will say.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Melissa Healy contributed to this story.  </P></p>

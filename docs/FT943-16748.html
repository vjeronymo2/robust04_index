			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Murdoch acquires free stake in German satellite TV With characteristic flair and chutzpah, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation yesterday acquired a stake in the Vox satellite television channel in Germany - for nothing. The deal gives News Corp 49.9 per cent of the broadcaster, which went into liquidation on April l. However, the Murdoch group will not take on any of the TV station's debt. News Corp, whose interests include a 50 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting in the UK, the Fox television network in the US and control of Star TV in Asia, will contribute 'programming expertise'. The deal represents Mr Murdoch's most significant move into the German television market. Launched at the beginning of last year, Vox has been in trouble from the start because of its programme mix and disagreements between the original six shareholders. It is estimated to have cost shareholders, including media group Bertelsmann, DM400m (Pounds 161m) since its launch. The channel, billed originally as 'television for university graduates', is required by its licence to have a heavy information content. However, it seems likely that it will now be redefined and aimed at a younger market, possibly with more entertainment programmes. Vox has about a 2 per cent audience share and is believed to be ninth out of 15 cable and satellite channels in the German market. However, it is one of only three channels to have access to the entire German terrestrial and cable television network. It is also carried on both the Astra and the Kopernikus satellite television systems. Bertelsmann, which is second only to Time Warner on the world media stage, will retain its 24.9 per cent in Vox. Yesterday it said the closure of the broadcaster had been 'averted at the last minute' after a 'months-long negotiating marathon'. The remaining 25.2 percent of the broadcaster will be held by a trustee until other investors are found. There is speculation that Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, which holds a 49.9 per cent stake in RTL, a rival channel, will take a stake in Vox.</p>

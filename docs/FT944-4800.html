			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Israel looks east for new markets - Peace process brings dividends for exporters Israeli exports to Asia have risen by a third in the first nine months of this year, highlighting the growing trade benefits resulting from the Middle East peace process, according to Israeli Treasury officials. Including diamonds, Israeli exports to Asia climbed to Dollars 2.3bn between January and September compared to Dollars 1.8bn for the same period in 1993. The Treasury said the trend reflected the development of non-traditional markets. Exports to Asia now account for 12.4 per cent of total Israeli exports, compared to only 8.1 per cent in 1992, the Treasury said. The figures were announced ahead of next week's visit to Tokyo by the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin. During the visit, the first to Japan by an Israeli premier, Mr Rabin is expected to sign two agreements; the first on cultural exchanges and the second on co-operation in science and technology. Israeli officials said the visit would be a landmark in Israeli-Japanese relations after a prolonged period in which Israel regarded Tokyo as taking a pro-Arab line on foreign policy because of its dependence on Arab crude oil. Israeli exports to Japan rose 17.5 per cent in the first nine months of this year to Dollars 681.5m, compared to Dollars 579.6m for the same period in 1993. However, almost 70 per cent of Israeli exports to Japan are diamonds. Since the Israeli-Palestinian peace breakthrough last September, Mr Rabin has also visited China, Singapore and Indonesia. After his visit to Tokyo he will travel to South Korea. The Treasury also said that total exports, including services, are forecast to grow by approximately 9 per cent this year, after a 12 per cent increase last year, and that the high level of inward investment in the Israeli economy would ensure continued high growth of exports in 1995. Israeli exports of merchandise, excluding diamonds and services, reached Dollars 10bn in the first ten months of this year - an increase of 12.1 per cent in real terms over last year. Agricultural exports rose 7.2 per cent during the first ten months and industrial exports, excluding diamonds, climbed 12.3 per cent. Exports rose 3 per cent to the European Union, 13 per cent to the European Free Trade Association and 7 per cent to the US.</p>

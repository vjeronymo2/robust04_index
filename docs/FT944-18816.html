			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Wanted - wonder of the age: Now is the time for all good citizens to come to the aid of the (millennium) party. But only mind-blowing ideas will do, says Antony Thorncroft The countdown has started. In just over five years the world will be celebrating, well, the party of the millennium. And if new year's eve 1999 does not go off with a suitably seismic bang, pedants, who know that the third millennium starts at midnight on January 1 2001 can have a second crack a year later. The British government is among the purists. Its millennium celebrations climax at the end of the year 2000. And it is going to be some junket: it has set aside a possible Pounds 1.6bn to make sure that it is an event that will be remembered for at least the next century. The joy of it all is that, in theory, not a penny of the cost will be paid for by the government - or the taxpayer. It is coming from that seemingly inexhaustible milch cow, the National Lottery. The lottery is one of John Major's footnotes in history. Margaret Thatcher, the former premier, was implacably opposed to government sponsored gambling: it disturbed her non-conformist soul. Major quickly recognised the inanity of the UK being the only developed nation without a lottery and gave the go-ahead. He has proved a reliable friend. Only last month he confirmed his support. 'The money raised by the lottery will not replace existing government funding - Treasury, please note.' But if John Major is midwife to the lottery, Lord Palumbo, when chairman of the Arts Council, is given credit for dreaming up the idea that a fifth of all the money raised for good causes from the lottery should go into a millennium fund. His main concern was patching up the great national monuments, especially the cathedrals and grand mansions, as the tired old century came to a close, in time for a fresh start in the new millennium. The concept soon developed a momentum of its own and until the end of 2000 the millennium fund will be a power in the land. Then the other lottery beneficiaries - the arts, the heritage, sport and charities - will subsume its portion, and all that will be left is its legacy. Just as the millennium fund arrived rather suddenly from nowhere so it carries little baggage. There has been only one attempt to define its objectives - by Peter Brooke, the former Heritage Secretary, who guided the lottery on to the statute book. His vision was warming but woolly. 'Our millennium projects are probably going to be those that would not otherwise happen.' 'Above all, the millennium commission's legacy should form a permanent enhancement of our national heritage. 'We should seek to capture the spirit of our age in enduring landmarks that symbolise our hopes for the future.' He took as his benchmark the Great Exhibition of 1851, which bequeathed such memorials as the Crystal Palace and the South Kensington museums, and its dim echo, the 1951 Festival of Britain, which bequeathed the little loved South Bank arts centre. A few certainties about the millennium are emerging through the haze. Undoubtedly, there will be some grandiose building projects but not nearly as many as first envisaged, at least by the directors of our great museums and galleries. Around half the millennium's cash will go on a dozen enduring monuments, fairly spread across the country. The other half will be spent on more transitory feel-good experiences which, ideally, would directly affect the lives of as many people as possible. The capital projects are up and running, at least in blueprint, before the first lottery ticket has been sold (in November) and the first donations to a good cause made, probably next June. It is already apparent that some highly fancied schemes will be turned down by the millennium fund commissioners, a nine-strong band of the Great and the Good. They are not inclined to help Covent Garden in its Pounds 100m rebuilding appeal: that is a decision for the Arts Council lottery staff. They are unimpressed by a proposal for a great national sports stadium in Manchester: that is for the Sports Council to consider. They are worried by schemes that involve the refurbishment of existing buildings, like the British Museum's Pounds 100m plan to enclose its inner court yard: perhaps the National Heritage Fund could help here. The millennium fund ideally wants new buildings, and mind-expanding ones at that, something on the lines of the Crystal Palace of 1851 or its pipsqueak 1951 successor, the Skylon. It is unwilling to provide money when there are already established institutions which exist to help. But it will provide endowment funds, so that anything really innovative that emerges does not have to struggle to survive. Who knows the UK might have the finest equipped rock stadium in the world in five years, or a technology museum which places foreign science parks back in the Dark Ages. It is hard to find current projects which are copper-bottomed certainties for millennium aid. For example, Cardiff Opera House is a strong candidate. Wales must have one big millennium building, geography dictates that. Wales is the land of song; Cardiff Bay is trying to regenerate itself; and the local arts mafia has got its act so organised that it has already chosen an architect, Zaha Hadid, on the basis of her challenging design. The only doubt over Cardiff Opera House is not that the proposed gigantic glass building will appear too 20th century modernist, and therefore dated, for the commissioners, but that they decide that the Welsh Office, or the local council, or commercial developers, are already in place to fund such a development. Who is to say that opera houses might not be old hat in the 21st century? Another strong contender is the South Bank Centre in London. It has asked Richard Rogers, one of the most fashionable architects of the day, to come up with ideas and he has proposed a semi-translucent umbrella to cover the existing faded buildings. A nationally sensitive site, with memories of past celebrations; a big name architect; plus the opportunity to hold the millennium festival there, that the commissioners might think essential to celebrate the big year - the South Bank looks a good bet. As does the Tate Gallery of Modern Art on Bankside. Perhaps it is too near the South Bank for comfort, but the UK lacks a national gallery of modern art and we are supposed to be looking forward in 2000. This may enable the commissioners to forget that the Tate is planning to move into an existing building, the old Bankside power station, much of which will be retained. The fact that the Tate has been quick off the mark, and is likely to be able to raise perhaps half the Pounds 80m needed from its own resources, may sway the commissioners, who expect big projects to conjure up some matching funding. None of these buildings, currently the fancied runners, really lifts the imagination. It is hard to think that many people a century from now will look at them in awe and regard or consider the 1990s as an age of Titans. None compares to the Eiffel Tower in terms of pretension, or the Statue of Liberty in terms of moral statement. None will take its place as a Wonder of the World. Oddly the most ambitious millennium project announced to date, the Pounds 150m Albertopolis plan for a regenerated museum village in South Kensington, looks like an early casualty, with one important participant hiving off to do its own thing, a pedestrian piazza linking the Hall with the Albert Memorial. Along with the London opera houses and museums, Albertopolis is likely to lose out to such regional ventures as a rehabilitated flour mill in Gateshead, which aims to be the contemporary art centre of the north east; or the Lowry Museum in Lancashire; or the proposed National Gallery of Scottish art. Here again there is nothing of real splendour. Anyone contemplating a giant platinum pyramid, an awesome bridge, or an inter-denominational cathedral-mosque, had better get their designs on paper quickly. The commissioners are not really worried about the capital projects - they feel they will emerge inexorably, even if they are not quite as spell-binding as they would wish. What concerns them, and perhaps the government, is engendering a feel-good factor in the public. They are touring the country, touting ideas from local worthies. John Major came up with one last month - a computer in every village hall in the land. These meetings cause problems. The commissioners cannot solicit applications: they can only offer guidelines. Most people, if asked how they would spend Pounds 1.2bn (the commissioners are not yet accepting that the lottery will give them Pounds 1.6bn: they are probably holding back Pounds 400m for a grand finale in 2000), would say 'devote it to cancer research, or at least arthritis' or 'provide nursery schooling for all' or 'modernise the transport system'. But millennium money cannot be spent on areas where the government is already financially committed. Hence the hunt for brilliant new ideas. The environment is certainly in favour - plans to replant the Caledonian Pine Forest in the Scottish Highlands, and to create parklands in derelict inner cities, have a winning look. Technology is an acceptable buzz word, and networks of local science centres, like that in the Smithsonian in Washington, stand a chance. Bursaries for foreign travel and education on the lines of the Rhodes Scholarships are obvious contenders. But what the commissioners would really like is a mind-blowing grand idea - like the Open University. They might have to settle for hundreds of small ones. This village might get a clock; that a communal green. Certainly the aim is to spread the money around the land, especially if local community groups join in with their time, labour and perhaps a little cash. Disused railway tracks might be brought back to life; canals might be put back into use; Stonehenge might be turned into a national park; the Highlands might get a university; retreats for artists and writers and musicians might dot the land. The greening of Britain, with the planting of millions of trees, may capture the public mood. The imagination is encouraged to run riot. The commissioners need help. Without the input of the people more and more of the cash might be siphoned off on the grand proposals just because they can afford consultants and influential appeal raisers and are ready to start. This is the opportunity for the common man to improve his quality of life. The commissioners will look more kindly on plans to improve existence in Derry rather than London. They want to reach the people and places which have been left behind in recent years. They want to improve the image of the nation now to future generations. Ideally, people in 2094 should be benefiting from the expenditure of the next five years. The FT is playing its part by asking its readers for their suggestions. They must look forward to the next century and beyond, although no doubt the millennium will also be used for a stock taking of the past, a modern Domesday survey of Great Britain in the year 2000. The best ideas will receive prizes, although not to the value of Pounds 1.6bn.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: Cristina Hoyos - Edinburgh International Festival the most distinguished, on paper, since 1979  - has begun high on the applause meter. Cristina Hoyos, the dramatic flamenco dancer, who may be remembered from the Carlos Saura films of Blood Wedding and El Amor Brujo, formed her own company in 1988. Hoyos is a nice mix of opposites  - sleek and explosive, earthy and elegant. She has an attack that makes her smallest move register powerfully for miles, and an intense, brooding presence. But if Hoyos is a true flamenco virtuoso, this programme does not show it. It is designed to promote her stellar lustre  - no other female dancer is given any important choreography. But it also suggests Hoyos is deliberately making dances that will not expose any decline in her technical powers. She also wants to make flamenco tell stories. Well, maybe it can, but not, surely, Lorca's Yerma? Yerma, a village wife whose goals are marriage and parenthood, is childless and unhappy about her husband's refusal to give her children. How do you convey 'You are not making babies with me, Juan' or 'She is sterile' in dance? Maybe you could mime it, but Hoyos is above that. She suffers statuesquely, she thrashes about the stage with a portentous gloom, she slides down her husband's body and, lying flat on the floor, opens her legs to him. But it looks as if her problem is merely his neglect, not her childlessness. This would scarcely matter if Yerma abounded in great dancing. But it's just a pot-pourri of flamenco moods. And its music, played mainly offstage, is so heavily amplified that it might as well be a recording. If flamenco music does not sound live, and if the dancing does not sound like a response to live music, then it is not flamenco puro. That goes also for the programme's other item, the all-dance Lo Flamenco. Here the musicians are onstage throughout  - but the singers still look as if they're lip-synching. Two male dancers are given big solos, but their material is blandly academic in its bravura, as if it were designed to pass a flamenco dance exam (grade 8). They don't have the fantasy or the individuality that even the three male singers show in the daft little solos that they offer at encore time. Still, Lo Flamenco feels like a happy party, with dancers and musicians all involved in something communal  - until Hoyos herself enters, half-way through. The show promptly changes identity and becomes a star vehicle. She's certainly an arresting dancer, perfectly co-ordinated, and her solos are full of eccentric touches  - zigzag shoulders, sudden switches of direction. But even this is conceived, not as a response to music, but a slick exercise in audience manipulation. In that respect, though I myself found it phoney, it succeeds admirably. At The Playhouse, Edinburgh, until August 20</p>

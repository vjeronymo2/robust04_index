			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH'S RIGHT STUFF  </P> <P> I was somewhat disturbed in reading Mike Boehm's review of the Church's opening  show at the Coach House ("The Right (Same) Stuff," July 14). Most distressing  was not the essentially negative conclusion of artistic stagnation but rather  Mr. Boehm's unbelievable abuse of similes. . . . "Like Bob Dylan. . . . Like  Van Morrison. . . . Like the Beatles."  </P> <P> Such blatant idolization of widely popular artists is deluded. Lack of monetary  success is not "specialization," and is not the antithesis of mass popularity.  Wake up.  </P> <P> A band that has so many varied solo projects (nine) and cohesiveness is not to  be subjected to a historical essay. I think that (Church lead singer) Steve  Kilbey responded best the other evening to the charges, saying roughly, "It's  as if we reached an impressive stature by immaculate conception!" Folk roots or  no folk roots, the Church buried Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and the Beatles last  night.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER B. SAMUELIAN  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

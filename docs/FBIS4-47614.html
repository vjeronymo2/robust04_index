			<p>Summary--Evidently      seeking to further cultivate his public  image as a top Iraqi official and potential successor to his father,  Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy has continued to publish in his newspaper  BABIL materials that are taboo for  other  Iraqi media organs.  For  example, the 2 February 1994 issue contains copies of alleged fliers  dropped on al-Basrah Governorate by "coalition aircraft" that depict  'Udayy and other Iraqi officials as "wanted" by "international  justice."  The pictures of 'Udayy and other senior Iraqi officials  are accompanied by summaries of the individuals' alleged crimes.      'Udayy Saddam Husayn's newspaper BABIL has had a long history of  publishing articles, editorials, and interviews that are  surprisingly candid and frank in in a country with strict limits on  freedom of the press.  'Udayy apparently has used this vehicle not  only to portray himself as a champion of press freedom, but also to  avenge his enemies and to advance his political career.  The fact  that BABIL has continued to be published suggests that 'Udayy's  enterprising approach to commenting on political and economic  developments in Iraq enjoys, on balance, Saddam's support.      'Udayy may have published the fliers in question primarily to  enhance his own political status.  BABIL's headline on the fliers  reads: "The Greatest Honor: Serving the Homeland and the Leader."  'Udayy's name and picture appear alongside those of Vice-President  Taha Yasin Ramadan, Defense Minister 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, Interior  Minister Watban Ibrahim, Revolution Command Council Member Muhammad  Hamzah al-Zubaydi, and Ba'th Party Command Member 'Aziz Salih al-  Numan.  The text accompanying the reproduced fliers claimed that  they were air-dropped by the same aircraft that had dropped  "hundreds of tons of bombs on our great people" during the Gulf War.  But, it added, those attacks "failed to achieve the enemies' goal of  infringing on the sovereignty, security, and renaissance of Iraq  under its mujahid leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect  and preserve him."  The hardcopy version of this Foreign Media Note  contains pictures of six individuals and a summary of the crimes  with which their are charged.

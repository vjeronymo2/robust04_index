			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Scholl dips to Pounds 11.7m mid-way HIGH marketing and develop-ment investment cost Scholl, the healthcare company, a dip in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.7m in the six months to June 30, compared with last time's Pounds 13.7m, which was flattered by Pounds 2.4m in higher investment and one-off gains. Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said the company had so far outperformed rivals as recession swept continental Europe: 'There is a problem and we can't stay above it for ever. We can't be any more optimistic than other people. I am terribly concerned about continental Europe even if we fared fairly well.' Turnover rose to Pounds 94.1m (Pounds 85.8m), with about 5 per cent of the gain attributable to currency movements and the rest to improvements in third party distribution sales, including a contract with Bristol Myers in Germany, and about 26 per cent growth in the Asia region, and 6 per cent in Australia. The company made two acquisitions in the first half of 1992. The Scholl retail chain in Canada opened four additional stores bringing the total to 24, with three more planned by the year end. The Gerard House herbal remedies company increased distribution from about 1,800 to nearly 5,000 points of sale. It bought Septivon, the antiseptic wash brand, in June from Elf Sanofi for FF125m (Pounds 14.7m) cash, plus taxes of FF8.5m (Pounds 1m). Scholl said results had been brought down at the half year by a change in the business mix: 'We used to be in a situation where all profit was made in the first half. Last year the split was roughly 75 per cent in the first half and the remaining quarter in the second and this trend is likely to continue this year.' At halfway the company had Pounds 6m (Pounds 19.4m) in cash and borrowings of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 2.8m). The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.6p out of earnings of 9.3p (11.2p).</p>

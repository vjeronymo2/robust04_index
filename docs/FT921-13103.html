			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Business Law: Computers in support of litigation It is hard to imagine a large law firm today operating without information technology (IT). Word processing, accounting systems, electronic mail and many more administrative and management applications are widely used. By contrast, lawyers themselves, in their advisory capacity, are far from dependent on technology. It requires little vision to imagine lawyering without IT: take technology away from most lawyers and there would be no perceptible change to their daily lives. But lawyers - as distinct from law firms - cannot remain impervious to technology for much longer. Litigators, in particular, are poised to undergo their own computer revolution. The term that is widely used here is 'litigation support', one branch of which involves systems that help with the management and control of large quantities of documents. The potential of this technology is particularly clear in complex technical cases, such as construction or computer disputes, where the party that has mastery of the documents can enjoy a clear strategic advantage over others. Three techniques currently dominate litigation support. One approach is to compile a computerised index of all documents relating to a case. Each document is represented in a database as a collection of objective features, such as date of document, author, as well as subjective features, requiring lawyers' classifications, such as whether a document is privileged or prejudicial to the client's case. Once set up, such a system can sort documents - for example, by date or by author's name. Additionally, the system can search and produce lists of documents sharing particular features - for instance, a list of all privileged documents written by Company X to Mr Y between two specified dates. Another technique is to build an information retrieval system that holds not an index but the full text of a collection of papers. This enables lawyers to search quickly and easily within the entire text of documents for the occurrence of single words (names of individuals, companies, places, or terms such as 'warranty' or 'delay') or for words in combination (the name of a company within a specified number of words of the name of an individual or a phrase such as 'defective software'). A third approach to litigation support uses imaging technology. This process can be likened to taking photographs of individual documents and can cope well with non-textual materials such as drawings and handwriting. Users of systems that hold images cannot search for individual words within the imaged documents (the text is not in machine readable form). Rather, they can view these images as if perusing microfiche on a computer screen. A database containing only images has two main uses: first, in overcoming problems of physical space and storage; and, second, in reducing the amount of paperwork that needs to be handled by judges and juries. The real benefits of litigation support will come with a combination of these three techniques. On one particularly promising model, the lawyer's first exposure to a set of documents will be through a litigation workstation with a large, television-sized, monitor. This system will contain the images of all the documents, each objectively indexed. The lawyer will read through the images of the documents on screen, adding subjective commentary to the index and selecting portions of text to be converted from image into searchable form. The result will be a sophisticated index, a database of searchable extracts, as well as the images themselves. Such a system would be invaluable for lawyers and clients both in preparation for trial and in the courtroom itself. Those who consider litigation as too confrontational, costly and time consuming often find in litigation support the makings of a panacea, a promising source of enhanced productivity, quality and efficiency and, in turn, the means by which disputes might be pre-empted, settled earlier or resolved at lower cost and greater speed. So where's the rub? Why aren't all lawyers using litigation support technologies? Lawyers have a range of misgivings, most of which are rooted in their incomplete picture of what can actually be achieved. Lawyers' preferences for secretive exploitation of IT does not help; nor does their refusal to work together in establishing standards and settling on compatible systems. A further obstacle is the belief that it can rarely be cost effective for the purposes of litigation to transfer documents from paper to machines. Historically, this has been true, but rapid advances in optical and intelligent character recognition technologies, together with the emergence of service companies devoted to indexing, data entry and imaging, suggest that it may no longer be a big problem. Moreover, as clients increasingly use computer-based document management systems for their own administrative purposes, it will be simpler to transfer documents from them to litigation support systems. Nonetheless, there is uncertainty over costs. There has been no court decision on whether the costs of setting up and running litigation support systems can be recovered by a successful party in litigation from the unsuccessful party. This matter is being pursued by the Society for Computers and Law, as it is unacceptable for solicitors to be unsure when asked to advise their clients on the recoverability of such costs. A further anomaly arises from the general requirement that lawyers charge on the basis of the hours spent on a task; a phenomenon which could, in principle, reward the inefficient firm and penalise the well-run practice. When litigation support systems are used, and time is saved, total time spent becomes a less reliable indicator of the value of a service. Cynics have suggested that lawyers will be reluctant to become too efficient with technology until the basis of charging changes. It would be sad if lawyers' uptake of litigation support technology was inhibited by inapposite billing and cost-recovery practices. Yet none of the perceived problems seems to be insurmountable, as the more progressive litigators are showing by their successful deployment of the new technologies. Indeed, ignoring litigation support is fast becoming uncommercial as barristers with positive experience come to expect solicitors to use computers; as courts encourage and require parties to employ database technology; and as clients realise that a higher-quality, lower-cost, wider-ranging service is available from hi-tech solicitors, legal Luddites will soon struggle. For clients, these developments raise challenging questions about the suitability of the lawyers they instruct. A further criterion in selecting legal advisers now emerges, relating to the extent to which lawyers have appropriate technology skills and support. If in big cases of the future, all parties have the documents held in litigation support systems (loaded perhaps by some external bureau), a key point of differentiation among practices will be law firms' relative proficiency in exploiting the data in these systems. Are the lawyers adequately trained in advanced searching techniques? What practical experience and record do they have with litigation support? Do they have permanent, first-rate support staff? Are they using advanced techniques, such as conceptual searching, intelligent 'front-ends' and hypertext to enhance the basic systems? Are they capable of advising proactively on versatile document management systems? Do they understand the complex legal questions regarding issues such as admissibility and authentication of evidence that litigation support systems raise? These are all questions clients should be asking before long. An immediate question for all clients is whether their lawyers are investing sufficiently in IT in preparation for the central role it is destined to play. The stage is set for significant change in the world of litigation. In five years, complex, large-scale litigation in the UK will invariably be supported by IT. By the turn of the century, litigation without IT will be virtually unimaginable. The author is special adviser on law and information technology at Masons, solicitors in London.

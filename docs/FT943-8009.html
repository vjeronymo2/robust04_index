			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: High technology, high ambitions - Ionica has plans to challenge BT and Mercury Most high technology start-ups suffer their teething pains in decent obscurity. No such luck for Ionica, which next year will challenge British Telecom and a host of new telecommunications operators for a share of the UK residential telephone market. Ever since the Cambridge-based company was awarded a licence to provide fixed telephone services in the UK two years ago, it has been subject to minute scrutiny - and a large dollop of scepticism. Would it be able to raise the necessary funding? Will its radio-based technology prove a match for the more conventional copper wire? Can enough telephone users - Ionica says it is looking for one in five of the UK's 20m residential lines - be persuaded to ditch BT and Mercury for a company without track record or international presence? Mr Nigel Playford, managing director, exudes an air of somewhat puzzled optimism when he reviews the company's progress since 1992. It is unlike any other company in this series, in that it had no option other than to have a grand strategy. 'You cannot be a small telco,' Mr Playford says, implying that Ionica either reaches its goal of national coverage or goes out of business. He is puzzled that no competitor came up with a similar approach. It was the first company to apply for a public telecommunications operator's licence after the government decided in 1991 to end the duopoly of BT and Mercury, and was rewarded with 30 megahertz of radio spectrum yielded, it seems, by the Ministry of Defence. Its business case looks increasingly sound. In a freely competitive environment, Ionica argues, the bulk transport of telephone traffic over long distances is a commodity to be bought at the lowest price from competing carriers. The commercial advantage then lies with whoever controls the 'local loop', the local exchange and the link to the home or office. What about the threat from cable television and mobile phone operators? Mr Playford argues that the cost of cable per home passed is some hundreds of pounds, compared with only Pounds 2 to Pounds 3 for radio. Cable telephony, furthermore, has to be piggybacked on to television services for the economics to make sense. Mobile telephony has limitations in service quality, cost, coverage and in penetration of buildings and so on. But Ionica will only be successful if it can offer a service at least as good as BT's and at a better price. It has developed a radio telephony system for the local loop. The prototype is working now, field trials will start towards the end of the year and the service will be launched next year. Given the intention to concentrate on residential customers and to some extent small businesses, marketing will clearly be critical. Mr Playford intends to offer some interesting variations on conventional services. The details remain confidential, but they are likely to involve several lines into the home - 'features that will help resolve family tensions over the use of the telephone,' he says, guardedly. The intention, however, is to avoid the bells and whistles promised by proponents of the 'information superhighway'. So videoconferencing will be a possibility, but there is no intention of offering video-on-demand. There is no intention, either, of expanding into forms of telephony outside the scope of the licence, although Mr Playford is in discussions with an unnamed mobile phone operator over a deal for reciprocal sale of services. The technology used is straightforward and has one advantage: that it exists. After initial scepticism, Mercury and BT are now showing interest in radio for the local loop but they will have to do their own development or buy in a solution from another supplier. Ionica's switches, the heart of the system, are System X bought from GPT. Its subscriber equipment - receiving antennae, electronics to decode the signals and handset - is being manufactured by Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, through a partnership agreement. There is interest in the system from some 50 markets overseas, which see radio telephony as an answer to the building of a conventional telecommunications infrastructure. Mexican and Finnish companies have already licensed the technology. The potential world wide is for hundred of millions of lines - which would have a huge effect on NT's unit manufacturing costs. Ionica will shortly move into a purpose-built, environmentally sound building on the Cambridge technology park, but it is still tiny, with only 70 full-time employees. It has, however, raised some Pounds 50m of initial funding - a spectacular sum for a start-up - from large shareholders including Yorkshire Electricity, Telecom Finland and Robert Fleming Investment Trust, and a host of small investors. Mr Playford believes another Pounds 50m will be needed; then the operation should begin to finance itself from revenues. Extra funds may be raised from existing shareholders, and talks are in progress with two large foreign telecommunications operators which could also result in further equity investment. Mr Playford says the group is thinking of going public in about 18 months; by that time it will be clear whether Ionica is going to be successful. A public offering would give its smaller investors the opportunity of a satisfactory exit. Sometimes seen as self-assured to the point of arrogance, Mr Playford confesses his confidence was shaken last year by worries that funding would not be forthcoming. 'But you have to believe you can do it,' he says. Previous articles in this series appeared on August 10 and August 16.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (14): Stepping into the breach - Jon Marks finds that private insurers can facilitate exports in difficult markets where standard cover is often unavailable / Private market export credit insurance / Getting Paid, the private insurance market, short-term credit insurance, multilateral aid programmes and EU initiatives all help exporters secure payment It can be costly and often it is not available when it could help most. But for companies faced with the need to secure their export orders against the risks of a customer not paying, the private insurance market should not be ruled out as a means of facilitating exports. Private insurers cover political and commercial risk in difficult markets. An attraction of private political risk cover is that - by basing its risk assessment on the intrinsic characteristics of individual deals - it may be used when the standard export credit agency (ECA) cover is not available. ECAs and banks whose exposure limits and risk ratings are largely based on perceptions of country risk, may be constrained by macro-economic or wider political considerations. 'Unlike traditional, government-backed business, the market brings with it commercial rules, helping to rationalise the market,' says Louis Habib-Deloncle, head of the recently created Paris insurer Unistrat Assurances and founder of the Paris Pool of political risk insurers. However, given the risks involved, private insurance may often be out of the question outside the OECD and official cover continues to dominate. Problems at Lloyd's and wider problems faced by global insurance markets mean the private market's capacity to insure deals is more constrained than it was in the 1980s. The private market is mostly short-term and can cover contracts of up to Dollars 30-40m. For confiscation cover, deals of up to Dollars 150m could be insured. Most deals are much smaller. But if the deal is right, the private market may insure risks which ECAs and banks usually avoid. This is reflected in the pattern of claims, says Kit Brownlees, managing director of political risk brokers Investment Insurance International (III), part of the Bain Hogg Clarkson group. The private market has been little affected by the Russian debt crisis, which has damaged ECAs and other creditors, because Lloyd's and other underwriters never took up much Russia risk. Cuba, however, was a market that most ECAs would not touch, but was open for private insurance of state-guaranteed letters of credit (l/cs) until Havana decided to stop making repayments in the late-1980s. Mr Brownlees believes Cuba represents the worst loss experienced by the market. In other cases, the private market has stepped in when ECAs have gone off-cover and banks have mainly reached their country ceilings. This was the case for Iran in 1992-93, when high profit margins made private insurance a valid option. The private market had capacity because Tehran continued to honour all its l/cs and ECAs had taken up most previous business. Iran's subsequent debt crisis has left private insurers, as well as the ECAs, forfaiters and other trade financiers who rushed in before it, confronting losses. Much private market business involves countertrade and other commodity-related business. 'In these deals we are covering performance risk, not country risk like an ECA would do,' Mr Brownlees says. In Zambia, for example, ECA cover is highly constrained but private insurance is available for the supply of equipment to Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), backing sales against payments linked to copper exports. Working within the Lloyd's of London system, III, has the largest share of the private political risk broking market, followed by Unistrat and American Insurance Group (AIG). Others underwriting political risk business include The People's Insurance Company, based in Singapore, and the Bermuda-based Exporters Insurance Company (EIC). AIG is developing its international reach. In France, analysts say its excess loss policies and other products are taking growing market share. EIC is among several newcomers to the business. 'The growth of newcomers like EIC is providing a whole new capacity,' Mr Brownlees says. Increasing capacity is essential if private political risk insurance is to become relevant to more exporters. 'Customers increasingly understand how to use the market, but they see the capacity is too small,' Mr Habib-Deloncle says. Lloyd's problems mean that overall levels of private insurance have markedly reduced since the 1980s. Other insurers have also found themselves confronted with problems leading to a reorganisation in the market in recent years. The private sector is more of a complement than competition to ECAs, according to Xavier Denecker, director of the French credit insurer Coface responsible for communications. In France a series of reforms and the introduction of new policies has increased the flexibility of Coface which is now majority privately-owned. 'Public sector insurers must show they are working in the national interest and keep within strict limits on country risk,' Mr Denecker says. 'Private insurers can guarantee all operations and here is their real niche'.</p>

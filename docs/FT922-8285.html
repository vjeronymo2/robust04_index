			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Papua lands troops on Bougainville PAPUA New Guinea (PNG) said yesterday its troops had landed in the south of the secessionist island of Bougainville for the first time since the national army and police withdrew in 1990. Mr Rabbie Namaliu, prime minister, said 15 soldiers landed at the village of Siwai on Saturday and set up a base in the area. Mr Namalie said a further 60 troops have been stationed on a nearby island. Mr Namaliu said the troops were despatched in response to requests from local chiefs and village leaders. He said the leaders feared for their safety following executions carried out earlier this year by the secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army. Mr Namaliu said the landing was designed to help restore services to the south of Bougainville, which has suffered lack of food and medical supplies since PNG imposed a blockade on the island two years ago. However, he said the PNG government is committed to seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p>

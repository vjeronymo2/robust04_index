			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> LUNCEFORD'S HELPING FOOT BOOSTS TRABUCO HILLS SOCCER  </P> <P> The leading scorer for Trabuco Hills High School girls' soccer team is a dead  ringer for Linda Lunceford, who led Esperanza to the 3-A finals last year.  </P> <P> That's because it is Lunceford.  </P> <P> Her family moved from Anaheim to Rancho Santa Margarita because her mother, a  Methodist minister, was assigned to open a church in the area.  </P> <P> It was as if Lunceford, a junior, had gone from the Space Age to the Stone Age.  Esperanza is 8-0 in Empire League play and has clinched the league title.  Trabuco Hills, which was dismal last year, is 3-3 in Pacific Coast League play  and struggling to make the playoffs.  </P> <P> Though mediocre by Esperanza's standard, Trabuco Hills' record is a definite  improvement over last season. It is due in part to first-year coach Tony  Cornfoot and Lunceford.  </P> <P> Lunceford, The Times' athlete of the week, leads the Mustangs in scoring with  29 goals in 15 games. Last Thursday, she scored four goals in a 5-0 victory  over Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> "She will always score goals because she has a natural instinct to be in the  right place at the right time," Cornfoot said.  </P> <P> Cornfoot, who coached soccer professionally in England, said Lunceford is one  of the best girls he has seen and is so powerful that she can strike a ball as  well as any boy.  </P> <P> As a coach in England, he has seen some good ones. "The English ladies won the  World Cup in Italy last year, and she could fit into the ladies' English soccer  team with no problems," Cornfoot said.  </P> <P> Making the transition from Esperanza has been difficult for Lunceford, who was  an All-Southern Section 3-A soccer team selection as a sophomore. All she has  known is success. She is an outstanding shortstop for the Ballhawks, the  third-ranked club softball team in the nation. She also plays for the Shooting  Stars, the No. 1 club soccer team in California.  </P> <P> "Mainly, I just kept telling myself we'll get better, we'll improve. I just  felt that I had to work with it," she said.  </P> <P> Things have gotten better. The first half of the season, the Mustangs lost to  Orange, 6-3. Two weeks ago, Trabuco Hills met Orange again. Orange was 4-0 in  league play. But Trabuco Hills defeated the Panthers, 2-0, on Lunceford's two  goals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Keri Erkenbrack scored 52 points and collected 18 rebounds in two Century  League victories for Canyon (17-4, 8-0) last week.  </P> <P> Tustin's Teresa Perkins scored 39 points in Sea View League overtime victories  against Estancia and University last week. She scored the winning basket  against University.  </P> <P> In a 5-0 victory over Katella, Michelle Rullo scored the hat trick, getting her  16th, 17th and 18th goals for Esperanza, the No. 2-ranked girls' soccer team in  4-A.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Linda Lunceford  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills High  </P> <P> Position: Center-forward  </P> <P> Height, Class: 5-6, Junior  </P> <P> Last Week: Scored four goals for the girls' soccer team in Trabuco Hills' 5-0  victory over Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Season: Lunceford is the leading scorer for the Mustangs with 29 goals in 15  games.  </P></p>

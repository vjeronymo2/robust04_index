			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF 2 IN CRASH WITH POLICE CAR  </P> <P> The Christmas Day tragedy in Westminster again brings up the criticism of  high-speed response of emergency vehicles. Unfortunately, because of the  legitimate legal ramifications, civil departments have to limit their  descriptions of events, so almost all we hear are very one-sided stories. This  is especially true for police departments where the popular view is to paint  them as cruel, stupid, vicious monsters.  </P> <P> In this case, the driver who was killed with her companion clearly broke the  law in not yielding to the police vehicle with its lights and siren. I am  frequently aghast at the indifference of drivers to this simple rule, and I see  people making left turns directly in front of oncoming ambulances or fire  trucks. I also see drivers chattering away and not paying full attention to  driving, or they have radios on at a very high volume.  </P> <P> The Times on Dec. 28 carried a story about the widespread availability of  assault rifles to the public. Little has been said about the nature of the  individuals involved in the uproar to which police had been called, but I  imagine any police officer wonders if he will be met by someone with such a  weapon when going to a violent dispute. I think these days it would be critical  to have help arrive quickly when a physical quarrel is in progress. It is too  bad police don't have the ability to see into the future to tell whether or not  every second counts. After something is over, the critics all come forward. Too  bad they aren't the ones involved in facing these life-threatening situations.  </P> <P> L.D. TAYLOR  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO GETS BACK ON TRACK  </P> <P> Troy Kopp pitched a two-hitter and Don Disbro hit two home runs and had six  runs batted in Wednesday to lead Mission Viejo High School to a 7-0 South Coast  League baseball victory at El Toro.  </P> <P> The victory lifted Mission Viejo (12-5 overall, 5-3 in league play) into a tie  for second place with El Toro (13-6) with seven games to play. Both teams are  one game behind Capistrano Valley (13-6, 5-3).  </P> <P> "It's nice to be in the race where we are," Mission Viejo Coach Ron Drake said.  "We lost two games last week to a pretty good ballclub (Capistrano Valley), and  it was nice to see the kids respond the way they did today."  </P> <P> El Toro starter Rob Johnson (6-2), who pitched five innings, started the game  by walking Jon Hayes. Hayes then stole second and went to third when Kopp's  one-out grounder went under third baseman Scott Sebo's glove for an error.  </P> <P> Disbro gave the Diablos a 3-0 lead with a home run over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> Disbro, who extended Mission Viejo's lead to 4-0 with a run-scoring single in  the fourth, highlighted a three-run fifth inning with a two-run homer. One out  later, Jeff Hawkins closed out the scoring with an RBI single.  </P> <P> "(Disbro) did a good job of hitting on both his home runs," said El Toro Coach  Dan DeLeon, whose team committed five errors. "He hit a mistake pitch on his  first homer and timed a fastball on his second homer. We didn't do a good job  of competing on the field and the kid (Kopp) did a good job of mixing his  pitches and changing speeds to keep us off balance."  </P> <P> Kopp (6-3), who didn't walk a batter, gave up hits in the first and second  innings. After that, the only El Toro baserunners came on Mission Viejo errors  in the fourth and fifth innings and a hit batter in the third. AL PRESTON  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Funds urge code instead of laws The government should consider implementing regulatory reform of pension schemes through codes of practice rather than legislation, the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, said yesterday. The Department of Social Security has invited comment on proposals to reform the regulatory regime for occupational pensions prepared by its Pensions Law Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode. The association said legislation could be years away, while many elements of the proposals could be in place by the autumn if a code of conduct were to prevail. Mr David Morgan, chairman of the association's parliamentary committee, said: 'In endorsing this robust new system and supporting most of the Goode recommendations, we are concerned that uncertainty over the two years until any new legislation could come into effect would make it difficult to plan with confidence.' The association conceded that codes of conduct were not legally enforceable, but 'the Inland Revenue has worked with codes of conduct for years and try breaking one of those'. The trade association said failure to comply with voluntary codes of conduct should cost schemes their tax-exemption rights. The association recognises that at least some of the elements of the Goode Committee recommendations, such as the creation of a new pensions regulator, will require primary legislation. In its response to the report, the association urged changes in the most crucial element of proposals for pension fund reform - the requirement that all schemes meet a so-called minimum solvency requirement ensuring that they could meet 90 per cent of all liabilities if they were suddenly wound up. The Goode Committee proposed that schemes be required to add assets immediately if its assets fell below that level. The association, in its paper, said that the proposal could force employers to add cash when they are least able, thus forcing them to reduce the value of guaranteed benefits offered by the scheme or to abandon defined benefit schemes in favour of defined contribution schemes. 'In a prolonged bear market, a sound but less than fully funded defined benefit scheme will be a better method of pension provision for its members than a defined contribution scheme,' the association said. Currently, calculations of solvency at wind-up are based on whether a pension scheme has sufficient assets to purchase fixed-interest annuities for all members. But as interest rates fall, annuities become far more expensive and a scheme that is solvent during a period of high interest rates may be technically insolvent at wind-up if rates fall. However, the association is also urging the government to go further than the Goode Committee recommendations on funding by requiring each scheme to set a compulsory long-term funding plan. Once agreed, the plan should be binding on the employer and disclosed to members.</p>

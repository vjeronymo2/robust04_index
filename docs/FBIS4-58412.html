			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali met with  Egyptian media representatives and delegates at the Prime  Ministry today. These media men came to Jordan in order to  report on the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian  Committee. During the meeting, the prime minister discussed  bilateral relations and the regional situation. Here are more  details:    Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali welcomed the  resumption of the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian  Committee. He said: We hope these meetings will be a  foundation stone for reinstating work among the Arab states in  the required way. He also pointed out the importance of  coordination between the two fraternal countries, particularly  in this phase.    The prime minister explained that the agenda of the meetings  includes many issues and topics, led by consolidating political  relations between the sisterly countries and discussing a number  of economic issues, such as exports, protocols, dealing with  trucks, transportation, the Arab bridge, and electric power  connection.    Dr. al-Majali said that the Arab world is now passing  through  a crucial stage, that facts and events are accelerating rapidly,  and that the Arab world is still unaware of the serious phase we  are passing through because it is still dealing, to a limited  degree, with the reasons for differences, but no genuine  attempts have been made to remove these differences and deal  with the new facts.    Al-Majali added that the real features of the new world  order  have not yet become clear, except for the fact that the United  States is the country that is currently dominating this order.  He noted that the character of the regional order that could  prevail in our region has not yet become clear. The prime  minister asserted that if the Arabs do not act before it is too  late, do not reach understanding, and do not achieve accord, a  regional order could be arranged and imposed on them. Such an  order could affect the Arabs for a long period of time.    Al-Majali asserted that there is no room for spectators in  such an order, and that we, the Arabs, should play an effective  and influential role in this order.    The prime minister reviewed the siege imposed on the port of  al-'Aqabah and the efforts that the Jordanian king and  government have made to resolve this issue, as a result of which  Jordan has sustained great financial losses that reflected  negatively on the performance of the Jordanian economy. He said  that since the meeting held between His Majesty King Husayn and  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in London last week  no ship bound for al-'Aqabah has been intercepted. He added  that the Jordanian proposal that the international company  Lloyds supervise the dealings with cargo bound for the port of  al-'Aqabah was approved. Al-Majali explained that some matters  pertaining to this issue are still being studied.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> SPRINKLER UPGRADE ORDERED  </P> <P> Three high-rise residences for low-income senior citizens that have been  exempted from city fire-sprinkler laws for nine years would lose their  exemptions, under a proposal given tentative approval Tuesday by the City  Council.  </P> <P> In voting to draft an ordinance lifting the exemptions, however, the council  directed the city staff to look to install the sprinklers without increasing  the residents' rents.  </P> <P> The council ordered the staff to investigate every possible funding source --  including the city. The proposal, which would give building operators two years  to install the sprinklers, will come back to the council for a vote within 45  days.  </P> <P> The buildings, Westminister Towers at 1112 7th St., Santa Monica Towers at 1233  6th St. and Geneva Plaza at 1441 21st St., were exempted from sprinkler  requirements in 1981 because the council believed installation of sprinklers  would cause rents to rise too high. The city's rent control law allows such  costs to be passed on to tenants.  </P> <P> Now, however, the city staff says the buildings' landlords would need a  combined total of $157,000 in outside financing to avoid raising rents. The  total costs of installing the sprinklers will be $1.2 million, according to  city staff.  </P> <P> Harrison Betts, president of Westminister and Geneva Towers, criticized the  council proposal, saying the reserve funds accumulated by the buildings in  recent years should go to sorely needed improvements, such as elevator and roof  replacement at Westminister Towers.  </P> <P> Nancy West, the city's housing program director, disagreed: "We believe it's a  life-safety issue more than a finance issue."  </P></p>

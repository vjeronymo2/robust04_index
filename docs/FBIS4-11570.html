			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 27 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Jose Maria Figueres,  the Costa Rican president-elect, rejected the possibility the  country may enter the Central American Parliament (Parlacen) as  long as differences on the issue still exist in his country. He  also questioned Parlacen's "concrete results" in the almost  three years it has been operating.    In an interview published today in the newspaper LA  REPUBLICA, Figueres, who is 37 years old and will assume control  of the government on 8 May, said Parlacen is "an issue that has  divided the country," and as long as this situation continues "I  do not think it is prudent to continue the controversy."    "We can do many things to become closer to the rest of the  Central American countries without thinking about this  parliament," said the next Costa Rican chief of state. He also  said regional unity can be achieved "by fighting for just  causes."    According to Figueres, Central American unity does not  depend  on Parlacen but, rather, on a "frank, open, friendly, and  unitarian" position of the countries in the isthmus, because "it  is easier to be heard as a region than as a sole country."    Figueres added, however, "the negative opinion many Costa  Ricans have about Parlacen could change when we see concrete  results," and he asked "what are the concrete results" of this  parliament since it started operations?    Parlacen, headquartered in Guatemala, was installed in  October 1991 with deputies from Guatemala, Honduras, and El  Salvador. Nicaragua, which has already approved its entry into  the forum, has still not elected its deputies. Costa Rica and  Panama have not even ratified the proposal to enter this  organization.</p>

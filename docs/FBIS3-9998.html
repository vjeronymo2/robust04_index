			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the other  Senate office, thinks the resolution of the Haitian crisis must  inevitably go through the formation of a temporary government  within the scope of Article 111 of the Constitution of March  1987. Sansaricq asserts that it will be necessary, sooner or  later, to end up with Article 148 or Article 149.    [Begin Sansaricq recording] "We are working on the solution  so we can establish a government that will operate under Article  111 of the Constitution." Let me explain what I mean: "We cannot  go straight to Article 148 of the Constitution" because,  (?although) there has been a resigning prime minister for two  and a half months, President Aristide has not deemed it  necessary to appoint a new prime minister.    "This is a problem. We cannot implement Article 148 because  the prime minister should be appointed by President Aristide. We  cannot implement Article 149 precisely because the parliament  restored Mr. Aristide as president of the Republic on 16 June  1993. So, this makes it impossible for us to implement Article  149."    We must nevertheless [changes thought] As the situation must  be untangled, we must have a temporary government until we can  settle on the implementation of either Article 148 or Article  149 of the Constitution.

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (4): Forward from the iron age - Archaic labour laws are gradually being amended OF all the challenges facing the new Labor government, developing industrial relations reform legislation has been one of the toughest. Last month, Mr Laurie Brereton, the industrial relations minister, finally revealed the package of measures to parliament - no small political achievement. The question is whether, in its efforts to win union support, the government has missed an opportunity to accelerate the pace of change in wage fixing. Historically, Australia's industrial relations system has relied on a network of quasi-judicial federal and state industrial commissions which have set wages for the majority of workers in centralised fashion  - paying little attention to productivity levels, regional conditions, or individual employers' ability to pay. In the event of disputes, the commissions have had the power to order compulsory arbitration, and to fine or imprison both workers and employers who fail to comply. In recent years, this system has also operated within the framework of an incomes 'accord', agreed between the federal government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, an umbrella body for the nation's various labour organisations. The first deal was struck in the early 1980s, and there have been six subsequent compacts. For the most part, the objective has been to deliver a degree of wage restraint in return for certain fiscal measures or welfare improvements. The seventh, and current, accord was unveiled earlier this year, shortly before the election. It differed slightly from its predecessors, being more of a 'social document' than a simple prices and incomes formula. But, in essence, it concentrated on two subjects: jobs and enterprise bargaining. On the former, a target for employment growth of 500,000 over a three-year period was laid down; on the latter, a commitment was given to devolved wage fixing, based on workplace bargaining. Finally, the agreement promised an arbitrated 'safety net' pay increase of Dollars 8 a week (with other flat-rate increases foreshadowed for 1994 and 1995); in the event, bargaining failed to produce a deal. None of these elements has proved easy to implement. Unemployment remains stubbornly high, with the September jobless rate standing at 10.9 per cent. Moreover, some forecasts have suggested that, even if the 500,000 jobs target is met, population growth and an increased worker participation rate would still leave the 1996 unemployment rate in double-digits. The ACTU has been critical of the new government's first budget, claiming that Mr Keating and his cohorts seem more interested in containing the nation's deficit than in job creation. At the ACTU congress in September, there were calls for a shorter working week to distribute 'leisure time', and for various fiscal initiatives to help reduce unemployment. The government, for its part, set up a task force to look into the issue, and faces increasing pressure to tackle the issue from its own back-benchers. Any substantive action, however, is unlikely before 1994. The second main plank of the seventh accord, 'enterprise bargaining', has been just as thorny, with much of the debate centring on who - on the labour side - should be permitted to strike these devolved workplace deals. ACTU members naturally preferred that existing unions be the vehicle. Mr Brereton, the industrial relations minister, is committed publicly to opening enterprise bargaining to non-unionists. Throughout the debate, the union movement faced two pressures. First, it knew that a Labor government might not be in power forever. There was, therefore, a desire to shore up defences against a potential successor - by getting the right to strike enshrined in law, for example. The ACTU also knew that its power depends on a controlling position in the labour market place, and was never likely to embrace any measures which threatened this. Union membership generally has been on the wane in Australia, although there have been some signs that the position has stabilised recently. At the end of 1992, for example, just under 40 per cent of workers belonged to a union, compared with over 50 per cent in the mid-1970s. At the end of the day, the legislation presented fudges onthe enterprise bargaining issue. Non-unionised workers will be able to strike enterprise deals through the use of flexibility clauses incorporated into centralised wage awards, but unions will be able to scrutinise such deals (although they will not have any power of veto). This, say some employers, is no reform at all: the scrutiny, and ability of unions to question deals in the arbitration forum, will deter many companies from going down this path. Greater protections for workers, however, are set out very clearly. Key measures include new national minimum standards on employment; a legal right to strike; and, if unions break laws against secondary boycotts, a 'conciliation' period of up to 72 hours before an employer can take legal action. With this debate over enterprise bargaining commanding such widespread attention, many industrial relations practices which have become de rigueur in other western-style economics barely get a look-in. Employee share ownership is relatively limited, for example, although some notable exceptions, such as the scheme at financial services group, Lend Lease, do exist. The title of a recent publication from the ACTU summed up the labour movement's ambivalent approach: it was Handle with Care. Meanwhile, 'concession bargaining' - a practice of exchanging pay or workrule entitlements for, say, equity in a business, which became increasingly common in the US during the recession - remains anathema. That said, the extent to which the labour market has already undergone changes should not be underplayed. The Australian labour movement has streamlined internally, cutting the number of unions. The number of working days lost through industrial disputes has also fallen, although the picture is scarcely pretty: the total stood a 1.015m in the year to end-June, compared with 1.57m two years previously. Finally, enterprise bargaining is finding its way into a fair number of workplaces regardless of the furore over legislation, and about 11 per cent of the workforce is reckoned to be covered by such deals at present. For many industrialists, the changes cannot come fast enough. For the labour movement, in a country which has a long history of protecting the 'working man', it is a question of ensuring that precious rights are not eroded.</p>

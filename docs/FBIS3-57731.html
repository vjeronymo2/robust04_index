			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] St. Petersburg January 27 TASS -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin is upset with his failure to persuade Boris  Fedorov and Ella Pamfilova to stay in the government,  presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday,  Kostikov warned against attempts to overdramatise the situation.    Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has repeatedly said  lately  that he will remain adherent to the course of reform, Kostikov  said. At the same time, he said Chernomyrdin's statements at the  recent agricultural conference in Oryol, Central Russia,  resembled "the distribution of unbaked bread" and caused certain  alarm. "The president is closely watching the situation in the  government and will not allow (anyone) to backtrack from reforms  while publicly pledging (one's) adherence to them," the  spokesman said.    He recalled that the new government has been working only a  few days since the reshuffle and has not taken any real steps  yet. "The president is inclined to judge by deeds, not by  words," Kostikov added. He noted that the president is  concerned about statements which can be interpreted as partial  restoration of "the administrative-command distribution and  state planning system."    "Under the new Constitution, the president has enough powers  and possibilities to direct the government and insist on the  continuation of the course chosen by Russia, the spokesman said.    Asked about Yeltsin's relations with the parliament,  Kostikov  replied that the tragic experience of the October events in  Moscow has given food for thought for both the president and the  parliament. The president was the first to draw conclusions and  meet with the heads of the parliament houses. "I think the  deputy corps which has passed the trial of democratic elections  is interested in constructive interaction with the president,"  Kostikov continued. He said number one task is to isolate  extremist forces in the parliament.    Kostikov said that the president is preparing a message to  the parliament in which he will outline the main tasks facing  the country. It will reiterate his adherence to the  continuation of the tough anti-inflationary policy and  privatisation as one of the key prerequisites for the country's  transfer to a market economy. These measures will be  accompanied by social welfare guarantees, especially for those  in need. "No one will give out unbaked bread from uncollected  wheat," the spokesman said.    "The president has no intention of interfering in the  operative work of the government and wants to see what the  corrections proposed by Viktor Chernomyrdin will give. There  may be various variants of tactics, but the president has a  clear-cut limit, that is the continuation of reform. If he sees  that a tendency towards its curtailment has emerged, he will nip  that tendency in the bud," Kostikov said.</p>

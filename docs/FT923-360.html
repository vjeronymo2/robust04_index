			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Irish leasing company in Ukraine air venture GUINNESS Peat Aviation (GPA), the Irish aircraft leasing company, and Air Ukraine, Ukraine's national carrier, yesterday announced the creation of Air Ukraine International, a joint-venture airline offering flights from Ukraine to western Europe and North America. In an effort to win back western passengers who prefer to fly to Kiev on western airlines, Air Ukraine International is to lease two new Boeing-737s from GPA for its European flights, and plans to lease a number of Boeing-767 aircraft for services to North America to be launched in summer 1993. The move is unusual for GPA, which controls less than 10 per cent of the joint venture. GPA's regular business is to lease aircraft, but the Irish company apparently realised that unless it contributed to the financing of Air Ukraine International, it would be a long time before the Ukrainians would be in a position to afford western aircraft.</p>

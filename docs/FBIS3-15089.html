There  are only Russian citizens who arrive in the republic to see  their families, INTERFAX was told by the Chief of the General  Staff of the Lithuanian Army Stasys Knezys.    The statements about the presence of some other Russian  servicemen in the republic, said Knezys, are groundless. The  general staff of the Lithuanian Army has no information about  incidents involving Russian servicemen, he said.    The statement was a response to the recent claim by the  former commander of the coastal guard division, stationed in the  Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, Major General Ivan Chernykh, that  staying in Klaipeda are approximately 150 Russian officers  "whose future has not been decided by the Russian Defence  Ministry." He said that Lithuanian law enforcement bodies  attempted last week to arrest one of the officers, Colonel  Vitaliy Yegorov, who had been warned in advance and escaped the  arrest.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING VIGILANT  </P> <P> The International Travel Section (March 5) had very helpful tips for persons  traveling overseas, where I am always very cautious about protecting my purse  and luggage. However, last November I had something new pulled on me. On a  crowded bus in London a scruffy person sat down beside me with a raincoat over  his arm. I did not like his looks, so I held very tightly to my purse by the  top and straps.  </P> <P> This person slashed the side of my purse with a razor and extracted an envelope  containing money. He was so professional, I was not aware of it and didn't even  feel him touch my purse. Fortunately, this was my last day in London and he  secured only 3 (about $5.25 U.S.). I was lucky I did not see him slash my  purse, because he might have used his razor on me. But since I always keep  money in several compartments of my purse, only a portion can be stolen if one  part is lifted.  </P> <P> MILDRED JACKSON  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

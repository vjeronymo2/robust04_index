			<p>BFN     [Text] On 16 June, employees of the U.S. Embassy in  Port-au-Prince began leaving Haiti for the United States. A  preliminary group of seven people departed on a commercial  American Airlines flight. Ambassador Swing took leave of this  group at the airport in the presence of American journalists  currently in Port-au-Prince.    It should be noted that about 70 members of the families of  the U.S. diplomatic staff accredited in Haiti, including the  spouse of Ambassador Swing, are due to leave Haiti before the  suspension of commercial flights between Haiti and the United  States on 25 June, and according to information provided by AFP,  75 diplomats, including Ambassador Swing, will remain in  Port-au- Prince.    It should also be pointed out that U.S. citizens residing in  Haiti have begun to leave the country under their government's  recommendation.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Around the horns in 15 minutes: David Lascelles (and 63 others) give Wagner a dashing work-out There was a box with a chain saw at one side of the rehearsal room, which was rather disconcerting. But perhaps the prospect of listening to an orchestra consisting entirely of French horns playing a Wagner medley might not be to everyone's taste. It did not, however, daunt the 64 members of the British Horn Society who turned up at the Barbican Centre in the City of London on Easter Saturday to prepare for a rare performance of Fantasia on Themes from the Ring of the Nibelungen, by Vitali Bujanovski. As a thoroughly indifferent horn player, I was one of the more apprehensive, but I had been assured that my modest grade six attainment was sufficient. I also had the attendant support of my wife, another relative novice. Bujanovski, who died only last year, was for many years principal horn of the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra and, like many lovers of the French horn, he was unable to resist the call of The Ring. Wagner himself is reputed to have told his wife that he 'wished he could write for nothing but horns.' Bujanovski took up the challenge and reduced the entire Ring cycle to its bare essentials: brass. He scored his piece for 32 individual horn parts in eight separate groups. But the orchestration is so clever that it can be played by any number of horns in multiples of eight. This extraordinary work lasts only 15 minutes but it packs in all the juiciest thematic highlights: the Rhine, Siegfried's heroics, the majesty of Valhalla, Wotan's fury, etc. It is the sort of thing everyone should hear - just once. When we arrived at the Barbican, we were invited to leaf through sample parts to find the one that suited us best. My wife and I ended up with part 30 which was low, had lots of rests and only one exposed bit, where we introduced the 'Siegfried Assertive' motif. Since no one has yet actually got round to publishing the Fantasia, we all had to make do with hand-written, photo-copied parts. Our co-players were a varied bunch of all shapes, sizes and ages, most of them amateur enthusiasts. Many were silver-haired; others were well below the age of puberty but possessing talent which left you wondering: Why bother? More interesting, in a way, were the horns themselves. Few instruments are quite as exhibitionistic, with their shiny twirls and complicated valve mechanics. Three owners of Vienna horns had come down specially from Scotland: their horns had an extra loop near the mouthpiece which invited eager comment and comparison. Purveyors of horns, music for the horn, and all the bits and pieces that horn players need had laid on a little exhibition in the hallway. With much fingering, tootling and chattering, we made our way round the stands. One of the problems with the horn is the shortage of good music, and this was a chance to extend our repertoire (although we have yet to find out whether our purchase of a Schubert mass arranged for horn duet was a good buy). The day's schedule involved only a brief rehearsal directly before the actual performance. We were lucky to have as our conductor Sian Edwards, the music director of the English National Opera; lucky, because she is a horn player herself. All musicians think their instrument is the most difficult of all to play, but French horn players know it happens to be true in their case. The instrument is a rebellious creature: it disobeys even the sternest commands. But Edwards, her shock of red hair ablaze, knew how to coax the best from our unruly efforts. The ragged early sounds, the disconcerting wrong notes, the false entries - all were ironed out steadily as we grew familiar with the piece, and each other. An hour later, we trooped on to the stage of the Barbican concert hall, a venue where I had never in my wildest dreams imagined I would find myself. The lights shone down with blinding brightness and I could barely see the audience, although one reason might have been that it was not exactly large. Edwards raised her hands, caught our eyes and off we went. First, she drew out the sonorous opening bars of the Rhinegold, then increased the pace as we joined Siegfried in his adventures. The tension rose as we clashed with the mounting forces of evil: great eruptions of noise as we slew the dragon and charged on to defy the very gods themselves. Next, a change of pace as we thrilled to the joys of eternal youth, rode down the mighty Rhine, and galloped to the sound of Siegfried's horn. The climax came with two dozen horns trilling and the rest providing a huge body of supporting sound, with an urgent, punctuating beat from deep below. Then, with a final thunderous blast, it was all over. That, at least, was how it seemed from the back row. Whether the audience felt the same, I do not know. There was plenty of applause, and Edwards came back for a second bow, waving generously at our happy faces. And so we dispersed. I only hope we left Wagner beaming, not spinning in his grave.</p>

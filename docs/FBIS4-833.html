			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary signed by "The Editor": "Stop Throwing Cash at </F> Them"]    [Text] The bellicosity of the Inkatha Freedom Party grows  daily more reckless, and the actions of its youth wing approach  treasonable insurrection. The challenge can no longer be  ignored.    The youth brigade, egged on by more adult leaders, plans to  march tomorrow on Shell House, headquarters of the African  National Congress, in the heart of Johannesburg. Its leaders  say they will defy a police ban to do so.    They also plan a week of rolling mass action to bring the  country, or at least its leading metropolis, to a halt. Their  attitude is defiant and confrontational, and their aim is to  stop or disrupt the country's first free elections. They are  willing to risk bloodshed and to precipitate civil war to do so.    They cannot be allowed to succeed. The birth of South  African democracy cannot be made hostage to violence. Inkatha  has ceased to be a mere political problem; it has become a  problem of basic law and order.    The police are deploying massive resources to stop the march  on Shell House. That is proper, but it is important for the  future to combine firmness with restraint. It is especially  important to prevent wild shooting or mass killings such as  occurred in Johannesburg a fortnight ago. The march must not  give martyrs to the future.    At the same time, it is not sufficient simply to break up  concentrations of marchers or demonstrators with tear gas, and  allow them to reassemble elsewhere, or to make the notorious  hostels a base for future raids and sallies. It is necessary  for the police to disarm as many people as they can, and to  arrest those who break the law.    But police action alone will not end this incipient  insurrection. The power of the Inkatha Freedom Party to sow  mayhem in the Transvaal derives in very large part from the  immense flow of public money -- more than R4-billion [rand] a  year -- from the government to the Zulu bantustan.    That flow of money should have been cut off months ago. The  tasks of paying pensions and salaries, and especially of  controlling the kwaZulu Police, should have been taken over by  the central government months ago.    Our progress towards democracy, not to speak of our lives  and  property, is now threatened because President de Klerk tried as  long as he could to preserve Chief Buthelezi as a future  political ally against the ANC. That endeavour has proved vain.    Even that expedient reason for keeping Chief Buthelezi  afloat  has fallen away.    In about a fortnight's time the new government will begin to  take control of kwaZulu from Ulundi. There is no need to wait.    President de Klerk owes it to the nation, and to its hopes  of  free and democratic elections, to cut off all state support for  Chief Buthelezi's regime: money, personnel and facilities, and  access to credit. He owes it to the nation to do so immediately.    Only when Chief Buthelezi's reign of terror in Ulundi is  brought to an end will we know how many Zulu people truly  support him. Only when his administration is allowed to  collapse will the Zulu people be able to join the rest of South  Africa in their march to freedom.    Until then we shall depend on an over-worked police force,  and an army spread thin, to hold the line against the mayhem  which, clearly, it is Inkatha's intention to sow. Until then,  we shall depend on the fortitude of the people of Johannesburg  to keep this economy ticking over, and this country functioning.    All these people have a right to expect President de Klerk  to  stop fiddling while Rome burns.</p>

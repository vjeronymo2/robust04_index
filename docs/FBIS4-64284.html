			<p>BFN     [Text] Following a meeting with Forza Italia leader Silvio  Berlusconi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini,  Northern League leader Umberto Bossi was asked if he would  reiterate his demands for the Interior Ministry. Bossi  answered: "Of course, even if we are going to discuss this next  week. Today we discussed programs."    He said that agreement has been reached over the program,  and  that problems might arise when we get round to filling the  ministerial posts.    Bossi left the meeting certain that Berlusconi and Fini have  accepted his proposals concerning federalism.</p>

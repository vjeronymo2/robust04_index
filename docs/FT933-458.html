			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Estate agent's details on trial THE FIRST estate agent to be prosecuted under the new Property Misdescriptions Act - aimed at eliminating misleading and exaggerated wording from house details - is to appear in court next week. Mr Ian Sinclair, a chartered surveyor who runs an estate agency in Great Yarmouth, is to appear before the town's magistrates' court on Monday to face two alleged offences under this year's Act. Norfolk Trading Standards, part of the county council, is bringing the case. Mr Steve Holland, deputy county trading standards officer, said the first alleged offence was that Mr Sinclair had advertised the price of a house in a local newspaper as being less than the house actually cost. The second was that Mr Sinclair had failed to alter the price of a property advertised in his shop window to reflect the real price of the house. Mr David Goldsworthy, president of the Warwick-based National Association of Estate Agents, said that the legislation was a 'sledgehammer to crack a nut'. Mr Goldsworthy said: 'It will all boil to down to whether it was a genuine mistake or deliberately misleading.' The Department of Trade and Industry said the Norfolk case was the first they had heard of since the law was enacted earlier this year. It pointed out that more cases might be pending on court waiting lists.</p>

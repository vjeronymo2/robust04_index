			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIONNE CUT; RANGERS TRY TO FIND TEAM FOR HIM  </P> <P> The New York Rangers cut their ties Tuesday with center Marcel Dionne, the  National Hockey League's third all-time leading scorer, and said they were  trying to find a place for him elsewhere in the league.  </P> <P> "It was mutually agreed upon by the Rangers' coaching staff and myself that  Marcel Dionne, judging by the just completed training camp, will not be a  member of the New York Rangers' hockey team this season," Ranger General  Manager Neil Smith said in a statement. "At Marcel's request, we will continue  to explore the possibility of his joining another team."  </P> <P> The Rangers were vague about the disposition of Dionne's contract, which calls  for him to make about $600,000 this season, his last one with New York.  </P> <P> "If there's no interest from other clubs, there is a mechanism in Marcel's  contract that has been mutually agreed upon," said Smith, who would not specify  the mechanism.  </P></p>

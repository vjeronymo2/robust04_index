			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: LVMH/Guinness It did not take the equity market long to figure out that the restructuring of LVMH's relationship with Guinness might be a better deal for the French company than first appeared. It has allowed LVMH to focus more closely on its luxury goods and perfumes business, which has so far enjoyed a stronger recovery than champagnes and spirits. The result is a 22 per cent rise in turnover in the first five months and an official forecast of a 30 per cent rise in first-half earnings. Cognac sales suffered a striking slowdown during the last couple of months while champagne turnover is up only 10 per cent so far this year. On the basis of such figures it is not surprising that LVMH shares have out-performed Guinness by some 20 per cent since the restructuring was announced. Yet, it would be wrong to conclude that Guinness had fumbled the affair. The deal should still turn out to both companies' advantage. The difference is one of timing. Given Mr Bernard Arnault's broad ranging ambitions for LVMH, it made sense for Guinness to home in on the drinks side. Moreover, it added to its interest in Moet Hennessy at the bottom of the cycle. Economic recovery and a lower price of grapes should eventually put some fizz back into champagne sales, while the rising Tokyo stock market may tempt Japan's salarymen to splash out on expensive drinks again. The trouble, as before with Guinness, is that recovery is painfully slow. It does not help that no replacement has yet been found for Mr Crispin Davis, who resigned as head of its spirits business last October.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Selling off the family chateau PARIS antique dealer Bernard Steinitz, purveyor of the very best in 18th-century French furniture, has been forced to sell off his country home, a Loire chateau no less, plus its entire contents, at considerable speed. Steinitz, who at the end of June opens new five-storey premises on Grafton Street in London and a new office in New York, says he had to sell the chateau to raise cash for yet another venture, a large auction house complex he plans to build in the Paris suburb of Saint Ouen. Steinitz, who caused a stir in the Paris art world this month by resigning from the powerful group of antique dealers known as 'Les Antiquaires a Paris', bought the 18-room Chateau Saint Paul de Cornillon 20 years ago complete with its furnishing. Perched on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Loire, the castle was built in the 13th century and restored in the 17th and 18th centuries. Steinitz has put the property in the hands of estate agents and asked Jacques Tajan of the Paris auction firm Ader Tajan to sell the contents. The sale will be held in the castle during the last week of May. About 1,000 items will go under the hammer, a third of them top-quality furniture which Steinitz has acquired over the years. Experts are still on the spot inspecting the lots and a catalogue will not be ready until ten days before the auction, but Tajan gave an early and extremely cautious estimate of around Ffr20m for the whole lot. Most of the furniture is 17th and 18th century. Outstanding items include 12 Louis XIV chairs in extremely fine condition, Henry IV chairs with original embroidered covers, Savonnerie carpets, 17th-century Cordoba leather wall hangings, period wood panelling of which Steinitz has the largest collection in the world, and a number of very fine French and Flemish cabinets. For the past two years Steinitz has worked from a sumptuously-furnished 'hotel particulier' on the Faubourg Saint Honore. The site he plans to develop is some five acres of workshops and warehouses he bought from the firm Wonder in 1986 at Saint Ouen, to stock and restore furniture. At the time Wonder was in the hands of multi-millionaire businessman Bernard Tapie, last month appointed minister of the Town by president Mitterrand, and Steinitz has been quick to scotch rumours that the new member of the socialist government has played any role at all in his venture. At the end of last year Steinitz finally obtained planning permission to build a large auction house, along with restoration workshops and office facilities for a transport company, plus a bank and a hotel. The whole scheme will employ a total of 1,000 people and the local council is supplying new roads. Steinitz says he aims to benefit from the new relaxed French legislation on auctioning to create an art market centre of European dimensions.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: SKr5bn state aid helps prop up Gota Bank THE SWEDISH government is to provide a further SKr5bn (Dollars 620m) guarantee for Gota Bank to prevent it from falling below minimum capital adequacy requirements under the weight of heavy loan losses. The commitment comes on top of a SKr10bn guarantee which Gota received at the start of this year after coming under state control at the end of 1992. It is being made because it has taken longer than originally expected to return the bank to the private sector and because a change in accounting treatment inflated its first-half credit losses to SKr7bn. The bank is expected to be sold during the autumn. The announcement is a stark reminder that Sweden's banking crisis is far from over after euphoria at other banks' results and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken's move to withdraw a state aid request. Gota announced a SKr560m operating loss for the first half, after being dragged into the red by a SKr1.4bn deficit from problem credits housed in Gota Bank Specialengagemang. It has already used SKr13bn of its SKr15bn total government guarantee to cover losses.</p>

Hata will meet president and Communist Party General  Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning home later in  the day, the officials said.    The China visit will be the first by Hata since he became  foreign minister and concurrently deputy prime minister in the  coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last  August.    Hata and Qian met three times last year.    North Korea's refusal of international inspections of its  suspected nuclear facilities may be high on the agenda for talks  between Hata and Qian, government sources said.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Technology: Assault on food bacteria The US Department of Agriculture has approved the use of a common food compound, trisodium phosphate, in poultry processing to reduce salmonella contamination. Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemical group whose US subsidiary discovered the antibacterial activity of trisodium phosphate, calls it 'a major breakthrough for public health'. Following yesterday's USDA approval, the company is working urgently with the EC authorities to amend food hygiene regulations so that the process can be introduced in Europe, where more than 1m people suffer from salmonella-based stomach upsets every year - many caused by eating poultry. The treatment, which Rhone-Poulenc calls AvGard, simply involves drenching each bird in trisodium phosphate solution at the end of the slaughtering process. Bill Swartz of Rhone-Poulenc says the total cost amounts to less than one cent per bird. Irradiation - an alternative method of killing bacteria - costs 5c to 20c per bird and is opposed by some consumer groups. USDA tests showed that trisodium phosphate reduced the incidence of salmonella and other bacteria (including E Coli) more than 100-fold in treated birds. Rhone-Poulenc scientists do not yet know how it gets rid of bacteria so effectively, Swartz says, though 'it may break the bond between the salmonella and the surface of the chicken'. Trisodium phosphate is used widely as a food ingredient, particularly for emulsifying processed cheese. The AvGard process leaves only 'tiny traces' of the chemical on the bird; it has no effect on the taste, texture or colour of the treated chicken, according to tests by independent laboratories. AvGard illustrates Rhone-Poulenc's approach to its food ingredients business, Swartz says. 'It is going to be very difficult to get new ingredients approved so we need to develop new uses for existing ones.'</p>

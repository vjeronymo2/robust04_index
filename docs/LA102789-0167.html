			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'CAMELOT' SQUEEZES WELL INTO A LITTLE THEATER  </P> <P> The proper expectations are the key to enjoying the Huntington Beach  Playhouse's "Camelot."  </P> <P> Like many of its counterparts throughout Orange County, the playhouse is a  little theater with a small budget. Anyone who goes to the production expecting  visual grandeur -- the type of lavish, magical staging usually associated with  Lerner and Loewe's recasting of the King Arthur legend -- are apt to be  disappointed.  </P> <P> Director Marla Gam-Hudson takes something of a minimalist approach to the 1960  musical, with varying results. The sets by Randimar Productions are very  simple, and Laurel Koelsch's and Terri Miller-Schmidt's costumes range from  professional to homemade (Lancelot's "armor" amounts to gray spandex tights and  what looks like molded cardboard painted silver). The overall appearance is  frugal utilitarian.  </P> <P> But if you can accept the economical aura, there are moments to enjoy. For  sure, the production does have its clumsy patches, but the principals (Mike  Moon as Arthur and Robin Follman as Guinevere) are both able. Follman is  especially strong -- this veteran of Opera Pacific and the Master Chorale of  Orange County has a rich voice and an often vivid acting style.  </P> <P> Her Guinevere is a naive but juicy young thing when she arrives, already  promised as Arthur's bride. She's a girl with womanly feelings, often  impulsive, even wanton, that signal the passionate trouble she later gets into  when the chaste Lancelot (Mike Thompson) arrives. Follman does equally well on  the frothy "The Lusty Month of May" and the deeper "I Loved You Once in  Silence."  </P> <P> There's no way for Moon to match Follman's singing skills, but he does have one  of those pleasant, music-hall voices that never lacks personality. His acting  is also ripe with the stuff. His Arthur fails at being a romantic, regal figure  -- Moon goes for the overgrown boy in the man almost every time -- but his king  is likable.  </P> <P> Gam-Hudson tries to compensate for the production's minor-key looks by bringing  a courtly touch to a few crucial scenes. This amounts to having the large cast  parade through the aisles and, in effect, use the entire theater as a stage.  Unfortunately, while it does impart a sense of expanse to the proceedings, it  makes everything too busy.  </P> <P> The show is faithful to the musical's original intent on most scores, but  Gam-Hudson does play around with the sorceress Morgan Le Fey. Here, Terri  Miller-Schmidt turns her into a kicky vision of witchful kinkiness, emerging  from the woods in black leather and chains, and brandishing a nasty little  whip.  </P> <P> 'CAMELOT'  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach Playhouse production of Lerner and Loewe's musical.

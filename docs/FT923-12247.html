			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Arts: Almeida Festival - Opera Besides the two more spectacular pieces already reviewed here, the Almeida Opera Festival mounted a pair of smaller operas on Friday. They had nothing in common but their admirable pianist, Helen Crayford. One was a commission from the American composer Nils Vigeland; the other, a bright little farce which seems to have been so thoroughly ignored after Ernst Krenek wrote it in 1945 that it was copyrighted only in 1960. Vigeland's False Love/True Love is a two-hander on a pair of scenes from Jane Eyre; first, Jane rejecting Rochester after their aborted wedding, and then her later return, when - reassured by his having become blind and crippled - she decides to marry him after all. Susan Bisatt made a sensitive, lyrical Jane; Meurig Davies's ponytail and designer stubble looked right for Rochester, but his pitched tone was so dry and shallow that most of the role emerged in Sprechstimme. As for the music .. Well: if the programme-book had announced False Love/True Love as an experiment in adapting an 1885 piano trio by a minor French composer (somebody from the Chausson-Faure ACT'e' circuit) for setting Charlotte Bronte's , we should all have believed it without question. The trio tinkled and warbled away, bland and mild, and the vocal parts followed meekly.                          *      *      * It all had the pastel passion of a period chocolate-box lid. Presumably Vigeland really did write it himself - but one couldn't guess why. Caroline Gawn's production, like Brad Cohen's conducting, was ultra-discreet. On paper Krenek's own comic text for What Price Confidence, about would-be marital infidelities, and his brittle piano-score (serial, I think, though lightened by friendly added-note chords), might seem to recall Schoenberg's dire Von Heute auf Morgen. The recurrent theme of 'having confidence' here operates rather like the recurrent sneer at 'moderne Menschen' in Frau Schoenberg's libretto. But Miss Gawn's crisp, witty direction - making resourceful use of the basic set for thebigger Almeida operas - and Miss Crayford's impeccably sprightly piano lifted that curse altogether. With a first-rate quartet of husbands and wives doing their best to err (Angela Tunstall, Rachael Hallawell, Geoffrey Dolton and Kevin West), the piece was delightful beyond expectation. Neatly paced, not a minute too long, Krenek's music points and underlines the comic exchanges wryly and deftly. How sad that a staging so expertly prepared should get just a single performance] The Bronte confection was awarded a second showing on Sunday, but it should have been What Price Confidence.</p>

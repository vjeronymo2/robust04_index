			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Dale Electric blames deficit on provisions Dale Electric International, the maker of power systems, tumbled from pre-tax profits of Pounds 544,000 to losses of Pounds 933,000 in the half year to October 31. Mr Iain Dale, chairman, said that the warning issued in October estimating a Pounds 700,000 first half loss was an 'impressionistic forecast' of the deterioration in trading conditions. He said that the loss related to provisions against contracts. Although the aviation sector remained depressed, he said the group was already benefiting from increased worldwide investment in airport infrastructure. Measures to achieve annualised cost savings of Pounds 1.1m had been implemented. Mr Dale added that the order book at January 31 was ahead 62 per cent at Pounds 26m (Pounds 16m). Turnover from continuing activities fell to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 26.7m). Losses per share were 6.74p (3.02p earnings). The interim dividend is halved to 1p.</p>

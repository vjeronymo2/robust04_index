			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Alternative to Tecs Sir, Peter Ashby's letter (April 29) draws attention to the unsatisfactory arrangements for training and enterprise councils. These were yet another set of the quangos in which British governments delight, since they provide high cosmetic value at low cost. The fact that they are usually ineffective doesn't matter, since this is easy to hide. Tecs should not be given public law status, but rather be merged with chambers of industry and commerce, which should. The government should then have a serious discussion with the chambers about standards. Finally, the British Overseas Trade Board could then be closed down and all its resources given to the chambers. We could have got all this right first time if Conservative ministers really had any idea about helping a market economy to work, but better late than never.

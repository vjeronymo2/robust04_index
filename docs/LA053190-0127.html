			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: GREEK WEEKEND  </P> <P> "We've been working once a week for two, two and a half months. We'd start at 9  in the morning and work for about six hours."  </P> <P> Pam Gonzalez and 19 other women have been preparing an enormous number of  pastries for the 8,000 attendees expected at this year's Greek Festival '90 in  Camarillo.  </P> <P> Hosted by the St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church, Friday through Sunday, the  festival is a time for feasting and fun. Continuous music, folk dance  exhibitions and lessons will be featured, as well as Greek food. And a trip for  two to Greece will be given away as a prize.  </P> <P> The Hellenic Sounds of Los Angeles and accordionist Polka Bill will provide the  music. Food booths will offer ethnic delicacies. The pastries -- 30,000 of them  -- were prepared ahead of time.  </P> <P> "It's not something you throw together the week before," said Gonzalez.  </P> <P> Baklava is a favorite. But the most popular is galataboureko, a custard-filled  caloric wonder, bathed in a lemony syrup.  </P> <P> "We increased production by 400% over last year to meet the demand."  </P> <P> St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church is at 400 Skyway Drive, Camarillo. Festival  hours: 5 to 10 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, and noon to 7 p.m.  Sunday. Admission is free. For information, call 482-1273.  </P></p>

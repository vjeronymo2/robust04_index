			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / BP's talks on Azeri fields suspended: Power vacuum in Baku halts progress on western oil projects BRITISH Petroleum said yesterday that talks over a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) development project for three oilfields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea had been suspended following political upheaval in the republic. But the company is optimistic that negotiations will resume in a matter of weeks. A BP official said that a team of negotiators from Socar, the Azerbaijan energy company, had been recalled to the capital, Baku, after spending last week in London. 'They can't feel comfortable negotiating these sort of things when the government is being changed. It doesn't surprise us a bit,' he said. But the government upheaval could lead to changes in officials in charge of running Socar which could further delay talks, industry observers said. Before he was forced to flee Baku, Azerbaijan's president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, had been due in London on Friday to sign a preliminary contract for the development of the three oilfields. 'We still had many months of negotiations to go before coming to the final contract,' said Mr Steven Bertram, financial director of Ramco Energy, which is also involved in the project. A group of eight western oil companies is involved in negotiations with the Azeri government over the oilfields which are believed to contain 4bn barrels of oil. They had paid Dollars 70m in preliminary payments which BP said yesterday was being held in an escrow account. The companies had been talking separately over the development of each individual oilfield, but at the beginning of June the Azeris said they wanted the fields to be linked in one development. Mr Bertram said: 'There are indications the new government may prefer to reopen negotiations for individual fields.' Ramco's share price dropped by 36p yesterday to 120p on news of the disruption to the oil talks. But Mr Bertram said it is still four times the price it was last October when the group first announced its involvement in Azerbaijan. Mr Thane Gustafson, an observer of the Russian energy scene at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, sounded a note of caution over the oil talks, saying that any government of Azerbaijan will be unstable until the war with Armenia over Nagorno Karabkh is resolved. 'I think it will take more than a couple of weeks to get back to the negotiating table,' he said.</p>

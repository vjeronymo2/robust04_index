			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Mulroney stalwart to quit politics ONE OF the stalwarts of Canada's outgoing Mulroney government, trade minister Michael Wilson, will leave politics after the general election later this year. Mr Wilson, 55, was finance minister for seven years, and then led Canada's participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement. He is one of several senior ministers who are stepping aside to allow Ms Kim Campbell, the prime minister-elect, to put her own stamp on the Conservative government ahead of the election. She will unveil her cabinet when she is sworn in on June 25. Her immediate challenge is to maintain unity within the party's Quebec caucus which was strained during the recent leadership race. Ms Campbell won the backing of several senior Quebec nationalists. But her main rival for the leadership, Mr Jean Charest, is a staunch federalist. He is expected to be offered the post of either deputy premier or Ms Campbell's chief Quebec lieutenant. Others in the Mulroney inner circle stepping down are Mr Donald Mazankowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister, Ms Barbara McDougall, external affairs minister, and Mr Joe Clark, constitutional affairs minister.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A novel tax problem from Japan MY WIFE gets income from Japan for a novel that has been translated into Japanese. She has had an advance on royalties, which are received by the UK publisher and distributed twice yearly. Her UK publisher has advised that the advance is 'subject to a 10 per cent Japanese withholding tax.' Can this be reclaimed from the Japanese tax authorities? If so, how should she go about it? No; the deduction of 10 per cent Japanese tax is authorised by article 13 of the Japan-UK double taxation convention*. On the other hand, your wife is entitled to credit for the Japanese tax against her UK income tax liability, by virtue of article 24(1)(a) of the convention. She should ask her tax office for the pamphlet on double taxation relief, IR6. If your wife has no UK income tax liability on the Japanese royalties (if they are covered by loss relief, for example), she can treat them as being reduced by the amount of Japanese tax - if that is to her ultimate advantage  -under section 811(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. *In a local reference library, you should find a copy of the double taxation convention with Japan in, for example, volume F of Simon's Taxes, British International Tax Agreements, volume 6 of the British Tax Encyclopedia, or Butterworths Tax Treaties. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

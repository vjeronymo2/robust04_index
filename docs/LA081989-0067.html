			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT LETS AMISH REJECT BUGGY EMBLEMS  </P> <P> The Minnesota Supreme Court on Friday dismissed traffic citations against 14  Amish who had refused to display safety emblems on their horse-drawn buggies as  required by state law.  </P> <P> Members of Minnesota's Amish community have a constitutional right to refuse to  affix the orange-red slow-moving-vehicle emblems to their buggies, the court  ruled unanimously.  </P> <P> "These appellants . . . are unwilling to compromise their belief that the  'loud' colors required and the 'worldly symbols' the triangular shape  represents to them conflict with the admonitions found in Apostle Paul's  epistles," Associate Justice Glenn Kelley wrote. "To them, to do so would be  putting their faith in 'worldly symbols' rather than in God."  </P> <P> Between February and September of last year each of the defendants received a  traffic citation for operating a horse-drawn buggy on a public highway without  displaying the emblem or an alternative black triangular emblem that the law  permits in cases such as theirs.  </P> <P> In December, Fillmore County District Judge Clement H. Snyder rejected the  Amish contention that the requirement violated their constitutional right to  freely exercise their religious beliefs, but he asked that a higher state court  review the matter.  </P> <P> Because some members of the Amish community do not object to complying with the  law, Snyder held that the Amish did not have a collective, genuine, sincere  religious belief on the issue.  </P> <P> He ruled also that, although application of the statute did infringe on the  exercise of the religious belief of some of the Amish, the infringement was  warranted by a compelling state interest -- protecting the health, safety and  welfare of all travelers on public highways.  </P> <P> In the decision released Friday, the Supreme Court agreed with the Amish  defendants that the trial court had improperly determined that, to be sincere,  a belief must be shared by a religious community as a whole.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court held also that the state has a legitimate interest in  protecting the public, including the Amish, on its highways. But it ruled that  even the option under the law for use of a black triangular sign was burdensome  to the Amish religious beliefs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan maintained its  position as the world's top creditor nation for the third  straight year in 1993, with its net overseas assets rising 18.9  percent to a record 610.8 billion dollars, a government report  released Friday [27 May] said.    The report, presented by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to  the cabinet, appears certain to add fuel to calls from other  Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations for action to trim  Japan's trade surpluses ahead of the G-7 summit scheduled for  July in Naples.    The latest reporting year was the 12th straight year in  which  Japan's net overseas assets -- overseas assets minus foreign  liabilities -- increased from the year-earlier level.    Gross overseas assets rose 7.2 percent to 2,180.8 billion  dollars, of which more than 80 percent were held in the private  sector in the form of overseas lending, factory, stock and  property.    The growth in gross assets was fanned by a whopping 6.2  percent jump in assets held in stocks and bonds which Japanese  investors purchased for long-term investment or a holding period  of more than one year.    Private direct foreign investment or purchases of real  estate  and construction of factories climbed 4.7 percent to 259.7  billion dollars, reflecting an unabated trend among Japanese  firms to shift production abroad.    In the public sector, foreign lending, such as Official  Development Assistance (ODA), increased 17.4 percent to 103.6  billion dollars.    By maturity, long-term assets rose 7.4 percent to 1,412.9  billion dollars, while short-term assets grew 6.7 percent to  767.9 billion dollars.    Total liabilities edged up 3.2 percent to 1.57 trillion  dollars for the first increase in two years as foreign investors  boosted purchases of Japanese securities and Japanese firms  increased loans in foreign currencies.    According to the latest data available, Germany and Britain  are the only other net creditor nations among the G-7 nations.  Canada, France, Italy and the United States are all debtor  nations.    Germany had net foreign assets of 257.6 billion dollars at  the end of June 1993, while Britain's net foreign assets totaled  521.3 billion dollars at the end of 1992.</p>

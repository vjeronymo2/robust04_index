			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Midwest farmers turn their attention to frost ALTHOUGH the Mississippi River has already blighted critical crop-growing areas of the American Midwest, farmers and commodity traders are now gauging the probabilities of an early frost. Delayed plantings, sodden fields, and unusually cool weather have put maize and soyabean development far behind schedule in the western corn belt, which includes Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and Missouri. In a year that could see farmers in Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana harvest record yields while their counterparts to the west watch their crops yellow from too much rain, crop analysts have found it difficult to put an accurate estimate on the overall US maize or soyabean production. Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade have been riding the weather rally like a steer at a rodeo. The soyabean futures price for November delivery, after taking a breather last week, rallied by 18 1/2 cents on Monday and in early trading yesterday remained above Dollars 7 a bushel. The figure was in spite of some analysts' assessments that prices were overdue for a downside correction. The US Department of Agriculture, in a weekly crop report released late on Monday, said that only half of Iowa's soyabean area was blooming as of August 1, compared with the 90 per cent normally expected at that time of year. Crop development in Minnesota was similarly behind, although warm, sunny weather had accelerated development in Illinois and pushed Ohio soyabeans ahead of schedule. Only a quarter of Iowa's maize crop had tasseled by late last week, behind the usual level of 85 per cent, while maize crops in Minnesota and Missouri were also critically underdeveloped. Farmers have turned from watching their rain gauges to pondering temperature forecasts. Mr Terry Francl, senior economist with the American Farm Bureau, estimated that average maize maturity dates were anywhere from one to five weeks behind. The delay was likely to have two major detrimental effects. First, he said, maize would pollinate later in the season, during the hotter, more stressful weeks of August. Second, he warned that maize maturity dates were being pushed to or beyond normal frost dates. Soyabeans were also late developing and were vulnerable to frost. The farm bureau has reduced its soyabean production forecast for the entire US to 1.812m bushels, well below the USDA's July 12 estimate of 1.975m. The bureau's maize production figure is now at 7.247m bushels, compared with USDA's 7.850m. 'That is only an estimate,' said farm bureau spokesman Mr Jack King. 'We are already hearing another 50,000 acres of prime crop land has been destroyed by levee (embankment) breaks south of St Louis. The water is receding, but many of the levees have been weakened, and are giving way.'</p>

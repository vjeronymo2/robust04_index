			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / People: Alexander squares the circle Stephen Alexander - who revolutionised tea drinking habits through introducing the round tea bag - has been appointed managing director of Lyons, the company's manufacturing sector, at the youthful age of 36. Alexander modestly denies having invented the round tea bag. He says he was 'the guy lucky enough to have approved' the invention of the round, as opposed to square, tea bag, one of Allied-Lyons' most successful ventures of recent years. 'Ian Prutton, the deputy marketing director and Bob Hodges, his managing director, at Lyons Tetley take the honour of inventing it,' says Alexander. The round tea bag was launched by Tetley in the south of the UK in mid-1989 and has been 'a tremendous success', he says. According to Alexander, 'the tea market is a very conservative market place, where normally one was used to looking at market share movements of decimal points. Tetley round tea bags put on a full five points of market share, and the Tetley and the Quick Brew tea brands are now in effect only available in round form'. Alexander, a Cambridge University law graduate, joined Allied-Lyons in late 1982, starting out by running the export side of Lyons' tea business. He went on to run Lyons' ice-cream business and went on to the board of Lyons in March 1988. He is appointed to the new position from November 2 and will take over responsibility for the food sector when David Beatty, Lyons' deputy chairman, retires at the end of February.</p>

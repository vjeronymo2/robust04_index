			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Zemribo: The Order of the </F> North-Western Army Group Means Violation of Latvia's  Sovereignty"]    [Text] Riga, 18 January -- The Chairman of the Latvian  High Court Gvido Zemribo termed the North-Western Army Group  commander's order, issued on 14 January, granting Russian  military persons the right to use weapons in a conflict  situation an evident violation of the sovereignty of the Latvian  State. In a statement distributed today, G. Zemribo recalls that  according to the Latvian Constitution, Latvia is an independent  democratic state recognized by many countries of the world, that  it is sovereign, and that "only the institutions of the Republic  of Latvia have legislative, executive, and judicial power on the  territory of Latvia and the power of any other state on it is  absolutely excluded." The establishment of the principles of  law in Latvia is the prerogative of the Latvian Government and  other executive institutions. Nobody has granted such rights to  the Russian Army.    DIENA has already written that the commander-in-chief of the  North-Western Army Group has issued an order which states that  "in the event of an assault or any other illegal action against  Russian soldiers or military structures, they should be solved  by all possible means, including the use of weapons. In the  event of an attempt to occupy a military object, one should open  fire" [na porozenije].    As the chairman of the High Court therefore concludes, the  order of the North-Western Army Group commander foresees that  the decision about whether or not the action is lawful will be  made by a soldier. "How dangerous this is and where it can take  us, we can see in the examples of many bloody events on the  territory of the former Soviet Union".    After having read this statement at a press conference, G.  Zemribo recalled that the Russian Army is stationed on the  territory of Latvia illegally, and that Latvia has no agreement  with Russia stating that the soldiers of the Russian Army are  not submitted to Latvian jurisdiction. Therefore they will have  to answer for their deeds in accordance with the Latvian laws --  and this concerns the users of the weapons as well as those who  have given them the respective orders. These crimes will be  investigated by Latvian investigation institutions, not by the  Russian military prosecution.    According to G. Zemribo, he is distributing this statement  as  the chairman of the High Court, and he does not wish to pay  attention to the political aspect of this matter because "the  court stays above politics". His only aim is to call Russia's  attention to the possible juridical consequences of the  announcement of the North- Western Army Group.    DIENA already wrote that the order of the chief of the  North-Western Army Group was given after the incident that took  place on 10 January between former president of Vidzeme District  People's Deputies Council in Riga, Andrejs Rucs, and two  generals of the Russian Army. Until now, only Latvian President  Guntis Ulmanis has publicly expressed at a press conference his  personal opinion that this order cannot be regarded as a correct  answer to the president's correct behavior during the 10 January  incident.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Italy moves on plan to shake up civil service THE government of Mr Giuliano Amato yesterday approved a decree designed to revolutionise the work habits of Italy's pampered and inefficient 3m civil service, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The reform envisages the introduction of performance-monitored work contracts, greater departmental responsibility, harmonisation of pay structures, staggered hours, greater job flexibility and the state's right to sack. The philosophy behind the measures is to impose private-sector principles of work on civil servants and to reverse the situation whereby the public must be beholden to them for the favour of their services. Mr Raffaele Costa, minister for EC affairs and in charge of the reforms, described the decree as 'a great step forward' which in the medium term would raise the civil service to EC levels. The shake-up was one of four main reforms endorsed by parliament two months ago.</p>

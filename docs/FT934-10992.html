			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Proton sets up European venture - Malaysian carmaker to produce left-hand-drive models for continental market AN Anglo-Malaysian joint venture through which the Proton, Malaysia's national car, will be marketed in continental Europe from the middle of next year was formalised in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. The venture, Proton Cars Europe, is between Proton itself, its Malaysian distributor, Edaran Otomobil Nasional, and Mr David Brown, who introduced Proton cars to the UK - which has subsequently become by far Proton's largest largest export market. Mr Brown will have a 55 per cent stake, Proton 25 and Edaran 20. The initial sales target for the first year of operation is 8,000 units, although the long-term hope is for much larger sales as Proton's production capacity expands. Proton has about 70 per cent of the Malaysian car market and is now making an aggressive sales push overseas. It has outline plans to set up an assembly plant in Vietnam and is considering an overseas manufacturing facility, possibly in Chile. Capacity at the plant, 20 miles outside Kuala Lumpur, is being increased to 150,000 units a year from the current 120,000 and the 80,000 with which the car project began in the mid-1980s. This is to cope with both the introduction of new models and the start of manufacture of left-hand-drive vehicles for export to Europe from early next year. Currently Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd, the Proton's manufacturer, makes only right-hand-drive cars. Malaysians drive on the left, reflecting the country's former colonial status, and exports hitherto have been confined to right-hand-drive markets. The UK is by far the biggest export market, with just under 15,000 sold in 1992 and 16,000 projected for the current year. Another 2,000 annually have been sold in other right-hand-drive markets such as New Zealand, Australia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other Commonwealth markets. Proton is itself a joint venture company in which Japan's Mitsubishi Corp has a 17 per cent stake. Proton Cars Europe will not, however, act as a conventional importer and distributor in continental Europe in the same way as Proton Cars operates in the UK. Instead, its role will be to research and recommend to Proton a network of national distributors for each European country, and to co-ordinate their activities after they have been appointed.</p>

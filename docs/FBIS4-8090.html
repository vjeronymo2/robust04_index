			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Armonko Grgic for Herceg-Bosna from Busovaca] </F>   [Excerpt] The police station in Busovaca has informed us  that a bus full of civilians that left Busovaca for Kiseljak at  0930 was turned back from the joint checkpoint in the village of  Brestovsko in the Kiseljak municipality because the Muslim side  would not let it through to Croat-held territory. The Muslims  said that the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] would not allow  free movement of humanitarian aid convoys to the Muslim side.  All this was caused by an incident in Kresevo where a Muslim  sniper killed an HVO soldier. The road between Busovaca and  Kiseljak was opened three days ago. [passage omitted]</p>

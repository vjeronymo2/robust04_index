			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rothmans forms Pounds 55m joint venture in Russia ROTHMANS International is to invest Pounds 55m in a cigarette manufacturing joint venture with Nevo Tobacco, a privately-owned tobacco company in St Petersburg, Russia. The deal marks Rothmans' first capital investment in central and eastern Europe, though it has licensing arrangements in Poland and the former Yugoslavia. Rothmans will acquire a 75 per cent shareholding in the venture, to be called Rothmans Nevo, and will build a new cigarette factory in St Petersburg. The factory, with an output of 10bn cigarettes a year, is expected to begin production in mid-1995. The UK-based company's Pounds 55m investment will be phased over several years and will cover construction costs and the supply of plant and equipment. Lord Swaythling, Rothmans' chairman, said: 'This venture is a major long-term initiative with a view to capitalising on the opportunity that Russia represents as one of the largest potential consumer markets in the world'. Russia, with a market estimated at 443bn cigarettes a year, has already attracted large-scale investment from other tobacco multinationals.</p>

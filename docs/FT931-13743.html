			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Production of illegal biological weapons An illegal programme may be continuing in Russia to produce biological weapons despite a ban announced by President Boris Yeltsin nine months ago, according to Mr Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British foreign office, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. In a report to be broadcast last night by BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Hogg said the UK had information 'from some sources' that there had not been full compliance with the decree. Dr Vladimir Pasechnik, an expert who defected from the Soviet Union in 1989, told the programme that an institute in St Petersburg had been working on a genetically manipulated strain of plague that could be used by terrorists. Biological arms are prohibited under a 1972 international convention.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO--Leaders of Japan's largest  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed in principle  Tuesday [31 May] to consider rejecting the government's overdue  fiscal 1994 budget in a carefully devised strategic move, party  officials said.    The LDP, ousted from power last year after 38 years of rule,  will demand the 73 trillion yen budget be revised in line with  its calls for more realistic economic policies, including a  greater burden on taxpayers to cover mounting welfare pension  costs, the officials said.    If the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata rejects the  demands, the LDP will vote against the budget in an effort to  lay the groundwork for a no-confidence vote in cooperation with  the No. 2 opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP), they said.    But the LDP strategy is based on the assumption that the  SDP,  which in April quit the ruling coalition, leaving it a shaky  minority government, will vote for the budget and clear the way  for passage by the Diet.    The planned LDP objection is to show its clout in having its  voice heard as the powerful opposition party, LDP sources said.    ``We have not decided to oppose the budget as a whole,'' a  senior party official said. ``We will have our Policy Affairs  Research Council discuss whether to submit demands for revisions  of the budget.''</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama at a meeting of </F> opposition parties in Xai-Xai, Gaza Province, on 26 May;  published as an advertisement]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, compatriots,    I would like to begin by saluting you during this first  meeting of opposition political parties being held in this  atmosphere of peace and national reconciliation that we all wish  to see.    This is a period of national reconciliation, after years of  grief, struggle, and suffering that we all experienced. We  stand for reconciliation during this period of peace and  consolidation of democracy.    Democracy: my dream, the dream of all of us!    Each and every process of national reconciliation signifies  the establishment of a government of national unity. This  results from the idea that what unites political forces of a  government of national unity is far greater than what separates  them.    In our case, some of the reasons that would lead us to  establish such a government are very clear.    Our first objective is to guarantee the holding of free  elections to establish democracy in Mozambique.    We know who the democrats are. We also know who the other  people are who have been in power for the past 19 years!    We are not dealing with a question of party strength. What  is at stake is not the fact that the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] is stronger than other opposition parties.  This cannot and should not raise doubts about our intentions.    Through its positions, Renamo has demonstrated deep respect  for all political forces since, I repeat, what is at stake is  the defense of democratic values, social justice, and solidarity  -- values which our people have not known and do not know in  practice.    All of us present here are very aware of the needs and  difficulties facing our people in their daily lives. We all  want to change this situation, by imposing justice and  democratic legality, fighting abuse of power and corruption, and  creating a new society.    We want to create a new society where economic and social  development will receive priority with a view to establishing,  from October, a better life for all Mozambicans and creating  foundations for progress, our future concern.    If all the problems that we face concern us and bring us  closer, then the only thing that remains is for us to combine  our strength through the establishment of a government of  national unity to find a solution to the needs facing our people.    Our disunity can only benefit others, notably the Mozambique  Liberation Front [Frelimo], which has always involved itself in  divisive maneuvers to continue ruling, which has always created  a gap between the privileged and the persecuted, a party which  has distanced itself from the country's reality, from our people.    Frelimo finds itself lost in this new model of society to  create true democracy.    The new Frelimo democrats are the old Frelimo Marxists.  Their methods and production have not changed: Mozambique's  backwardness and increasing difficulties facing our people.    As far as Frelimo is concerned, the existence of many  parties  standing for elections is a good thing, because its strategy is  to safeguard votes that it is sure of obtaining from the few  supporters of the Marxist policy under the disguise of democracy.    Its aim is to see the votes of the rest of the electorate  divided among the many political parties, making difficult the  emergence of a party with absolute or relative majority, thus  creating compromises that would thwart democratic values.    Friends, we cannot forget that Frelimo is well acquainted  with electoral mechanisms, it has immense financial resources  and an electoral machinery capable of all tricks, since it has  been in power for the past 19 years in a single party  dictatorship.    In the coming elections there are many presidential  candidates, but we all know, however, that there will only be  one president!    The issue now is for us to decide whether this president  should be a democrat or whether we want to continue with a  "make-believe democrat" whom we all know as Chissano.    Brothers, when I present myself to the electorate, I do not  do so merely as a Renamo candidate appointed during a special  congress of our party.    I want to be and I will be a candidate of democracy who  represents and defends the people, regardless of their political  creed.    It has not been in vain that I have been defending solutions  that lead to national reconciliation. I will not distinguish  between winners and losers, and once again the best solution is  the establishment of a government of national unity.    What distinguishes us from Frelimo is that if Joaquim  Chissano remains president of the Republic he will continue to  be the president of a section of society pitted against another,  whereas a democrat will be the president of all, without  exception or discrimination of a political, social, economic,  religious, or ethnic nature.    That is what democracy, for which I have fought so much,  means to me!    Thus, I have always supported the existence of a financial  fund for the electoral campaign to enable us to carry out our  electoral campaigns with some financial backing that we have  been lacking so far.    The agreement that we may reach will enable us to reinforce  control mechanisms at the level of voter registration, which is  a decisive step in the electoral process.    If we do not take all precautions in order to jointly ensure  complete neutrality and transparency in this process, then all  other following phases of the electoral process will be  jeopardized.    Our joint monitoring will include the tight control of "vote  counting," the use of data systems that assess and inform us  about the use of computers, and the invitation we will make to  those countries that form part of the UN Operations in  Mozambique to form a group of electoral observers.    Although provisions have been made for the establishment of  "mobile voter registration centers," the same is not the case  regarding the ballot boxes. This will evidently create  difficulties for the people deep in the interior. It will be up  to us to guarantee their movement to polling stations.    Once again, the government and Frelimo -- which is one and  the same thing -- obtained the approval of an electoral law  favorable to them.    It is not only important to guarantee security in voter  registration centers, it is also vital to guarantee security  during the entire electoral process.    I am referring to the security of our candidates and our  electorate. This will only be possible through the assistance  of the police, which is neutral and depoliticized.    Together, we must demand the reinforcement of the National  Commission for Police Affairs and the Civpol [UN Civilian Police  Force] at national level to prevent incidents of insecurity and  conflict which would certainly jeopardize the whole process now  under way.    I am convinced that together we shall be able to more easily  overcome all the difficulties that lie ahead. Some of these  difficulties are already known to us and we shall be cautious.    Brothers, we shall certainly experience other unforeseen  difficulties, however -- constant surprises, provocation after  provocation -- that jeopardize the process for which many people  gave their lives and many more are willing to work tirelessly  and sacrifice their lives.    I am convinced that the challenge before us today, to form a  government of national unity, is a decisive step forward toward  victory by the democratic forces.    [Signed] Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama</p>

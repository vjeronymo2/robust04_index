			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEBRASKA;  </P> <P> REGULATION OF GUN OWNERS IS UPHELD  </P> <P> The Nebraska Supreme Court has ruled that the state can still regulate who may  own guns despite an amendment to Nebraska's constitution that allows residents  to bear arms in almost all circumstances. The ruling came after cases against  two Lincoln County men were dismissed by district judges who cited the  amendment, approved by voters in 1988. The two men contended the amendment's  language prevents any regulation by the Legislature of the right to possess  arms. The state argued that the right to keep and bear arms is limited to  lawful purposes.  </P></p>

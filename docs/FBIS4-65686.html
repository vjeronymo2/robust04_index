			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The government, the laender, and the  communes are facing sizable tax losses in 1995 and the following  years as compared with the medium-term planning. As a result of  the recession, lower wages, prices, and interest rates, 21  million German marks [DM] less will be available in 1995 than  estimated as recently as in May last year. The government alone  will receive DM9.9 billion less. This was announced by the tax  assessment working group today after four days of consultations  at the Finance Ministry.    Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) stated  that this shortfall in receipts can be absorbed in the 1995  budget. The projection of the global shortfall serves this  goal. In addition, personnel reductions are planned, and  privatization will also yield proceeds. Waigel called on the  laender and communes to exercise strict discipline concerning  expenditure to curb the overall new indebtedness.    Waigel considers the shortfall that has been caused by the  economic situation to be a consequence of last year's serious  recession but also the result of the "agreeable moderate  development of wages, prices, and interest rates." They will  have a dampening effect on the increase in the nominal tax  revenue in the coming years. Thus, the assessment also reflects  the "success of our stability policy."    In view of the economic development, DM2.7 billion more in  tax revenues are expected to be earned as compared with the  short-term assessment for 1994. A total of DM375.9 billion fall  on the government, which results in an additional DM1.9 billion.</p>

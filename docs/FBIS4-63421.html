			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov; from the </F> "Itogi" program]    [Text] Last week passions again broke out around the  Russian budget. As our program predicted last week, the Defense  Ministry attempted to increase budget expenditure on the Armed  Forces and the military-industrial complex. Apart from that,  Vladimir Shumeyko, the speaker of parliament's upper chamber,  stated somewhat unexpectedly for the uninitiated, that the  Federation Council will not approve the law on the draft budget  in its current form.    [Gerasimov] The Russian military, deeply offended by the  amount allocated to them by the state budget last week,  conducted a mass attack on legislators on the eve of the  adoption of the budget by the State Duma. The State Duma  Defense Committee, concerned by the results of the  underfinancing of the Army, came out with a decision on  increasing the military share from 37 to 55 trillion rubles.  The last time that financing of troops took up 30 percent of  the state budget was in the USSR in 1940 before the Second World  War.    However, this circumstance in no way reflects the real  situation. Today, 60 percent of defense expenditure is on social  provisions. The withdrawal of troops from the distant and near  abroad, unprecedented in history, and support for the  infrastructure of military bases eat up a significant part of  the budget.    According to Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, the  Army is up to its ears in expenditure. For several years  exercises have not been above regimental level and the number of  inspection trips has fallen sharply, as has the receipt of new  equipment. Andrey Kokoshin claims that 55 trillion does not  mean a luxury life for the military, but money to stop the  collapse of the Army. [Video shows Kokoshin addressing news  conference]    [Begin Kokoshin recording] It is absolutely not question of  our are preparing for a major war, although you always have to  be vigilant in this regard, and to a certain degree, defense  capability is one of the main factors in preventing war. But  the fact is that we need a minimum level to provide for the  viability of the Armed Forces and preserve the unique defense  producers, and preserve the opportunities for the Armed Forces,  when the country is richer, when the country gets to its feet,  to get hold of first class military equipment. [end recording]    [Gerasimov] In the meantime, the Federation Council has  seriously worked on support for the military budget. Its  speaker, Vladimir Shumeyko, last week visited the Ivanovo  strategic missile forces division. In his opinion, the Army  today is the only stable institution of Russian statehood and it  is dangerous for the state to save money on it. Vladimir  Shumeyko said That the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly  will only approve a budget that will be capable of strengthening  the Armed Forces.    [Begin Shumeyko recording] What does 55 mean? Is it enough  or not? I am not prepared to go into these figures with you  today. I am far from simply relying on figures. Until we sit  down and check each article on each branch of the Armed Forces  calmly, maybe it will not be 30 or 55. Because I have spoken  with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin and know how difficult it  is for the government today, how difficult it is to make  allocations to the military in these conditions where there is a  lack of revenue in the budget, especially when the  agro-industrial complex is making demands, and so on. It will  be necessary to defend every kopeck. Maybe it will be 57 or 48.  [end recording]    [Gerasimov] At the same time, according to a statement by  General Vorobyev, the chief military financier, the money  allocated by the Defense Ministry is barely enough to pay off  the debts for supplies of equipment and weapons. The military  budget approved by the State Duma in its first reading may  deprive Russia of its strategic nuclear forces, the basis of  ensuring national security. A new system created on the basis of  solely Russian enterprises and constructors bureaus must replace  the missile complex reaching the end of its guaranteed life. If  this program is disrupted, then by the year 2000 Russia will  have only 90 strategic missile launchers, which will lead to the  complete destruction of nuclear parity with the United States.    Igor Sergeyev, the commander in chief of the Strategic  Missile Forces, thinks that at current levels of finance the  introduction of new missiles will be postponed indefinitely and  his department will not be in a condition to carry out its  present volume of tasks.    [Begin Sergeyev recording] We have to start their  introduction in 1995 to replace the 300 launchers that we have  destroyed up to the present time, in accordance with the quota  where the Americans chose 3,500 and we chose 3,000. We believe  that this will be sufficient, but they needed to be assembled,  they will not just appear. As of today, if you take 100 percent  of the finance planned for this area, at the present time we are  financed only for four percent. [end recording]    [Gerasimov] The combination of arguments produced by the  military to justify the necessity of increasing their share of  the budget will most likely convince the legislators, moreover,  since the State Duma is the only state body that has not yet  expressed a positive attitude toward additional finance for the  Army. The president and the Cabinet of Ministers have already  supported an increase in the budget to 55 trillion rubles. The  military's main ace is that political sympathy in an as yet  unstable society remains on their side.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU car dealer rules to be renewed Reform of regulations governing the distribution and sale of new cars within the European Union is expected to be finalised at a meeting of the European Commission on September 21. The motor industry now operates under a so-called 'block exemption', which allows car makers to operate selective and exclusive dealer networks in breach of European competition rules. The exemption was granted for 10 years and is due to expire at the end of June next year. The Commission is expected to approve renewal of the block exemption, which carmakers consider crucial to their ability to maintain their networks of authorised dealers. The final details of the new regulation are unlikely to be settled until late this year following consultations with EU member states and other interested parties. An intense debate has been waged between the competition and industry directorates over how radically the system should be reformed in order to improve competition in the European car market. The competition directorate has argued that experience over the last 10 years has shown that the block exemption 'has not contributed in any significant way to either the opening up of national markets or to the development of flexible and efficient structures in the distribution of cars and spares'. It has been supported by European consumer groups, which have called for the deregulation of the car market. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, has supported the case for block exemption renewal, however, partly as an instrument for controlling the flow of Japanese vehicle imports into the European Union. The competition authorities have been concerned that the present distribution system has also contributed to the wide divergence of car prices across west Europe and has served to hinder cross-border purchases of new cars. The car makers maintain that car price differentials are chiefly caused, however, by currency fluctuations and the wide disparities between the levels of car taxation in different EU member states.</p>

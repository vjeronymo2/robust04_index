			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SLIDE CLOSES PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY; 2 DRIVERS INJURED  </P> <P> A landslide swept a sheet of tumbling earth and rocks down from a cliff in the  Pacific Palisades area onto Pacific Coast Highway this morning, injuring at  least two drivers unable to escape in time and damaging several cars.  </P> <P> The drivers -- a man and a woman -- were taken to Santa Monica Hospital, said  Ted Braun, a spokesman for the hospital.  </P> <P> Braun said the injuries did not appear to be serious. "They are not  life-threatening injuries," said Braun, who was unable to give the identities  of the drivers.  </P> <P> Officer Doug Myers, of the West LAPD traffic division, said of the two injured  drivers: "Basically what they got was an exciting E Ticket ride" down Pacific  Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Added Judy Lester, a New Jersey resident who was a passenger in a third car,  which filled with mud: "It was like being in a bumper car at the pier. . . .  All of a sudden it became dark, and mud started coming in the back window."  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear if there was any serious damage to homes in the  area. A large piece of concrete, which appeared to be part of a patio from a  home above the slide area, seemed to be threatened by the earth movement, LAPD  spokesman Roger Mora said.  </P> <P> A Caltrans spokeswoman, Terrygay Jackson, said the agency is not doing any  roadwork in the area and is uncertain what might have caused the slide.  </P> <P> Lt. Robert Schroeder, a county lifeguard stationed near the slide area, said at  least two cars overturned as the dirt and rocks spilled over a section of the  15000 block of the highway shortly after 11 a.m. The two victims were removed  from those cars.  </P> <P> Schroeder said that in addition to the two drivers injured at the scene, three  others were being assisted by lifeguards.  </P> <P> "Apparently that strip of highway is (now) just a bunch of dirt," Mora said.  </P> <P> Jackson, of Caltrans, said agency workers have already begun to try to clear  dirt from the highway.  </P> <P> While the cleanup continued, police blocked off both sides of the highway to  oncoming traffic. "We have closed PCH between Temescal (Canyon Road) and West  Channel Road," Mora said.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Steven Braun, Darrell Dawsey and Clay Evans contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

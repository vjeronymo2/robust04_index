			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO-WIN SITUATION  </P> <P> Oct. 28 letter writer Lev Mailer expresses his disappointment that Barry  Levinson's movie "Avalon" wasn't Jewish enough.  </P> <P> It seems to me Levinson can't win. Had he cast only Jews in the central roles,  he would've invited angry letters about standing in the way of non-traditional  casting. And had the film been dripping with Jewish iconography, he would've  left himself open to criticism that he is furthering racial stereotypes.  </P> <P> STEVE STOLIAR  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Slow start to Christmas trade Retailers face the prospect of a subdued Christmas shopping season if the level of trading indicated by cheque usage continues at the level of last weekend. Transax, the Birmingham-based cheque guarantee company which covers 48,000 shops, reported that last weekend, the first of the season, the average level of cheque authorisations for high street stores was running only 4.9 per cent ahead of the comparable weekend last year. But trading last weekend was busier than the weekend before. The value of cheques that Transax was asked by high street shops to authorise was 13.7 per cent higher.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Procordia to sell Wallac to EG&amp;G for SKr330m PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and food group, is selling Wallac, a Finnish biotechnology subsidiary, to EG&amp;G, a US services and technology group. The unit is changing hands for SKr330m (Dollars 46m). The company said the sale was not connected to an agreement to demerge its drugs and consumer goods units, reached on Thursday between the Swedish government and Volvo, the vehicle manufacturer, which jointly control Procordia. Procordia had planned for some time to dispose of Wallac, which has annual turnover of Dollars 50m, because its diagnostic equipment did not fit with Procordia's core biotechnology activities. Wallac became part of Procordia three years ago. The deal between the government and Volvo will result in the consumer goods section of Procordia being taken over wholly by Volvo, while the government will privatise its majority holding in the streamlined pharmaceuticals business by 1995. Volvo will remain a large shareholder in the pharmaceuticals side, holding up to 35 per cent. Mr Jan Ekberg, Procordia's chief executive, said the new drugs-only company would concentrate on expanding in the US and Japan following the integration this year of Erbamont, the Italian drugs group acquired from Montedison in May and poised to become fully owned by Procordia.</p>

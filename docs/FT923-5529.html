			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Milosevic must adopt peace plans or resign, says Panic SERBIAN president Mr Slobodan Milosevic will be forced to resign if he does not implement the accords reached at the London conference, Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump Yugoslavia, said yesterday. Mr Milosevic last night welcomed the peace plan and denied that he had ambitions to create a greater Serbia. However, Mr Panic said in London before returning to Belgrade: 'What counts is not the word but the deed. This peace proposal is now the official peace plan for the federal republic of Yugoslavia. I expect Mr Milosevic to comply, or else.' The Yugoslav federal parliament meets on Tuesday to discuss the conference accords, aimed at ending the war in Bosnia, and possibly Mr Milosevic's future. Increased pressure on the Serbian leader coincided with fresh warnings from the United Nations and the European Community, joint organisers of the conference, that the fighting in Bosnia would not end in the next few days, despite the agreement. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, warned at the end of the conference that 'what counts is what happens on the ground, not today, or tomorrow, but in the next few weeks'. Meanwhile, the Dutch defence ministry yesterday announced it had suspended two junior Dutch army officers serving with the UN for refusing to work in Sarajevo's Marshall Tito barracks, which was shelled on August 20. In Bosnia, government officials said the accords could lead to an escalation of the fighting. 'The conference was a catastrophe. It went back,' said Mr Stjepan Kljuic, a member of the Bosnian presidency. Other Bosnian officials said Serb forces could use a time lapse between the agreements being reached at the conference and their implementation to continue bombardments. The besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo was again shelled by artillery and mortars yesterday. Fifteen mortar bombs crashed on or near the presidency building. Elsewhere, Serb forces continued their blockade of the eastern town of Gorazde, and the northern city of Bihac. The accords cover the closure of detention camps, an end to 'ethnic cleansing', and a ceasefire. Negotiations, due to begin in Geneva on September 3, will begin implementing the accords.

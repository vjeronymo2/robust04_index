			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Cicutto flies in to Glasgow for NAB Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based clearing bank which is a subsidiary of National Australia Bank, has appointed Frank Cicutto, a high-flyer from the parent company, to replace Charles Love, the ceo who died just after Christmas. Cicutto, 43, is currently state manager for New South Wales and Australian Territory, the largest unit in NAB, with more branches and greater assets than Clydesdale. He took up office in Glasgow yesterday but will not move from Sydney to Glasgow until the second half of February. Love, who was 48, died suddenly during a skiing holiday in France. He had been ceo at Clydesdale for little over a year having previously held senior posts with TSB. He had recently launched a project to create two branch banking processing centres and a telephone centre for the Clydesdale in Scotland, a project which will involve up to 800 job losses but will not mean closing branches. Cicutto has been with NAB for 26 years. His recent appointments include general manager of the group's credit bureau and head of the bank's US operations, based in New York. He had not visited Scotland before this week. Cicutto is the first Australian to be ceo of Clydesdale, which NAB acquired in 1987 from the Midland Bank. All previous ceos have been British and there are only a handful of Australians working in the bank. However, he says he does not expect to encounter any hostility for not being Scottish and that he intends to carry on with the strategy launched by Love. 'The direction is very clear and I am very comfortable with it,' he says.</p>

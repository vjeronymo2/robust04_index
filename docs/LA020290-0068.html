			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT NOISE FOES GIVE THEIR LAWYER THE THIRD DEGREE;  </P> <P> LINDBERGH FIELD: IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SCENE FROM "BONANZA," EXCEPT THAT NO ONE  HAD A ROPE. OPPOSITION BY THE 1,500 CITIZEN PLAINTIFFS TO A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT  MEANS THE LAWSUIT NOW MOVES TO TRIAL.  </P> <P> It wasn't an episode from "L.A. Law," but it could have been: The disgruntled  judge is told that more than a thousand people from Point Loma are unhappy  about a proposed settlement of their airport noise lawsuit, which they never  consented to and which pays their out-of-town lawyer $50,000, so the judge  excuses himself from the courtroom to let the attorney and the people talk.  </P> <P> For the next half an hour, lawyer John Schimmenti of El Segundo stands in the  center of the large courtroom as dozens of his clients fire away with angry  questions. Why do you deserve $50,000? Why didn't you return our phone calls?  Why didn't you tell us about the settlement?  </P> <P> "This is so pathetic . . . (and) such a scummy way to do business," charges one  of the clients, Pat Rickon.  </P> <P> Schimmenti tries to explain. Yes, he says, some mistakes were made. The law has  changed, he says. "Use the microphone, we can't hear you!" yells an elderly  woman, one of many in the audience. The lawyer offers to divide the $50,000  with the people. The courtroom erupts in derisive laughter.  </P> <P> "You're fired!" shouts a man in the back. Some of the clients, themselves  lawyers, quiz Schimmenti as if he were on the witness stand.  </P> <P> Some of the marshals and law clerks, onlookers to the inquisition, grin  nervously and whisper. It could be a scene from "Bonanza," except no one has a  rope.  </P> <P> Finally, it's over. Schimmenti tells U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving  that "a substantial number" of his clients don't want to settle with the San  Diego Unified Port District, the agency that runs Lindbergh Field and which the  estimated 1,500 residents sued because of jet noise at the busy airport.  </P> <P> Irving, who earlier had explained that he was inundated with phone calls,  letters and a personal visit from residents since December, when the proposed  settlement became public, tells Schimmenti, "I had no intention of approving  this settlement" because of the dissatisfaction.  </P> <P> So the the lawsuit -- technically 11 lawsuits filed against the Port District  involving 780 parcels of property -- moves forward to a trial, probably this  summer.  </P> <P> Irving says he will give the residents 90 days, until April  </P> <P> 27, to decide how they want to proceed. He orders Schimmenti to document his  billing to the court by providing time sheets.  </P> <P> The judge also calls on Schimmenti and the lawyer for the Port District,  Michael Gatzke, to contact all the residents who were named in the lawsuit and  notify them of the new developments, and to ask whether they want to remain as  plaintiffs.  </P> <P> Afterward, a somewhat chagrined Schimmenti, acknowledging he has never seen or  participated in a similar scene, says he assumes he will remain the lawyer for  the residents. But many in the lobby say they intend to hire someone new to  represent them.  </P> <P> "I don't see how we can keep him. We're not going to court with him," says John  Turner, a plaintiff and a lawyer himself. Turner says some leaders of the  residents, many of whom are members of the Airport Coalition, a group that has  long waged a battle over airport noise, have already begun discussions with San  Diego attorneys who might take the case.  </P> <P> Nancy Palmtag, a plaintiff and spokeswoman for the Airport Coalition, praises  Irving and says: "He really understood what was happening to us and took care  of it in a responsible way. We couldn't have asked for more."  </P> <P> Palmtag says the issue isn't about money or damage awards the residents could  potentially receive. Instead, she says, it's about moving Lindbergh Field. The  controversy over the proposed settlement and news that the Port District  intends to improve Lindbergh Field to accommodate more passengers has  rejuvenated many in Point Loma to fight against the airport in court, she said.  </P> <P> According to the terms of the proposed settlement, first offered to Schimmenti  by the Port District, the Point Loma homeowners would not have received money  damages from the Port District. But the agency would have paid the residents'  legal fees, up to $50,000. In addition, some of the residents were free to  refile their lawsuit by 1994 with a different attorney. But many people at  Thursday's hearing say they were excluded from refiling because they had not  answered letters sent by Schimmenti, letters many said they never received.  </P> <P> At the end of Thursday's hearing, an elderly woman makes her way to the railing  separating the audience from the lawyers and judge. "Thank you very much,  judge," she calls out to Irving, as he walks to his chambers. "You're welcome,"  he replies.  </P></p>

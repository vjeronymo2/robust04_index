			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: They're playing a Finnish tune in Japan - Andrew Clement reports from the Kitakyushu International music festival KITAKYUSHU sprawls across the north-western tip of Kyushu, the most southerly of the main islands of Japan. With a population of a little over a million it is the country's seventh largest city, created in 1973 from the amalgamation of five industrial towns. Its hectic jumble of expressways, factories and urban development receives the thumbs-down from the guide books to Japan, which generally urge visitors to pass through as quickly as possible and head on to the volcanoes, hot springs and lush evergreen forests farther south. There is much hard work going on to change that unprepossessing image, and the arts are strongly featured in the city's immensely ambitious plans for the millennium. A handsome art museum already commands a panoramic view, air pollution permitting, across the whole of Kitakyushu, and the Kitakyushu International Music Festival has put down firm roots - five years old now and generously supported by the city authorities. The festival is the creation of the violinist Yoshiko Arai, and her cellist husband Seppo Kimanen. Kimanen founded and still directs the Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival, the exuberant midsummer celebration in central Finland that has established itself as one of Europe's leading chamber-music feasts. The couple's idea of creating a Japanese sibling to Kuhmo in Ms Arai's home city was eagerly received in Kitakyushu, and it has prospered mightily, now drawing musicians from Europe and the US each November to Japan. There was a full week of concerts and recitals this year and every one was immensely well supported and warmly received. The Kuhmo model was the starting point for Kitakyushu and chamber music remains its raison d'etre with the final evening given over to a mammoth programme of 'chamber music fever'. Along the way, though, some aspects of the Finnish programme have been adapted to local conditions, and slowly other, new traditions have evolved. There was never quite the sense of prodigal informality, the spontaneity and unpredictability, which is one of Kuhmo's most engaging characteristics; the Japanese concern for order and firm planning saw to that. Concerts began and ended with most un-Kuhmo-like punctuality, with never a suggestion of music-making stretching on into the small hours. The nature of the place, and the diverse venues for the concerts were partly responsible. For Kitakyushu has at least three concert halls that would be welcomed in almost any European city - certainly nowhere in the British Isles outside London is so well endowed - and all played host to one or more concert. Chamber music in big, 2000-seater halls is a very different proposition from the intimacies of the Finnish performances. Yet a series of lunchtime concerts (immensely expensive and exclusive) in the beautiful Western-style headquarters of the Industrial Club of West Japan generated their own kind of cosiness; there the British cellist Robert Cohen gave marvellously eloquent performances of solo suites by Bach and Britten and was heard with the closest attention, while a programme of Sibelius's chamber music given in a Buddhist temple with the audience seated cross-legged on the floor had a kind of rapt intensity that made a very suitable substitute. Sibelius and Brahms were the themes of the Kitakyushu week. Japanese audiences are only just getting to grips with Western music of the 20th-century, and Sibelius, one suspects, was largely unknown to them. Two concerts by the orchestra of the Korean Broadcasting System under Okko Kamu brought a Sibelius symphony, the First, sketched in rather approximate terms (decent string playing, raucous, insecure wind); in the Shokakuji temple the Jean Sibelius Quartet (Arai's and Kimanen's own group) gave a beautifully conceived, small-scale account of the Voces Intimae quartet, and the remarkable violinist Mark Peskanov played the rarely heard (and still unpublished) Five Pieces Op. 81. Peskanov and his regular Kuhmo colleagues provided the personnel for the other, less thematic chamber evenings too. In these happily assorted programmes the music-making seemed at its most unbuttoned and exciting. Scattered through the week there were thrilling accounts of the Dvorak piano quintet with Peskanov and Cohen, Jukka Pohjola and Teemu Kupainen from the Sibelius quartet, and the pianist of the Tchaikovsky Trio Konstantin Bogino, and of the Brahms Piano Quintet with Peter Csaba and Arai, Vladimir Mendelssohn, Kimanen and the pianist Etsuko Terada. Peskanov with Juhani Lagerspetz gave as crisp and musical an account of Beethoven's Violin Sonata Op. 12 no. 1 as one could hope to hear, the Tchaikovsky Trio dug out a typically full-blooded account of Rakhmaninov's Trio elegiaque and Charles Neidich was wondrously fluent in Brahms' E flat Clarinet Sonata and Berg's Four Pieces. Such were the most Kuhmo-like highlights of a packed week, but the concerts by the Korean orchestra also provided a platform for young soloists from Finland and Japan to go through their paces. The Finnish-based Valeria Resjan coped well with Mozart's B flat Piano Concerto K595, even though the KBS Symphony is hardly the Mozart orchestra of anyone's dreams. Most remarkable of all was a 15-year-old violinist Yuko Kawami, who despatched Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy as if its technical challenges were negligible. Both young ladies were invited to next summer's festival in Kuhmo, while Kuhmo's own youth policy is now reaping its rewards in the shape of the Virtuosi di Kuhmo, a splendidly accomplished string orchestra conducted by Peter Csaba that spent the week in Kitakyushu touring schools in the area. Their performances at the final jamboree demonstrated what a finely honed group Csaba has produced and what a useful broadening of Kuhmo's scope it provides; even transplanted halfway across the world the festival preserves a special flavour and its energy and enthusiasm most of all.</p>

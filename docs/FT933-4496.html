			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (1): First phase of the flexibility revolution - Comment / Flexible working, using computer technology, is a peripheral concern for many suppliers and users, but its wider implications have to be taken seriously COMPUTER technology is making 'flexible' working possible; the rapidly changing demands of today's business environment may make it increasingly necessary. It does not follow, however, that companies will find flexible operation an easy discipline to implement - or that all staff will find it a congenial way of working. The London-based consultancy Ovum says that flexible work is 'any work carried out using a computer, outside company-owned premises by the company's employees.' The list includes field workers in sales, maintenance, inspection and delivery, but also professionals working at home and specialists seeking a quieter, more motivating environment. By this definition there were just over half a million 'flexible' workers in the US and Europe at the beginning of this year. So far, then, flexible working is a mere drop in the employment ocean. But the companies pioneering flexible working policies are among the world's largest and most innovative - Boeing, Mercedes, ICI, BT and Unilever among them - suggesting that the dribble could grow to a flood by the turn of the century. This is certainly the dream of information technologists looking at the ways in which people interact with computers. They see the growth of interest in multimedia - the convergence of computing, video and wireless technologies - as an essential precursor of a time when an executive's only link with the office will be an electronic umbilical cord; when handwritten memos complete with voice annotations and video clips will fill the ether; and when newspapers will be delivered as a self-selected collection of electronic 'clippings' to a monitor screen. This issue of Software at Work does not deal with anything so futuristic. It is concerned more with the first phase of the flexible working revolution. At one end of the spectrum there are the people entrusted to work from home using personal computers. Pioneers here include computer companies, who have a head start in the technology. Digital Equipment, for example, encourages its staff to be flexible in the way they work; some 20 per cent of its employees in the UK have computer equipment at home. Elsewhere in the organisation there have been attempts to bring the home to the workplace. In Stockholm, Sweden, for example, Digital employees have designed their workplace around the themes of the garden, the golf course, the beach and the archipelago. At the push of a button, computers emerge from the ceiling to levels which make it possible to work standing, sitting or even lying down. AT the other end of the spectrum there are rural communities of flexible workers trained to the same level of competence as their urban equivalents and using electronics to give them access to the same resources. This development is all quite small-scale at present. Flexible working is being actively promoted by fixed and mobile telecommunications network operators who see a potentially substantial new source of revenue. The Connected Community project, recently launched by BT, Apple Computer, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission is studing the potential benefits of technology in small towns and villages. Success depends on persuading large corporations to use such remote resources. Nevertheless, the wider implications of moves towards flexible working have to be taken seriously. The development of 'personal digital assistants' and 'personal communicators' - pocket-sized computers capable of sending and receiving messages - reflects new interest in mobile computing. Researchers are already working on the psychology problems that people are likely to face when working alone. Office workers enjoy more than just the banter and comradeship of their colleagues; they receive valuable, if covert, clues which alert them to the state of business - the 'buzz' in a foreign exchange dealing room as interest rates change, for example. Some companies will look at flexible working as a way of saving money. Certainly 'hot desking,' where employees have no permanent desk but use common facilities in the office and personal computers at home, can lead to substantial saving in real estate. Digital's most successful 'Office of the Future' experiment has led to 30 per cent increases in personal productivity and space-savings of 40 per cent. But Ovum, which has just completed a study* of flexible working, warns that costs may be higher than companies expect: 'Potential users should realise that deciding on and implementing a flexible working solution is a complex task and one for which there is little help from experienced external suppliers. 'It is a fairly expensive process and has many hidden costs, such as the setting up of help desks and installing virus detection software, that must be taken into account.' Ovum argues that software development will be a key cost, pointing out that Metropolitan Life, the personal and corporate insurance company, took six developers, four years and Dollars 2m to develop software for its 1,000-strong sales team. Windsor Life, concentrating on life insurance and pensions, took two programmers, 10 months and Pounds 200,000 to develop software for its 300 sales people. These are hardly the kinds of projects which a sensible company is going to entrust - at a management level at any rate - to an outside contractor. Which suggests that those who believe that reports of the death of the central information systems department have been exaggerated are right. The Brussels-based consultancy OTR, in examining the future of the IS department, concluded that there were several tasks which only a central IS function could fulfil. These included ensuring that a company's IT infrastructure was flexible enough to handle new demands from a fast changing business environment. Another task is ensuring that quality standards for large business projects are met. The development of systems for flexible working comes into that category. The use of computers to support staff working out of the office will certainly grow over the next decade. Those that successfully implement the new systems will be those who follow the older, proven rules of total quality. * Flexible Working with Information Technology: The Business Opportunity, Ovum, London, Pounds 725.

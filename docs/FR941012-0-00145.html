In the WIR survey, injured loggers reported that among the factors that contributed to the accident were coworker's activity, misjudging time and distance needed to avoid injury, using wrong cutting methods and not paying full attention to work. In addition, a State of Washington study of fatalities in the logging industry from 1977&hyph;83 concluded that over 90 percent of the deaths had been preventable (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Therefore, when unsafe behavior is observed, it is important that proper work practices be reinforced through additional training. Fifth, according to the WIR survey, more than one third of all those injured had never received training. Moreover, more than one half of injured loggers working in non-western States (i.e., States without logging standards and training requirements) had never received training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixth, the logging industry itself supports the value of training in reducing accidents (Ex. 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;29, 5&hyph;33, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;43, 5&hyph;44, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;47, 5&hyph;59, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). Many commenters said their accident rates decreased after they implemented a training program (Ex. 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6; Tr. W2 125, OR 566). One company achieved a 63-percent reduction in lost workdays within a year of implementing training (Tr. W2 125). The Montana Logging Association reported that member companies had decreased accidents by 52 percent after implementing training (Tr. OR 566). A study for the International Woodworkers of America found a 71-percent reduction in accidents in establishments in the Pacific Northwest region who had implemented training programs (Ex. 4&hyph;181).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(1) requires that training be provided for each employee, including supervisors, at no cost to the employee. The proposed rule also required each employee to be trained. This provision clarifies OSHA's intent that supervisors also must receive training. OSHA believes that it is important that supervisors be trained since they are responsible for making work assignments, determining work areas, providing consultation when hazardous situations arise, determining when new employees can begin to work independently, and identifying and correcting unsafe job performance of employees they supervise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters raised the issue of cost and availability of training programs, especially for small establishments (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;32, 5&hyph;51). However, other commenters said there are training resources that are readily available for logging establishments (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 36, 9&hyph;1). These include logging associations and companies which currently offer logging training programs and traveling training seminars, and video tapes which are available to employers. For example, the Alaska Timber Insurance Exchange has established a video library for policyholders to use as training supplements (Ex. 9&hyph;15). The American Pulpwood Association said it was developing a logging training that was to be available by the end of 1989 (Ex. 5&hyph;27). The Associated Oregon Loggers has also developed logging training programs for member companies (Ex. 36). One training company indicated it was currently providing a variety of different logging training programs in six different States (Ex. 5&hyph;20). OSHA also notes that several commenters have expressed their willingness to work with OSHA to train loggers (Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;47, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i)(2) requires that training be provided as follows: as soon as possible but not later than the effective date of this section for initial training of each current employee who has not previously received training; prior to initial assignment for each new employee who has not previously received training; whenever an employee is assigned new work tasks, tools, equipment, machines or vehicles; and whenever an employee demonstrates unsafe job performance. When the proposed rule did not require initial training for each current employee, the proposed rule would have required training prior to initial assignment; annual retraining of each employee; and retraining whenever changes in job assignment would expose the employee to new or additional hazards. OSHA received many comments on the training provisions, some of which have already been discussed above in the Major Issues section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

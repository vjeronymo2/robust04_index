Delivering a report on the Supreme Court's work to the  ongoing session of the National People's Congress [NPC], Ren,  president of the Supreme People's Court, said, "Stability serves  as an important guarantee for reforms and economic development."    In 1994, he said, all courts will continue to unswervingly  crack down on serious criminal activities and better use  judicial means to regulate economic relations and protect the  legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, and improve  the explanation of new laws.    Reviewing last year's work, he said that, in 1993, Chinese  courts tried 3.4 million cases of all kinds, including 400,000  criminal cases, he said.    Courts meted out severe punishment to offenders of such  crimes as murder, robbery, rape, explosion, kidnapping and  roguery, he said, adding that organized crime was a prime target  of the law.    The top judge said that last year courts convicted 230,000  criminals on charges of seriously damaging state security and  disrupting public order.    Meanwhile, courts mitigated sentences for, or released on  probation, criminals who showed real repentance or performed  meritorious deeds in reform through labor, with 230,000  mitigation cases and 33,000 probation cases handled in 1993.    Courts at all levels speeded up the handling of cases  involving economic crimes after the government decided to launch  an anti- corruption campaign last year.    According to Ren, courts handled 27,463 such cases last year  and concluded 27,323 ones. They gave verdicts to more than  22,106 economic offenders, of whom 6,863 were sentenced to  prison terms of five years or more, life in prison, death, or  death with a reprieve.    He revealed that among the convicted were 69 county-level  and  seven bureau-level officials.    The top judge said that, in recent years, a number of  government employees, including a very small number of  officials, have abused their power to commit serious crimes of  embezzlement, bribery and diverting public money for personal  use, to public indignation.    Courts took as their main punishment target officials  committing such crimes who worked in leading bodies of the  Chinese Communist Party and the government, judicial  departments, administrative law-enforcement departments and  economic administrative departments.    With the growth of a socialist market economy, people's  courts are in a better position to regulate economic relations.    In 1993, the number of lawsuits involving economic disputes  rose substantially, with many new types of such lawsuits  occurring, he said.    Last year courts handled 890,000 such lawsuits of the first  instance, up 37 percent from 1992, involving a total amount of  70.5 billion yuan.    Furthermore, with the development of China's foreign trade  and marine transportation, the number of cases involving  maritime disputes has risen steadily in recent years, Ren said.    In 1993, maritime courts handled a total of 1,830 such cases  and concluded 1,607 ones. Courts at all levels also concluded  1,311 economic cases involving foreign nationals or residents  from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.    Ren Jianxin said that in handling cases involving foreign  parties, Chinese courts adhere to the principle of safeguarding  national sovereignty, fully exercise China's jurisdiction, and  protect, on the basis of equality, the legitimate rights and  interests of both Chinese and foreign parties involved in  accordance with international treaties signed or acceded to by  China and by taking reference to internationally accepted  practices.    "The prompt and proper trial of such cases is conducive to  improving China's investment environment and to promoting  foreign economic cooperation and trade," he said.    He said that, in 1993, Chinese courts attached greater  importance to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of  citizens and legal entities by various judicial means, and  handled large numbers of cases involving the right of person and  property rights.    Last year courts handled 2.08 million civil cases of the  first instance, 61 percent of the total number of all types of  cases of the first instance.    Of these handled, there was a sharp increase in the number  of  cases involving divorce, personal reputation, honor,  nomenclature, name and portraits, disputes over labor contracts,  wages, insurance, welfare and labor protection, debt, land  development, housing sales and real estate mortgage.    Meanwhile, courts also re-tried a total of 73,121 criminal,  civil, economic, administrative, civil and maritime cases that  had been given verdicts since 1949, he said.    They changed verdicts for 14,271 cases that had been proven  to be incorrect, he added.</p>

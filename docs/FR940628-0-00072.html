			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), we are amending &sect;195.228(b) to reference the appendix without further rulemaking notice. However, should any person be adversely affected by this decision or wish to change the final rule, that person may submit a petition for reconsideration under RSPA's rulemaking procedures in 49 CFR 106.35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule provides that the appendix may be used only for girth welds to which the appendix applies. For example, as section A.1 of the appendix states, neither welds in pump stations nor welds used to connect fittings and valves are covered by the appendix. Also, the appendix applies only to girth welds between pipe of equal nominal wall thickness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.234&blank;Welds: Nondestructive testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.234(e) requires that ``100 percent of each day's girth welds installed in *&blank;*&blank;* [certain] locations must be nondestructively tested 100 percent unless impracticable, in which case at least 90 percent must be tested.'' RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.234(e) to clarify that ``90 percent'' pertains to the number of girth welds that must be tested over their entire circumference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;195.234(g) requires: ``At pipeline tie-ins 100 percent of the girth welds must be nondestructively tested.'' RSPA proposed to clarify that this standard applies to tie-ins of replacement sections of pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The THLPSSC supported the proposed amendments, although one member thought part 195 should define the word ``impracticable.'' We did not adopt this recommendation because the word is used in its ordinary dictionary sense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three operators and two pipeline-related associations commented on the proposed amendments. Three commenters agreed with the proposal, one suggested editing changes, and one made a related proposal discussed supra under the heading, ``&sect;195.228(b) Welds; standards of acceptability.'' Although we did not adopt all the editing suggestions, these comments helped us provide clarity to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, one commenter thought the proposed amendment of &sect;195.234(g) was unnecessary because &sect;195.200 already indicates that &sect;195.234(g) applies to replacement sections. Moreover, the commenter thought adding the proposed phrase to &sect;195.234(g) would create confusion over whether &sect;&sect;195.234(a) through (f) apply to replacement sections. While these observations have theoretical merit, in practice, some operators have failed to recognize that ``pipeline tie-ins'' include tie-ins of replacement sections. The clarifying phrase adds emphasis where it is apparently needed to assure compliance with the full extent of the rule. Section 195.234(g) is, therefore, adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 195.246&blank;Installation of pipe in a ditch and 195.248 Cover over buried pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.246(b) is inconsistent with &sect;195.413(b)(3) for pipe in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets (See &sect;195.2 Definitions) under water less than 15 feet deep but at least 12 feet deep, because &sect;195.246(b) permits the pipe to be without cover or to be above the seabed if properly protected. Such pipe is a ``hazard to navigation'' under the definition of that term in &sect;195.2, and must have the minimum cover required by &sect;195.413(b)(3). In addition, &sect;&sect;195.248(a) and (b) are inconsistent with &sect;195.413(b)(3) for pipe in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets under water less than 12 feet deep. Section 195.248(a) allows pipe to be less than 12 inches below the seabed (i.e., a hazard to navigation). In certain instances, &sect;195.248(b) allows pipe to be without cover or less than 12 inches below the seabed. Neither condition is allowed under &sect;195.413(b)(3). In light of these inconsistences, RSPA proposed in the NPRM to amend &sect;&sect;195.246(b) and 195.248(a) and (b) to correct the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

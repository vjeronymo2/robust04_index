			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky has dealt with southern Slav developments, among  other things, during his visit to County Baranya. Csaba  Belenessy reports:    [Belenessy] On the occasion of his 15 April visit to  Budapest, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel confirmed that Germany  considered it very important for Hungary to become a member of  the European Union [EU] and NATO as soon as possible, said Geza  Jeszenszky. He added, however, that because of Russian  concerns, his German counterpart was more cautious in the matter  of accession to NATO. In the view of the Hungarian foreign  minister, these concerns are unfounded because NATO is of a  defensive nature; it is not directed against anyone. What is  more, if it expands to more remote eastern areas, the borders of  freedom and well-being in Europe will extend further, and this  could have a very beneficial effect on Russia's security and  economic revival.    In his address Geza Jeszenszky paid particular attention to  the Balkan crisis. He said that Hungary could be proud of the  fact that, among the Yugoslav successor states, it has very good  relations with Slovenia and the friendly Hungarian-Croatian  relationship, which has its roots in the historical past, has  been restored.    He stressed that Hungarian foreign policy had not taken  hostile steps against Serbia; on the contrary, it had chosen the  best possible path. This is recognized by Belgrade too, since  January; as a result, the hatchet has been buried. [passage  omitted]    One of the basic conditions of a just resolution of the  Yugoslav crisis, Geza Jeszenszky emphasized, is that Croatian  Baranja [under Serb control] should be freed from the rule of  foreign armed men who settled there and that those who had been  driven away should be able to return there. Referring to this,  Geza Jeszenszky mentioned not only the Croatians and the  Hungarians, but also those Serbs who, before the war, had  constituted 23 percent of the population.</p>

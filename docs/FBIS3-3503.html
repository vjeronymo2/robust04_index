Xinjian, which was chosen as a site for the comprehensive  project about the control of insect and other pests, is a key  rice producing county.    With reference to the experience of field schools for  farmers  in Indonesia, recommended by FAO, local authorities will open  similar schools in line with local conditions in an attempt to  help farmers to deal with pests and treat diseases that endanger  rice.    No classrooms and teaching facilities are needed for such  schools: farmers mainly study through actual practice under the  guidance of experts.</p>

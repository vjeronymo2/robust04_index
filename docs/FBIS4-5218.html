			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hwang Sang-mo] </F>   [Text] Students who had restrained themselves from staging  demonstrations for some time took to the streets again to demand  renegotiations on the revised Uruguay Round implementation plan.    Approximately 5,000 students of 22 Seoul universities,  including Hanyang and Kyonghui Universities, gathered at  Chongnyangni Station, Chongmyo Park, and other places in Seoul  and held meetings to oppose the ratification of the Uruguay  Round implementation plan. The students called the revision of  the Uruguay Round implementation plan an antistate act that  would crush agriculture. They demanded renegotiations with the  United States on basic agricultural products. They also  demanded that the National Assembly not ratify the  implementation plan and opposed the adoption of the Morocco  protocol composed of implementation plans of each state  scheduled for 12 April.    Approximately 5,000 students of some 110 regional  universities, including Pusan, Chonnam, and Kyongbuk  Universities, held meetings this afternoon to oppose the  adoption of the Uruguay Round protocol and the National  Assembly's ratification and staged street demonstrations.    In particular, students of eight universities in Pusan and  South Kyongsang Province, including Pusan and Tonga Universities  declared a class boycott for today and tomorrow.    Most of today's gatherings were peaceful, and there was no  confrontation between police and students.</p>

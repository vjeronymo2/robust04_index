			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Japanese coalition wins tax cut victory Japan's parliament yesterday approved income tax cuts worth Y16,500bn (Pounds 104bn) over three years, in a move vital to bolstering the painfully slow economic recovery. This is a victory for the three-party ruling coalition at a moment when internal divisions have begun to re-emerge. It had to close ranks and force the bills to a vote in a parliamentary committee a day earlier, as a result of an opposition boycott. The tax cuts are to be followed by a rise in the unpopular sales tax from 3 to 5 per cent from April 1997, needed to adjust the government's shrinking income tax base to the increasing number of pensioners. The package, the most radical overhaul of Japan's tax system since the introduction of sales tax in 1989, will now go to the upper house for final approval. In theory, it should get through easily, since the coalition of socialists and conservatives has a majority in both chambers. Yet a new element of instability has entered Japan's balance of power during the tax debate of the past few days. A group of socialist dissidents has started to translate into action tentative plans to leave their party. Mr Wataru Kubo, the socialists' number two and leader of the dissident faction, is discussing forming a new party with potential partners in both government and opposition. Mr Kubo wants to create a small, centre-left group to hold the balance of power between the two conservative groups - the Liberal Democratic party and former LDP defectors - who now sit on opposite sides of parliament. Ostensibly, opposition parties say they are holding up tax reform to put pressure on the government to produce firm plans to cut spending on Japan's vast and powerful bureaucracy, a popular electoral theme. Opposition parties broadly agree with the tax package, since they proposed something very like it when in power earlier this year. But with the help of Mr Kubo's dissidents, they clearly welcome any chance to put the government on the defensive. Separately, the Finance Ministry yesterday gave a rare concession in a row with the postal bank, the world's largest savings institution. It allowed the postal bank to raise interest paid to ordinary savers by 0.03 percentage points to 1.35 per cent, where it stands more than a point above private sector banks' demand deposits of 0.25 per cent to 0.3 per cent per year. The Finance Ministry wanted a smaller rise, to guard against a shift of funds from banks to postal savings. The rise, while minute, answers the Postal Ministry's demands in full. It had asked for permission to raise rates in response to the small rise in bank deposit rates.</p>

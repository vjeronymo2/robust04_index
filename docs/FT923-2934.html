			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Univa falls 82% on flat demand and price wars UNIVA, Canada's second biggest food distributor - formerly called Provigo - continued to feel the impact of price wars, higher franchise costs and flat consumer demand in the second quarter ended August 8. Before special items, net profits fell 82 per cent to CDollars 3.8m (USDollars 3.2m) from the same quarter in 1991, on near steady sales of CDollars 2.1bn. The results reflected special gains on asset disposals, partly offset by restructuring charges. After these items, earnings per share came to 21 cents, compared with 24 cents. First-half net profits amounted to CDollars 24.5m, or 26 cents a share, down 27 per cent from CDollars 33.7m, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 3.6bn. Central Capital, a troubled financial services group placed under court supervision on June 15, will be 90 per cent controlled by creditors through a new holding company when restructuring of the group is completed. The remaining 10 per cent will be held by preferred and common shareholders, including Mr Leonard Ellen and his associates, who previously had 60 per cent control.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Japanese surplus 'nearing peak' Strong Japanese exports and only moderate growth in domestic demand for foreign goods produced a 0.9 per cent rise in Japan's current account surplus in July. The gap widened to Dollars 11.74bn (Pounds 7.5bn), a record for the month, from Dollars 11.63bn in July last year, roughly in line with market forecasts. Finance Ministry officials interpreted the result as further evidence that the politically sensitive surplus has started to peak as Japan and the US approach another critical deadline - at the end of the month - in trade talks. Adjusting for the rise of the yen against the dollar over the past year, the current account gap shrank by 7.7 per cent when measured in the Japanese currency. Stripping out sales of services, Japan's trade surplus rose 4.9 per cent to Dollars 14.45bn, but fell 4.2 per cent in yen terms. Exports rose 6.6 per cent in dollar terms and imports were up 8.1 per cent against July 1993. On average, import volumes had grown by 10 per cent since the turn of the year, reflecting a gentle pick-up in domestic demand, an official said. Exports had declined in five of the past seven months in yen terms, he added. The surprise in yesterday's figures was a sudden sharp rise in the outflow of long-term capital, to Dollars 20.85bn in July from Dollars 4.5bn in June. Mr Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, believes this is partly due to a surge in bonds issued overseas by Japanese companies, so that cash will return to Japanese hands rather than being recycled abroad. July's long-term capital account deficit also includes a record Dollars 8.99bn outflow of funds from foreign investors, who became net sellers of Japanese shares and bonds for the first time in 13 months. Foreign investors, previously the sole source of support for the languishing equity market, had provided a Dollars 6.66bn capital inflow in June. A ministry official said foreign investors were believed to have taken profits on the yen's rise and might be worried about the impact of the stronger currency on companies' export earnings.</p>

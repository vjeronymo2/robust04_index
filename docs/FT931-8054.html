			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: St Jonathan's Passion ONCE ubiquitous, Jonathan Miller is now at pains to distance himself from the opera establishment in Britain. He has consistently accused the London critics of malicious attacks on his productions, renewing his complaints in an extraordinary self-pitying interview published in The Independent last week. Now Miller works exclusively in the US and mainland Europe, safely out of reach of the slings and arrows of the London critical mafia. But he has been tempted back to London to direct a dramatisation of the St Matthew Passion, conducted by Paul Goodwin. The performances in Holy Trinity, Sedding's beautiful church just off Sloane Square, are certainly collector's items; fully staged versions have occasionally appeared in German opera houses, but here the Bach passions have a ritualised concert life, usually shorn of any liturgical significance. The object of this new version, says the programme book, is to make the passion 'accessible to audiences through its humanitarian and powerful messages'. There is certainly nothing extravagant about Miller's dramatic packaging; it is delivered in the round, with the two choirs (12 voices each) and the period-instrument orchestras grouped around a small acting area. Everyone wears casual clothes, the lighting is functional, props are confined to a loaf of bread, an apple and a glass of wine; there is also a table at which the Evangelist and later Pilate can sit. The chorus rises from its seats at crucial moments, grouping and regrouping about the conductor, while the soloists are more peripatetic; they migrate between the two antiphonal bands, break the circle or move to join forces with the obbligato players in the arias. The effects are approximate, the dramatic elements generally obvious. Nothing appears to articulate the parallel narrative flows of the action, to make a contrast between the Evangelist's story-telling, which is sometimes illustrated in mime, and the moments when the protagonists take on the burden of the drama themselves, in which operatic conventions might have been expected to apply. One hesitates to resort to the term, but the St Matthew Passion contains its own element of alienation, and any version that attempts to beef up its dramatic potency (begging the question of whether that is needed at all) really ought to have taken that into consideration. For a project that aims to make the work more accessible to an English-speaking audience it seems extraordinary too that it should be sung in German. In the end everything that Miller has added to the work seem purely cosmetic; none of his glosses draws the listener into the action or expose new layers of meaning, any more than transferring a production of Tosca to fascist Italy or a Rigoletto to New York sheds new light on those genuine operas. The greatest achievement of this particular passion is probably to convey the impression that everyone is consistently involved in the performance; players and singers watch each other like hawks, and the chorus takes an intense interest in what the soloists are saying and doing. That in itself guarantees closer attention from the audience, and the musical performance is a thoroughly decent one. Goodwin's effusive gestures convey a good deal of brisk common sense; nothing is allowed to sag or drag, the lean instrumental detail is always busy and pertinent. The choruses are young and involved; there is an eloquent, lucid Evangelist from Rufus Muller, a woolly toned but physically intense Christus from Richard Jackson, stylish accounts of the remaining arias from Nancy Argenta, James Bowman, Jamie McDougall and Stephen Varcoe. If the event is worth catching for its uncomplicated musicality, the rest has curiousity value only. Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, London SW1; further performances tonight and tomorrow</p>

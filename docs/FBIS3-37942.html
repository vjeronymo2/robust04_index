President Mircea Snegur said, among other things, that at  the  recent congress entitled Our Home, the Republic of Moldova, he  mentioned, as he had done before, the same historical events and  the need to preserve our brotherly ties, and, as he specified,  to stick to our kin.    At the same congress, he emphasized that the policy promoted  by the Republic of Moldova is consistent in all areas and is  linked to reality and the nation's desire to consolidate its  statehood and to develop as an independent state.    Speaking about the same policy, Snegur mentioned that the  directions of economic and cultural integration between Moldova  and Romania remain the same.    In connection with the Ilascu case, the Moldovan president  said that he prefers to act rather than talk and that his  intentions remain the same, namely to have these political  detainees transferred to the constitutional legal bodies of the  Republic of Moldova.    In connection with the meeting of the interministerial  commission, recently held in Bucharest, Snegur affirmed that it  has opened up very positive prospects for mutual economic  cooperation. It is necessary to speed up and activate tangible  relations between economic units; the meeting was assessed as  encouraging for the future.</p>

Commenters stated that, contrary to the exchanges' assertions, there are distinctions between the OTC derivative markets (including the instruments previously exempted by the Commission) and the contracts traded on the CME, CBOT, and other exchange markets. Whereas swaps and other OTC derivatives are primarily dispersed, non-fungible, privately-negotiated, principal-to-principal transactions in which individual credit determinations have been made about disclosed counterparties, exchange-traded futures contracts are traded among anonymous counterparties and on an agency basis in a public market established by a third party. Commenters in this category emphasized that an appropriate level of federal regulatory oversight of exchange markets is necessary to maintain market integrity, and, moreover, that the need for such oversight is not diminished by the exclusion of certain market participants since exchange regulation is designed to address the characteristics of that market and many regulatory provisions are designed to protect the market itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, according to some commenters, the ultimate and the appropriate regulatory structure for OTC derivatives is not settled; rather, Congress and financial regulators are reviewing the need for OTC derivatives regulation. Some commenters asserted that the entire derivatives market requires more, not less, regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. The Proposed Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In granting the Commission exemptive authority, Congress cautioned the Commission to use its authority ``sparingly'' and not as a way of prompting a ``wide-scale deregulation of markets falling within the ambit of the Act.'' <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  In light of this admonition as well as the advice of commenters, in particular that of other financial regulators, the Commission believes that the scope of the exchanges' petitions, which requested exemptive relief from most of the provisions of the Act and regulations for all instruments traded by sophisticated participants, is too broad. Notwithstanding the exchanges' assertions to the contrary, the Commission's previous exemptions for swaps, hybrids, and certain energy contracts, granted shortly after the Commission was provided with exemptive authority, <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  cannot be equated with the exchanges' requests for exemptive relief. The previous exemptions, which followed extensive periods of consideration of the issues raised by such instruments, <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  arose out of a need specifically recognized by Congress to enhance the legal certainty as to the regulatory status of those instruments. Each such exemption related to types of transactions that the Commission had previously found to be beyond the scope of the CEA or unsuitable for regulation thereunder because of the nature of the transaction, the parties, the applicability of other regulatory regimes or otherwise. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H.R.

Specifically, the Commission's consideration of an appropriate regulatory approach for swaps began in December 1987 with the publication of an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which addressed a number of types of off-exchange instruments and which solicited public comments on a wide range of issues. Subsequently, in July 1989, after a second notice-and-comment period, the Commission issued a policy statement which established a safe harbor for swap agreements meeting certain specified criteria. This was the foundation upon which the Commission ultimately adopted final rules in January 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's examination of a regulatory approach with regard to hybrid instruments also began with the same December 1987 Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and request for comments. Based upon the comments received and its subsequent experience, the Commission in January 1989 proposed rules to exempt certain types of hybrid instruments meeting specified criteria, and adopted a statutory interpretation which recognized an exclusion from regulation for other types of hybrids. Following an extensive comment period on its proposed rules, the Commission adopted final rules in July 1989. These rules and the statutory interpretation, together with the experience gained by the Commission in administering them, served as the basis for the proposal and ultimate adoption by the Commission in January 1993, pursuant to its new authority, of rules exempting certain hybrid instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, with respect to commercial contracts involving energy products, the Commission received inquiries concerning the applicability of the Act to transactions of this type following the issuance of the judicial decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Transnor (Bermuda) Limited v. BP North American Petroleum, et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  738 F. Supp. 1472 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). In response, the Commission in September 1990 issued a statutory interpretation taking the position that commercial transactions of this type which met certain criteria were excluded from regulation under the Act as ``cash forward'' contracts. Following the enactment of the 1992 Act, the Commission in November 1992 received a petition for exemptive relief concerning similar transactions. In response, the Commission published a proposed order which would provide exemptive relief to certain persons engaged in contracts involving energy products that meet certain criteria and, following a public comment period, adopted a final order in this regard in April 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In granting exemptive authority to the Commission under new Section 4(c), the Conferees on the 1992 Act recognized the need to create legal certainty for a number of existing categories of instruments which traded outside the forum of a designated contract market. These instruments were noted to contain some features similar to those of regulated exchange-traded products but are sufficiently different in their purpose, function, design or other characteristics that, as a matter of policy, traditional futures regulation and the limitation of trading to the floor of an exchange may be unnecessary to protect the public interest and may create an inappropriate burden on commerce. H.R. Rep. No. 978, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 80 (1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, the Commission does not subscribe to the exchanges' apparent view that there are no significant distinctions between dispersed dealer and central auction markets that would be reflected in assessing the appropriate level and manner of regulation of transactions undertaken in either forum or that should cause the Commission, in applying the exemptive criteria of the Act, to treat OTC and central exchange products identically. This is true irrespective of whether further regulation of the dealer market may be found, as a result of ongoing inquiries, to be desirable. The federal regulation of futures exchange markets dates from 1922. In 1974, Congress expressly expanded coverage of the CEA to ``all services, rights and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in,'' to assure that the prices generally quoted and disseminated from those contracts could be used as a fair basis for determining consumer and producer prices. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  To reflect the public interest in the appropriate functioning of price discovery markets and to assure market integrity and customer protection, a number of regulatory protections are currently required. These requirements reflect the fact that exchange transactions are conducted between anonymous counterparties and support the financial integrity of such transactions with marking-to-market, daily or more frequent cash settlement, segregation of customer funds, capital requirements, margin, recordkeeping and inspection rules, and clearing guarantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1a and 3 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 and 5.

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / People: Astec appoints Farr to take over from Tamke David Farr, 39, has been appointed chief executive of Astec (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company, 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US. He replaces George Tamke, 46, who becomes non-executive deputy chairman. Tamke, chief executive since 1992, was instrumental in improving the company's fortunes through a restructuring programme and by moving some of its manufacturing bases from high cost to low cost countries, particularly in south-east Asia. Farr says he will pursue the strategy he inherits from Tamke. The company has recently opened its second plant in Shenzhen, China and is set to open one in the Philippines later this year. Farr ran Emerson's mergers and acquisitions department between 1986 to 1989, overseeing the Astec acquisition. He was president of Ridge Tool, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emerson Electric, from 1989 to 1993. He has been based in Hong Kong since taking up the post of president of Emerson Electric Asia-Pacific last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME AWAY FROM HOME;  </P> <P> AN EARLY MIDNIGHT  </P> <P> Just before 4 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Linda Hall of Santa Monica will join many  of her fellow Britons in ringing in 1990.  </P> <P> Noisemakers in mouths, colorful hats on heads, they will count down the seconds  to the magic hour, and will join in singing Auld Lang Syne.  </P> <P> Because that is when it will be midnight in the land of their roots. They will  be at Ye Olde King's Head in Santa Monica, a pub that for 16 years has served  as a reunion center for many of the estimated 60,000 British passport holders  and 300,000 to 500,000 Britons who live in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> "In England, everybody goes to a local pub, not just for eating and drinking,  but to catch up on the gossip and to socialize," said Hall, an executive  secretary and British citizen who has lived here with her husband, John, for  six years.  </P> <P> "If you want a plumber to fix your place, you can either find one at the pub,  or else somebody will be there who knows of a good one."  </P> <P> Such typical British gathering places, Hall said, aren't at all like the usual  American counterparts: "Here (bars) are usually dark. A man goes there and sits  in a dark corner, slugs a few martinis, and goes home to face his wife."  </P> <P> She said she and the others at the King's Head like to spend time perusing the  newspapers brought in by British flight crews, and left around for anyone to  scan. Some throw darts, some browse the overseas soccer scores that are posted  and some drink British beer and eat bangers (sausages) for a taste of home.  DAVID LARSEN  </P></p>

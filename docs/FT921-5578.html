			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Coal contract talks near agreement: Deal may safeguard pits but pressure is on to keep electricity prices low BRITISH COAL and the electricity generators are close to resolving the deadlock over crucial contracts which will decide the future size of the UK coal industry. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, the privatised generator, said yesterday the negotiations were 'very constructive and moving forward'. He added: 'We look forward to an early conclusion. There may even be an agreement before the election.' Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal, agreed that a deal before the general election should not be ruled out. It could cover several years, make possible cheaper electricity, and ensure the future of British Coal. The two companies are understood to have had a meeting yesterday. PowerGen and National Power, the other privatised generator, are easily British Coal's biggest customers. But it is understood that National Power is further from agreeing terms with British Coal. The new contracts, which will replace existing three-year contracts on March 31 next year, have become a political issue in advance of the proposed privatisation of British Coal. The two sides have found it hard to agree a price and the generators have threatened to cut the 65m tonnes a year they buy from British Coal, in favour of cheaper imported coal. Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, is under pressure to find a compromise between a secure future for British Coal and low electricity prices for consumers. He has tried to smooth the negotiations by holding discussions with the regional electricity companies. But both generators deny he has discussed the contract directly with them. Mr Clarke said yesterday he was 'mystified and angered' by claims that British Coal was planning to close all but a dozen profitable pits in preparation for its privatisation. Mr Clarke indicated that the price in the new contract might be higher than the 150p per gigajoule, the unit of energy from coal, which has been suggested and closer to British Coal's present costs of 163p-164p. He said British Coal's costs could fall significantly between now and the start of the new contract, allowing the company to drop its price over a period of years. The contract was likely to be structured in two stages, he said, to give British Coal time to adjust. National Power has indicated it would like a price of around 130p per gigajoule, and has pointed out that the Scottish electricity industry recently imported 8,000 tonnes of coal at 100p per gigajoule. The political pressure to restrain electricity prices is already intense. Prices to industrial consumers are set to rise by between 15 and 20 per cent and in some cases more. Mr Clarke yesterday warned of the serious threat to miners' jobs by the expansion of gas-fired power generation. He said that by the mid-1990s gas-fired generating capacity would be equivalent to 21m tonnes of coal, putting at risk some 21,000 miners' jobs. And towards the end of the decade, gas-fired capacity could be twice that figure, Mr Clarke told a meeting of the Coal Industry Society in London.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Asda raises stakes in price war Asda has signalled that it intends to sharpen its strategic focus on pricing in a move which will add to competitive pressures in the UK grocery market, Robert Corzine writes. It wants to reduce one-off, promotional price cuts in favour of everyday low pricing. Such a policy puts pressure on suppliers to reduce their prices. This is the latest development in a steady drive to prepare for saturation in the industry by focusing on low prices and removing as many costs as possible.</p>

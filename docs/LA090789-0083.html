			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO P.V. TO WORK WITH EASTVIEW PARENTS IN SCHOOL SECESSION BID  </P> <P> Admitting that they are facing an uphill battle, Rancho Palos Verdes officials  are joining forces with residents of the city's large Eastview section to bring  their children into the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District.  </P> <P> "You must petition for this, but we can help you through the process," Mayor  Jacki Bacharach told residents at Tuesday's City Council meeting. The council  will vote Sept. 19 on a resolution supporting the transfer of Eastview from the  Los Angeles Unified School District to the Palos Verdes system so that all  peninsula youngsters will be in the same district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Task Force Proposed  </P> <P> Anticipating opposition from the Los Angeles district, which vigorously fought  a 1987 school secession bid in Lomita that failed, the council also proposed  that a task force of involved public agencies and residents be formed to work  on the transfer proposal.  </P> <P> The task force would include representatives of the two school districts and  state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) and Assemblyman Gerald N.  Felando (R-San Pedro), who represent the peninsula. It would also include  members of the East Peninsula Educational Council, a parents group that has  sought to split the district and prevent the proposed closure of Miraleste High  School.  </P> <P> The school board voted to close the east-side school in 1987 because of  declining enrollment, but the decision has been delayed pending the outcome of  legal action against the district.  </P> <P> Walt Yeager, president of the Rolling Hills Riviera Homeowners Assn. in  Eastview, said the community is not dissatisfied with the quality of Los  Angeles education but wants to complete the annexation process begun in 1983.  At that time, Eastview -- which constitutes 20% of the Rancho Palos Verdes  population -- came into the city, but the students remained in the Los Angeles  district.  </P> <P> They attend Dodson Junior High School and Crestwood Elementary School in Rancho  Palos Verdes, and San Pedro High School.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert Ryan and Jeffrey Younggren, president of the Palos Verdes  district Board of Education, termed the secession effort an uphill fight.  </P> <P> Saying the proposal will never survive the process of petition and hearings at  the local and state levels, Ryan urged that the city hire a lobbyist and begin  seeking special legislation to bring Eastview into the peninsula school system.  </P> <P> Younggren, who said it "makes sense" for Eastview to be in the local district,  predicted that the proposal -- which involves a predominantly Anglo student  group -- will run up against the ethnic balance criteria of the state Board of  Education, which has the ultimate say in whether a secession election is held.  </P> <P> A key issue in the unsuccessful Lomita secession was whether it damaged school  integration efforts. Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction,  said in a report that losing Lomita students "would adversely affect existing  desegregation programs" in the Los Angeles district and urged that it be  denied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number of White Students  </P> <P> Ron Apperson, Los Angeles district legal adviser, said the district's major  concern about the Eastview secession is that Los Angeles would be giving up a  substantial number of white students in an area bordered by ethnic communities.  </P> <P> "We are committed to a court plan and court order, and here you have a  substantial white population in a district of diminishing whites," he said.  "Our sense of integration would counsel the board to look critically at this."  </P> <P> School district boundary matters are handled by the Los Angeles County  Committee on School District Organization, an arm of the Los Angeles County  Office of Education. Its 11 members are elected by the 95 school districts  within the county.  </P> <P> Petitions to transfer territory must be signed by 25% of the registered voters  within the transfer area, and if they are held valid, the committee conducts  public hearings in the districts affected. A recommendation is then made to the  state board, which holds a public hearing and decides if an election on the  district change should be held.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Town Hall Meeting Planned  </P> <P> In addition to forming the task force, the council authorized assigning a staff  member to work with Eastview residents and will conduct a town hall meeting in  Eastview on the proposal.  </P> <P> Yeager said the residents, who have yet formally to circulate petitions, have  held off for years in the belief that they could not overcome opposition by the  Los Angeles district. But, he said, they have been encouraged by the success of  the east-side parents group in delaying the Palos Verdes proposal to close  Miraleste.  </P> <P> Eastview resident Craig Kelford told the council that his community can  contribute to that effort. "We can get 300 to 600 kids to Miraleste, . . . keep  that campus open," he said. "And don't turn it over to developers."  </P></p>

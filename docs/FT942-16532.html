			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential boost The life assurance sector included a number of strong performers, notably Prudential, up 3 at 320p and Legal &amp; General, up 8 at 473p. The latter were boosted by the recent recommendation from BZW, which rates the stock as its favourite in a sector offering a generous 35 per cent yield premium to the market and superior dividend prospects. Prudential's shares were principally driven by a recommendation from Hoare Govett who said the stock had suffered too much from investor worries about tighter regulation, alleged mis-selling of personal pensions and rather disappointing 1993 new business figures. Hoare said investors should focus instead on above-average dividend prospects following the cost-reduction programme, the re-shaping of the group's UK field force and strong growth in sales via intermediaries. 'The prospective yield of 5.7 per cent is unwarranted for a company that has grown its dividend since 1980 twice as fast as that of the average British company,' Hoare concluded. Shell Transport, which has lagged behind BP in the general upsurge in oil shares over the past week or so, outpaced the latter as a more positive view of the stock uncovered a stock shortage among London's marketmakers. At the close Shell, were 14 higher at 696p, having reached 699p earlier in the session. UBS, the stockbroker, was said to have upgraded its Shell forecast and triggered the early demand. SG Warburg was also positive on the sector. BP gained 2 to 373p but Burmah Castrol, reporting on Monday, slipped 11 to 815p. Enterprise was the pick of the exploration and production stocks, advancing 11 more to 439p. A big bought deal in Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group, left the company the heaviest traded stock on the London market with more than 63m shares changing hands. Shortly after the market closed it was announced that Lazard Freres Asset Management had sold 34.2m Spring Ram shares, made up of 29.4m 'old' shares and the rest in 'new' stock from the rights issue. The 29.4m was sold to BZW at 55 3/4 p and placed by the investment bank at 56 1/2 p. Kleinwort Benson was said to have been largely responsible for the good showing by Whitbread, which outperformed the sector to close 6 higher at 523p. Kleinwort said it expected a substantial re-rating to accompany Whitbread's results in May. Recent disposals have left Whitbread with the strongest balance sheet, healthiest free cash flow and best earnings growth potential of the big brewers, according to the broker. Board room changes at components company Laird Group, which also reported an increase in both profits and the dividend sent the shares soaring 19 to 388p. Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities believes it to be 'the best quality stock in the sector.' Industrial engineering group Triplex Lloyd tumbled after warning of a Pounds 3m loss for the year to March 1994. The shares were down 18 at worst before steadying to finish 13 lower at 133p. Broker recommendations made earlier in the week continued to help GKN and the shares added another 4 to 580p. Early weakness in New York imposed pressure on internationally traded stocks with hard-hit Glaxo slipping 9 to 604p on turnover of 5.2m after some heavy institutional selling by one US house, Reuters Holdings shedding 22 to 1927p and Zeneca easing 4 to 729p. SmithKline Beecham lost 5 at 370p in the 'A's in spite of positive news on its drug pipeline. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome rebounded from earlier falls as analysts decided that the full text of the Anglo-French Concorde study on AZT carried no new damaging information bout the anti-Aids treatment. The company insisted the full report showed that AZT did delay the onset of AIDS in symptom free adults. The shares, 11 down at worst closed 2 off at 555p. Turnover in business services group BET rose to 8m and the shares shed 5 to 120p, after James Capel was reported to have downgraded profit expectations. Conglomerate Trafalgar House's ordinary shares closed 4 ahead at 104p as Robert Fleming highlighted the attractions of the convertible stock. Mr Robert Gibson at the broker said: 'They offer a relatively risk free 6 per cent yield with only a small premium over the ordinary stock.' The convertible shares gained 6 1/4 to 132 1/4 p.</p>

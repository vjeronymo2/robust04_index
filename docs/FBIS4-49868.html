			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The Chinese Government  on Thursday [12 May] denied some reports that China has been  arranging behind the curtain a summit meeting between the two  Koreas.    In a weekly press interview here, Wu Jianmin, Foreign  Ministry spokesman, said China does not need to mediate between  South and North Korea inasmuch as there is a dialogue channel  between the two Koreas.    "The Chinese Government wishes to see South and North Korea  resolve their problems through their direct and constructive  dialogue and negotiations," Wu said.    Asked to comment on the report of North Korea's acceptance  of  nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), Wu said he heard nothing about it.    He added, however, that if the report were true, it could be  a welcome news. "It is in accord with China's consistent policy  that problems should be settled through dialogue and  negotiations between direct parties involved," he said.    On the remarks allegedly made by a senior U.S. State  Department official to the effect that China had assisted in  North Korea's missile system and nuclear development, Wu  rejected it as an "irresponsible and totally unfounded  allegation."</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Saving for retirement should be encouraged Sir, It is important to provide the answer - cut from my original letter (March 27) - to my rhetorical question on life insurance. In the context of the high cost of selling life insurance I asked: 'Why not simply leave the customer alone to buy or not buy if he feels the urge?' The point is received wisdom has it that the urge will be unfelt and the product unbought. While this would not matter if the product were a video recorder or a box of cornflakes, given the probable collapse of the state pension scheme it is important the public be encouraged to save for the unexpected and retirement.

He was speaking at a two-day meeting on the transform of  economic structure in the Mekong delta held in Can Tho city, the  Mekong River delta province of Hau Giang. The meeting drew the  participation of secretaries of the party committees and  chairmen of the people's committees of 11 provinces in the  region.    On the transform of the Mekong delta's economic structure,  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that the construction of  socio-economic infrastructural bases is the foremost task aiming  at ensuring a firm base for the socio-economic development and  improvement of local people's cultural standards. At present,  he noted, the Mekong delta's infrastructural base is too low.    It was reported that each year this region produces over 11  million tonnes of rice, accounting for nearly half of the  country's total rice output. Thus more investments in rice  cultivation, particularly special rice-growing areas, are  needed. Furthermore, the Mekong delta provinces had great  potentials in breeding pigs and ducks, and planting fruit trees  and industrial crops. Aquatic products are also a strong point  of the region.</p>

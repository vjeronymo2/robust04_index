			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Socialist, social democratic  and labor parties from all over the world meeting at a congress  in Tokyo advocated Wednesday [11 May] that Japan and Germany  become permanent members of an enlarged U.N. Security Council.    "The Socialist International supports an increase in the  number of permanent members to include Germany and Japan as well  as a number of regional representatives, whilst ensuring that  the developing world is properly represented," representatives  from 63 parties and organizations said in a resolution.    The Socialist International (SI) currently comprises 111  political parties and organizations worldwide.    Summing up the two-day congress at a news conference the SI  president, former French Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, noted  that the Tokyo meeting aimed at listening to the concerns of  Asian countries and at strengthening the socialist movement  globally.    Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and representatives  from Bangladesh, Myanmar [Burma], Cambodia, Laos and India were  among the special guests at the congress which focused on  democracy and social development in the Asia-Pacific region.    Mauroy said the SI, given the rapid economic development in  the Asia-Pacific, must expand relations with free labor unions  to counter the excesses of "wild capitalism" and protect Asian  workers from the "great misery" that Europe experienced during  the industrialization in the 19th century.    Speaking at the same news conference, the former head of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) of Japan, Makoto Tanabe, who is SI  vice president, pointed to the congress resolution on Asia,  which singles out North Korea as a security risk for its  suspected nuclear weapons program.    "North Korea, which is defying the demand of the U.N. that  it  implement comprehensive safeguards measures, can never gain the  support of the international community," the resolution said.    The SDP has long maintained friendly relations with North  Korea. However, Tanabe said, "on these issues we express, of  course, our agreement to this resolution."    Tanabe called on Pyongyang to allow inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and on other countries  to intensify efforts to dissuade North Korea from developing  nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens 2% amid heavy index-linked sales Short of support ahead of Friday's meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa, share prices dropped on heavy index-linked selling and profit-taking by corporations, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 409.85, or 2 per cent, at 19,841.38, falling below 20,000 for the first time in eight trading days. The Topix index of all first section stocks slid 18.68 to 1,598.02, through 1,600 for the first time since January 28. Selling pressure increased in the afternoon as investors were discouraged by rumours that a leading monthly magazine will carry an article over a trucking company's allegedly dubious loans to Mr Hosokawa. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 20,236.32 and fell to a low of 19,650.97 in the afternoon session. Many investors were also sidelined ahead of the launch of the Nikkei 300 stock futures contract next Monday. 'There are rumours that some US investors will be selling the Nikkei 300 index to hedge their positions,' said a Japanese broker. Volume totalled 450m shares, down from Tuesday's 616m, and declines outscored advances by 915 to 168, with 104 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.34 to 1,321.13. Stocks recently popular on the multi-media theme were lower on heavy profit-taking. Fujitsu fell Y30 to Y1,040 and Nitsuko Y60 to Y1,540. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y28,000 to Y947,000. Some banks were lower on corporate selling, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank losing Y20 at Y1,940. Trucking issues were weak due to the alleged scandal involving Mr Hosokawa. Nippon Express declined Y40 to Y1,000 and Yamato Transport Y30 to Y1,180. Short term investors bought speculative favourites. Japan Storage Battery rose Y7 to Y820, Sanken Electric climbed Y36 to Y915 and Namco advanced Y60 to Y2,650. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 316.27 to 21,704.84 in volume of 84.2m shares. Kyocera, the ceramic chip package maker, shed Y230 to Y6,740. Roundup Pacific Rim markets were mixed as the Lunar New Year holiday season took hold. Seoul, Taiwan and Kuala Lumpur were already closed. HONG KONG ended firmer but off highs as early demand dried up and gains were eroded by late position-squaring. The Hang Seng index rose a net 49.87 to 11,504.03 in half-day trading ahead of the new year festival, which closes the market for the rest of the week. Expectations of strong results announcements by some blue chip companies later this month had stimulated the buying. Properties led gains, with Cheung Kong, the second most actively traded stock, adding HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 47.75 and Henderson Land ahead HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 53.50. SHK Properties receded 50 cents to HKDollars 63.50. BANGKOK was spurred 2.8 per cent higher as demand from local and foreign funds overcame selling pressure by local investors. The SET index broke above 1,400 to end 37.90 stronger at 1,403.63. MANILA's composite index climbed 42.48 to 2,995.33 as local investors bought selected stocks. SINGAPORE edged forward in thin half-day trading and the Straits Times Industrial index firmed 19.96 to 2,341.60. AUSTRALIA was depressed by profit-taking and a drop in futures, the All Ordinaries index falling 34.5 to 2,270.9. NEW ZEALAND declined, the NZSE-40 capital index finishing 4.53 off at 2,369.16. Telecom picked up 3 cents to NZDollars 4.91 after the 9-cent fall on Tuesday which followed its third-quarter results. BOMBAY surrendered 3.4 per cent as profit-taking whittled away at the sharp gains seen earlier in the week. The BSE 30-share index dropped 143.16 to 4,018.92. KARACHI was higher as blue chips posted sharp gains late in the day. The KSE 100-share index closed a net 9.87 ahead at 2,325.22, after dipping to 2,304.88 at midday.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE TOTOS, A HOLLYWOOD ENDING;  </P> <P> FILM: FRANCES SPENT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON FOR TRYING TO KILL HER STRAYING  HUSBAND TONY. FUNNY STUFF? 'I LOVE YOU TO DEATH' DIRECTOR LAWRENCE KASDAN  THINKS SO -- AND THE HAPPY COUPLE AGREE.  </P> <P> In 1983, Frances Toto, a mother of four living in Allentown, Pa., and married  to Tony Toto, a local pizza shop owner, decided to have her husband bumped off.  It was an impulsive decision, Frances said later, but not a capricious one.  Tony was cheating on her pretty much around the clock, and girls were starting  to call the house. "A body can only take so much," Frances explained.  </P> <P> After failing in attempts to blow Tony up in his car and ambush him with a  baseball bat (the bomb didn't go off and he chased the bat-wielding assailant  away), she hired two amateur hit men, who for $500 put a bullet in Tony's chest  after Frances first subdued him by spiking his chicken soup with sleeping  pills.  </P> <P> But Tony didn't die. He lay in bed unattended for four days with two bullets in  him (another of his wife's friends tried to help by shooting him in the head),  and he still didn't die.  </P> <P> "He was so full of life, you couldn't kill him," said Lawrence Kasdan, the film  director, who has made an improbable new comedy, "I Love You to Death," based  on Tony's and Frances' romantic troubles, now patched up since Tony recovered  from his wounds and Frances was released from prison. The two are living  together happily once again.  </P> <P> "This is a story about extreme behavior," Kasdan said. "The potential is there,  I think, for all of us to act in extreme ways. I wake up some mornings with the  most extreme thoughts, either good or bad."  </P> <P> Comedies about adultery are almost as old as drama, and murder plots based on  adultery have a long tradition in Hollywood running right up through Kasdan's  own 1981 film "Body Heat" and on to "Fatal Attraction." But finding humor in an  offended spouse's actual murder attempt is relatively unexplored territory --  and for good reason, some would say, in a society where rising statistics of  domestic violence are no laughing matter.  </P> <P> The opening credit that "I Love You to Death" is "based on a true story"  becomes a startling piece of information as the film unspools its farcical  scenario of the simple, devoted Rosalie, played with unfamiliar anguish by  comedienne Tracey Ullman, trying ineptly to arrange the murder of her  philandering Joey, the movie version of Tony played by a broadly Italianate  Kevin Kline.  </P> <P> "When they offered it to me," Kasdan said of the screenplay by John Kostmayer  -- the first script he has directed that he has not also written -- "they told  me this is a feminist movie: He ends up with a bullet in his head and it makes  him think. And what he thinks is that he loves his wife. To me what the story  is about is that their love was so strong, you couldn't kill that. Even having  tried to murder him, he still loved her. So there's a symmetry there to me.  He's too full of life to die and so is their relationship."  </P> <P> Producer Jeffrey Lurie, who arranged for the film to be made at Tri-Star  Pictures, describes the story affectionately as that of "a troubled but heroic  couple that was trying, each from a different perspective, to save their  marriage."  </P> <P> The Totos, who made their first trip to Los Angeles this week to help launch  the movie, say they are thrilled with it. "Most of the scenes are very real,"  attested Tony, a fit, sprightly man of 44 who seemed to be catching on quickly  to the Hollywood promotional spirit in his Italian-inflected English. "The  movie is great. It's fantastic. We love it. And it's a message for everybody:  Crime doesn't pay, cheating doesn't pay."  </P> <P> Which is not entirely true if you consider the money the Totos stand to make  from their participation in the movie, said to be close to six figures up  front, with a percentage deal tied to future profits.  </P> <P> Frances, who is 45 and somewhat less ebullient than her husband, said their  children gave the film high marks as well. "They were laughing at Kevin Kline  because he's got his (Tony's) mannerisms down fantastic," she said, seated  beside Tony in the library at the St. James's Club on Sunset Boulevard. "And  his accent and all."  </P> <P> Tony admitted that the movie is somewhat funnier than the real events that  brought him close to death and sent Frances to prison for four years after  pleading guilty to criminal solicitation to commit murder. He remembers, for  example, waking up in the hospital and feeling scared and worried. "I couldn't  understand why my wife did this? Was it because I cheated on her or something  else? At the same time I was praying to God, 'Please let me live.' "  </P> <P> Doctors in Allentown later speculated that the chicken soup laced with  barbiturates may have actually saved Tony's life by lowering his metabolism and  slowing the bleeding from the gunshot wounds, a detail preserved in the film.  </P> <P> The bizarre case of the Totos found its way to Hollywood via a story outline  prepared by two Allentown police officers familiar with the case, Barry  Giacobbe and Arthur Beers. Eventually, Ron Moler, the producer of the comedy  "Bachelor Party," saw the outline and optioned the rights from the policemen  and the Totos and brought in screenwriter John Kostmayer to put a comic spin on  the story.  </P> <P> "The comic possibilities were pretty obvious," said Moler, who convinced the  initially skeptical Totos to sign over the rights to him. "Tony was thinking  about a book, and I said, 'This is a black comedy.' "  </P> <P> "The idea of pumping bullets into somebody is not generally funny, and in fact  that's not what made us laugh," said Kostmayer, who also wrote the popular 1983  Los Angeles play "On the Money." "The humor comes from the contradiction  between what they (Frances and her co-conspirators) wanted to accomplish and  what they did accomplish. It's only funny because the consequences were  relatively happy for the people involved."  </P> <P> Kostmayer acknowledges that some viewers could find the material difficult. "I  think some people are going to react badly to the irreverence and the  Rabelaisian humor and the fact that the comedy is offered with the realism  intact."  </P> <P> The term "black comedy" is sometimes used to describe the comic interpretation  of otherwise dark or menacing situations, but the difference between "I Love  You to Death" and recent black comedies like "The War of the Roses" and "Shock  to the System" is its basis in truth, its proximity to near calamity.  </P> <P> Kasdan said he didn't know this when he first read the script. "I read it and  loved it," he said. "I thought it was sweet and touching." He also said, "This  is a story that once would have been on 'Ripley's Believe It or Not.' "  </P> <P> Kasdan has made four other movies in the last decade -- "Body Heat," "The Big  Chill," "Silverado" and "The Accidental Tourist" -- and considers them all to  have been risky. "Finding the right tone is the challenge of a thing like this.  Although it's a challenge finding the right tone with any movie. To what extent  can you push the envelope in either direction and still have the piece be  unified, whether you're doing a Western or a comedy or a drama. I think that's  true in a lot of what I've done. I thought 'Accidental Tourist' was very funny  but very sad too.  </P> <P> "Most of the comedies that come out of Hollywood aren't funny. We spent two  weeks in rehearsal to talk about what kind of movie we were making, what kind  of joke is acceptable. There are things that are different from the real story,  but the most outrageous stuff in the movie all happened."  </P> <P> The drug-dazed hit men, played by William Hurt and Keanu Reeves, apparently  were just as feeble-minded as they look on the screen. In a miscalculation that  spared Tony's life, the real would-be killers recited the Pledge of Allegiance  to each other at his bedside in an effort to remember on which side of the  chest the heart is located. (The gunmen still got it wrong and shot him in the  right side, missing his heart by an inch.)  </P> <P> "In a way, everybody would like to be as free as Joey," said Kasdan. "You may  not applaud his promiscuity, but what is appealing about him is that he has  this enormous appetite for life and sort of goes at it without much conscience,  you know? He enjoys every minute of his day.  </P> <P> "He's not an admirable character necessarily, but he's human. In less extreme  forms we all do this every day. I think this is what all the movies I've made  have been about, which is this battle going on between your desires and your  ideals. That's what 'Body Heat' is about. The guy knows what's right. But what  he wants is very strong and it overcomes what he knows is right. That's what  'The Big Chill' is about. That's what life is about to me, trying to reconcile  what you know to be the correct behavior with what you want to do."  </P> <P> "I knew it was wrong," Tony admitted at the St. James's Club about his  behavior. "Because of what it was doing to my family. But I just blank  everything out and just go on and kept doing what I was doing."  </P> <P> Frances, to judge from the movie, never thought to confront Tony about his  infidelity before leaping to her radical solution. Did she ever discuss it with  him?  </P> <P> "Well, I would try to," she said before being interrupted by her husband.  </P> <P> "She tried to a little bit," he interjected, "but I just said, 'Eh, don't  bother,' and I make up some excuse and she just gave up."  </P> <P> In the film, she learns of his infidelity when she spots him with another  woman, but in truth she never actually saw him with any of his girlfriends.  </P> <P> "Thank God!" she said.  </P> <P> "No, I never got caught," Tony said, with what sounded like pride.  </P> <P> "I had so many people call me and tell," Frances continued, "I think if more  people had minded their own business, we might have been better off."  </P> <P> But Tony immediately saw the flaw in this. "Well, maybe not. Because I would  have kept going and kept going and. . . ."  </P> <P> No telling what Frances might have done eventually.  </P></p>

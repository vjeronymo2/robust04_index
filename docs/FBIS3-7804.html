			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] At the session in Vyhne on 27 February, the  republican leadership of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] asked the movement's political board to discuss the  possibility of stepping up cooperation in the future with other  political entities. The HZDS is counting on its coalition  partner, the Slovak National Party, in order to form an election  bloc, and is also considering as its partners the Christian  Social Union, the Farmers' Party of Slovakia, and the Party of  the Greens in Slovakia. Preliminary talks have already been held  with these parties.    We asked the representatives of potential partners of the  ruling movement about the conditions under which they would be  willing to accept an offer for coalition cooperation.    Speaking on behalf of the Christian Social Union [KSU] is  Deputy Chairman Viliam Oberhauser:    [Begin Oberhauser recording] In a period when further  fragmentation of political forces is taking place, the KSU is  looking for possibilities to bring these forces together because  it is precisely this solution that Slovakia needs in the present  period. [passage omitted]    We have been engaged in talks with other partners--the  Slovak  National Party and the HZDS. We are open to everyone willing to  form an association on national and Christian principles and on  the principle of solving the social problems of the Slovak  people. [passage omitted] [end recording]    The resolution adopted by the delegates to the Second  Congress of the Farmers' Party of Slovakia, which took place in  Martin on 26 February, spoke of the party's willingness to  cooperate with the HZDS. Miroslav Makson, the party's deputy  chairman, outlines his party's position on this issue.    [Begin Makson recording] We are and we wish to be a  political  party of the center. From this viewpoint, the HZDS is  objectively the most suitable political partner. I think that,  apart from this fact, it is precisely the HZDS that has the  same--and on some points even identical--agrarian program as the  Farmers' Party of Slovakia.    On the basis of this fact, the delegates to the congress  arrived at the conclusion that the HZDS is the most suitable  political partner for us. The delegates themselves confirmed,  as it were, that the HZDS would do more for the farmers than  they have managed to do so far if the current political  situation were more stabilized. [passage omitted]    Just the attitude of the prime minister and HZDS Chairman  Meciar toward farming provides a certain political guarantee  that farming will gradually be developed. [passage omitted]  [end recording]    Our colleague Peter Turcik telephoned Jozef Pokorny,  chairman  of the Party of the Greens in Slovakia, and asked him under what  conditions the party would be willing to enter into a coalition  with the HZDS.    [Begin recording] [Pokorny] [passage omitted] Our condition  for a possible entry into a coalition or an election bloc--and  by this I do not mean just the HZDS, but also other partners  that have already approached us--is respect for environmental  protection, a positive attitude toward environmental  legislation, and the preservation of the state administration  governing the environment, which has been under discussion for  more than two years. [passage omitted]    [Turcik] Are you ready to enter into this coalition provided  the HZDS offer is actually finalized?    [Pokorny] I do not link this intention to only one  movement--in other words, the HZDS. We have received this offer  from the HZDS, but it is up to the party's membership to decide  on this issue. In no case do the Greens want to be  swallowed--and I can guarantee that this is not going to  happen--by another powerful party that talks about the  environment only before the elections and forgets all about it  after it has joined the parliament. We saw this happen in the  past. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

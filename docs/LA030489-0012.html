			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFGHAN REBELS FACE NEW PROBLEM -- SEAT FOR INTERIM GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Now that they have formed a government, Afghanistan's fractious moujahedeen  rebels are faced with the major problem of where to put it.  </P> <P> Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, elected Feb. 23 as president of what the moujahedeen  call an interim government, said it would be installed in Afghanistan within a  month.  </P> <P> Moujahedeen officials and Western diplomats say it is important that the  promise be honored, but choosing a seat for a government now based in Peshawar  in northwestern Pakistan is difficult.  </P> <P> "We have been discussing it for a week, but we haven't made much progress," one  rebel official said.  </P> <P> Getting the government installed inside Afghanistan quickly is important  politically for the Muslim rebels fighting the Kabul government, now bereft of  Soviet military support.  </P> <P> Last year, leaders of seven rebel groups based in Peshawar formed a government  under Muslim fundamentalist Ahmad Shah.  </P> <P> "Ahmad Shah sat in Peshawar and became a joke. Mojaddidi's (government) has to  demonstrate as soon as possible that it is not Peshawar-bound," one Western  diplomat said.  </P> <P> "Putting it inside will demonstrate that it is an Afghan creation and  Afghan-run," he said.  </P> <P> "Once it's inside, people can't influence it. Afghans will see it as theirs and  start to rally round it, I think," he added.  </P> <P> Finding a place sufficiently safe from which the interim government can also  communicate to the outside world is the problem.  </P> <P> The moujahedeen have captured five of 30 provincial capitals.  </P> <P> They are reluctant to launch all-out assaults on other main Afghan cities they  are besieging, mostly because guerrilla families are still inside them.  </P> <P> The rebel-held cities are either too far from Pakistan to ensure easy  communications with the outside world, or are vulnerable to government air  strikes and the Scud missiles Moscow gave Kabul.  </P> <P> Moujahedeen officials say they are under pressure from the Pakistani military,  eager to keep up the political momentum provided by the election of the  government, to take an eastern Afghan city as the government seat.  </P> <P> Jalalabad, a three-hour drive east of Kabul, is a possibility, but it has been  heavily reinforced by Kabul and its flat terrain makes attack difficult.  </P> <P> Western diplomats said the southern city of Kandahar is likely to fall sooner  than Jalalabad. But some factions oppose Kandahar, an area that supports former  King Mohammed Zahir Shah.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the most logical site is Khost, near the border about 80 miles  south of Jalalabad.  </P></p>

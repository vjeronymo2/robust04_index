			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / EC budget talks lead to fears over Irish union vote EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will today discuss new EC budget proposals that could disappoint Irish voters just days before a national referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union. A majority of finance ministers last week came out against a package of spending increases put forward by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. His plan for a 30 per cent increase in the EC budget over five years would benefit poorer countries in the EC, including Ireland, through larger contributions from richer member states. However, the Portuguese presidency is now proposing a compromise under which the budget would rise by the same amount but possibly spread over a longer period, following opposition from richer member states. The Irish government will be concerned that any display of rich country stinginess today might affect the result of its referendum on Maastricht on Thursday. Recent Irish opinion polls show a slide in pro-EC opinion, though still with a majority in favour of Maastricht. If Irish voters were to follow the Danes, who rejected it two weeks ago, the treaty on EC political and monetary union would be effectively dead. The Delors plan envisaged a steady rise in spending by a third from next year to Ecu88bn in 1997. The Portuguese presidency is proposing either limiting the increase in the first couple of years, or spreading the whole 30 per cent rise beyond 1997. Dublin's worries are shared by others, including Mr Delors, who told Irish journalists last week that Ireland could count on continued large cash benefits from the Community. But Mr Delors has represented his 1993-97 spending plan as 'the bill for Maastricht'. To get the treaty ratified in richer countries, Delors and the Portuguese presidency, have to accommodate the desire of richer states to minimise this bill. Mr Delors has a delicate path to tread, with one false step jeopardising not only the Maastricht treaty, but also his chances of being re-nominated by EC leaders at the Lisbon summit in 10 days' time for a further two-year term as Commission president. At present, he has no rival for the job. In its paper outlining options for an outline accord at the Lisbon summit on future EC financing, Portugal suggests that the overall spending rise might be 'moderated in the initial phase' to suit richer countries which will be paying in more than they get out of the EC budget. But the poorer countries  -Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal  - would still get 'a linear increase' in aid from Brussels. Portugal tentatively hints that the cuts in the Delors plan should come in spending on EC internal policies, though not in the new scheme for trans-European transport networks that might especially benefit the Community's poorer periphery, and on EC external policies.</p>

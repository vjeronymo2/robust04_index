			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 1ST DRUG DEALER CONVICTED OF PLAYGROUND LAW VIOLATION  </P> <P> A Los Angeles man who sold drugs to an undercover officer in Canoga Park was  convicted Wednesday in what prosecutors said was the first case in the nation  under a new federal law that sets stiffer penalties for dealing drugs near  playgrounds.  </P> <P> Oscar Gutierrez-Rizo, 19, was found guilty by a jury of selling one-third of a  gram of cocaine at Lanark Recreation Center on Lanark Street. He was standing  five to seven feet from the edge of the playground at the park, Assistant U.S.  Atty. Jimmye Warren said.  </P> <P> "The officers set up the operation there in response to numerous citizen  complaints of narcotics trafficking," Warren said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Law  </P> <P> Under a federal law passed in 1987, people convicted of dealing drugs within  100 feet of playgrounds, schoolyards, video arcades, colleges and public  swimming pools may receive double the sentence previously imposed, Warren said.  Consequently, Gutierrez faces a minimum of one year in prison without the  possibility of parole or probation and a maximum of 40 years in prison, Warren  said.  </P> <P> He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 2 by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon.  </P> <P> Before the law went into effect, there was no mandatory minimum sentence for  selling very small quantities of drugs, such as occurred in this case, Warren  said.  </P> <P> There have been a number of convictions under the same law for selling drugs  near schools, Warren said, but this was the first case in the nation involving  the sale of drugs near a playground.  </P> <P> A co-defendant in the case, Sergio Hurtado-Esquivel, who was with Gutierrez  during the drug sale, is scheduled to be tried in federal court starting today.  </P></p>

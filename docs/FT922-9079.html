			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Taxing times at home . . . - Expatriates DOES YOUR overseas home qualify as job-related accommodation? If so, and you maintain a residence in the UK - particularly one on which there is a mortgage - you could be in line for special treatment for capital gains and income tax. While you are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, you are not subject to British tax on any capital gains you may realise - apart from gains arising from assets used in a UK business. But a tax liability remains for resources which you intend to retain beyond the date on which you resume UK residence. This is particularly true for property. Your principal residence will be exempt from CGT and, while the basic requirement for full relief is continuous residence, there are special rules for expatriates. These provide that, if a property was your residence both before and after an absence overseas, and in the intervening period you had no (other) residence 'eligible for relief', your CGT exemption will be preserved even though you let the house in your absence. So, if you own a single property in the UK which satisfies the 'before and after' test, and while you are abroad you live in rented accommodation, you will face no problems. But the situation is very different if you do not actually purchase the property until you have been abroad for a while. Then you can satisfy the 'before' test only with difficulty, for although no period of residence is specified in the legislation, you or your spouse would need to take up residence for around three months to be sure of doing so. Even then, it is doubtful whether you can nominate that property as your principal residence instead of the one you rent overseas. A nomination can only be made in order to choose between properties occupied contemporaneously. But all of these problems dissolve if you live in job-related accommodation overseas. You are then deemed to be living in the UK home as your residence. While this treatment can be of considerable value, many expatriates may view the question of whether or not they are entitled to MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source) for up to Pounds 30,000 of any loan used to acquire the property, as one of more immediate concern. You are not disbarred from MIRAS relief merely because you are non-resident although it does then become difficult to fit yourself within the rules. Nevertheless, you will obtain relief if the property is used wholly or to a substantial extent as your principal residence - which means that you or your spouse and family must live there for six months a year or more. If, as in most cases, that is not feasible, you might nevertheless benefit from the provisions of extra statutory concession A27. This extends the relief to properties used as residences before departure overseas and which are expected to be so used on return. However, for all except Crown Servants, the absence overseas must not be expected to exceed, and must not in fact exceed, four years. The fact of living in job related accommodation overseas, plus the intention to take up residence in the UK property can come to your aid. In these circumstances, MIRAS relief will be permitted to continue without time limit. So what then is job related accommodation? For employees, it is accommodation provided by reason of your employment: where it is necessary for the proper performance of your duties; or where it is provided for the better performance of your duties, and it is customary for employers to provide accommodation for your job; or where there is a special threat to your security. But it would be a mistake to think that merely living in company property or having accommodation provided as part of your salary package, means it will be job related. The rules are strictly applied by the Revenue which will look in detail at each case. It is clear that if you pay rent for your accommodation, any claim that you might have had will be destroyed because the property cannot be said to be 'provided' for you. In practice, members of the armed forces, for example, should encounter no problems if they live in the accommodation assigned to them. Civilian workers who are accommodated in a company 'compound' should also succeed in showing that they live in job-related accommodation. But if you do not fit into these categories, be ready to prove your case. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T Fry Limited of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

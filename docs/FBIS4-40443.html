			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.M. Zaytseva, Crimean finance minister: "On </F> Currency Regulation in Crimea"]    [Text] The Crimean president's edict, "On Currency  Regulation and Currency Control," which actually does contradict  Ukrainian legislation in terms of a number of positions, evoked  an ambiguous reaction from official Kiev. In this connection  many of our readers are interested in why the Crimean president  was forced almost to enter into a certain confrontation with the  leadership of Ukraine over this issue.    The factors that brought about the appearance of this  presidential edict are explained by Crimean Finance Minister  L.M. Zaytseva.    The fact is, says Lyudmila Mikhaylovna, that as a result of  the establishment by the Ukrainian Government of a fixed rate  for the karbovanets many enterprises of Crimea that have foreign  partners, including Russians, were placed on the brink of  financial disaster. For example, a critical situation developed  with airline tickets in the Simferopol airport, where mostly  Russian air carriers are based.    They were prohibited from selling airline tickets for  Russian  rubles and the sales were transacted for karbovantsy at the  reduced exchange rate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Security. At  the same time it was impossible to buy rubles at the low  exchange rate and return them to their legitimate owners. But  the aircraft still continued to fly, taking a loss. Even though  in December the Crimean Council of Ministers adopted a  resolution concerning the sale of airline tickets for Russian  rubles, the situation has not improved, because Russian rubles  were still subject to mandatory sale at the same reduced  exchange rate.    In general, the exchange rate fixed below market turned out  to be an extremely favorable environment for destroying domestic  producers who were still capable of competing on the world  market. At the dawn of Ukrainian independence there was not a  single politician who did not emphasize that Ukrainian industry  exports products to more than 100 countries of the world; now,  to be sure, they try not to recall the times of the past Union,  when this really was the case. Exports from Russian industry  have fallen severalfold as well.    Crimea has ended up in an especially difficult situation. As  a result of certain events it has lost the Russian market and  has gained nothing except the karbovanets. In Ukraine only a  small part of the commodity output finds its way to the world  market, and the exchange rate of the karbovanets has been  scandalously reduced. In addition to all that, they immediately  permitted foreign economic activity without creating favorable  conditions on the world market through intergovernmental  agreements. And when domestic money began to rapidly lose its  value, there appeared the idea of introducing a compulsory  exchange rate below market for the dollar, but this was a  struggle with an effect rather than a cause.    As a result the enterprises, in order not to be ruined, were  forced to conceal foreign currency, and the already poor budget  became even slimmer. Yet the exchange rates of the world  currencies are changing every day. This means that our economy  is being artificially slowed down, while on the market it is  necessary to seize the moment.    But any currency is a commodity, and it is necessary to  handle the commodity in one's own way and carefully, and the  edict of the president of Crimea lays the foundation for this  civilized attitude toward the Republic's main commodity. In the  first place, currency revenues should be transferred to one's  own republic and not left in foreign banks where they will  circulate in the interests of anybody except Crimea and, in the  second place, the earnings will be sold not at a fixed rate, but  on the interbank currency exchange formed by the government.  Even now there are branches of 85 Ukrainian banks operating in  Ukraine and there can be no doubt that at the first signs of  political stabilization and the formation of a civilized  currency system dozens of Russian and non-Russian banks will  come here. Bankers are well-to-do people and they can afford a  good climate and peace. In any case, hope is inspired by the  fact that Ukraine itself (which previously declared that  Crimea's currency innovations were unacceptable) is following  the Crimean path and preparing a package of documents providing  for normal currency regulation.    Naturally, the creation of a foreign currency system worthy  of Crimea is not a simple matter and we must not limit ourselves  to the presidential decree alone. From the enterprises we are  already receiving more letters with proposals to simplify the  currency regulation system. On the other hand, certain Crimean  companies will have to seriously revise their foreign economic  activity and reorient it in the interests of Crimea. There is  no other way.</p>

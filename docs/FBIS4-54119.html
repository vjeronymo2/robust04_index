			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The Justice Ministry has  decided to simplify procedures for foreigners seeking permission  to live in Korea, including extending the period of stay from  the present three years to four years, officials said Wednesday.    The new procedures will go into effect July 1.    Extension of the period of stay will apply to foreign  journalists, missionaries and other religious workers, company  employees and investors in businesses, they said.    The ministry will also simplify the papers required to  invite  foreigners and other attached documents, the officials said.    In addition, the ministry will issue an approval paper for  visa issuance (a kind of letter of invitation) to foreign  science technicians, professors, religious workers and  businessmen. Until now, the paper had been issued only to  foreign interns for technological training here.    Under the new procedures, the approval paper could be  obtained from the ministry's immigration office by prospective  Korean employers of foreigners. Thereupon, Korean embassies  would issue visa to those who file approval papers.    Foreigners who wanted to live in Korea for employment  previously had to submit applications at Korean embassies for  approval from the Justice Ministry.    The ministry also required foreign religious or social  workers aged 50 or older to leave the country at the end of a  certain period of time to seek re-entry. But from now on, they  would be allowed to stay permanently.    Moreover, from July 1 the ministry will stop checking  departing foreigners individually and instead let them be  screened by automatic passport reading machinery. The ministry  plans to install 43 of the machines, initially at Kimpo airport,  with plans to equip all international airports and ports by 1996.</p>

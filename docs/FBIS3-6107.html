			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "A Pressing Demand of Time"] </F>   [Text] The South Korean people, human rights organizations  of many countries, and international organizations are raising  their voice demanding the abolition of the South Korean puppets'  National Security Law.    According to Seoul radio, in a meeting of the UN Human  Rights  Committee recently held in Geneva, many human rights  organizations urged South Korea to abolish the National Security  Law.    In the meeting, a U.S. human rights organization exposed  that  illegal confiscations by invoking the National Security Law have  yet to be rooted out in South Korea, even under the so-called  civilian government, and demanded that the UN Human Rights  Committee investigate human rights infringements in South Korea.    Denouncing South Korea for still repressing the students  movement and imposing evil sentences by invoking the National  Security Law, the World Students' Christian Federation strongly  demanded in the meeting that the puppet authorities release all  prisoners of conscience.    On 8 March, a spokesman for the South Korean opposition  Democratic Party released a commentary expressing strong  dissatisfaction at the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's brake on the  abolition of the National Security Law, an antireunification  fascist evil law, and stressing that the party will push ahead  with the movement for the abolition of the National Security Law  to the end.    This party's position of strongly demanding the abolition of  the National Security Law was also expressed in a news  conference held by the party representative on 5 March. On the  same day, the Hong Kong branch of Amnesty International issued a  statement and said that it would carry out a movement of sending  protest postcards to the puppet authorities to protect human  rights of prisoners of conscience in South Korea. The Amnesty  International branch also demanded that the puppet authorities  release figures arrested on charges of violating the National  Security Law.    These facts show that the abolition of South Korea's  National  Security Law is unvaryingly demanded not only by the South  Korean people but also by the people of the world and that this  is the most pressing issue that can be no longer delayed.    As everybody knows, the so-called National Security Law of  South Korea is an old remnant of the military fascist  dictatorship and an evil, antireunification and fascist law that  is the most savage and malicious in the world.    The National Security Law defines us fellow countrymen as an  antistate body and enemy, so that those who support and admire  us or even mention a word regarding the fatherland's  reunification are subject to punishment, and so that the just  struggle by youth, students, and people for the independence and  democracy of South Korean society become an object of oppression.    Tens of thousands of youth, students, and people have been  punished for carrying out the just struggle of demanding  independence, democracy, and reunification. Countless numbers  of people died on the scaffold. Today, many prisoners behind  bars with long-term sentences suffer inhumane torture in South  Korea.    It is no accident that the Amnesty International pointed out  on 9 March that South Korean incarcerates prisoners for longer  terms than any place in the world, such as Kim Son-myong and An  Hak-sam, who have been confined in jail since the Korean war.    Moreover, even with a civilian mask, the Kim Yong-sam puppet  regime not only maintain the National Security Law but also  abuse it to oppress with more cruelty the South Korean people's  just struggle for independence, democracy, and the  reunification, to block North-South dialogue, and to amplify  confrontation, not reconciliation or unity between the North and  the South.    Last year, the Kim Yong-sam groups blocked dialogue between  youth, students, and people of the North and South -- including  the meeting between youth and students of the North and South in  Panmunjom on 12 June and the Fourth Pannational Rally -- by  applying the National Security Law. Even this year, it blocked  representatives of the Chondoist religion in the North and South  from holding a working-level contact in Panmunjom to discuss  joint celebration of the 100th anniversary of the peasant war in  1894. Also, it has indiscriminately suppressed South Korean  youth, students, and people who want to hold dialogue with us.    All these facts prove that the South Korean people cannot  enjoy their democratic freedom and rights nor achieve their  social independence and national reunification because of the  existing National Security Law. Therefore, the South Korean  people and the people throughout the world have strongly called  for the abolition of the National Security Law, an evil  antireunification, fascist law, which cannot be found anywhere  else in the world.    Amnesty International has exposed and denounced the acts of  the South Korean puppets who are viciously infringing upon their  people's human rights without abolishing the National Security  Law. However, the South Korean puppets will say that they regret  hearing Amnesty International's denouncement and will find an  excuse.    Such acts by the South Korean puppets show that they will  continue to brutally suppress the patriotic people in South  Korea without abolishing the National Security Law. Therefore,  their acts are unforgivable and become challenges to the voices  of the people at home and abroad who call for the abolition of  the National Security Law    If the Kim Yong-sam groups fail to listen to the voices of  the people at home and abroad -- which have reflected the  demands of the times -- but instead continue to embark upon the  road of betrayal, they will not avoid a greater denouncement  from the people.    The Kim Yong-sam groups must clearly see the trends of the  times and immediately abolish the National Security Law as  demanded by the people.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Babcock back in the black with Pounds 2.83m Babcock International, the engineering contractor, materials handling and facilities management group, returned to profit in the half year to September 30, but is again omitting its interim dividend. The group, which is in the first few months of a three-year restructuring plan, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.83m, compared with losses of Pounds 9.18m. Mr John Parker, chairman, said the modest profit was in line with the corporate plan, which was on schedule, and profitability would improve in the second half. However, higher then expected losses in the group's main problem area, its energy division, caused analysts to downgrade full-year profit forecasts. Turnover fell from Pounds 413m to Pounds 349m, partly reflecting the contraction of the energy division and reduced revenues from Babcock's Drax flue gas desulphurisation contract for National Power, now approaching completion. The group order book fell from Pounds 608m to a 'satisfactory' level of Pounds 569m, which excludes the Pounds 100m-plus refit contract for HMS Superb, to be handled by the Rosyth Royal dockyard. The loss at the energy division was reduced to Pounds 6.85m (Pounds 13.7m), on turnover down from Pounds 178m to Pounds 108m. Its restructuring was proving to be tough and demanding, said Mr Parker, and had required wider management changes than originally envisaged. Additional costs have been identified on some older contracts and there was no gross margin on about Pounds 25m turnover elsewhere. Also, tendering costs were heavy, as winning a large power plant order remained a priority. Babcock is awaiting decisions on 14 big power plant tenders, and - in consortium - is one of four groups bidding for National Power's Pembroke FGD contract. That would be worth about Pounds 100m to Babcock, said Mr Nick Salmon, chief executive. The best performing division was facilities management, where profits were Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.2m) on turnover of Pounds 98.1m (Pounds 101m). Babcock is the sole bidder for Rosyth dockyard, where it has a management contract until March 1996. Mr Parker said Babcock Rosyth Defence, as the dockyard operator, could end up leasing the facilities from Rosyth 2000, a consortium of which it is a member. The consortium is a separate initiative from the proposed privatisation. Net cash at September 30 was higher than expected at Pounds 53.7m (Pounds 10m debt). Earnings per share were 0.17p (1.59p losses). COMMENT This was always going to be a transitional year for Babcock, with its new management team and strategy. The more optimistic full-year forecasts, of as much as Pounds 25m pre-tax - against a Pounds 41.2m loss - implied that the energy division would break even, which is clearly wide of the mark. House brokers Smith New Court have revised their forecast down from Pounds 17m to Pounds 13m, giving earnings of 1p and a prospective p/e of 26. Shareholders, however, should focus on prospects for the following years, where the groundwork for a solid recovery in profits and dividends has been laid. The dividend question will be reviewed at the year-end.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry  will announce over the weekend a reshuffle of Army and Air Force  officers affecting eight to 10 Army two- and three-star  officers, informed sources said Friday.    The first military personnel changes by Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae, the Army reshuffle will likely involve the discharge  of three- and four-star generals who were members of the defunct  Hana- hoe, a private politically motivated club of some Korean  military academy-graduated officers once led by Former  Presidents Chon Tu- hwan and No Tae-u.    Of the one- and two-star Hana-hoe members, some major  generals will be discharged from active service and the  remaining major and brigadier generals will be dismissed from  important staff and division command posts.    The scope of the Army reshuffle will depend on whether Gen.  Kim Chae-chang, deputy commander of the combined ROK-U.S. Forces  Command, is discharged for his links with Hana-hoe, the sources  said.</p>

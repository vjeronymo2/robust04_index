			<p>BFN     [Text] Khun Sa has mobilized his forces to encircle  Burmese Government troops and is trying to recapture Chot Town.  In the ensuing battle four Khun Sa soldiers were killed, at  least 15 Burmese soldiers were believed killed, and there were  many casualties. The latest report says that Khun Sa's men have  succeeded in recapturing five bases.    Shan State, 11 May--Four days ago Burmese Government forces  attacked a Khun Sa stronghold and captured seven military bases  on Doi Hinpong, opposite Thailand's Wiang Haeng District, Chiang  Mai province. On the day of the loss of the bases, the Khun Sa  troops encircled the Burmese soldiers in the captured bases,  triggering heavy fighting along the Thai-Burmese border opposite  Thailand's Ban Piang Luang, Wiang Haeng District.    A report says the 250-strong Khun Sa force attacked the  Burmese Government force in the bases on Doi Hinpong in Chot  Town, about 20 km from the Thai border and recaptured five of  the bases.    A report on the fighting by the Thai Task Force 327 in Wiang  Haeng District said four Khun Sa soldiers were killed and many  wounded. Some of the wounded were taken for treatment to a  hospital in Ban Maisung, a Khun Sa liberated area. Some were  sent to the district hospital in Wiang Haeng District. The  casualties on the Burmese Government side were estimated at no  less than 15 killed.    According to Prince Khunduan Saengkham, the secretary  general  of the Shan State restoration council, the Khun Sa soldiers have  been deployed in Tuan and Chang Towns and have completely  encircled Chot Town. An attack on the Burmese Government  soldiers was expected soon.    The prince said: "We have hired about 20 small buses in Ban  Piang Luang to transport soldiers to reinforce the front line  and move the wounded soldiers to the district hospital in Wiang  Haeng District."</p>

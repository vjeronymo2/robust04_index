The Final Dark Canyon EIS analyzes the impacts on the environment from reasonable foreseeable development of oil and gas resources within Dark Canyon, located in Eddy County, NM. The EIS analyzes seven alternatives, including the no action alternative and the Applicant's (Yates Energy Corporation) proposed action to drill the Diamondback Federal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 1 Well on Federal Lease NM&hyph;62161. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ROD documents the Bureau's decision to select Alternative G (the Preferred Alternative) of the Final EIS. The Decision approves the Applicant's proposed Diamondback Federal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 Well, with the location moved 300 meters to the northeast and establishes a ``Cave Protection Zone'' (CPZ) within the EIS Study Area that would prohibit surface occupancy on existing leases. Drilling would be allowed within the EIS Study Area, but outside the CPZ, with enhanced precautionary operations. Future leasing would be denied within the EIS Study Area. By Memorandum of August 13, 1993, the National Park Service (NPS) concurred with the BLM in the selection of the agency's Preferred Alternative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Dark Canyon EIS Study Area encompasses approximately 8,320 acres and lies about 20 miles southwest of the city of Carlsbad, NM. The EIS Study Area is in the BLM's Carlsbad Resource Area and totally encompasses the Dark Canyon Special Management Area, noted for its rugged and scenic landscape as well as cave resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BLM was the lead agency for preparation of the EIS, because the BLM is responsible for permitting oil and gas exploration on federal mineral estate. The NPS, Southwest Region, was a cooperating agency for preparation of the EIS because the Study Area borders Carlsbad Caverns National Park to the south, and because the alternatives described in the EIS could affect NPS cave resources, particularly Lechuguilla Cave. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Questions or concerns on this ROD can be directed to: BLM, New Mexico State Office, ATTN: Joe Incardine (NM&hyph;911), P.O.

A formal public hearing was held on the Draft EIS to receive oral and written comments on the adequacy of the Draft EIS and the merits of the alternatives discussed in Carlsbad, NM, on October 22, 1992. The public comment period for the Draft EIS closed on November 20, 1992. The Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 18, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following issuance of the Draft EIS to the public, over 1,000 comments were received by the BLM and were analyzed and considered in the preparation of the Final EIS. During preparation of the Final EIS, additional formal and informal meetings were held with interested publics and agencies to develop additional information and new alternatives for the proposal based on the public comment received on the Draft EIS. These meetings included an informal open house and public meeting held in Carlsbad, NM, on May 27, 1993, to inform the public of the progress on the project, including development of two additional alternatives and additional scientific data to be used in the analysis of impacts and development of mitigation measures. The Final EIS was released to the public and filed with EPA on December 17, 1993, with over 800 copies mailed out to agencies, organizations and the general public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the end of the 30-day availability period for the Final EIS, the ROD was prepared and signed by the BLM New Mexico Acting State Director on January 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William C.

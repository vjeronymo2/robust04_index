			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station editor (Wang Huiqing): "Seize the </F> Opportunity and Lift Restrictions on Three Direct Links"; from  the "News and Current Events" program]    [Text] Three major events in the mainland's diplomatic  relationship occurred at the end of 1993 and the beginning of  1994. The first major event was the Sino-U.S. summit, e.g. the  meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton in Seattle, United  States, the first such meeting in five years; the second being  the joint communique issued by the Chinese and French  Governments on the resumption of the traditional friendly  relationship between the two sides; the third major event, which  occurred a little bit earlier, was German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl's leading a 200-member delegation to China. The three  astounding major events came on the heels of each other.  International media is of the view that there will be a global  China craze. Economy is the foundation of politics. Diplomacy  is like a piece of mirror which reflects a nation's interests.  The brilliant achievements that the mainland has scored over  the past 15 years of reform and opening up shows the world that  in addition to recognizing China as a political power, they  should not ignore China's economic vitality and potentials. If  major Western powers want to shake off recession and develop  their economies, they cannot afford to neglect the thriving land  of China. The attraction of China's economy has forced some  Western nations to change their policy: from a policy that tried  to isolate and impose sanctions on China to a policy that seeks  detente, cooperation, and friendly exchange with China. While  Western economies failed to stage a comeback last year, Asian  economies thrived and enjoyed an economic growth rate of 7  percent. In particular, Mainland China topped the world's  growth rate at 13 percent. At the same time, Mainland China has  become a country that has attracted the most foreign capital. On  1 January this year, and with the rising of the red sun, five  new sets of tax law were simultaneously put into force.  Following that, reform on the foreign exchange was carried out.  Various reform measures and laws and regulations in the areas  of finance, taxation, foreign trade, and enterprises will be  introduced this year. Unlike in the past, reform measures,  along with other supplementary reform measures, will be  comprehensively carried out this year, thus forming a systematic  project. This shows that following an accumulation of 11 years  of experience, the policy of reform and opening up has entered a  mature stage. With the heralding in of 1994, the mainland will  provide an improved and ideal environment for foreigners who  come to the mainland for economic and trade cooperation.    The economic and trade exchanges between Taiwan and the  mainland, due to rapid development over the years, have become  the most active part of all exchanges between the two sides of  the strait. As of last year, the number of companies and  enterprises that Taiwan businessmen established on the mainland  reached some 15,000, with a promised investment amount of over  $13 billion and an actual investment amount of over $6 billion,  thus exceeding the combined investment amount of previous years  and catapulting Taiwan into second place in the number of  foreign-funded enterprises. The cross-strait trade amount has  exceeded $12 billion.    Amid the surging tide of economy and trade, Taiwan  authorities did lift some restrictions and make some  relaxations. However, the cross-strait economic and trade  relationship is still unable to cross a hurdle. Over the years,  economic exchanges between the two sides, due to different  attitudes, have always tended to be active on the one side and  passive on the other. Obstacles abound in the course of  progress. On the island, the authorities have always dragged  their feet and the private circles have always prodded the  authorities to advance; the authorities are unable to keep up  with the pace of private circles. At a time when the mainland's  economic situation is progressing by leaps and bounds and is  attracting a large infusion of capital from the world,  businessmen and well- informed people realize the pressing  situation and strongly call on the Taiwan authorities to change  their present mainland policy. Recently, articles published in  several big and influential Taiwan newspapers pointed out that  at a time when the world's economic structure is undergoing a  realignment, the mainland occupies a pivotal position. Japan  and the United States have already unveiled their new China  policies. Taiwan should follow suit. Some economic officials  also suggested this to the authorities, noting that Taiwan,  after World War II, knew how to seize the opportunity presented  in world stability and created its economic development. This  time, if Taiwan is able to seize the opportunity of the  mainland's reform, it will enable Taiwan to carry out a smooth  readjustment of its industrial structure. Some scholars even  bluntly pointed out that if Taiwan sets self-imposed limitations  because of political factors and lets foreign countries get a  headstart, Taiwan will lose a great chance for investment,  cooperation, and development. Taiwan would also be helping its  own business rivals. There is a saying: making an erroneous  step, you will lag behind others for 100 years.    Faced with such a situation, how should the Taiwan  authorities act? It will help nothing if they just sigh and  live in regret. Opportunity, once missed, will not come back.  The most practical thing for the authorities to do is to  resolutely lift the restrictions on the three direct links, so  as to bring about a breakthrough development of the cross-strait  relationship in the new year.</p>

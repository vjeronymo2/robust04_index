			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] There is still no consensus on the proposed special  congress to interpret the Constitution and decide whether a  popular consultation on constitutional reforms should be held.    Maria Eugenia Lima, deputy for Chimborazo, said that the 52  signatures needed to make the special congress official have not  yet been obtained.    [Begin Lima recording] One serious problem is that [words  indistinct], the required 52 signatures have not been obtained,  even counting the opposition parties and the one that made the  proposal. Anyway, the government has made several mistakes by  sending us proposals that cause a social commotion and aggravate  the country's problems. I think this mechanism itself guarantees  that problems will not be solved. [end recording]    Lima blames Congress President Samuel Brettini for the  Congress' paralysis. Lima added that the people are eagerly  awaiting 10 August, when Brettini will be replaced.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled article by political observer Yuriy Lepskiy under </F> the "Seven Days of Our Life" rubric]    [Text] All week people were telephoning the editorial  office from various Russian cities, and for some reason, many  asked one and the same question: Is it true that "Ostankino" is  being stormed? The callers had "heard" or "read" somewhere about  a new version of a Kremlin coup actively being discussed in  Moscow this week. Evidently, while the capital was discussing  whether or not "version No. 1" bore any relation to reality, the  provinces had managed to "enrich" the scheme with obligatory  elements which it lacked with, for examaple, the storming of  "Ostankino" and General Makashov leading the assault.    Personally, having always respected the reader, I even now  consider these telephone questions no more naive than the claims  of professional politicians that peace and accord will come  about in Russia as a result of the amnesty applied to the recent  prisoners of Lefortovo.    Terrible though it may be, everything or almost everything,  set forth in "version 1," which revealed the mechanism of a  possible coup, could in my view perfectly well have happened in  reality. I go along with my readers in not ruling out in  principle the possibility that Mr. "A" and Mr. "B" in the  president's close or broader entourage had arranged to remove  him from power by pleading the head of state's poor state of  health (was this not exactly what Gorbachev's closest entourage  did in August 1991?). Nor do I see anything remarkable in the  fact that some Mr. "C," expelled from the political Olympus for  lack of talent, grayness, and idleness, is not averse to  mounting a white steed and riding into the Kremlin....    However much the president's aides and counterintelligence  officials may go on about the absurd and nonsensical nature of  the false report that was disseminated, I know along with my  readers that it created such a ballyhoo because it too closely  resembles our actual life. Alas, political coups or attempts to  carry them out are becoming almost the norm -- people are  starting to get accustomed to them, as to snow in winter and  green leaves when summer comes. Hence, the mistrust of attempts  by the "opposing" sides to confirm priority for the principles  of civil peace and accord in our harassed society.    The political plot as a means of resolving contradictions in  society is evidently characteristic of our life even now.  Secret or hush-hush decisions by cabinet and apparatus are  another old standard in our political practice. Somehow I  cannot recall a broad discussion in the press and on television  of the consequences of increasing the customs tariffs on  imported food before that decision was adopted, and yet it  affects literally every Russian. It is a question, above all,  of food prices. Is quiet cabinet lobbying in the government by  supporters of Vice Premier Zaveryukha not a small "economic  plot" to resolve the problems of Russian agricultural producers  this year? Oh why does it not occur to anyone to organize a  "plot" or to carry out a "coup" IN YOUR INTERESTS AND MINE  [uppercase as published]? Why is it that, after all these  cataclysms perpetrated "in the name of the people," things are  no easier for the people themselves...?    The political coup is the natural offspring of communist  ideology. On 7 November 1994 that grandfather will be 77 years  old. In October 1993 his lively grandchildren -- let us  consider them so -- got up to mischief again. Well, where there  are grandchildren there will also be fun, while there is this  blood kinship, while this genealogical tree with its roots back  in October 1917 has not withered....</p>

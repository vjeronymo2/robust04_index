			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae sets record again THE Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings yesterday. The largest residential mortgage provider in the US made a profit of Dollars 381.6m in the first three months of the year, compared with the Dollars 320m it earned at the same stage a year ago. The first quarter was the busiest in the association's history in terms of the number of loans Fannie Mae bought from mortgage originators and the amount of mortgage-backed securities it subsequently sold to investors, the combined volume of which totalled Dollars 55.6bn. Previous record business volume was Dollars 41.7bn, recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Three factors in particular had contributed to the increase in earnings during the opening quarter, said Fannie Mae. The average net mortgage balance rose Dollars 5.8bn, in spite of a near-record level of mortgage portfolio liquidations, as homeowners took advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages. A rise of 3 basis points in Fannie Mae's net interest margin to 145 basis points also boosted earnings. Thirdly, guaranty fee income from mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rose Dollars 10.9m to Dollars 193.6m. The increase reflected a record amount of total MBS issues (Dollars 41.2bn) and a jump in total MBS outstandings to Dollars 389.9bn. Fannie Mae did not completely escape the affects of the recent recession during the first quarter, however. The company's acquisition of foreclosed properties rose 17 per cent to 2,238, primarily because of difficulties in the north-eastern states, where the economic slump has hit hardest. Consequently, charge-offs to Fannie Mae's allowance for loan losses rose slightly in the quarter to Dollars 56.7m, taking the total allowance for loan losses to Dollars 727.3m. Profits were boosted by a modest decline in administrative expenses, which fell to Dollars 86.1m.</p>

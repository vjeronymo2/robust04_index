			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Half of extra jobs 'have been lost' ALMOST half the jobs created between 1983 and 1990 were lost in the 15 months of recession up to the third quarter of 1991, according to Mr John MacInnes of Glasgow University in a paper on the north-south divide. Mr MacInnes says that in spite of the faster rise in unemployment in the south in the latest recession the south has almost 750,000 more people in work now than in 1979 compared with 500,000 fewer in the north. The north has lost fewer jobs in the current recession because it had less new employment created in the boom. He also says that governments in the 1970s created more jobs than the deregulating government of the 1980s, even including the large increase in self-employment. Several other reports on unemployment were published yesterday to coincide with today's publication of the February unemployment figures: A survey by Alfred Marks, the recruitment consultants, indicates that 55.4 per cent of companies have made staff cuts in the past two years while only 26.7 per cent have reported an increase in staffing levels. Clerical staff have been the hardest hit. The Campaign for Work argues in a paper from Professor David Piachaud that permanent unemployment of 2.5m or more in the 1990s will worsen social divisions and exacerbate the development of an underclass. The AEU engineering union yesterday said it had identified 33,000 job loses in manufacturing industry in the current year, representing a quickening of the rate of unemployment compared with the last quarter 1991. The Trade Union Congress yesterday published a report drawing attention to the fact that the government's own labour force survey has estimated unemployment to be 220,000 higher than the official statistics. It adds that in certain regions - the west Midlands, East Anglia and the south-west - unemployment would be 20 per cent higher using the labour-force survey definition. The least-affected job categories were visual display unit and word processor operators (7.4 per cent) and computer system staff (8.5 per cent). The most frequent method employed by companies to decrease staffing was natural wastage, although two thirds made enforced redundancies.</p>

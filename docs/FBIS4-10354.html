			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with PSD President Adolfo Jarquin by Walter </F> Lacayo Guerra; place and date not given; first five paragraphs  EL SEMANARIO introduction]    [Text] The way out of the crisis in which the Democratic  Social Party (PSD) now finds itself can be glimpsed, however  vaguely, in the distance, although without Alfredo Cesar and his  principal ally Guillermo Potoy included in it. The actions of  the group headed by Deputy Adolfo Jarquin Ortel have been real  shows of strength. A total of 29 of the 50 members of the  National Directorate (DN) appeared at the meeting called by  Jarquin to straighten out the political course of the party  previously headed by Cesar.    Ortel's followers reaffirmed their support for the proposed  constitutional reforms, the incorporation of PSD deputies into  the National Assembly, and reorganization of the National  Executive Council (CEN) as a result of the sanction which the  Disciplinary Council imposed on Potoy, Cesar, and Adan Morales,  who were removed from their posts for one year. The National  Directorate decided that new party leaders would be elected in  June and that those disciplined would not have the right to run.    The unanimous resolution of the National Council of  Political  Parties (CNPP) to resolve the conflict in favor of Jarquin's  group was the coup de grace for Cesar's bunch, which was to be  expected since the latter group's allegation was extremely weak.  After all, it was easy to see that the majority--no fewer than  29 members of the National Directorate--were on Jarquin's side.    Thus it is that Cesar and Potoy's faction exhibits a  significant weakening, not just within the PSD, but in the UNO  [National Opposition Union] itself, where leadership will now  pass to the liberals of Virgilio Godoy's PLI [Independent  Liberal Party] and Arnoldo Aleman's PLC [Constitutionalist  Liberal Party]. Cesar apparently ends up alone in the National  Assembly, without any party or bench. The defeat has crushed his  aspirations to become head of the UNO bench now led by Luis  Sanchez.    The CNPP resolution virtually creates a new social  democratic  party in Nicaragua. There is a potential opportunity to stand  out as a party that takes decisive steps to consolidate the  National Assembly's stability and its contribution to the  process of constitutional reforms could make it a party of the  future. Adolfo Jarquin granted the following exclusive interview  to EL SEMANARIO.    [Lacayo Guerra] What are your impressions of the CNPP  resolution recognizing you as the legitimate president of the  PSD and removing Guillermo Potoy?    [Jarquin] The National Council of Political Parties acted in  keeping with our party statutes because as soon as the  illegalities and arbitrary acts mainly committed by Guillermo  Potoy and Alfredo Cesar began, we went before national and  international public opinion to condemn that antidemocratic  outrage and violation of the statutes. A minority opposed a  decision of the majority to support the reforms of the political  constitution and not raise such false banners as the Constituent  Congress. The CNPP is the body that governs and controls the  activities of political parties and we must abide by its  decision. We logically expected the ruling to go in our favor  because we had the majority of the members of the National  Directorate behind us. Likewise, the majority of the rank and  file supported the movement, which has been seeking a way to  rescue social democratic ideals and ensure that our efforts in  Nicaragua would actively support democratization and the  establishment of a state of law. We also wanted laws to be  passed or adapted for society within an acceptable legal  framework enabling us to develop along the lines of social  justice and in a manner promoting sustained development of the  economy rather than merely grope our way along. We maintain that  in order to win we must judge, and the democratic struggle lies  in strengthening the institutions of government.    [Lacayo Guerra] Deputy Alfredo Cesar has claimed that the  ruling was rigged because the UNO is not properly represented on  the CNPP even though it won the elections. What comments do you  think such an observation merits?    [Jarquin] Cesar's claim is incongruous. He has been saying  that it is he who gives the new board legitimacy and now he  wants to maintain that the composition of the CNPP is not in  keeping with the nation's laws. What is incongruous is that they  did appeal a ruling by the CNPP to the Supreme Election Council.  I say that by lodging an appeal, they are tacitly recognizing  the validity of the Council of Political Parties. They have the  right to appeal, but Cesar has been saying that since there is  an appeal, the CNPP resolution is suspended. It is they who are  suspended, not us. One must abide by the law and the CNPP is the  body that governs and controls political parties in Nicaragua.  We must be respectful of such bodies and not resort to the  tactic that whenever something does not go in favor of any one  person, then one is accused of belonging to or being allied with  the government or the Sandinists. Such a tactic cannot continue  in Nicaragua. Here we must have sectors of national life that  want to advance and implement a national program to further the  democratic process.    [Lacayo Guerra] Have you had contact with the members of the  Supreme Election Council in order to defend yourselves, as you  have the right to do, and what resolution do you expect from  that body?    [Jarquin] We intend to pay the Supreme Election Council a  courtesy visit and hope the judges will review everything done  and the evidence provided by those of us who abide by the law.  There are absolutely no human rights violations or violations of  the political constitution. We continue to be right because we  have abided by the law. The problem is that when someone does  something wrong, he always ends badly. From the standpoint of  our organization, we have statutes that must be respected.    [Lacayo Guerra] The UNO recently issued a bulletin stating  that the real authorities in the PSD are Guillermo Potoy,  president of the PSD, and Alfredo Cesar, secretary general.    [Jarquin] It is not comrade Eli Altamirano, coordinator of  what is left of the UNO, who decides who has legitimacy. We have  government institutions for that purpose. They determine who the  legitimate officials of a party are and they must be respected.    [Lacayo Guerra] What does the future hold for the PSD? What  will happen to the group of leaders sanctioned by the party's  disciplinary council?    [Jarquin] We have entered a phase of strengthening our  structures. We maintain that what we are trying to determine is  how to get back on the social democratic path. The PSD had  shifted to the right and lost its identity. We have a role to  play in building the history of Nicaragua. When this party was  conceived, it was conceived as a party of the center left, a  viable alternative for Nicaraguans with aspirations to resolve  the problems of the country, which is facing social injustice.  We are going to put out a political manifesto defining our lines  of action, which basically number four.    [Lacayo Guerra] What are the four lines of action that you  have defined?    [Jarquin] The first must be to strengthen our country's  political stability. Second, we must contribute to Nicaragua's  economic takeoff. Third, we must expand and activate the social  democratic rank and file. Fourth, we must renew and broaden our  international relations. On this last point, I would point out  that we recently acted as observers for the general elections in  Costa Rica. We met with the president of the National Liberation  Party, Dr. Carlos Manuel Castillo, and even with President-elect  Jose Maria Figueres. We also met in the Dominican Republic with  Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, vice president of the Socialist  International. We have made different international contacts so  that this project will not be confined to the organizational  strengthening of the party and active participation in  parliamentary debates and specific political tasks. Rather, on  the international level, we want to find help and support of  social democratic friends abroad.    [Lacayo Guerra] What is the situation of your bench in  Parliament and its programs? Will you be integrated into the  Political Council of Benches?    [Jarquin] We will join the Political Council of Benches  because we have a great deal to contribute. We must not forget  that Parliament is going through a new phase in which we must  participate with solid criteria so as to strengthen that  institution of government which the Legislative Branch is,  drafting acceptable laws for the people of Nicaragua and helping  to strengthen the other branches of government. The political  action line in Parliament will be to seek reforms of the  political constitution. In that sense, while my party was part  of the UNO, we participated in a commission that engaged in a  dialogue with the Sandinist Front and we hope to participate in  the Political Council of Benches in a like manner. We want to  make our best contributions with respect to the Law of Military  Organization and other important laws that will be debated and  passed this year. We shall also continue to contribute to the  country's stability.    [Lacayo Guerra] Could you sum up your experiences in the  political battle that you have won over the other sector of  social democrats led by Alfredo Cesar?    [Jarquin] The members of this movement are young and  courageous members who, despite all manner of schemes used  against us, have held fast and put up a good fight. It was not  easy to face a group that is self-governing and that sets itself  up as the owner of truth when anyone opposing what they consider  to be the truth is accused of being allied with the government  or the Sandinist Front. I repeat: It was not easy. We were  looking for a way to contribute to the sustained development  that is so essential to the country. We shall be guided by the  thought that it must be Nicaragua that emerges as the winner.    [Lacayo Guerra] In quantitative terms, what is the  composition of your bench?    [Jarquin] Right now we have four deputies, without counting  the two persons sanctioned by the party, Alfredo Cesar and Adan  Morales, but we shall soon increase that number to six.    [Lacayo Guerra] Who are the other two?    [Jarquin] We are waiting for the right time to move ahead.  We  are involved in talks with them and for the time being I prefer  not to divulge their names.    [Lacayo Guerra] You have said that the crisis in your party  occurred because a majority group wants to make reforms in the  constitution. Do you have a proposal?    [Jarquin] No, we have no proposal, but I personally  participated in the drafting of a joint proposal between the  Sandinist Front and what was the UNO at the time.    [Lacayo Guerra] That FSLN-UNO proposal was thwarted and only  the Sandinist Front signed it. Do you still agree with the  spirit of that document?    [Jarquin] I agree with the document. I believe there are  certain points requiring further discussion since we cannot  close our minds to any potential debate. I am specifically  referring to international economic agreements. Their approval  must be subject to the participation of other sectors, not just  the National Assembly.    [Lacayo Guerra] What is your view of the impossibility of  reelecting the president and the ban on relatives of the  president being candidates?    [Jarquin] I do not think we can give first or last names to  a  restriction because we are talking about legislation for the  nation, for the future. Let us remember that the constitution  governs all Nicaraguans. It is not a matter of closing the door  to other persons because of political desirability. Some groups  say there must be no reelection at all. I am of the opinion that  it should be allowed in alternate periods, but I would like to  hear all opinions and learn the experience of other countries.  Costa Rica has no reelection, but I realize that there is a  struggle to reform the constitution in that country to allow  such reelection. It is argued that four years is a very short  time for a president to carry out his platform. That is why I  agree that the term be five years, but I do not have a closed  mind on the subject. In the National Assembly, we must be open  to public debate, with all groups saying what they think. We are  building for the future and we cannot erect obstacles.    [Lacayo Guerra] It is said that Antonio Lacayo is a  potential  presidential candidate and that the Democratic Social Party that  you head would support him. Your comments?    [Jarquin] It is too soon to speak of such a possibility,  first of all because Antonio Lacayo is not a member of the PSD.    [Lacayo Guerra] But many ministers and government officials  are members of the PSD National Directorate.    [Jarquin] Well, we must start from the fact that the PSD  participated actively in Violeta Chamorro's campaign. Our party  supplied the activists, and many of the president's bodyguards  and chauffeurs come from the PSD. Some ministers are also from  the PSD because we believed and continue to believe that the  process which began on 25 February 1990 must have continuity.  There must be a national program to further democracy in  Nicaragua. Right now we cannot talk about any candidacy of  Antonio Lacayo. The opponents of our decision are the ones  supporting that view. We could talk in the future, but right now  we face the task of strengthening our structures.    [Lacayo Guerra] What future do you envision for the group of  social democrats headed by Alfredo and Guillermo Potoy?    [Jarquin] They have three options: to form a new party, and  it is already being rumored that they are thinking about forming  a party called the Nicaraguan Democratic Party or something  similar. Their appeal to the Supreme Election Council is an  attempt to gain six months, the time they think they need to win  our rank and file. Second, they can ally themselves with the  right and adopt a policy of confrontation. They would need such  a party in order to do so. Third, another party could take them  in, but I do not know which party would. It is said that the  Communist Party would take Alfredo Cesar. That could happen,  right? (Laughter)</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Privatisation pioneer goes one further: Mexico is handing over the provision of basic public services VISIT Mexico's recently re-opened National Auditorium and a change in the way the government conducts business becomes clear. Once a loss-making white elephant with cheap subsidised tickets, the auditorium now charges up to Dollars 100 (Pounds 56) a seat, and makes a handsome profit. Once an employer of 1,200 federal workers, it now has just one. All other work, from security to securing stars - including recently Placido Domingo, Paul Simon and next year's Miss Universe - is contracted to the private sector. The Mexican government, well-known for the privatisations of state-owned industries, has taken the concept a step further by handing over the provision and financing of basic public services to the private sector. Telephones, motorways, water treatment, electricity generation, railways and ports are being financed in part or fully by private capital to an extent not seen even in most developed countries. Subsidies are being scrapped. The stimulus to the privatisation of public goods comes from the appalling state of Mexico's infrastructure, cited by most businessmen as the most critical constraint on economic growth, and the enormous pressures on the government budget. A recent report from the business organisation Canacintra concluded with what most Mexicans did not need telling: the motorway network was insufficient, with some sections too narrow and badly put together; trains were slow and in bad condition; ports were unreliable; the telephone service was inadequate; the postal service was slow and inefficient . . . and so on. The government's first target was the telephone system, privatised in December 1990. Telmex, as the telephone monopoly is known, has to invest under government regulation about Dollars 14bn in five years and increase lines in service by 12 per cent a year. Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, likes to say that the government privatised investment in Telmex which would not have been forthcoming had the company remained in public hands. The government handed over at about the same time the construction of all four-lane toll roads to the private sector, ahead of the US, which allowed private partnership for the first time last December. The Mexican government has already authorised concessions for 3,521km of motorway for investments of Dollars 5bn, of which 1,149km are in operation. Another 2,372km of concessions are forthcoming. The government usually finances about 10 to 15 per cent of a motorway project, banks or capital markets another 50 per cent, and private investors or construction companies the rest. Brokerages and banks recently have been issuing bonds in Mexico guaranteed by future toll payments. The government promises to extend concessions to private investors in a motorway if projected revenue targets are not met, substantially reducing the risk of the bonds. Soon these bonds will be offered internationally. The first to be submitted probably will be backed by tolls on motorways that already have been built, in an attempt to test the market. However, foreigners at a recent conference on Mexico's motorway programme appeared cautious and wary about exchange-rate risk and the possibility that future governments might renege on commitments made by the free-marketeers now in control. Other risks have become apparent. Toll prices, because of the high cost of capital, are so high that demand in some cases has not met expectations, causing losses for creditors. Construction costs have been higher than projected in the Mexico City-Acapulco motorway, to the discomfort of the lead bank, Banco Serfin. Other government departments have followed the example of the Ministry of Communications and Transport. Mexico's Commission of Federal Electricity (CFE) has signed projects worth Dollars 2.5bn with consortia including France's Alsthom, Spain's Mecanica and Mexico's Bufete International to build and then lease back generators. The CFE will assign another Dollars 2.2bn-worth of plants to private contractors, including a consortium lead by General Electric and Bechtel, according to a report by El Financiero International. These projects may prove big business for Mexico's brokerages who are working on projects to attract private capital aside from that provided by foreign construction companies. Mr Javier Magana of Probursa is working on a plan to emit electricity bonds internationally and guaranteed by CFE's promise of payments for the use of a generator. Probursa is also proposing a similar scheme for water treatment plants, where capital is raised through water bonds that are guaranteed by a stream of payments which local government agrees to make for use of the plants. A series of French and British water companies have trooped through the offices of the National Water Commission in the hope of obtaining a slice of a billion-dollar business. Such projects, while hardly new in the US, 'would a year and a half ago been considered absurd', says Mr Magana. They are feasible because interest rates have fallen to below 15 per cent and confidence in the peso is strong, while the consensus in and out of Mexico is that infrastructure spending will boom over the next decade. However, foreigners may still hesitate to invest in a country where price controls on basic necessities such as electricity and water have been a way of life for more than half a century. The other constraint is Mexico's constitution, which still reserves ownership and distribution of many public services to the state. While the government has found ways round the law, greater legal clarity would help.</p>

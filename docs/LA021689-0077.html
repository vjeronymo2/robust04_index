			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUTTING THE BLOOM BACK IN NEW HOUSING;  </P> <P> PASADENA TASK FORCE CALLS FOR A 'CITY OF GARDENS' ORDINANCE WITH FLOWERY  LANGUAGE  </P> <P> The city Board of Directors has ordered the preparation of an ordinance to  require builders to make a central garden the focus of all new apartment and  condominium projects, with parking well-concealed from passers-by.  </P> <P> The ordinance is based on a planning document called "A City of Gardens" that  was developed by a team of consultants under guidance from a community task  force.  </P> <P> City directors embraced the new approach this week even though some builders  and architects complained that the standards are impractical, will increase  housing costs and will not produce more attractive housing. Architect Jack  Corey said he "loves the idea of gardens," but the proposed design standards  are full of technical flaws and so unworkable that builders will frequently  file appeals to deviate from the requirements.  </P> <P> Director Rick Cole conceded that the standards are imperfect, but said they can  be corrected through experience. The city needs a new approach, he said,  because the current code has produced projects that are "absolutely  unacceptable to any kind of quality of life for the people who live in them or  have to live next to them."  </P> <P> And, he said, if the city allows builders to continue constructing such  projects, residents will demand a halt to all construction, and the result will  be a "mindless no-growth policy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Comment  </P> <P> Directors instructed the city attorney's office to prepare an ordinance based  on the new standards and to circulate it for public comment for four weeks  before adoption. In the meantime, projects that have already been submitted to  the city will be allowed to go forward under the old standards.  </P> <P> The new approach is designed to break a pattern of long, narrow multifamily  units built in rows, with asphalt dominating the open space. The city report  outlining the City of Gardens standards says such buildings violate the  integrity of neighborhoods and detract from the city's historic character.  </P> <P> The report says that, "The most noticeable and important quality of Pasadena  neighborhoods is their overall garden character," with courtyards, lawns and  flowers.  </P> <P> It also says that "Pasadena's residential streets are relatively free from  dominance by the automobile. Pasadena has a slow and graceful character created  by trees and buildings. . . . The traditional Pasadena quality depends very  much on the fact that parking is invisible," placed behind buildings. It says  that "driveways that are beautiful in Pasadena are like mysterious paths,  leading through trees or shrubs, to some place in the back. Projects where a  wide asphalt aisle with parked cars entirely dominates half of a 50-foot lot  completely lose this character."  </P> <P> The proposed standards would require that all multifamily projects have a  garden or landscaped court as their focus. The main garden would take up 17% to  20% of a lot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tile Fountains  </P> <P> Projects would be required to have roofed balconies, tile fountains or other  attractive features.  </P> <P> The city's planning consultants and Planning Commission had recommended that  all parking be confined to the rear 40% of a lot. But directors enlarged the  area where parking might be permitted to the rear 60% of a lot, after Director  Kathryn Nack said she feared that placing parking far apart from some of the  residences would be inconvenient and pose security problems.  </P> <P> To offset the increased open space requirements, the new standards would allow  buildings in some cases to be constructed at the side and rear property lines  without a setback.  </P> <P> The City of Gardens standards would apply in all the city's multifamily zones  that allow 16 to 48 units per acre. It would not apply to downtown districts  that allow more units per acre, nor to projects that involve mixed uses, such  as retail stores on the ground floor and apartments above.  </P></p>

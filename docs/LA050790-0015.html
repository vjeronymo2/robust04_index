			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS  </P> <P> In your editorial does the reference to "the arrogant cant of unthinking  zealots" include the criticisms of countless medical doctors who have spoken  out against animal experimentation?  </P> <P> Among these enlightened physicians was Dr. Charles Mayo, founder of the  world-renowed Mayo Clinic, who said, "I abhor vivisection. It should at least  be curbed. Better, it should be abolished. I know of no achievement through  vivisection, no scientific discovery, that could not have been obtained without  such barbarism and cruelty. The whole thing is evil."  </P> <P> BOB BARKER  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special corrwespondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> correspondent Georgiy Shelenkov]    [Text] Cairo, 3 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who arrived in Cairo today to attend the signing of the  Palestine-Israel agreement, has handed a personal message from  Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak. In the message the head of the Russian state confirmed  his invitation to H. Mubarak to visit Moscow. This visit,  Kozyrev told journalists, can take place in the forseeable  future.    Answering questions from journalists after meeting H.  Mubarak  at the presidential palace "Al-Ittihadia," the head of Russian  diplomacy noted that at the meeting Russia's preparedness was  confirmed to assist further steps along this path together with  the United States, which co-chairs with Russia the Middle East  peace process, and Egypt.    Tomorrow's signing of the Palestine-Israel document, Kozyrev  said, "will become a good present" for President Mubarak, who is  celebrating his birthday on Wednesday.    The realization of the Palestine-Israel agreement, the  minister continued, will present the Palestinians with some  difficult tasks in implementing autonomy. Russia is ready to  give them all possible assistance in this.    Moscow also intends to contribute to progress in the  Syrian-Israeli direction of the peace process, too. "We will  make every effort to bring closer the positions of the sides,"  Kozyrev said. "Maybe we are on the threshold of a new peace  process, that between Syria and Israel."</p>

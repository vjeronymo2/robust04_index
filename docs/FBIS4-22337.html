Kalashnikov; place and date not  given: "Forest Belt Is a Reliable Bastion"]    [Text] Benefactress earth is now in a disastrous  state. Its fertility is declining catastrophically owing to the  fact that the application of mineral fertilizers has decreased  repeatedly. Progressing soil degradation, which is due to the  increasing wind and water erosion, ferocious dry winds, and sand  encroaching on arable land, aggravates the agricultural  situation. As long-term practice shows, green plantings can and  should protect fields. However, do we sufficiently engage in  afforestation today? What hinders this? How do immediate  prospects look? Our correspondent talked about this with Yu.  Shevelev, chief of the Administration of the Timber Industry of  Russia's Ministry of Agriculture and Food.    In order to better understand the role and significance of  protective forest plantings--Yuriy Aleksandrovich noted--we  should first talk, even if in brief, about the natural and  climatic conditions under which Russia's rural workers have to  work. These conditions are highly specific and in most regions  are not quite favorable for agricultural production.    Here are the figures of the All-Russian Scientific Research  Institute of Agricultural and Forest Reclamation (VNIALMI).  About 70 percent of the country's sown areas are located in hot  and dry or in cold and water-logged zones. Deserts occupy almost  14 percent of the areas. More than one-half of the areas under  grain crops are located in the zone of periodic droughts.  Gullies represent a terrible evil for the plowman. Their total  area exceeds 6 million hectares. In all, there are 15 to 30  million hectares of gullied land (according to various  evaluations).    From year to year the agricultural situation does not get  better. Conversely, it deteriorates, because soil degradation is  occurring and quite intensively at that. According to  specialists' estimates, in the last decades approximately  one-fourth of all the arable land available in Russia, owing to  wind and water erosion, has lost from 10 to 30 percent of its  fertility. A catastrophic decrease in humus--more than 81  million tonnes annually--is observed. It has been estimated  that, owing to soil erosion, we lose 400,000 to 500,000 hectares  of arable land annually. Saline soil, swamps, and drift sand  continue to develop on the most fertile land in the lower  reaches of the Volga, the Don, and the Kuban.    It goes without saying that the picture is depressing.  Forest  plantings have always been protectors of fields and crops. To  put it more simply, only they can save benefactress earth and  bar the way to destructive dry winds, black storms, encroaching  sand, and other natural calamities.    Apparently, there are quite a few of them--in many regions  forest belts intersect fields lengthwise and crosswise. However,  they are obviously insufficient. We have 2.9 million hectares of  protective plantings, but no less than 14 million are needed. It  would seem that there is only one conclusion--to reduce this  gap. Life itself and the disastrous state of land, in which it  is, demand this.    In fact, however, everything is different. For example, last  year, out of the 132,000 hectares of protective forest plantings  planned according to initial outlines, trees, shrubs, and other  plantings have been placed only on 68,000 hectares of the  allocated areas. If work continues to be carried out at the same  rates, the required 14 million hectares will not be reached even  in 100 years. This means that we will not stop the unceasing  degradation of arable land. Conversely, it will retake vast new  areas from fields.    The reason for such a slow development of protective  afforestation is known: The crisis situation in the country's  economy--more simply, the shortage of funds--affects the course  of work. The funds allocated from the federal budget for these  purposes are obviously insufficient. Hopes to solve the problem  with the funds of local budgets are not being realized. First of  all, because local budgets are still small--they are just being  formed. However, the problem lies not only in this. Local bodies  of power often use even the money earmarked for the  establishment of forest belts for other needs, which, from their  point of view, are more important. This is due to the  underestimate and lack of understanding of the importance of  forest reclamation work.    The question arises: What is next? How is tomorrow seen?    On assignment from the government the state program for the  development of agricultural and forest reclamation work in  Russia is now being prepared. A large group of scientists and  competent specialists of a number of ministries and departments  are involved in drawing it up.    Undoubtedly, the quite substantial experience in  afforestation during past years should have been taken into  consideration. Many, especially people of the older generation,  remember well with what enthusiasm the planting of forest belts  was undertaken in localities soon after the end of the war with  the fascist German invaders. Some years trees and shrubs were  planted on hundreds of thousands of hectares of arable land,  gullies, and ravines. During the subsequent period, right up to  our days, there were both ups and downs in this work. Some years  afforestation was hardly practised--it was abandoned almost  completely.    Drafting a new important document, we proceed from the fact  that the agro-industrial complex and the entire national economy  will derive a vast effect from the forest protective work  carried out. Specialists estimate that the average annual yield  of grain on Russia's fields protected by forest belts increases  by 18 to 23 percent, of industrial crops, by 20 to 26 percent,  and of fodder crops, by 29 to 41 percent. This promises an  increase of many million tonnes in the gross output of grain and  other products. Such a yield increase can be obtained if, to the  existing almost 3 million hectares occupied by forest and other  protective plantings, at least as much is added in the next few  years (in the future their area must be increased to 14 million  hectares).    Such a task is set by the state program for the development  of agricultural and forest reclamation work. It envisages the  establishment of a completed system of protective forest  plantings in the Volga Area, in the central chernozem zone, in  the North Caucasus, and on big irrigated tracts of land. Similar  measures are to be carried out in especially dangerous regions  of the development of water and wind erosion. It will be  necessary to block the encroachment of sand and to stop the  depletion of meadows and pastures.    What difficulties lie in wait for us during the fulfillment  of the planned program? The financing of work is problem No 1.  We proceed from the fact that, since the control of the  catastrophic soil degradation for the preservation and increase  in fertility acquires state-wide importance (after all, the  program is called the state program), the federal budget should  assume the main concern for its financing, at least at the first  stage. Of course, this does not mean that funds of local bodies  of power should not be attracted. No less than 25 to 30 percent  of the performed work should be paid from local budgets.  Nevertheless, I repeat, the state budget should be the main  source. To shift everything to local budgets means to ruin this  work. There is the danger that funds will be used for other  purposes--there are sufficient examples of this.    Another range of problems is of a juridical and legislative  nature. Although fundamentals of both land and forest  legislation already exist, numerous questions regulated by  nothing arise in practice. The allocation of land for protective  forest plantings is the most acute. Who assigns them and in what  order? It seems that it is clear: the owner of land--the  kolkhoz, the sovkhoz, the cooperative worker, and the farmer. He  must allocate land, plant trees and shrubs, take care of them,  and so forth. It is also clear that they do this for themselves,  for their own needs--forest plantings will protect their crops  against dry winds, improve the climatic situation, and,  ultimately, repay them with a yield increase. However, they do  this, alas, not always.    In my opinion, following the example of foreign countries  (Canada and the United States), we should adopt regional laws  obliging all land users to carry out the entire set of necessary  anti-erosion measures on their territory, including the growing  and maintenance of protective forest plantings. It is also  necessary to financially interest land users in the survival and  preservation of forest plantings and to introduce sanctions for  the nonperformance or low quality of anti-erosion work and the  loss of perennial plantings.    We are also concerned by the purely organizational aspect of  the matter. That is, how to organize the fulfillment of the  planned program in practice better and more efficiently. First  of all, it is necessary to preserve forest reclamation stations  (there are about 50 of them) existing in localities and not to  let them die. Numerous nurseries for the growing of seedlings of  future forest belts are under their authority and many different  machines for the planting of trees and shrubs and their care are  concentrated in them. It is also important to preserve forestry  establishments participating in this work. Unfortunately, in  order to survive, both forest reclamation stations and forestry  establishments often withdraw many of their forces for the  performance of various kinds of commercial operations and change  their specialization.    Of course, this does not exhaust the range of problems  connected with measures for the control of land degradation. I  believe that it is necessary to restore previously existing  forest reclamation services in the system of local bodies of  agricultural management. A significant restructuring of  sectorial science and of the personnel training system lies  ahead. If we do not do this, we will greatly complicate the task  of afforestation in the country.</p>

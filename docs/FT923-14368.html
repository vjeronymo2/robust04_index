			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Only 94 companies refer to accounts standards FEWER than 100 companies worldwide make reference to international accounting standards in their accounts, according to a survey from the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). The Scandinavian countries, France and Canada dominate the list, while only one UK company - Ocean Wilsons in its 1990 accounts - has made mention of the standards. A total of 94 companies refer to the IASC, including several from Italy, the US and Japan. There is also at least one Polish company and three international organisations. Mr David Cairns, secretary-general, said he was disappointed that only a very small number of listed companies referred to the standards 19 years after the IASC was established. But he said that a growing number were now beginning to do so, mainly as a result of either national requirements to state that they conformed with accounting standards, or by a desire to make their financial statements more attractive so they could gain access to international capital markets.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Competitive disadvantage of east underlined REAL gross domestic product (GDP) in the former East Germany fell by 11.4 per cent between the second half of 1990 and the same period of 1991, according to the first official statistics recalculated on a comparable basis with the rest of Germany. During the same period, the number employed fell faster - by 18.7 per cent - so that labour productivity actually rose by 9 per cent over the year, according to the Federal Bureau of Statistics. Even so, labour productivity in eastern Germany only stood at 32 per cent of the level in western Germany in the second half of 1991, underlining the severe competitive disadvantage of industry in the east. Gross wages per employee increased from DM1,290 per month to DM2,220 (Pounds 795) during the 12-month period, an increase of 52.9 per cent, in contrast to the absolute decline in economic activity. The statistics, still described as preliminary, nonetheless represent the first to be recalculated on a comparable basis with the rest of Germany. They show how essential public-sector spending has been in preventing an even more drastic fall in economic activity, and how the economy appears to have bottomed out in the first quarter of 1991. Thus the GDP fell from DM58.4bn in the third quarter of 1990 to DM43.8bn in the first quarter of 1991 - a drop of more than 27 per cent in six months. Between then and the last quarter of 1991, it recovered to DM50.1bn. In the same period private consumption fell from DM47.7bn to DM40.9bn in the first quarter of 1991 and recovered to DM50.4bn at the end of the year, fuelled by unemployment pay, the conversion of savings accounts into D-Marks and consumer credit. In contrast, public sector spending rose sharply from DM17.9bn to DM27.8bn between the third and fourth quarters of 1990, fell back to DM17.7bn in the first quarter of 1991 (probably as a result of sheer spending limitations in the collapsed public sector) and recovered steadily to reach DM25.6bn in the last quarter of the year. Exports, traditionally to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, were totally stagnant: starting at DM16.5bn in the third quarter of 1990, they were marginally down at DM16.4bn at the end of the period. Imports, on the other hand, soared from DM35.6bn at the start of the period (the first quarter after economic and monetary union between the two halves of Germany) to DM61.4bn at the end.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        EAST GERMAN GROWTH AND WAGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1990                       1991                       3rd     4th      1st      2nd      3rd      4th                    quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  quarter  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic     product (DMbn)*   58.4     53.1    42.5      44.9     48.7     50.1 GDP per person     employed (in DM) 6,700    6,600   5,500     6,100    7,000    7,500 Gross monthly     wages (DM)       1,290    1,430   1,500     1,650    1,930    2,220  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * 1991 prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

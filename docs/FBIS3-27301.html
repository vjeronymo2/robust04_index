It also disclosed that up to 77  per cent held foreign passports, increasing fears that an exodus  of top officials is likely near the change-over.    The survey, conducted by Professor Joseph Cheng Yu-shek and  Dr Jane Lee of the City Polytechnic, showed strong pessimism  among the cream of the 1 90,000-strong civil service. As many  as 35 per cent of the top-ranking officials said they would not  remain in the civil service after 1997. And another 29 per cent  said they were undecided whether they would continue to serve  after that date. The survey was conducted between March and  November and targeted about 1,000 most senior level staff. It  contained interviews and was followed by a mailed survey with a  response rate of 57 per cent.    "In the study, it is observed that the bureaucrats generally  exhibit a strong sense of uncertainty and pessimism concerning  their future career as well as their political role," the  academics said in their paper. "Early retirement and  resignation from the civil service may be the ways by which the  bureaucrats express their negative feelings towards the future  political system."    The survey showed that up to 37 per cent of respondents were  pessimistic about their career. Among these, 13 per cent said  they were "very worried", while the remaining 24 per cent were  worried". The senior officials were also disturbed by the  increasing interference by China in the run-up towards 1997.  Twenty-one per cent said they were "very worried" about the  involvement of Beijing government officials in Hong Kong's major  policy decisions. And nearly half (46.9 per cent) of the  respondents said they were "fairly worried" about China's  involvement, compared with the 25.5 per cent who were "fairly  unworried". Also, more than half (50.9 per cent) disagreed that  the decisions of the Chinese Government should override those of  the Hong Kong Government. More than 65 per cent of the  respondents said they were holding full British passports, with  another 11 per cent holding other foreign passports.    The survey found that a majority of the respondents agreed  that the Government should be held accountable to the  Legislative Council, compared with the 17.1 per cent who said  the Government should be held accountable to the Chinese  Government. This was despite the fact that many of those  interviewed felt that politicians were "incompetent, senseless  and inimical to the general interests". "The study finds that  the bureaucrats are in the process of adjustment towards a more  open and responsive government," the researchers said.</p>

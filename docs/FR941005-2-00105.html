The JTF&hyph;6 program involves providing operational, engineering, and general support to law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that have drug interdiction responsibilities within the southwestern border states. The Draft PEIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 15, 1994, at 59 FR 18115; the Notice of Availability (NOA) of the Draft PEIS was published on May 19, 1994, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at 59 FR 26322. Comments on the Draft PEIS were received from five Federal Agencies, five State Agencies, and four private individuals/organizations. A request for an extension of time for review and comment was received from individuals in Laredo, Texas, and the U.S. Department of Interior. The request was granted and the comment period was extended from May 30, 1994, to June 10, 1994. Copies of all comments and responses are documented in the FPEIS. The FPEIS was filed with the EPA on August 11, 1994, and published on August 19, 1994, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at 59 FR 42831.

The thrust of this program is the use of Department of Defense training resources in the support of agencies responsible for the fight against illegal drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mission of JTF&hyph;6 is to plan and coordinate military training along the U.S. Southwest Land Border in support of counterdrug activities by Federal, State, and Local LEAs, as requested through Operation Alliance and approved by the Secretary of Defense or a designated representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The JFT&hyph;6 program provides operational, engineering, and general support to LEAs operating within the Southwestern United States which have drug interdiction authorities and allows the LEAs to conduct their missions more efficiently and effectively. The actions performed by JTF&hyph;6 personnel are quite diverse, ranging from reconnaissance operations to the building and renovation of roads and radio towers. The JTF&hyph;6's primary area of concern is within a 50-mile-wide corridor along the U.S./Mexico border from Port Arthur, Texas, to San Diego, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The INS is responsible for the prevention of smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. This is the task of the Border Patrol, which is also responsible for drug interdiction between the U.S. land Ports-of-Entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Border Patrol has been the primary beneficiary of most JTF&hyph;6 engineering actions to date, INS elected to act as lead agency for the preparation of this FPEIS. The EPA and JTF&hyph;6 elected to act as cooperating agencies. A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a PEIS was published on July 15, 1993, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 58 FR 38140. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the FPEIS is to address cumulative environmental impacts of previous actions as well as those actions which may be developed within the reasonably foreseeable future. The FPEIS analyzes these cumulative impacts and generically examines the impacts of future individual actions based on experience with similar past actions. The FPEIS also describes the different types of actions performed by JTF&hyph;6. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Doris Meissner, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24564 Filed 10&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;10&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

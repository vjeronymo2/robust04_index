			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, May 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  pledged to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday [5 May] to  further strengthen Japan's relations with the rapidly expanding  European Union (EU), Japanese officials said.    The officials said both Hata and Kohl agreed that regional  groupings should be open to maintain free trade. Hata pledged  Japan's efforts to keep the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum as a mechanism to supplement the general agreement  on tariffs and trade, the officials said, adding Hata supported  closer dialogue between APEC and the EU. The 12-nation EU is  expected to expand its membership to include Austria, Finland,  Norway and Sweden.    Hata met with Kohl after talking with German Foreign  Minister  Klaus Kinkel about Japanese and German bids to win permanent  membership in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Hata  and Kinkel pledged to cooperate with each other in the UNSC  bids, officials said. Hata and Kohl, meeting for three hours,  also shared the need for Japan, Germany and other countries to  support Russia's reform efforts and maintain equal partnership,  the officials told reporters.    On North Korea, the two leaders also stressed international  solidarity to address Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons  program, although Hata said Japan believes channels of  communications with North Korea remain open to achieve a  negotiated settlement. Asked by Kohl about China's political  landscape in the future post-Deng Xiaoping era, Hata said the  collective leadership under President Jiang Zemin is functioning  and predicted no drastic change in China's open-door policy,  officials said.    Hata arrived in Bonn on the third leg of a European trip  with  previous stops in Italy and France. He will visit Belgium next.  In his talks with Kinkel, Hata said permanent UNSC seats for  Japan and Germany would benefit UN activities, and Kinkel said  Germany shares the same view. Hata and Kinkel expressed their  shared concern over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  program, urging Pyongyang to dispel suspicions about the nuclear  issue, the officials said.    Kohl said in the course of his talks with Hata that he gets  tired as Japan changes its prime ministers every two years,  according to Japanese officials.    They said Hata responded, "I will do my best" to stay in  power longer than his predecessors. Hata's immediate  predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, was in power for only eight  months.</p>

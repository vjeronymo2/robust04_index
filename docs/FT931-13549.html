			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Monopolies chief defends reports CRITICISM of recent reports from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for bowing too much to the views of the industries under investigation has been dismissed as ill-informed by Sir Sydney Lipworth, the departing commission chairman. Presenting his final annual report, Sir Sydney yesterday defended the commission's report on new cars published last February against attacks from consumer organisations. He said the criticism arose because the report's findings had not matched public expectations on differences between new car prices in the UK and elsewhere in the EC. Much of what the report said had been overlooked. It was detailed and complex and it was clear that not everyone had understood it, he said. Sir Sydney said: 'The MMC is a first-rate institution doing a first-rate job.' As an 'economic tribunal' the commission had long experience and was well equipped to take on new types of work, he added. The strongest attack on the report on cars had come from the Consumers' Association. This prompted media criticism of the inconsistent approach adopted by the commission towards beer, petrol and car reports.</p>

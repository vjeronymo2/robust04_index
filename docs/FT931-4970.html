			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Shifts in the pattern of poverty: Paul Cheeseright and Chris Tighe examine the funding battle as the map of assisted areas is redrawn INNER London and parts of southern England are soon likely to be labelled as assisted areas by the government, opening the way for companies in those areas to qualify for both government and EC subsidies. The Department of Trade and Industry is redrawing the assisted areas map for the first time since 1984 and EC limits on the proportion of a country's population that can be designated may mean the withdrawal of some regional assistance to areas in Wales, the Midlands and north east England. Since 1984 the assisted areas have received additional investment of about Pounds 3.5bn in derelict land grant and European regional development fund allocations, according to figures obtained from ministers by Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour MP for Darlington. The department is struggling to adjudicate between competing claims from across Great Britain for a place on the map. But the adjudication will not be completed before the government has assessed the economic impact of the programme of coal mine closures. The problems with coal policy have delayed completion of the redrawn map, originally expected at the end of last year. Now the department says it will not appear before mid-April at the earliest. More than 1,800 submissions have been made to the department from local authorities, development agencies, training and enterprise councils, local university departments and even parish councils, in an ever lengthening parade of poverty. Although the official deadline for submissions was September 30 last year, efforts to put pressure on Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister in charge of the redrawing, have continued unabated. Last week Birmingham Chamber of Commerce told him that its area deserved not just intermediate but full development status - that is, a wider range of subsidies than it may now receive. A place on the map means acknowledgement of industrial decline, hence the present concentration of assisted areas in the Midlands and the north, Wales and Scotland. The difficulty for the department is that the map can include no more than 35 per cent of Great Britain's population. The department will have to judge whether unemployment in southern England is merely cyclical and it will have to decide how deep-seated is the local economic effect of coal mine closures. It will also have to assess whether traditional industrial areas, recession notwithstanding, have arrested their decline. On such considerations it is possible to predict likely changes on the map. For the first time parts of inner London and the east Thames corridor may be included. North Nottinghamshire has a strong claim. So too have some coastal areas, the strongest candidates being around Skegness in Lincolnshire; Yarmouth, Harwich and Southend in Suffolk and Essex; Thanet, the Medway area and Folkestone in a swathe of Kent stretching to Maidstone; and, in the south, Brighton, Hastings and the Isle of Wight. To keep within the EC guidelines such inclusions will mean the removal of areas of relative economic recovery. Current thinking tends towards the deletion of Cardiff, Newport and Neath in south Wales; Shotton and Wrexham in north Wales; Darlington in the north east; and Corby, Kidderminster and Telford in the Midlands. Mr Milburn said yesterday his figures illustrated how the loss of assisted area status put in jeopardy additional sources of investment. Since 1984, for example, the Darlington area has received nearly three times as much investment from derelict land grant (Pounds 3.4m) and EC regional development funds (Pounds 7.6m) as from regional assistance (Pounds 4.3m).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.176  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Property recovered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Before approval <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Do not pay claims for missing property if the missing property is located before the claim is approved. Only the transit related damage will be cognizable. As an exception to this rule, compensation may be allowed for necessary items that were missing for an unreasonable time after the expected arrival date and were replaced by claimant prior to the items being located. Necessary items are those that are basic to the operation of a household. If compensation is allowed under the above exception, the claimant will disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in such items in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> After approval <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If missing property is located after the claim is approved for payment, the claimant will normally be advised of his or her option to_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Accept any or all of the items located and remit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount already allowed for such items to the United States. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain circumstances, the claimant will not have an option: The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS or his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designee can require the claimant to accept any or all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items and remit the amount allowed; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in the property and retain the amount approved for payment. If, however, the approval or settlement authority determines that any of the recovered property is substantially different in quality, price, or value from the property claimed, the approval or settlement authority may require the claimant to return the amount allowed for such property and accept the property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.177  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Companion claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When two or more claims arising from the same incident are, by reason of differences in amounts within the jurisdiction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different approval or settlement authorities, action will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withheld on these claims until the authority having jurisdiction over the largest claim has determined that the claims arising out of the incident are cognizable, unless the claims lesser in amount are clearly cognizable and meritorious.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.178  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Emergency partial payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Frequently a claimant is in immediate need of funds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace damaged or destroyed property. An emergency partial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment up to $2,000 is authorized under the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A hardship situation exists that can be alleviated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing immediate funds for the repair or replacement of certain property lost or damaged; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A claim has been presented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The approval or settlement authority determines that the claim is clearly payable under this chapter, in an amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the amount of the proposed emergency payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The approval or settlement authority can approve an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency partial payment on any claim that meets the above criteria. If the adjudicated amount exceeds the approval or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement authority's delegated monetary amount, pay up to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegated amount (less the emergency payment), mark the outside of the file ``PRIORITY'' and transfer it with all documentation (to include computer disk, paper screen and memorandum of opinion) to the next higher claims authority for additional payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Prior to making any emergency payment, the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approving such payment normally will obtain an executed partial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptance agreement from the claimant or his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative. Only the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Division, USARCS or his designee can authorize emergency partial payments above $2,000. The authority requesting an emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partial payment above $2,000 can coordinate telephonically with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.179  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Personnel claims memorandum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A personnel claims memorandum of opinion will be included in the file of each personnel claim disapproved; forwarded for adjudication, disapproval, or reconsideration; or forwarded with a recommendation that there be a deviation from the Allowance List or other established policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A personnel claims memorandum of opinion will be signed by the Claims JA. It will be routed through any intervening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement authority, addressed to the settlement authority who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take final action (for example, a disapproval would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed to the SJA of an area claims office, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration would be addressed to the Commander, USARCS). The memorandum will be sufficiently detailed to explain fully and support the action taken or recommended. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;551 for further instructions.) It will be arranged as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Claimant's name and address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Date and place the incident occurred giving rise to the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Amount of claim, the date it was filed, and the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration was requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Subparts the claims were considered under, and a brief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of the incident or of the issues raised by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant on reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Facts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Recommended action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.180  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim will be reconsidered under the conditions listed below. Reconsiderations normally require additional investigation and review. This additional information will be documented in the file. An approval or settlement authority_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) May always reconsider his or her action if the original action was in error or is incorrect based on new facts. This may be pursuant to either a claimant's oral request for reconsideration or as a result of any post-settlement review conducted on the claims file. Note that while the original approving or settlement authority may consider a claimant's ``oral'' request for reconsideration, claims personnel should advise claimants that a higher settlement authority will not act on an oral request until the claimant presents it in writing in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The basis for any change will be reflected in the file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Must reconsider a claim upon the written request of the claimant or someone acting on his or her behalf. The claimant must clearly state the factual or legal basis for relief. However, the reconsideration process must be considered not as an adversarial process, but rather as an opportunity for the approval or settlement authority to continue a dialogue with the claimant. Every effort should be made to develop the claimant's version of the facts. A claim will be reconsidered even if a settlement agreement has been executed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The original approval or settlement authority will modify the original action if he or she determines that the original action was incorrect or is incorrect based on new evidence. The basis for any change will clearly be reflected in the file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A successor or higher approval or settlement authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will only modify the original action on the basis of fraud,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial new evidence, mistake (misinterpretation) of law or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, or an error in calculation. The basis for any change will clearly be reflected in the file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An approval or settlement authority can take final action on a request for reconsideration if he or she informs the claimant in writing that the claimant_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Is aware of the right to have the file reviewed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USARCS; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

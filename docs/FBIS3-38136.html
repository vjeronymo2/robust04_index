			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO     The first 1994 poll conducted from 3 to 6 January by the  PARIS MATCH/BVA polling organization among a nationally  representative sample of 985 individuals over 18 showed that the  popularity of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, President  Francois Mitterrand, and the government rose since the last poll  in 1993. The poll appeared in the 20 January Paris PARIS MATCH.    Overall, and accounting for differences between leftist and  rightist voters, 49 percent of the respondents (compared with 44  percent in the December poll) said they had a good opinion of  Mitterrand as president of the Republic. Some 44 percent said  they had a bad opinion of him, compared with 48 percent in  December. Seven percent did not know. When asked about their  opinion of Balladur as prime minister, 60 percent said it was  good, up 4 percent since December, and 29 percent said it was  bad, down 5 percent since December. A total of 11 percent did  not know. Respondents were also asked if they were satisfied or  dissatisfied with the way France is governed. Overall, 33  percent said they were satisfied, up from 27 percent in  December, and 62 percent said they were dissatisfied, down 3  percent since December. Five percent did not know.    The same poll asked respondents to name the candidate for  whom they would be more likely to vote if new legislative  elections took place. Some 3 percent chose the extreme left, up  1 percent since December. Eight percent opted for the Communist  Party (PC), the same as in December. Similarly, the percentage  of those who would vote for the Socialist Party (PS) and for  Generation Ecologie remained stable at 21 and 5 percent  respectively. The same was true for the Greens at 5 percent.  Slightly more respondents would vote for the Union for French  Democracy (UDF) (15 percent compared to 13 percent), and  slightly fewer (29 percent compared to 31 percent) would vote  for the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Finally, 12  percent--compared to 13 percent in December-- would vote for the  National Front (FN).    The 12 January Paris daily LIBERATION reprinted the results  of a popularity poll conducted by the Louis Harris organization  on 7-8 January among 1,005 voters on behalf of the PROFESSION  POLITIQUE DE CETTE SEMAINE. Some 55 percent of the respondents  said that the Balladur government is "going in the right  direction," a 5 percent increase in the last two months. Some 38  percent thought the opposite, a 3 percent drop. The most popular  was Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua with 34 percent  favorable opinions. He was followed by Minister of Social  Affairs Simone Veil with 53 percent and Minister of Foreign  Affairs Alain Juppe with 51 percent.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / West European car sales expected to fall WEST EUROPEAN new car sales are expected to fall to around 13.2m this year from 13.42m in 1991, Mr Robert Eaton, president of General Motors Europe, said yesterday. GM Europe, one of the least protectionist car makers in western Europe, also signalled significant toughening of its stance against the Japanese car industry. While Japanese productivity was high, there was 'reason enough' for the European car industry to 'maintain its self-confidence,' he said. 'There is no reason to believe the future of the European industry will depend on copying Japanese systems. Europe should stop placing the Japanese car industry on a pedestal.' In an attack on the Japanese industry, Mr Eaton claimed that Japanese car makers benefited from 'different cultural, social and societal systems, lower wages and longer working hours, the long-standing support of and close co-operation with their government, import barriers that protected their national industry and profitability for decades, and which are only now being gradually removed.' Mr Eaton said UK new car sales were forecast to rise in the second half of the year to 1.7m compared with 1.59m last year. Sales in Germany were expected to fall by around 13.5 per cent to some 3.6m from 4.16m in 1991. Rover, the UK vehicle maker, yesterday took the unusual step of unveiling two new cars simultaneously, a coupe version of the Rover 800 executive saloon and a convertible version of the smaller Rover 200, at the Geneva show. The unveilings mark the start of an expected flurry of new products from Rover Group this year, to include the first MG two-seater sports model since the Abingdon factory which produced the MGB closed a decade ago.

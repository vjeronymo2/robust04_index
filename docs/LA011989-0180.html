			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> 2 ARRESTED IN THREAT TO POTENTIAL WITNESS  </P> <P> Two gang members, one a juvenile and the other an adult, were arrested after  threatening a 15-year-old who was scheduled to be a witness at a gang-shooting  trial, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Santos Manuel Lopez, 20, of Costa Mesa was arrested Wednesday, and a  17-year-old Back Bay High School student was arrested Tuesday. Both were taken  into custody on suspicion of dissuading a witness by threat, a felony, Costa  Mesa Police Sgt. Ron Smith said.  </P> <P> The 15-year-old was "approached in person by an adult and a juvenile male who  said they were Blood gang members out of Santa Ana," Smith said. "They  threatened him with physical harm if he appeared to testify against their  fellow Bloods."  </P> <P> The teen-ager did not have to testify at the Tuesday trial because the two gang  members eventually pleaded guilty after plea bargains were arranged, Smith  said.  </P> <P> Five adults and four juveniles were arrested in October for a gang-related  fistfight and shooting at a shopping center. One teen-ager was injured in the  fistfight, but no one was shot.  </P></p>

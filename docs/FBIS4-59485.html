			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Our Middle East correspondent, Cecilia Udden,  reports that cheering Palestinians gathered in the streets of  Jericho when Israel handed over power after 27 years of  occupation. It is not yet quite clear, however, which  Palestinians the Israelis have handed over power to, she reports:    [Udden] [passage omitted] Many people are skeptical of  self-rule and skeptical of Yasir 'Arafat's way of exercising  democracy. Since December, many leading persons, including  spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, have relinquished official  responsibility. But yesterday the PLO announced at a news  conference in Cairo that 15 people have been nominated,  including Hanan 'Ashrawi, which came as a surprise to herself,  according to reports received by this program. [passage omitted]    But one important name is conspicuous by its absence from  the  list of 15 candidates for the so-called Palestinian government:  Dr. Haydar Abd-al-Shafi, the popular and respected doctor from  Gaza, who led the Palestinian delegation when the peace talks  started. People in Gaza say about Dr. Haydar that he is  kind-hearted. I asked him whether he does not feel any pity for  Yasir 'Arafat now that it seems difficult to put together a  government. But Dr. Haydar is unrelenting.    [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] I said that I am  ready to participate if 'Arafat yields to democratic principles.  It is his self-made problem. We didn't make the problem for  him. [end recording]    [Udden] [passage omitted] The moment of truth will only come  when elections are held in the West Bank and Gaza. The  election, planned for July, can be held in the fall at the  earliest. Dr. Haydar, who refuses to be a member of a  PLO-nominated administration, can, however, envision running as  a candidate in elections. I do not rule out the possibility, he  says diplomatically.    [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] Well, I don't  rule that out. I only say it like this: I want to, but it is  too early to say. I say I don't rule out my participation.  [end recording]</p>

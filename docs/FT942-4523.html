			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/C&amp;G Yesterday's High Court judgment puts a formidable obstacle in the way of Lloyds Bank's bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. Though ordinary depositors can receive bonus payments regardless of their length of membership, share account holders of less than two years' standing cannot. Without their vote the requisite majority would almost certainly be unattainable. Since the two parties remain confident of their legal ground, the obvious route is to appeal. It is difficult to conceive of alternative inducements, especially since the judgment made no distinction between cash and paper. The new uncertainty threatens the 5 per cent out-performance of Lloyds' shares against the sector since the deal was announced. After its abortive bid for Midland, Lloyds cannot let C&amp;G slip through its fingers without being thrown right back into a strategic impasse. The tragedy for the bank is that the judgment appears to rest on a quirk in the wording of the law. More generally it is a forceful reminder that the playing field is uneven. These problems do not arise in cases where building societies are transforming themselves into banks. Yet that creates just as much risk of deposits switching from society to society in search of inducements. There is ever more urgent need for full public debate before the law is redrafted.</p>

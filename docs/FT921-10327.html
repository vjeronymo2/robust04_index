			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK unveils its lively lion logo for Europe THE UK yesterday put a lion in the European tank when it unveiled the logo marking British presidency of the European Community, due to start on July 1. The logo, a lion striding across the EC's flag of a circle of yellow stars on a blue field, appears to give a somewhat ambiguous picture of the British government's European policy. For Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, who conducted the ceremonial unveiling, it shows 'a lion at the heart of Europe, an energetic, lively and intelligent lion. It shows our forthright approach to Europe and maintains British pride and British identity'. For others, conscious of Britain's deep reservations about a supranational European monetary and political union, the logo was more evocative of the UK driving a lion and cart through the EC's most ambitious projects. That impression may have been the result of an intervention by Mr John Major, the prime minister. He complained that the original version of the beast, designed and developed by the Anglo-Italian company Minale Tattersfield at the modest cost of Pounds 15,000, presented too docile a picture of Britain and should be made 'more lively and energetic'. Some surprise was also expressed at the press launch at the timing of the British initiative, barely a month after Portugal had taken over the EC presidency for a six-month stint. In the face of Mr Hurd's denials, it was also suggested there might be a link between this unusually early start of the European campaign and the desire to make an impact on voters before the forthcoming UK general election. Mr Hurd said there were two top priorities for the British presidency during the second half of the year. The first was the completion of the single European market, 'in which the free movement of goods and services promotes jobs and prosperity and brings benefits to individual consumers and businesses'. The UK would concentrate in particular on the liberalisation of financial services and transport and the creation of a real internal market in energy. The second main priority was the enlargement of the Community, starting with the European Free Trade Association applicants. The aim was for accession negotiations to start at the end of this year or the beginning of 1993. The UK also wanted to ensure that the Community had sound financial foundations and that both budgetary discipline and the interests of ordinary taxpayers were respected in the extensive review of the Community's finances to be started this month. An essential element of this problem was a continuation of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Other British priorities included the buttressing of democracy and reform in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. 'We shall press ahead with trade agreements with the newly independent states and we shall help the east Europeans prepare for EC membership by implementing the association agreements with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia,' Mr Hurd said.</p>

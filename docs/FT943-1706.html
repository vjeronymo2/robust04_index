			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Bossi challenge over state TV The populist Northern League plans a move that could oust the new government appointees brought in to run the RAI, Italy's state broadcasting organisation. The League yesterday unveiled a plan to introduce a legislative amendment that would oblige the two-month-old board to resign and allow appointment of fresh management by parliament. The League was angered by the way the board of directors, headed by Mrs Letizia Moratti, a former stockbroker, changed the entire editorial management of the three television channels over the weekend with any reference to the existing editorial teams. Other members of the government dismissed the League's protests as pique over having failed to get any of its own editorial nominees appointed at RAI. Although this may be close to the truth, Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, has consistently expressed concern over prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's ability to control both commercial and public broadcasting. Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest empire includes three channels controlling over 80 per cent of commercial television. The League has some leverage because next month the government will need to endorse a decree providing ongoing funding for the RAI. The League is attaching its amendment to this decree. The amendment could pass if the opposition decides to make common cause with the League. Staff at the RAI are threatening further industrial action in the wake of Tuesday's 24-hour strike in protest against the new appointments.</p>

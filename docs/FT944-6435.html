			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (13): Striking evidence of regeneration efforts - Bristol development corporation Many of the people flocking this autumn to a 14-screen, 3,600-seat Showcase Cinema at Avon Meads in Bristol will be unaware that only a year ago the site was derelict. The American-style development of a 26-acre site at Avon Meads and Castle Court is, as yet, the most striking evidence of the regeneration efforts of Bristol Development Corporation on 900 acres near the city centre. Alongside the Showcase Cinema, opened in August by National Amusements of the US, there is ten-pin bowling, fast-food restaurants and a parade of stores. This month, an 85,000 sq ft Cargo Club was opened by Nurdin &amp; Peacock, its third UK membership warehouse, in which goods are sold off pallets and racks at low prices. More than 12,000 people had paid the annual membership fee of Pounds 25 by opening day. Avon Meads and Castle Court, which have been developed for the BDC by Wilson Connolly, have free parking and, because of a new spine road, can be reached without driving through the congested city centre. The road itself, named St Philips Causeway, was opened in July and links the M32 motorway with the A4 Bath road. While the leisure and retail complex has won popular approval, the BDC itself has been, in some quarters, highly unpopular. One of 12 such corporations in England, it was created by the government in 1989 with planning powers to regenerate land suffering from dereliction and poor access. The Labour-controlled city council failed in a court action to stop it. The BDC's aggressively market-led strategy did nothing to improve relations with the council. Critics of the government's concept of the corporations argue they have a high cost per job created - and poorly targeted benefits. Relations between the BDC and the city council, although still uneasy, have improved over the past year and the council's Labour leader, Mr Graham Robertson, has joined the board. Recently, however, tensions have resurfaced with the BDC's plans for its flagship site, Quay Point. Mr Miles Collinge, the BDC's pugnacious chief executive, makes no apologies for the corporation being a commercial organisation driven by market forces. He does not disguise his frequent impatience with the city authorities. 'Bristol of all cities has a capacity to emit negative messages,' is a typical comment. The BDC concentrated on infrastructure first - notably on St Philips Causeway, which cost Pounds 47m. The design-build contract was completed by Balfour Beatty ahead of schedule and on budget. Mr Collinge describes the road as of 'mega-significance' and says the area it serves 'didn't have a future without it.' One scheme, intended to complement the spine road, is for a weir to improve the appearance of the river Avon, which becomes a muddy ditch at low tide. But although a parliamentary bill to build it was unopposed, funding has yet to be found. Development which has proceeded includes, in partnership with Nationwide Building Society and five national housebuilders, an urban village called Avon Riverside. So far, about 300 houses, out of a planned total of nearly 1,000, have been completed. The main office relocation has been by NatWest Life, which has taken a headquarters building on the waterfront. The BDC says 2,250 jobs have been created, with another 1,000 expected from schemes in progress. It forecasts there will be, eventually, 18,800 direct and indirect jobs and predicts that private investment of Pounds 820m will be secured. In May, the BDC, due to be wound up in December next year, published an exit strategy together with a review by KPMG Management Consulting. KPMG said the recession had caused developments to come onstream later than originally forecast, but 'despite this background the BDC has successfully brought about development and laid the foundations for strengthening interest as the economy and the property market recovers.' The review said the BDC had identified opportunities which had not been seen by the council. The potential had been transformed by improvements to the infrastructure and environment. Twelve sites already had some development and a further 13 were being marketed. 'There is no evidence that this turnaround. . . could have been achieved with the BDC's activities,' KPMG said. The most grandiose project is for Quay Point, which the BDC believes will be a gateway to the city of international status. It is a triangular site of 23 acres next to Temple Meads railway station, the city's ring road and on the waterfront. The BDC, with Wilson Connolly as preferred developer, hopes to have a 2m sq ft commercial centre, attracting Pounds 400m of investment. In addition to offices, the BDC wants a quality hotel, leisure attractions and, most controversially, 350,000 sq ft of shopping including a department store and mall. The scheme is attacked by those concerned about the impact on the city's Broadmead shopping centre, and on a proposed Harbourside development on the waterfront. The council's view is that a strategy for central Bristol should be by devised by agreement, not competition. Mr Collinge's view is that the real threat to the city centre comes not from Quay Point, but from out-of-town development. Despite Quay Point having been marketed for some time, no deal has yet been struck for a department store. Mr Collinge, while saying that remains the preferred option, indicates the scheme could be adapted to have less retail space, more confined to support shopping for office workers. But he comments: 'We do not believe in mono-cultural development, whether retail, leisure or office. A development blossoms more in a city if it has a mix of uses. 'This corporation wants to do nothing but strengthen the heartbeat of Bristol. Why allow this site to continue to moulder? It is the most accessible site and why not recognise that, and say it is the central business district?' Mr Collinge comments: 'My great sadness is that the vision of the BDC has not been shared. There has been squabbling argument with third-division politics trying to kill the BDC. Cities like Birmingham and Manchester have had a strategic vision in harmony with the private sector.' He adds: 'Potentially we're a very competitive city and, if we got our act together, we could knock spots off other cities.'</p>

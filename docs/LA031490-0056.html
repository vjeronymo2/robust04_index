			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROCER 'EVERYONE LIKED' SHOT TO DEATH IN HOLDUP  </P> <P> Grocer Tomoji (Tommy) Matsuda, a month shy of his 71st birthday, clung fast to  his little corner of North Main Street near Chinatown long after the other  store owners moved away and graffiti began appearing at every turn.  </P> <P> This is my neighborhood, he'd tell friends who shopped at Toni's Market on  North Main at Ann Street.  </P> <P> The area was battered and forgotten, changed to be sure. But he was proud of  the three sons he had raised there and the name he had made for himself.  </P> <P> Matsuda was shot and killed Monday on the same corner where he had worked and  lived for 39 years -- a victim, some say, of the changes he turned a blind eye  to.  </P> <P> Toni Matsuda said her husband had chatted with a group of children who had  bought candy before starting to restock the shelves. She was at a cash register  in front and her husband was at the rear when a young man and woman entered  late in the afternoon. Both were wearing black clothing and sunglasses.  </P> <P> "They had been looking at the spaghetti mix, waiting for the other customers to  leave the store," Toni Matsuda said. "Then the man came over and pointed a gun  at me and said, 'This is a stickup and get on the floor, flat.' . . . My  husband thought that guy was going to kill us." Tommy Matsuda pulled the gun he  kept for protection and ran to the front of the store.  </P> <P> "It all happened so fast. I don't know who shot first. I saw my husband slump  down. I ran to him and he was already bleeding a lot in the head.  </P> <P> "The man told the woman, 'Go! Go!' but she just stood there, dumbfounded. He  yelled 'Go!' another time and then they left.  </P> <P> "They didn't get anything."  </P> <P> An unidentified customer was shot in the leg.  </P> <P> Matsuda died shortly after 10 p.m. Monday at County-USC Medical Center.  </P> <P> Toni Matsuda described the gunman as a Latino, about 25, about 5-feet-7, thin  and well-groomed with short, dark brown hair. The woman was a Latina, also  about 25, standing about 5-feet-6, also thin and with curly, shoulder-length  hair.  </P> <P> "I was always badgering them to move and come up to live with us," said  Matsuda's oldest son, Dennis, 36, of Spokane, Wash. "But there were still a lot  of people (in the neighborhood) that he felt close to. He knew a lot of people  there and liked it. Everyone knew him. Everyone liked him.  </P> <P> "The area always had its violent side. But I don't remember it being really  this violent. I remember my dad commenting that it was getting more dangerous,  that the people seemed to be getting more dangerous. But he didn't want to  leave."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the curious gathered in front of the small grocery, named in honor  of Matsuda's wife. A cardboard sign notified customers that the store would be  closed through today.  </P> <P> John Gardenas, 18, a resident of a housing project across the street, said  Matsuda had worked at the store for as long as he could remember.  </P> <P> "I think Tommy was there when my grandmother lived around here," Gardenas said.  "He was nice. He spoke English, Spanish, Chinese. Everybody liked Tommy."  </P> <P> Matsuda's wife said her husband was born in Japan and that his family  immigrated to the United States from Peru in the 1940s. He spent a year during  World War II in a detention center for Japanese-Americans, then moved to  Denver, where he met Toni.  </P> <P> They married in December, 1948, and moved to Los Angeles in 1950, choosing a  lively area of "mom and pop" stores along North Main Street near downtown as an  ideal spot to open a dry-cleaning business. The family lived for a while over a  dry cleaner's on North Main, directly across from Ann Street Elementary, which  the children would later attend.  </P> <P> "We didn't know anything about dry-cleaning," Toni Matsuda recalled. "We  learned it from the ground up. We brought up a son, then the twins came along,  and later a friend of ours put us in the grocery business."  </P> <P> In 1966, the Matsudas opened Toni's Market, catering to the nearby housing  projects and the shrinking number of other residences in the area.  </P> <P> By the 1970s, the neighborhood was changing. Other businesses closed or moved  out, gangs moved in and the area took on a rougher look.  </P> <P> The family eventually moved to another part of Los Angeles. But Matsuda refused  to consider moving his business.  </P> <P> "He was a very hard worker and he liked everybody," said Kenneth Yow Jr., who  owned the grocery building. "He had been there so long that nobody gave him any  problems. He knew everybody, and everybody knew him."  </P> <P> But as the years passed, Yow said, Matsuda privately expressed concern over  rising crime.  </P> <P> "He knew it wasn't safe," Yow said. "But when you have to make a living, you  have to put up with it."  </P> <P> Yow said Matsuda, like other area merchants, "always kept a gun, because you  don't know what is going to happen."  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements for Matsuda were incomplete Tuesday.  </P> <P> Toni Matsuda said she was not sure if she would return to the grocery to work.  She said longtime customers had been calling to express their condolences.  </P> <P> "I have no bitterness toward the neighborhood," she said. "I don't hold it  against anybody because two crazy people do something like this.  </P> <P> "It was never a place to be scared. You can't blame a neighborhood when  something like this happens."  </P></p>

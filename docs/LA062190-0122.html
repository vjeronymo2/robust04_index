			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUNE GARDENING TIPS  </P> <P> Plant a tree this summer to shade the hot spot in your garden next year.  </P> <P> It's not necessary to sacrifice having a vegetable garden to conserve water.  </P> <P> Use drip irrigation instead. There's less water wasted and the water is  distributed more evenly. Using mulch also helps the soil retain moisture and  discourages weeds. Not only does that cut down on the time you spend  maintaining the garden, but weeds consume water and nutrients meant for your  plants.  </P> <P> The late-summer productivity of your roses is determined by the amount of water  and feeding they receive now. The rose garden should never be allowed to dry  out. You can maintain steady growth through regular watering and feeding.  Protect new growth from pests by spraying at pre-determined intervals.  </P> <P> One last planting of dahlia tubers will give you fall blooms as the plants you  set out earlier are cutting back.  </P> <P> It's not too late to plant tomatoes. Set them deeper in the ground than they  were in the nursery container to prevent weak, leggy plants.  </P> <P> Dig basins that slope away from the trunks of shrubs and trees. Fill the basins  and allow the water to penetrate deep into the root zone.  </P> <P> Tuberous begonias in pots, beds or hanging baskets should be fertilized on a  regular basis throughout the summer.  </P> <P> Soak hanging basket plants under a sprinkler or in a tub every now and then to  ensure roots are getting thoroughly irrigated.  </P> <P> Source: California Association of Nurserymen.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: SELECTED POKER CHIPS A GOOD BET  </P> <P> Question: I collect items from gambling establishments here -- such as in  Nevada -- and abroad, such as in London and Monte Carlo. I particularly have a  large collection of poker chips from European clubs going back half a century  or more. Do they have much value? -- F.W.  </P> <P> Answer: We have seen individual chips -- properly authenticated as to age and  gambling house -- listed for $50 or more.  </P> <P> This is not to say that collectors at the entry level cannot round up a wide  assortment of gambling-related items at reasonable prices. In this category  would be card decks, dice, books on the subject, casino ashtrays and signs.  Little wonder, then, that there is growing collector interest in this colorful  field.  </P> <P> As for your poker chip collection, many collectors mount them the same way coin  collections are displayed.  </P> <P> Serious collectors say they keep a communications line open to casino officials  so that they have an opportunity to purchase old inventory.  </P> <P> Among magazine collectors, National Geographic has always been a favorite. In  the March, 1989, issue, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the National  Geographic Society, notes that "people have always found it difficult to part  with National Geographics."  </P> <P> For example, he says Dr. Lew Begley of Mesquite, Tex., has about 400,000 copies  of the magazine.  </P> <P> "These individuals are among hundreds of collectors who share a passion for our  magazine," he writes. "Belonging to no association or formal network, they  trade news on the whereabouts of rare issues, such as the flag number of  October, 1917, with its 1,197 color drawings of the world's flags, or the  mushroom issue of May, 1920, treasured by botanists for its detailed paintings  of fungi."  </P> <P> The rarest issues are those published before 1910. Of these, Grosvenor says:  "The earliest issues, they tell me, have become rather expensive. A  well-preserved copy of October, 1888, (Vol. 1, No. 1) might be worth $10,000."  </P></p>

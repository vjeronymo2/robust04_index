			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Markets: Water: half full or half empty? - Serious Money This week's spurt of relief in water company shares prompts two thoughts. First, it is a classic example of investors being more worried by anticipation of bad news than by the news itself. Secondly, many water shares still look sound long term value. Investors were - rightly - afraid that this week's new price caps for water companies (see page IV) would make it harder for the companies to continue paying out such munificent dividends. Brokers' analysts had done lots of pretty accurate sums about what regulator Ian Byatt would decide. But investors still held off until they knew for sure. Once the bogey could be viewed in plain daylight, it looked far less frightening. Speculators who bought ahead of the review will generally have done well - but not if they bought South West, which fell because its price cap was tougher than expected. Moral, if you are going to speculate, go for a spread of shares - unless you are sure of your ground. What matters to more serious investors is the outlook for water shares now. The sector dividend yield is more than 5.1 per cent compared with 3.8 per cent for the market. Yesterday many investors were arguing that most of the shares (but not the luckless South West) had a bit further to go short term  -although prices were racing ahead as they talked. Ten per cent is probably the limit. But long term prospects make them look a solid investment. Some analysts reckon the water companies have scope to increase dividends by over 4 per cent (inflation-adjusted) a year over the next five years. And the bigger increases may come through in the early years. Not bad, given the lack of commercial risk. Laterally minded investors also bought regional electricity shares after the water report. That is too simplistic. There may be a case for electricity shares, but do not base it on water. The Great British Public is thoroughly confused by the Great British Financial services industry. People are worried that they do not understand enough about more complicated products such as personal pensions to make an intelligent choice themselves. They think it vital that a financial adviser should be strictly independent, but very hard to find such independent advice. These are some of the findings from the National Consumer Council's new MORI survey into what people think of personal financial services. The Council describes the lack of consumer confidence as 'worrying'. But in many ways it is rather encouraging. For the public is right to be puzzled by many of the 'products' being sold. It is also right to be suspicious of many of the people selling those products. Consumers have read all the stories about mis-selling of personal pensions, abysmal life insurance surrender values, and ignorant salesmen. And they understand that any salesman who is paid mainly or exclusively by commission must find it hard to give genuinely independent advice. Hence their worry. But hence also the first stirrings of change in a minority of life insurance companies. Only this week Norwich Union switched its sales agents from commission to salaries. If commission is the root of all evil, do not waste time persuading your sales staff to rise above it - just remove the temptation. Costs and commissions are investors' foes. Here is another example of costs at work. Pension top-ups, cosily known as additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), may be a good idea, but you need to watch what you are contributing to. A new survey from actuaries Watsons* confirms one longstanding worry (Weekend FT, April 9, page III). If you opt for a free-standing AVC you may well get a worse result than if you take what your employer offers. For charges are likely to be up to twice as high. Additional contributions seldom go into the main pension scheme: they are run separately. All companies with standard pension schemes have to offer an AVC, and most employers mop up the charges of the scheme. So assuming the underlying investments produce the same stockmarket performance in both cases, the in-house AVC is bound to give a better result. That does not, though, mean that you should opt for a company AVC regardless. It depends what the company is offering. Some merely provide building society linked schemes - which may suit people very close to retirement, but not those with several years to go. But if your employer offers a good with-profit or unit linked scheme run by a financial company with a good record, that will probably be a better choice than a free standing scheme. As Watsons suggests, the best of all worlds is an employer which offers its employees a choice of AVCs. Advertising is an alternative scapegoat for financial upsets. How about a switch to the new Russian system? Businesses can only advertise actual dividend and interest rates paid in the past. Now there is a creative challenge.

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINE AIR STATION VS. COUNTY DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> I will provide the short plank if Mayor Larry Agran of Irvine provides the long  walk, along with everybody else who complains about the noise at the Tustin and  El Toro air stations (April 7).  </P> <P> Agran can try blaming the county, which has cheated on Community Noise  Equivalent Level (CNEL) 65 areas.  </P> <P> But he has only himself to blame for moving into an area with two military  bases that have been there since World War II. Everyone wants to be free, but  few are willing to pay for it.  </P> <P> The noise was here before most of us were here, before most of us were born! As  a resident of central and south Orange County for 41 years and as a former  Marine stationed at El Toro, I know what it takes, as others do, to maintain  freedom. The military has to train and if you move into their training area,  you adapt to them.  </P> <P> So, to Agran and the rest of the yahoos who complain about noise, I wouldn't  call someone who buys a house under a flight pattern an innocent bystander.  </P> <P> I would suggest they relocate to Blythe or Quartsite, where there aren't so  many military aircraft.  </P> <P> DAVID BANNING  </P> <P> Trabuco Canyon  </P></p>

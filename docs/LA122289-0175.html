			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SKEPTICAL KOVIC SOLD ON FILM  </P> <P> Times have mellowed for Ron Kovic, the former Marine paraplegic warrior whose  life is depicted by Tom Cruise in "Born on the Fourth of July."  </P> <P> Once the angry man who rallied the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Kovic is  now occupying himself with art and other creative undertakings. He co-authored  the script for the autobiographical film with director Oliver Stone.  </P> <P> The movie, which opens this week, outlines Kovic's nightmarish passage from  all-American boy and superpatriotic soldier to wheelchair activist against the  war.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, he described his joy that Stone, an old friend and  fellow Vietnam veteran, undertook the task of bringing his life story to film.  </P> <P> Stone's film "Platoon" won four Oscars, including best picture in 1986.  </P> <P> "I knew he could have done anything he wanted to do," Kovic said of Stone. "He  was the biggest director in Hollywood, at that time, in the world."  </P> <P> Kovic, 43, said he was at first skeptical about Cruise. Now, he says he is  astonished at the superstar's performance.  </P> <P> "Many people wondered, 'Could Tom Cruise do it? Could he pull it off?' " Kovic  said. "When he did, it was just so exhilarating."  </P></p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Ericsson falls into SKr363m loss ERICSSON, Sweden's leading telecommunications group, announced yesterday that it suffered a pre-tax loss of SKr363m (Pounds 34.3m) for the first three months of the year, compared with a profit of SKr1.009bn for the same period of 1991. Consolidated net sales fell 11 per cent to SKr9.462bn from SKr10.649bn while income per share was SKr2.44 compared with SKr2.98 for the first three months of last year. The company said the main reason for the deterioration in its financial performance so far this year was the fall in demand in its main overseas markets combined with its determination to stick to its long-term technical development programme. Ericsson forecast that income for 1992 would 'continue to be low' and said its business outlook for the first half of the year was 'very weak'. The full impact of the company's cost savings exercise, which cut 1,810 jobs from its 70,000-strong labour force, will not bring positive results until the second half of the year, said Ericsson. Mr Lars Ramqvist, president, said the 22 per cent improvement in order bookings for the first three months was evidence of the success of the company's research and development strategy. The value of orders rose to SKr13.057bn compared with SKr10.729bn for the same period of 1991. 'The sharp increase that has occurred during the two most recent quarters in orders is the result of specific orders for new systems and products rather than any change in the business climate,' he said. Mr Ramqvist told the annual shareholders' meeting that Ericsson's future as a leading international supplier of telecommunications systems during the 1990s depended on generating earnings so the company could pursue a high level of development activity and capital expenditure, and ensure a positive cash flow and dividend payments. Ericsson reported a sharp fall in net sales revenue from its public telecommunications area in the first quarter to SKr4.163bn from SKr5.262bn but it also reported a marked increase in its order bookings. In its radio communications business, the company reported a substantial rise in orders for pocket telephones and digital systems in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sporting goods side lifts Finnish group A strong performance from its Wilson Sporting Goods arm enabled Amer, the Finnish consumer group, to raise profits sharply in 1993. The group made a profit of FM118m (Dollars 21.2m) in the 10 months to December 31 1993, up 62 per cent from FM73m in the same 1992 period. Pro-forma profits for the whole of 1993 were FM119m, compared with a FM7m loss in 1992. The company is changing its fiscal year to the calendar year. The weaker Finnish markka flattered full-year sales, which climbed to FM7.66bn from FM6.75bn. Excluding currencies, sales were down 3 per cent because of recession in key markets. Operating profit rose to FM366m from FM290m, as the contribution from Wilson helped to offset weaker performances from the group's paper, tobacco and publishing divisions. Wilson, which is strong in the US, doubled operating profits to FM245m as the benefits of new products, marketing and a cost-cutting drive started to show through.</p>

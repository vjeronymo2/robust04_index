			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / US battles to hold share of Japanese chip market THE US-Japan battle over semiconductor trade is not over yet, in spite of the surprise announcement on Friday that the long-sought US target of a 20 per cent foreign share of the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) Japanese semiconductor market had finally been achieved. The US is now pressing Japan for continued improvement in foreign access to its semiconductor market by maintaining an average 20 per cent foreign market share over the next 12 months. Japanese officials said, however, that they would 'reject out of hand' any suggestions for further quantitative measures of market access. As trade officials and industry representatives from both countries gathered in Hawaii for semiconductor trade talks that began yesterday, it was evident that sharp differences remained which could have important implications for trade relations in this and other sectors. Officials from both countries were surprised by Friday's announcement that the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market was 20.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, a 4.3 percentage point jump from the previous quarter. Although the market share rise alleviated trade tension, it also raised new questions about the use of market share as a quantifiable indicator of market access. Japan has always vigorously denied that the 1986 semiconductor agreement guaranteed foreign chip manufacturers a fifth of the Japanese market. The Japanese government's resistance to further use of market share data has been hardened by US suggestions that a similar approach might be applied in other sectors. However, the sharp increase in the foreign share of the Japanese chip market in the fourth quarter could be explained more by economic conditions in Japan than by the significant increase in foreign semiconductor sales. US officials acknowledge that the size of the Japanese semiconductor market declined drastically.</p>

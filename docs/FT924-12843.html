			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The fiscal dilemma facing Clinton Financial markets were awash with speculation last week that a newly elected President Bill Clinton would order an immediate fiscal stimulus next year to kick-start a stagnant or declining economy. Campaigning in Virginia, Mr Clinton reacted cautiously. He said he would review the need for tax cuts or spending increases, but had not yet made any specific decisions. 'I do think there are some ways to accelerate economic activity . . . like accelerating the highway programme. There are ways to do that that wouldn't necessarily increase the deficit,' he said. The speculation about a fiscal boost next year reflects growing anxiety that the US recovery is again losing momentum, despite cuts in interest rates to the lowest levels in a generation. Many American economists believe a negative, recession psychology is so deeply entrenched that a direct injection of purchasing power through higher short-term government borrowing is now the only way to revive the economy. Signs that Europe and Japan are either in or on the brink of recession have heightened fears that too much is being expected of monetary policy. Speaking in Tokyo, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, inadvertently fuelled such fears by hinting that the world could be facing the most intractable downturn in 50 years. The US outlook has undoubtedly worsened since the summer, which is one reason why President George Bush appears so listless in debates; as the depressing figures roll in, his economic record has become all but impossible to defend. The day after Mr Bush cited exports as a bright spot, official figures showed the trade deficit surging in August to an astonishing Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.29bn). This mostly reflected a slump in overseas demand for US goods - a worrying sign that the global slowdown is now inflicting acute pain on US manufacturers, who export up to a quarter of their output. At home, industrial production fell in September for the third month in four, while business inventories rose sharply in the third quarter, suggesting further output cuts are unavoidable. Car sales, which had strengthened a bit at the end of September, fell again early this month. Retail sales were flat in real terms last month, despite an artificial stimulus as households in Florida and Louisiana replaced goods destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. And consumer confidence - a guide to future spending trends - fell again in early October, according to preliminary results from the University of Michigan survey. The figures point to another dip like that in the final quarter of last year, when growth slumped to an annual rate of only 0.6 per cent. The response last year included a surprise 1 percentage point cut in the discount rate and a fiscal stimulus. The extension of unemployment benefits and reduction in tax withholding ordered by the White House in January gave consumption a significant boost early this year. And the economy perked up temporarily, growing at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent in the first quarter. Is another, larger fiscal stimulus now needed despite the large structural budget deficit? Mr Paul Krugman, an MIT professor and informal adviser to the Clinton campaign, favours a stimulus of Dollars 50bn to Dollars 60bn (about 1 percent of GDP) if the economy is still stagnant in January. Along with many US academics, he sees no conflict between higher borrowing today and longer-term action to raise the national savings rate by reducing the budget deficit. Some close advisers to Mr Clinton, however, are more cautious. The nature of this business cycle, says Mr Robert Shapiro, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, raises 'grave doubts' about the efficacy of a fiscal stimulus. I am inclined to share Mr Shapiro's scepticism. After a decade of big deficits, it is hard to believe that more borrowing can help an economy already saddled with far too much debt. Why should financial markets believe that a Clinton administration will ultimately reduce the budget deficit if its very first action is to raise borrowing significantly? The fact that the Bush fiscal stimulus earlier this year had only an ephemeral impact on growth also points to the limitations of fiscal action in the current climate. US companies have reduced costs and greatly increased their efficiency. With low short-term interest rates and a competitive dollar, they ought to be poised for a strong recovery. The inhibiting factors are a pervasive lack of confidence at home and growing weakness of overseas markets. The crucial judgment for the incoming president is how best to revive business confidence. If confidence returns, everything else will come right. If, as some fear, the world is really on the edge of a 1930s style slump, all governments must stand ready to borrow to sustain economic activity. On any other economic scenario, a credible plan to reduce US federal borrowing, starting next year rather than in 1995 or 1996, would seem a better bet. Lower federal borrowing would allow long bond yields to fall sharply, sparking a strong investment-led recovery. In the absence of a sudden revival of the economy, the new president will face a tough decision. Mr Clinton, the front-runner, is showing commendable caution in refusing to make rash commitments.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / US to give Romania three fast patrol boats The United States is to give Romania three fast patrol boats and radar surveillance systems to help with the policing of the river Danube, the Romanian government said yesterday, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Romania has also proposed a meeting with Ukraine tomorrow to discuss better enforcement of UN sanctions against Serbia. The move follows what the UN termed a 'flagrant violation' of sanctions last week by five Serb barges, carrying around 40,000 tonnes of oil. The barges, loaded in Ukraine, reached Serbia after evading Romanian and Bulgarian patrols on the Danube.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / 20% of directors take pay cut One in five directors in some of the UK's biggest companies took a pay cut last year, according to a report by Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International, the recruitment consultants. The report surveyed salaries of more than 1,000 senior executives, in 154 of the UK's largest companies. It found that two in five top executives received less than a 2 per cent increase in their total cash earnings. 'This firmly contradicts the public perception that senior managers are paid inflated salaries,' said Mr Michael Brandon, the Korn/Ferry director who co-wrote the report. But the findings also revealed broad discrepancies in the upper and lower earnings of managers. While 40 per cent of those in the survey had relatively low increases, another 15 per cent had annual increases of more than 30 per cent. More than 40 per cent received increases above 10 per cent. The report said that those earning the highest salaries were generally obtaining proportionally greater increases. The median increase in cash earnings of all the directors of 8.4 per cent was largely due to increased bonuses, said the report. Basic salaries on average rose slightly ahead of inflation, by 4 to 5 per cent. Mr Brandon said: 'What we are finding is that while there is a whole group of people doing very well there is another group of directors out there who are not.' Building Societies and mutual life offices are losing out in competition with the quoted banks and insurance companies to attract the highest quality directors, a report says today. The Incomes Data Services management pay review compares the pay packages of top directors in the 11 largest building societies and 11 mutual life offices with those of equivalent directors in quoted banks and insurances. The IDS report said that the societies were confronting the problem by adopting long-term bonus schemes linked to various measures such as sales achievements and cost controls.

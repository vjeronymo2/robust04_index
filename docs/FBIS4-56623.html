			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Trade Ethics"] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton is correct in promoting  exports, which are responsible for 80 percent of U.S. economic  growth and also for more than 12 million direct jobs.    But as a world trade leader and defender of ethical, free,  and fair competition in international trade, the United States  should be the first to observe the rules, and set an example of  what it preaches.    Following the donation of $800 per ton of frozen chicken  exported to Arab countries, the U.S. Government has now decided  to grant a bonus, within the same system of subsidies (Export  Enhancement Program), of $47 per ton to help sell 798,000 tons  of wheat to the PRC.    The United States thus has no authority to demand within the  GATT/World Trade Organization that developing countries (like  Brazil, India, etc.) be condemned for "social dumping" for  having lower salaries in their export production sectors than do  the industrialized countries.</p>

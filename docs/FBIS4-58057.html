			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hammud </F> Munsir, and Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Southern Forces Prepare To  Launch Revenge Attack After 100 People Are Killed in 'Imran  Fighting"]    [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Damascus -- Military  confrontations between northern and southern forces in Yemen  entered a serious stage yesterday after more than 100 people  were killed from the two sides, among them 20 civilians, and 200  wounded, and after forces moved from northern and southern camps  and set up posts in the areas adjacent to their camps. A state  of maximum alert has been announced among southern forces in  Aden, including the air force, in what has been described as  preparation for launching a revenge attack within 24 hours.    The security situation has become more serious following the  attempt in Sanaa to assassinate Dr. Hasan Makki, first deputy  prime minister and member of the General People Congress [GPC]  General Secretariat (political bureau). [passage omitted]    At the military level, Yemeni sources said that the  continuing tank battles between northern and southern forces in  'Imran, north of the capital, Sanaa, presage an expansion of the  fighting to all Yemeni governorates, especially as military  reports confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the forces  present in all northern and southern camps in the former fringes  area have moved from their barracks and set up posts in the  areas adjacent to their camps.    Authoritative sources in Aden have said that all camps in  the  city, including the air force, are on maximum alert.    The sources expect southern forces to launch a revenge  attack  within the coming 24 hours on northern forces in some southern  governorates. The sources accused Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih of "wanting to eliminate the southern brigades  stationed in the north. So it is difficult to return the  northern forces based in the south peacefully." [passage  omitted]    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday former South  Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad urged the political  leadership and conflicting Yemeni parties to take steps to  quickly contain the crisis and stop the explosion which could  lead to disastrous consequences. He said: The political  leadership must stop evading the crushing crisis Yemen is  experiencing.    He also said: The fighting that broke out among comrades in  arms is unjustifiable, because there can be no victors in this  fighting.    President 'Ali Nasir appealed to the Armed Forces "not to  aim  their weapons against one another, in order to spare blood and  keep the Armed Forces strong and coherent so they can protect  and safeguard the homeland." He urged all parties to adhere to  the Pledge and Accord Document.    Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that the  solution to this crisis should be Yemeni and that others' task  should be to help only. President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad revealed  an initiative he submitted recently to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, saying that this  initiative can form a prelude to a dialogue and breakthrough in  the Yemeni situation.    The former president praised Arab efforts, especially those  being made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and some other  Arab brothers. He said: Everyone in Yemen is responsible for  this conflict; no one can be cleared. And they must rescue  Yemen and the Yemeni people.</p>

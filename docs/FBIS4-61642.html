			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has just held  a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry on the subject  of the Russian Armed Forces being two years old -- results and  prospects. On the telephone with the details is our commentator  Viktor Levin.    [Levin] Defense Minister Pavel Grachev spent an hour and a  half speaking in detail about the state of affairs in the  Russian Armed Forces, pointing out what has been achieved, and  going into great lengths about the shortcomings. But probably  the main thing which needs to be emphasized above all else is  the fact that over the past two years the military, as the  defense minister said, has begun to clearly realize the  responsibility that lies with the Armed Forces.    The defense minister gave an assurance that Russia's Armed  Forces have become a reliable state institution and the  guarantor of stability in our Russian Federation. The  realities, indeed, are these, Pavel Grachev said: the Armed  Forces -- and he expressed his immense gratitude to the  soldiers, sergeants, warrant officers, officers, generals, and  admirals -- remain completely battleworthy.    At the same time, the defense minister noted that there are  three tasks which require a solution at state level. They are,  first and foremost, reliable and stable financing within the  limits required by the Defense Ministry. Secondly, ensuring  that the personnel are up to strength. According to the defense  minister, one soldier now has to do the work of ten. This is  the result of being under strength. The outcome of this is that  the burden on young soldiers of 18 years of age is so great that  many cannot stand up to it. In the defense minister's opinion,  no matter what the army commanders do, this problem will not be  solved without a state decision and without the Armed Forces  being brought up to full strength. And the third conclusion was  to ensure normal housing and living conditions for servicemen  and their families. Pavel Grachev gave the following example:  last year over 50,000 apartments were built. This is a whole  town, but this is insignificantly small because over these past  few years there has been a very great movement of troops from a  number of states which are now considered to be foreign and even  from the present states of the CIS.    Replying to questions, the minister dealt in detail on the  problems of staging the joint Russian-American exercises at the  Totskoye proving ground. According to Grachev, if we really  want to mutually get rid of the image of an enemy and move  towards partnership, these exercises are vital. He admitted  that these exercises were of a symbolic nature: they were not  military exercises in the pure sense, they were peace-keeping  exercises, and he believes that they should definitely take  place. One may think about the right time -- it may be that  summer is not the best time when the crops are ripening and the  harvest coming up -- but this issue is, I would say, a very  minor one. The defense minister stressed several times that it  was necessary to hold these exercises, for the sake of peace and  for the sake of friendship. This is Viktor Levin, from the  Ministry of Defense.</p>

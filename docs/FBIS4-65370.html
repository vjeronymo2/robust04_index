			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Training of Estonian Policemen </F> Useful for Finland as Well"]    [Text] The training of Estonian policemen in Finland has  gotten under way. In early spring the Police Institute in Espoo  already had a few Estonian policemen for a brief course. At the  Police School in Tampere a crime investigation course, in which  Estonian investigators participate for the first time, is  currently under way.    The police department of Finland's Ministry of the Interior  and the head of Estonia's police have agreed on intensified  cooperation in training. This year about 30 Estonian policemen  will take courses in Finland.    Chief Inspector Matti Launiainen of the Interior Ministry's  police department says that the training of Estonian policemen  also gets the Finnish policemen used to international relations.  Finland also benefits from the Estonian policemen by acquiring  current information about crime in the east.    The first experience from the training cooperation is good.  The language represents the biggest problem, but it is not  insurmountable. The training language is Finnish.    Criminal investigator Ain Balder from Tartu says that  economic criminals in Estonia have a five-year lead over the  police. This lead is what one is now trying to shorten with the  training in Finland.    The strong moral self-esteem of the Finnish police appeals  to  the Estonian policemen, says Balder. In Estonia there are  problems of suspicion about receiving bribes. This is ballast  from the Soviet era that one should get rid of, he says.    Balder believes that personal contacts across the Bay of  Finland will make criminal investigation in both countries more  efficient. It is surely better to get help through direct  contacts than via Interpol or other official international  channels, he says.</p>

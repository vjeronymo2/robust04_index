			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Pits facing closure will be offered for sale, says coal chief A NEW possibility of reprieve for some of the 31 threatened coal pits emerged yesterday as Mr Neil Clarke, the British Coal chairman, said that any which would still be closed under the government's revised scheme would be offered for sale. His statement came as Mr John Major and senior ministers prepared to finalise proposals for the draft white paper on energy in the light of Friday's report by the cross-party trade and industry committee of MPs. The white paper, due to be discussed by cabinet on Thursday, must take account of the committee's plans to increase the annual market for deep-mined British coal by 16m tonnes or more for five years at a cost of about Pounds 500m. Mr Clarke told The Money Programme on BBC television: 'If they are going to be closed and people wish to operate them, as far as I am concerned they will be offered for sale to those who wish to operate them.' Such a move would not take the pits off the political agenda completely, however, as private mining companies might well seek redundancies or new working practices in order to cut costs. Estimates of how many pits would be saved if the committee's recommendations were adopted go as high as 25, although others have been more cautious in their assessment. Mr Keith Hampson, a Tory committee member, suggested the report's plans could save 13 to 17 of the pits. At Westminster, opinion appears to be hardening that, in order to avoid risking defeat in the Commons, the government needs to raise its own proposals of expanding the market for coal by about 12m tonnes, to save around half the threatened pits. Tory MPs on all sides of the argument have intensified their lobbying of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. He has been holding meetings with individual MPs, but in the run-up to publication - expected around the middle of this month - he will be seeing lobbies such as the Conservative coal group. He is also likely to meet the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers. Mr Heseltine should resign over the pit closure row, according to 53 per cent of those questioned for a Mori survey for the Coalfield Communities Campaign, an all-party association of coalfield local authorities.</p>

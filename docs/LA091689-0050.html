			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC'S LATINO STRATEGY  </P> <P> Regarding "ABC Ad Strategy Takes Aim at Latino Viewers" (Sept. 8):  </P> <P> Reporter Claudia Puig quotes ABC Entertainment executive Mark Zakarin as saying  that his father "would read a Jewish intellectual journal and point out the ads  for Ford Motor Co. 'It was like Ford cared about Jews in American. . . . So he  actually bought a Ford.' "  </P> <P> There was a sad irony in Zakarin's remarks. Automotive pioneer Henry Ford was  one of the most virulent anti-Semites this country has ever produced. Ford's  irrational hatred and suspicion of Jews was comparable to Hitler's, and he did  what he could to attack them, using his company's resources. Perhaps his most  hateful contribution to the annals of racism was his financing of the  publication of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion," a forgery that many  people still wrongly believe to be an actual account of a Jewish conspiracy to  control international finance and the media. This particular bit of libel is  still fueling racism and anti-Semitism around the world. An edition was  recently issued in Japan, once again purporting to be an authentic document.  </P> <P> PETER SAGAL  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

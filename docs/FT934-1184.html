			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Service sector and consumers lift economy The economy expanded more quickly in the third quarter than previously thought, thanks largely to relatively high growth in service industries and consumer spending. In the latest quarter gross domestic product grew 2.1 per cent from a year earlier. The previous estimate was 1.9 per cent. A big factor explaining the higher growth was the 2.6 per cent year-on-year growth in the third quarter in consumer spending, particularly on furniture, carpets and cars. Between July and September service-sector output expanded 2.4 per cent on a year earlier, with an especially sharp growth in retailing, hotels and catering and financial services. Excluding oil and gas extraction, the economy in the third quarter grew 1.8 per cent on the year, higher than the 1.6 per cent previous estimate. This measure of output was up 0.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, after 0.4 per cent quarterly growth recorded between April and June. The figures from the Central Statistical Office are adjusted for seasonal changes and inflation. They indicate that people have gradually increased their spending under the influence of lower interest rates, a fall in saving and a slow rise in personal incomes, due partly to falling unemployment. In the third quarter the savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of personal disposable income - was 10.6 per cent after 11.7 per cent between April and June. After averaging 12.6 per cent during last year, the ratio in the latest quarter was at its lowest since the fourth quarter of 1991. Unadjusted for inflation, personal disposable income increased a quarterly 0.3 per cent in the third three-month period, to show a 3.1 per cent rise on the year. Manufacturers have benefited from export volumes holding up reasonably well, while in the third quarter construction output rose a real, inflation-adjusted 0.2 per cent on the previous three months, the first quarter-on-quarter increase for three years. Among individual service sectors, distribution - including retailing, catering and hotels - increased output 3.4 per cent in the last quarter on a year previously and 1 per cent on the quarter. Financial services, and transport and communication saw comparable figures of 3.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent, and 1.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent. In other highlights from the figures: Total gross domestic product increased 0.6 per cent in the third quarter on the previous three months. In the first nine months of the year the economy expanded 1.75 per cent on the comparable period last year. In the third quarter consumer spending was 1 per cent higher than between April and June. Spending on furniture, floor coverings and cars was 20.6 per cent, 17.5 per cent and 9.6 per cent higher than in the equivalent period last year, with these three areas showing quarterly rises of 5.6 per cent, 4.5 per cent and 4 per cent. In the third quarter total gross domestic product was 1.3 per cent lower than at the last peak in output in early 1990, but 2.5 per cent higher than at the bottom of the recession in the second quarter of last year.</p>

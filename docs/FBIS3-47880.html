Though debates during the special Diet session failed to  flesh out the real image of the Hosokawa coalition government,  during press conferences, Hosokawa, his eyes on approval  ratings, shows himself to be a very competent and skilled  performer.    Introducing a White House style to his very first press  conference soon after taking office, Hosokawa startled those  present while also creating a fresh, new impression by pointing  his pen at reporters, indicating whose questions he would take  next.    When he was ready to announce his economic emergency  measures, though short on particulars, he sat himself down  before a panel of questioners, explaining and assessing the  measures himself, clearly viewing the occasion not so much as a  press conference as a way into the nation's living rooms via the  television.    The substance of these economic measures--a package of  deregulatory measures and proposed government spending amounting  to about 6.2 trillion yen to stimulate the economy and help  businesses recoup profits lost by the high yen exchange  rate--were not enough to satisfy domestic industries or United  States demands, but coming just before the new administration's  inauguration, perhaps they were about as much as could be  expected.    The new government is a coalition of eight parties. It is  probably like the saying, "to expect a lot, in the end, is to  cry for the moon."    But even granting the unusualness of an eight-party  coalition, voters are not going to give the new administration  an indefinite period of grace. The most important job for the  new administration at this point, as far as the voters are  concerned, is stimulating the economy. Closely related to this,  too, are the economic talks between the United States and Japan.  Even if political reform is put through, there is no guarantee  that voters will be seeing a turn for the better in their  standard of living.    Nor, supposing that we have an electoral system combining  single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, can  we assume that necessarily means an improvement in government or  better politicians.    When all is said and done, we still haven't a clear idea of  where the Hosokawa coalition government is headed. Even Prime  Minister Hosokawa's leadership ability is an unknown quantity.    Moreover, even without these questions, the new government  is  said to have a "dual power structure." The person drawing a  great deal of attention is Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, one of the key figures in the  formation of the coalition.    Takemura the Best Choice as Chief Cabinet Secretary    It is not an exaggeration to say Shinseito has a monopoly on  the new administration's key posts with Tsutomu Hata as deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, Hirohisa Fujii as finance  minister, Hiroshi Kumagai as head of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], Eijiro Hata as  agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister, and Keisuke  Nakanishi as general director of the Defense Agency.    Ozawa, for his part, heads the ruling coalition's highest  coordinating body, the Representatives Forum [daihyosha  kaigi], which is made up of the secretary generals and  general secretaries [and their equivalents from the coalition  parties]. With Komeito secretary general Yuichi Ichikawa and  Democratic Socialist Party general secretary Takeshi Yonezawa  teamed together to form a scrummage, the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ], no matter how hard it tries, finds itself  outnumbered. Young SDPJ general-secretary Hirotaka Akamatsu has  had more than he can handle.    Clearly, a dual power structure exists. But, ironically,  because of the new coalition's fragility, this dual structure  has not come prominently to the fore. Keeping in mind that no  one stands to gain if the coalition breaks apart, the parties  are exercising restraint to avoid that danger.    Still speaking in general terms, the coalition came safely  out of the special Diet session. However, specifics will be  argued when parties meet for the extraordinary session of the  Diet. Naturally, frictions and contradictions in the dual power  structure will be unavoidable.    Hosokawa has surrounded the Official Residence with members  of the Sakigake [Harbinger]. For its part, the Shinseito wanted  Kumagai to fill the post of chief cabinet secretary and  Toshihiro Nikai, the post of deputy cabinet secretary.    The chief cabinet secretary's function is that of cabinet  coordinator and spokesperson, a role that comes from his serving  as the prime minister's right-hand man and in a capacity similar  to head clerk, or banto, for members of the cabinet.  Traditionally, as probably only natural, prime ministers have  chosen only those whom they could place their greatest trust in  for the post. Since all information to and from the Official  Residence goes through his hands, his political importance is  without comparison to other members of the cabinet.    If Kumagai had become chief cabinet secretary, because he  belongs to Ozawa's innermost circle of associates, Prime  Minister Hosokawa might have been labeled an Ozawa puppet.    The best choice, and the one Hosokawa finally settled on,  was  Sakigake president Masayoshi Takemura. Close friends since their  days as governor, Takemura and Hosokawa helped each other out  during the recent lower house election, and the Sakigake is soon  to merge with Hosokawa's Japan New Party.    Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation] chairman Akira  Yamagishi, said to have been one of the leading actors in the  formation of the new coalition government, met separately with  Hosokawa and Takemura prior to the Cabinet's inauguration.    Relating his impressions of both politicians, he says: "It's  hard to tell whether Hosokawa has any content. I guess you could  say he's `fuzzy.' Takemura, on the other hand, has a philosophy,  and because he expresses himself frankly, he's persuasive."    In fact, Takemura seems to have made the better impression  of  the two.    During their meeting, Takemura sought Yamagishi's  understanding of his position. "I've worked with the labor  unions (as governor)," he said, "so I understand the situation  of Rengo (and the labor unions). But aside from me, members of  Sakigake haven't had any experience with labor unions other than  in what you might call an adversarial relationship. Eventually,  I can get them to understand, but it'll take a while, so I need  time."    Yamagishi said he understood. It was probably this kind of  exchange that left him with his favorable impression of Takamura.    Shift in the Official Residence Toward Sakigake    Hosokawa eventually chose Yukio Hatoyama to serve as his  deputy cabinet secretary. The decision was so sudden it even  took Hatoyama by surprise. Having ceded the chief cabinet  secretary's post to Takemura, Shinseito put up a fight,  unwilling to relinquish the deputy cabinet secretary post.  Acting as a coordinator and informational liaison to the ruling  coalition party, the deputy cabinet secretary can be likened to  an "official residence affairs committee chairman." Without a  doubt, it was a post Ozawa wanted for Shinseito. Before a  decision was made, the party leaked a story to the press, saying  Toshihiro Nikai's appointment had been firmed up. This  "appointment by the press" is probably a good indication of just  how determined the party was.    Another Sakigake appointee was Hideyuki Tanaka for the newly  created post of special assistant to the prime minister.    The line around the prime minister was closed with the  appointment of this Sakigake trio, forming what we imagine when  we hear of a troop lineup that is so tight as to be virtually  "leak proof."    Nor was this the end of it. A shakeup occurred less than a  month after Norihiko Narita took up his duties as senior  (private) secretary to the prime minister.    Constantly at the side of prime minister, the senior  secretary has to work with him as though one in body and spirit.  Various types have filled the position in the past. If there  have been "bigwigs" in the position who made suggestions and  pointed out problems with regard to policy matters, there have  also been others who acted as liaisons to the mass media and  still others who were in charge of carrying out the prime  minister's personal errands.    The very nature of the job requires someone whom the prime  minister can trust. Most often it is a relative or a reporter  who has been assigned to cover his career over the years and has  been in constant contact with him.    Narita, however, had had almost no face-to-face contact with  Hosokawa before taking the job. The political conference section  head of the National Diet Library, Narita was known as an  authority on research concerning electoral systems.    One of Ozawa's "brains" when it came to questions about the  electoral system, Narita apparently received his appointment  through Ozawa's recommendation.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura explains Narita's transfer  less than a month after taking up his post, saying, "Since the  ruling coalition party had completed work on its political  reform bill, Narita's duties were finished."    No one in Nagata-cho, however, is inclined to accept this  explanation at face value.    According to an Official Residence reporter, "Even after  becoming the Prime Minister's secretary, Narita was going in and  out of Ozawa's place. He was probably leaking Official Residence  information to Ozawa, wasn't he? Because of that, the Sakigake  trio--Takemura, Hatoyama, and Tanaka--had kept him at a  respectful distance."    Generally, one never hears of the prime minister's head  secretary being in charge of the formulation of a specific bill.  That would just never be part of a secretary's job description.  If he was being sought for his abilities as a specialist on  election systems, there ought to have been a better, more  suitable place for him than in the secretary's office.    In fact, there is talk that Narita will be one of  Shinseito's  candidates for the next lower house election. Being senior  secretary to the prime minister, even for a short while, sounds  much better in running for an office than being a section head  at the National Diet Library, so perhaps Narita didn't lose out  after all.    Thus, the shift toward Sakigake that has been going on in  the  Official Residence has been completed.    Ozawa, Master Designer and Planner    Takemura appears now to be the Official Residence's  designated "guardsman" and can cross swords on an equal footing  with people like Ozawa, Shinseito's "strongman behind the  scenes."    Takemura definitely seems to have become a presence for  Ozawa  that touches on his nerves.    True, compared to Ozawa, who has been reelected to the Diet  now for his ninth term, Takemura has only been elected to his  third term. Ozawa also has the experience of having wielded the  scepter of secretary general for the powerful Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP]. Though Takemura can claim experience as governor,  in what counts most for the LDP--number of reelected terms--a  large gap still exists between Ozawa and Takemura.    For Ozawa, Takemura must seem like a political "greenhorn."    Takemura probably wouldn't agree. Though he may not have  been  reelected to as many terms as Ozawa, he has served his home  state as governor and, being eight years Ozawa's senior, is in  no way his inferior, Takemura would probably say, when it comes  to life experience. Being what might be called "tenaciousness,"  Takemura is tough and skilled at persuasion and the art of  negotiating from his experiences heading local government.    Still a graduate student at Nihon University, Ozawa hastily  entered politics as his father's successor upon the latter's  death, and has no experience in the real world outside of  politics. Moreover, always in the political mainstream, first as  a member of the Tanaka faction and then the Takeshita faction,  Ozawa might be likened to a greenhouse plant. Used to having  political authority on his side, he can be tough but is also  often criticized for his arrogance.    Even those who know him well from their days together in the  Kobuchi faction agree that Ozawa is a man of strong likes and  dislikes who is known for acting arbitrarily on his own  authority.    During his LDP days, an "Ozawa containment" net was setup,  probably the result of opposition to his methods.    Without having to refer to his recent book, Blueprint  for Building a New Japan," we know Ozawa is a master  designer, able to lay out a blueprint for himself based on a  world view and national vision.    Foresight, philosophy, vision--these are all things that are  indispensable to politicians, and to the degree that these  qualities are missing in politicians these days, Ozawa's  presence looms up all the more prominently in our impressions.    But he is also self-conceited and has made enemies and  created rivals.    Takemura, Single-Minded Attention to Political  Reform    Takemura is Ozawa's opposite. When he founded and took on  the  chairmanship of the Utopia Political Study Group, a forerunner  to the present Sakigake Party, he was still a freshman in the  Diet.    The impetus to form the group was the Recruit scandal. The  group started from the desire to study the relationship between  money and politics. The group gathered information and later  released its findings (though the latter was not part of its  initial plan) on the amount of funds each of its 20 members  spent on an annual basis for political activities. Even for  first year Diet members, about 116 million yen on average was  found to be needed, and when these finding were released, they  caused quite a stir, leading to a ban on political gifts for  ceremonial occasions by Diet members in their local election  districts.    In the end, Takemura concluded that the only effective way  to  reform the political system was to change the electoral system,  and he was seen running around during the [Toshiki] Kaifu  administration putting together a proposal for combining  single-seat constituencies with proportional representation.    The director of LDP's Political Reform Promotion  Headquarters  was Masayoshi Ito. Its chairman was Masaharu Gotoda. Takemura  became the reform headquarter's secretary general, a post which  he kept until he left the party.    The relationship between Takemura and Gotoda goes back to  when Takemura, after graduating from Tokyo University, went to  the Ministry of Home Affairs for a [job] interview. It was  Gotoda who was on the hiring line as chief secretary to the  minister.    Takemura is said to have taken part in the student movement,  but Gotoda stood up for the young applicant, asserting, "The  Home Affairs Ministry needs that kind of energy."    Core members of Takemura's Utopia Study Group became key  figures in the formation of the Young Dietmen's Forum To Promote  Political Reform (sponsors, Shigeru Ishiba and Susumu Yanase).  The group came into existence following the Kaifu  administration's aborted attempt to get a political reform bill  passed.    Takemura turned his energies toward effecting political  reform, working in conjunction with this group of young Diet  members, but around March of this year, all but a few had given  up any hope of realizing their hopes for reform.    At about this time, Yukio Hatoyama, Kenichiro Sato, Takeshi  Iwaya, and others had already resigned themselves to leaving the  LDP. The 10 who eventually bolted the party to join Sakigake  were all members of this young Dietmen's group.    Ozawa, on the other hand, stayed with the party even after  the split-up of the Takeshita faction following Shin Kanemaru's  resignation from the Diet. To the very end, steps were being  taken to have Ozawa designated Kanemaru's successor as party  chairman. After the split, Ozawa and Hata joined hands to form  their own faction, hesitating until the eleventh hour to secede  from the party.    Advocating electoral reform, the two played a brilliant hand  in transforming themselves into the "party of reform." But if we  look back over the road Ozawa has traveled, it is hard to rid  ourselves completely of the suspicion that his reform arguments  are just rhetoric being used in a struggle for political power.    Coalition's Ability To Govern Questioned    Although it is true that, only being in his third term,  Takemura was hardly in the position to participate in power  struggles within the LDP or within its factions, still, his  motives for advocating political reform, in contrast to Ozawa's,  strike us as being pure. After all, isn't of the reasons that  the Sakigake people want to draw the line between themselves and  the Shinseito their opposition to Ozawa and his tendency to  engage in power struggles?    Even if Sakigake joins up with the Japan New Party, it is  unthinkable that it will get ever together with Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] to form still another new party.    It is not certain that the election reform bill will be  passed, but attention is sure to be focused on the tug-of-war  between the Shinseito-Komeito camp, which is aiming for a  two-party system, and the Sakigake-Japan New Party, as well as  the future direction of the Hosokawa coalition government. As  long as the Hosokawa coalition stays in power, however, no  decisive confrontation is likely to occur between Ozawa and  Takemura. For they know, if they were to cause the collapse of  the coalition government, they would only be bringing trouble on  themselves.    The Hosokawa coalition is often said to be like a fine piece  of glasswork. Certainly, an eight party coalition government has  no precedent in Europe, where most governments are formed  through coalitions. Nor has there ever been a past case where  the head of the fifth-ranking party becomes prime minister.    But it is a truism that applies not only to governments: an  object that looks fragile ends up staying intact. That is  because it is handled with special care so it doesn't break. Of  course, there are seemingly unbreakable objects which may have  an internal flaw that causes it to splinter. The ability of the  Hosokawa coalition government is certain to come under scrutiny  and questioned, but one thing seems certain: for the time being,  ruling coalition members are not expected to fight, nor can they  afford to.    The question is Ozawa, the politician. He is a strategist  and  the type of politician who shows formidable skills on the  offensive. How long will he be able to endure the vague  misgivings of those on watch [around Hosokawa]?    Will there be reminders of events two years ago, when his  high-handed attempts to force the candidacy of Hisanori Isomura  for the Tokyo gubernatorial race failed?    Probably, Takemura will take an unhurried stance, allowing  himself time to grasp the political situation around him. In  point of flexibility, he is Ozawa's superior. If these two very  different men can skillfully mesh gears, the Hosokawa coalition  government may be able to enjoy an unexpected sense of security  and well-being. The key to its future is held by these two men.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Universities urge Lords to reject Clarke compromise UNIVERSITY vice-chancellors are urging peers to reject a compromise over government powers to intervene in universities when the plan is debated in the Lords, Andrew Adonis writes. The controversy arises from the Further and Higher Education Bill, currently before the Lords. As originally framed, the bill gave ministers the right to issue directions to particular institutions as they saw fit. After pressure from universities, and backed by an all-party group of peers, Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, agreed to re-examine the issue. However, the new clauses he has tabled - decided without consulting the committee of vice-chancellors - narrow the proposed powers without removing them. Under them, ministers may not intervene to direct the content of courses of study or research, although they may limit their duration, a power the government is keen to retain. The committee believes the new formula still gives too much scope for intervention. In a letter to Mr Clarke, Mr David Harrison, the committee chairman, calls instead for the bill to specify those circumstances in which the government may intervene. He believes intervention should 'be by way of special directions subject to parliamentary consent'. In the Lords today, Baroness Young, a former Conservative education minister, will attempt to broaden the new limits set out by Mr Clarke. In particular, she proposes that ministers should have no powers over the admission of students or the appointment of academic staff to universities. Six colleges of higher education in Wales have indicated that they would like to join the University of Wales, leading to fears that the university could break up in its present form. Such a move could lead to some of the six colleges that comprise the federal university seeking to set up as universities in their own right.</p>

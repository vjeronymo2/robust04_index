			<p>BFN     [Text] Mashhad (Khorasan), April 22, IRNA -- Doctors at the  Qaem hospital here have described the condition of Friday prayer  leader Mohammad Abaei Khorasani, as "satisfactory". Hojjat  ol-eslam Abaei who substituted as the Friday prayer leader  today, was shot at by a lone gunman just as he had finished the  sermon.    "Luckily the bullets hit the back of his shoulder and did  not  cause him any serious injury," said Dr. Fattahi the Mashhad  representative to the National Parliament (Majlis) who happens  to be a specialist surgeon by profession.    The terrorist tried to shoot himself and was injured badly  when faced with the fury of the worshippers. He was immediately  whisked away by law officials.</p>

GRS 23 will now read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=3 --> General Records Schedule 23  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> Records Common to Most Offices Within Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> This schedule provides for the disposal of certain records common to most offices in Federal agencies. It covers administrative subject files; facilitative records such as suspense files, tracking and control records, calendars, and indexes; and transitory documents. This schedule does not apply to any materials that the agency has determined to be nonrecord or to materials such as calendars or work schedules claimed as personal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office Administrative Files described under item 1 are records retained by an originating office as its record of initiation of an action, request, or response to requests for information. This item may be applied only to separate administrative files containing such records as copies of documents submitted to other offices for action including budget feeder documents, purchase orders, training requests. Item 1 may not be applied to files that also contain program records, and it may not be applied by an office that receives and takes action on documents submitted by other offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several items covering electronic records produced on stand-alone or networked personal computers (such as word processing files, administrative databases, and spreadsheets) that were previously in this schedule have been moved to General Records Schedule 20, Electronic Records. To preserve the previous numbering of the items in GRS 23, the item numbers that have been moved have been reserved. The disposition of records described in this schedule that are created in electronic form is governed by GRS 20, items 3, 13, 14, and 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Item 1.

They may also include copies of internal activity and workload reports (including work progress, statistical, and narrative reports prepared in the office and forwarded to higher levels) and other materials that do not serve as unique documentation of the programs of the office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Destroy when 2 years old, or when no longer needed, whichever is sooner.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This schedule is not applicable to the record copies of organizational charts, functional statements, and related records that document the essential organization, staffing, and procedures of the office, which must be scheduled prior to disposition by submitting an SF 115 to NARA.]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Items 2&hyph;4.

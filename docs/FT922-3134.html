			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster leaders in further talks NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders yesterday held an intensive series of meetings without any resolution of the problems which have deadlocked the inter-party talks on the province's political future. After nine hours of negotiations in Belfast, a brief statement said only that further meetings would be held today. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has been exploring if, or when, talks might move to the second 'strand' - involving the Irish government. So far discussions have been only on possible systems of devolution for Northern Ireland.</p>

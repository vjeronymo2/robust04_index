Kozyrev had earlier held talks with Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat with regard to giving a boost to the Middle East  peace process. This was also the chief topic of a meeting  between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and President 'Arafat.    The Palestinian president held a dinner banquet in honor of  the Russian foreign minister, to which Foreign Minister Ben  Yahia was invited. After the dinner talks were held between the  Palestinian and Russian delegations. Mr. Ben Yahia also  attended the discussions.    After the two-hour working session with President 'Arafat  and  his aides, which was attended by Mr. Ben Yahia, the Russian  foreign minister announced in Tunis that the PLO chairman is  ready to resume the negotiations with Israel. He told  journalists, in President 'Arafat's presence, that he was very  pleased to announce that President 'Arafat had made a most  important and brave political decision by promising to resume  the negotiations and continue the peace process.    President 'Arafat, who avoided talking about the resumption  of negotiations with Israel, confined himself to saying that he  remains committed to the peace process despite the tragedy and  the massacre.    The Russian foreign minister stressed the brave character of  President 'Arafat's decision and pointed out his great  contribution to establishing an era of comprehensive and just  peace in the Middle East. He added that he had given President  'Arafat an invitation from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to  visit Moscow, without specifying a date.    President 'Arafat declared that the Palestinian leadership  is  expecting guarantees from the peace co-sponsors -- that is, the  United States and Russia -- for the protection of the  Palestinian people and their holy places. He said also that it  is expecting Israel to carry out confidence-building measures  for the continuation of the peace process.    The Russian foreign minister stated that what is required is  to work first and specifically for reaching an agreement on Gaza  and Jericho as soon as possible. He stressed that his country  will work with all determination for the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September between the PLO  and Israel. He then emphasized that the United States and  Russia had pledged, in their capacity as co-sponsors of the  peace process, to watch over the full implementation of the  resolution which will be adopted by the UN Security Council on  the Hebron massacre. He also said that he will hold specific  and serious talks with his U.S. counterpart at their meeting on  Monday, regarding the elements of the resumption of peace and on  the guarantees that the peace co-sponsors must provide in order  to guarantee continuous progress for these negotiations.    On his arrival in Tunis for a brief visit, the Russian  foreign minister said that Tunisia's role is essential within  the framework of the efforts for the resumption of the Middle  East peace process. He said that he had come to meet Foreign  Minister Ben Yahia and President 'Arafat; he wished, he said, to  express to President 'Arafat Russia's support for his brave  leadership, his efforts to establish peace in the region, and  his determination to prevent the enemies of peace from impeding  its course. He added that he would hold thoroughgoing talks  with President 'Arafat on the current situation in the region  and ways to push forward the peace process.    Asked whether he had any proposals, he said: We have some  ideas but we rely on the wisdom of President 'Arafat and his  aides for progressing along the course of peace. He then  pointed out that he had an important message from President  Boris Yeltsin to President 'Arafat.    With regard to the Russian proposal concerning a call for a  new international peace conference on the Middle East, Mr.  Kozyrev said that that proposal remains open and what is certain  now is the need to focus on seeking the means to rescue the  peace process.</p>

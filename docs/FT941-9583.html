			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Eyes on Japan as markets shiver Global bond and equity markets are gearing up for another nervous week, with US-Japanese trade frictions provoking the latest jitters. Following the failure of trade talks in Washington on Friday, many fear that the US will try to push the yen higher as a way to close the trade gap. 'Tokyo is the place to watch,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS. A higher yen could hamper recovery and have a severe impact on the Tokyo stock market, which could drag other markets lower. Early today in Tokyo, the dollar opened at Y106.15 - its lowest level since mid-November - compared with Y107.1 at the end of New York trading on Friday. Japanese equities fell sharply, with the Nikkei average down some 400 points at about 19,600 after an hour's trading. European markets will once again be in the thrall of the Bundesbank, whose council meets on Thursday. The central bank may be reluctant to ease monetary policy ahead of a wage agreement in the engineering sector. Unchanged German interest rates could put renewed pressure on other European markets. Faced with a slew of economic data, the UK markets are in for a nervous week, although the worst may be over after last week's sell-off. UK fund managers' views, Page 16</p>

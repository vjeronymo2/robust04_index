			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / National party battles to redraw S African role: Speculation mounts that it might withdraw from the cabinet as it attempts to find a political identity Having served nearly three months as junior partner in South Africa's coalition government, deputy president F W de Klerk's National party is struggling to find an independent political role for itself in the new regime. Amid widespread reports that several backbenchers and some senior members are advocating that the party withdraw from the cabinet and take up a more traditional opposition role, the NP is trying to develop a new policy framework ahead of next week's opening of parliament. Speculation about the NP's future has been so intense that it has affected the stock market. On Wednesday the party was forced to publish an official statement denying any plans to leave the cabinet, and defending its 'important and constructive' role in the government of national unity mandated by the new South African constitution. Under that constitution all parties which won more than 5 per cent of the vote in April's elections are entitled to proportionate cabinet representation. The National party has six cabinet members, but with the recent resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister and his impending replacement by Mr Chris Liebenberg, who is not a member of any political party, its representation will be reduced to five. Mr Keys' resignation also leaves the NP without any cabinet members in senior positions as it had earlier lost a struggle to retain one of the security portfolios. With the party's scope for independent manoeuvre limited by the need for cabinet consensus, local analysts have begun to question whether it will be able to survive as an independent political force. The problem has been exacerbated by the low profile Mr de Klerk has kept since the elections. Before the poll he and President Nelson Mandela were seen as something of a double act. Mr de Klerk now lacks an effective executive position in government and has been largely relegated to the political background. This has been, in part, a deliberate decision by the NP to give the new government time to find its feet but, privately, NP ministers have complained about insufficient ANC consultation in government policy-making and younger party members are eager to break free of the artificial political coalition and begin to criticise ANC policies more openly. With a huge amount of controversial legislation due to be debated in the new parliamentary session, the party has realised it must stake out an independent political position for itself. To this end the NP is due to draw up a new policy framework at a party conference today and Mr de Klerk is set to make a statement on Monday in which he is expected to outline a plan of action.</p>

Ostrer, St. Petersburg Technical Institute; UDC 502.7:276.8]    [Abstract] The natural exoenzymatic decomposition of  lignocellulose is performed by aerobic bacteria, actinomycetes,  and fungi in ecological microbial succession. Technologies for  the microbial conversion of cellulose to produce protein,  glucose, alcohol, and fuels are being developed on that basis.  But the supramolecular structure of cellulose and its  association with other components of the plant cell --  specifically, lignin and hemicellulose -- represent a serious  obstacle to enzymatic attack and effective conversion. Although  chemical processing of substrates is widely used to raise  nutritional value and to intensify the processes of  biotransformation, reagents are difficult to regenerate,  equipment has strict requirements, and the process is expensive.  Since depolymerases of symbiotic microorganisms effect  decomposition in natural biocenoses, the researchers here chose  to examine rapidly growing micromycetes that produce an entire  complex of depolymerases. The most promising such micromycetes,  in their view, were strains of the Aspergillus  fungus, because they produce a broad range of hydrolytic  enzymes. The researchers used Aspergillus sp.  VKPMF-559 in the direct conversion of corn cobs. The protein  yield over an 18-hour period of cultivation was 17.2 percent,  with 80 percent utilization of cellulose.

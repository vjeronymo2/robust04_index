			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- A meeting between President  Boris Yeltsin and U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has  begun in the Kremlin. Greeting his guest, Yeltsin said that the  world situation had changed during the past two years. Blocs  ceased to exist, and for this reason "the role of the United  Nations organisations became absolutely different." The  president explained that "the U.N. has become more active of  late, and its role in settling some controversial problems has  been enhanced."    Yeltsin intends to discuss with Butrus Butrus-Ghali the key  problems dealing with the functioning of the U.N. and with the  work of the Security Council. They may touch upon other  problems, including a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis.</p>

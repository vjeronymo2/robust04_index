			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: The morning after The Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England will have plenty to talk about when they meet this morning for their monthly chat about interest rate policy. In economic terms, the effect of last night's political upset is not very significant. At stake was a tax increase which would have increased the net take from VAT by not much more than Pounds 1bn - a figure which amounts to little more than a rounding up adjustment when set against total spending of the order of Pounds 300bn. Certainly the Chancellor should not have much difficulty in fulfilling the promise that he would find ways of making good the shortfall in his statement tomorrow. The potential political damage is much more serious. The government's tactics in attempting to bring unruly backbenchers back into line are shown to have been deeply flawed. Its ability to control its own finances can no longer be taken for granted. The assumption that a conservative government will be in office for at least another two years will also need to be reassessed. It is true that some of this uncertainty has already been reflected in the weakness of London's security markets during the past few days. But last night's debacle may make the Chancellor less inclined to resist any pressure from the Governor for a pre-emptive rise in interest rates: after all, he now has scapegoats to point to. The next day or two may be uncomfortable.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Labour takes over county council body LABOUR HAS won overall control of the Association of County Councils for the first time in the organisation's 104-year history. The development - which follows the Conservatives' disastrous showing in last month's county council elections when they lost control of all but one of the 20 counties they were defending - intensifies the difficulties facing Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary, in his dealings with local government. Labour's majority was assured yesterday when a selection panel at hung Cheshire county council gave the party two seats on the ACC executive, with one each for the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. This ensures the party of an overall majority of five seats on the ACC's executive council. The Conservatives are now the ACC's third-largest party. This puts Labour in charge of three of the four main representative bodies for local government in mainland Britain. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are Labour controlled, while the Association of District Councils remains under a minority Tory leadership. Mrs Josie Farrington, the ACC Labour group leader, played down the possibility of confrontation with the government. She said: 'It's not really appropriate in an association to talk about taking control. Obviously we will be speaking up for the interests of people who use local government services, and we would do that collectively with all those who want to make a case to gov-ernment in a reasonable way.' Labour's strength on the ACC was boosted last week by a decision of Labour-controlled Derbyshire county council to rejoin the association after a 12-year gap, giving the party an extra three seats. Derbyshire's and Cheshire's decisions, with the reappointment of three Labour representatives from South Glamorgan county council, will bring Labour strength on the 182-seat ACC executive to 93. The Liberal Democrats will have 48 seats, Conservatives 31 and independents 9, with one vacancy - giving Labour an overall majority of five seats. Before the county elections the Tories controlled the ACC with 91 of its then 178 seats, to Labour's 61, the Liberal Democrats' 16, and independents' 10.</p>

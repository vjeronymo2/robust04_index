The Foreign Ministry  denounced what it said Monday was the "negative stance of the UN  Security Council vis-a-vis these inhuman killings." It called  for an end to what it termed was a "human rights violation in  Bosnia- Herzegovina". The government called for the lifting of  the arms embargo imposed on Muslims in the besieged city. The  United Nations have been unable to determine who fired the  single mortar round Sunday.</p>

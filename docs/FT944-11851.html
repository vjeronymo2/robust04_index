			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Ontario acts on workplace equality: A new law encouraging employers to improve the lot of minorities Ontario hopes its new affirmative-action law will succeed where other approaches have failed to improve work prospects for disadvantaged groups. The Canadian province's Employment Equity Act, which took effect on September 1, goes beyond voluntary compliance but stops short of the racial and other quotas which have been favoured by some US states. 'We want the workplace to develop its own plan, which it wants to implement,' says Ms Juanita Westmoreland Traore, the lawyer who is the province's first employment equity commissioner. The new law is designed to help four groups: women, visible minorities, the disabled and aboriginals. It applies to every private-sector employer with more than 50 people on the payroll, and to all government agencies with more than 10 workers. The government estimates that 17,000 employers and almost three-quarters of the province's workers will be involved in the exercise. A sizeable bureaucracy is being brought together to monitor progress. The Employment Equity Commission, based in Toronto, has an annual budget of CDollars 9.3m (Pounds 4.4m) and will eventually have a staff of about 100. An employment equity tribunal is also being set up to hear complaints and settle disputes. Every employer must go through a step-by-step process over the next three years: a campaign to inform workers about the law, consultation with them, and production of an 'employment equity plan'. The timetable is staggered, depending on the number of employees. For instance, private-sector employers with more than 500 workers must have their plans in place by March 1996. The law is deliberately vague on the scope of the plans. It says only that they should 'remove barriers and make reasonable progress towards achieving employment equity'. Ms Traore defines a barrier as 'a policy or practice that more negatively affects the designated groups than others'. She adds: 'We expect that employers will look to the spirit of the act and develop a plan that fits it.' As examples, she cites jobs which require 'Canadian experience' - a criterion which cannot be met by new immigrants, a growing proportion of whom are black or oriental. Some employers may have to rearrange work schedules to take account of non-traditional religious holidays. Ms Traore, who is black, stresses that the new law does not require disabled people to be employed in jobs which require agility or physical strength. But she draws a distinction between a job requirement and a tradition. The latter would include the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's insistence a few years ago - but subsequently withdrawn - that Sikh recruits forsake their turbans for the Mounties' well-known Stetson. The business community has mixed feelings about the new law. 'We expected worse,' says a human resources manager at one large company. The manager gives Ontario's Social Democratic government credit for consulting widely on its proposals, and for watering down some of the harsher provisions before they became law. But Mr Joe Couto, an official at the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, asks whether many companies, especially smaller ones, have the resources to carry out extensive and often complex surveys and consultations. 'This is going to be a boon for consultants,' he predicts. Some businesses are concerned about a backlash from white male workers, who could accuse employers of reverse discrimination. Dofasco, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has tried to reduce these fears by expanding its employment-equity efforts to include all employees. 'We're trying to recognise that everyone has differences and that these don't hinder their contribution to the workplace,' says Ms Linda Bishop, Dofasco's manager for human resources planning. Canada Trust, a large financial institution, has already identified several ways in which it can further the interests of the four disadvantaged groups without stirring resentment among the workforce at large. The company has decided, for instance, to place job advertisements not only in Toronto's mainstream dailies but also in newspapers catering to specific ethnic groups. It is about to launch a 10-week pilot programme for potential recruits who have developmental handicaps, such as dyslexia. A year ago, Canada Trust introduced an 'alternate work option', which allows all employees to choose flexible work hours, job sharing, work-at-home options or any other arrangement which suits them without harming their productivity. 'This is a business opportunity,' says Ms Heather Conolly, manager of workplace equality. She also says, however, that complying with the new act will require 'horrendous' paperwork. Ms Traore acknowledges that the success of the new regime will hinge on employers' enthusiasm. 'If it works the way we want it to work, it should have its own inherent dynamism,' she says. 'People will see that it's in their self-interest.' There is little in the law to force compliance. No deadlines are set for implementing employment equity plans. The law spells out a near-endless process of consultation, mediation and appeals. If all else fails, the employment equity tribunal can alter a plan. But if the employer fails to comply, the tribunal can impose a maximum fine of only CDollars 50,000 (Pounds 22,800) - which is unlikely to be high enough to bring reluctant employers into the employment-equity fold.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W., PAD, and B.C.: "Miller: Solidarity </F> Forces an Opened Door; Jankowski: Strikes May Last Several  Months"]    [Text] It has been confirmed that on Friday [11 March]  railroads workers are going to stage a 10-hour strike.  Yesterday, work at over a dozen plants associated in the  National Steel Works Section of Solidarity was suspended;  rallies were held in other plants and money was collected for  strike funds.    At a conference organized in the morning at the Office of  the  Council of Ministers [URM], the government stated that it is not  able to change the Budget Law--it has been passed by parliament:  it has been holding talks with trade unions since January, so  Solidarity cannot accuse it of having too little good will to  negotiate; Solidarity can negotiate its demands in the  trilateral committee; miners are only "an instrument of force"  and will not receive any money for striking; the strike by  railroads workers is illegal. The government did not say this  directly; however, it is not going to forward a special  invitation for "Solidarity" to attend talks.  <H5>  Yesterday Steel Works, Tomorrow Miners </H5>   Today in Lodz, the National Committee [KK] of Solidarity  will  hold a session. Unofficial information suggests that there  appear to be two options for further action: one can either  expect an escalation of the protest, or--this is more  likely--Solidarity may suspend the protests in two weeks or so  because of the uncompromising attitude adopted by the government.    The same sources maintain that the collection of money for  the strike fund "is going quite well." The funds will be placed  in an interest-bearing account.    In a few months' time, Solidarity may take advantage of the  social dissatisfaction and, with the necessary financial means,  may organize a serious action, perhaps not in all sectors of the  economy but "in several important sectors that are vital from a  strategic point of view."    KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak evaluated the 8 March strikes  as  a success for the trade union: "According to our information,  participating in the protest action were four plants in the  Koszalin voivodship, as well as 80 plants in the steel works  branch--69 in the two-hour warning strike; in 11 plants money  was collected for the strike fund."    Fourteen steel plants were on strike in Silesia; in the  other  11, money was collected for the strike fund--the workers  earmarked 2 percent of their earnings to the cause. On strike  were, among other plants, the following steel works: Bankowa,  Zawiercie, Baildon, Batory, Bobrek, Zabrze, as well as  Czestochowa and Sendzimira in Krakow. In the Lucchini-Warsaw  steel works, only two rallies were organized, in which  participating were only those employees (approximately 350  persons) who could leave their work posts without causing a drop  in production. The plant decided that it could not afford to go  on active strike in a situation where there were already  production delays. During one of the rallies, Mazowsze Region  Head Maciej Jankowski said that "what we are starting today may  last as long as several months--fight for the rights of  employees has always been long and calls for considerable  determination."    Warning strikes will be staged today at plants in and  around Lodz, as well as at 100 selected plants in the  Silesian-Dabrowa region. On 10 March, strikes are supposed to be  staged in Gdansk and at pit-coal mines. Deputy Industry  Minister Eugeniusz Morawski told URM that mining and energy "are  not the area of the strike; they are the instruments of forcing  decisions." He believes that here "the issue is political." He  stated that the strike in these branches leads to  destabilization and added that the violations of the law will be  scrupulously registered; he will insist on coal partnerships not  paying "a single penny" toward the strike. "If any of the  partnerships does make any such payments, I will institute legal  proceedings to find out about the results of such an unjustified  gift."  <H5>  Railroads Workers "Illegally"? </H5>   "The 10-hour strike by railroad workers is supposed to  affect  the entire Polish State Railroads [PKP] network, in both freight  and passenger traffic. The protest will be organized between  0900 [0800 GMT] and 1900," assured Railroads Solidarity Head  Krzysztof Maminski. He did not rule out the possibility,  however, that the strikes may be staged as soon as Thursday. He  assured that rescue and special trains will be allowed to pass;  he also did not exclude the possibility that some international  trains that near their destination when the strike starts, will  be allowed to reach their destinations.    At a URM news conference, PKP Director General Aleksander  Janiszewski said that Solidarity was informed that their wage  demands are impossible to meet--PKP would have to pay from 500  million to 1 billion zlotys of the popiwek [tax on excessive  wage increases]. Therefore, lower increases were put into  effect, which were agreed upon with the other trade unions.  Janiszewski deemed the Solidarity strike illegal because the  PKP General Administration "finds out about it from the press,  whereas, in line with the law, it should have been informed  about it five days ahead of time." As a consequence, PKP will  take steps to oppose it.  <H5>  The Government Is Ready and Waiting </H5>   Labor Minister Leszek Miller said on 8 March that the fact  that Solidarity is forcing the government to hold talks with  trade unions is like "forcing an opened door" because it has  been holding such talks almost since the very first day it was  established. According to him, the negotiations on social  guarantees and the trilateral committee have such broad powers  that they are a sufficient platform for discussions and  negotiations on any demands.    Miller stressed that the government cannot implement the  demand that the budget be changed because the budget has already  been passed by parliament; however, the trilateral committee may  discuss next year's budget. Andrzej Baczkowski, deputy labor  minister and head of the trilateral committee, added that the  committee may discuss any topic, and it can be convened at once  if Solidarity decides that it is willing talk.</p>

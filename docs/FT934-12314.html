			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Litho Supplies pathfinder forecasts jump to Pounds 4.3m LITHO Supplies, which claims to be the UK's largest independent distributor of printing products, is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer likely to value the company at about Pounds 50m. The pathfinder prospectus published yesterday forecasts pre-tax profits ahead by 27 per cent to Pounds 4.33m, compared with Pounds 3.35m for 1992, on sales of Pounds 54.7m. Litho hopes the proceeds will break down into Pounds 15m of new money and Pounds 12m from sales by existing shareholders. Of the Pounds 12m, some Pounds 3m should go to the board and employees with Pounds 9m to institutions led by 3i. The flotation is likely to reduce both the 53 per cent stake of existing institutional shareholders and the 47 per cent stake held by the board and employees, beyond the diluting effect of the new issue. Mr John Byford, joint managing director and deputy chairman, said the proceeds would reduce borrowings of Pounds 9.5m. Litho was formed during a 1991 management buy-out from Pembridge Investments which acquired various Litho businesses as part of its hostile takeover of DRG, the printing and publishing group, in 1980. The company estimated the market for consumable products, the bulk of its turnover, at Pounds 250m a year and 50 per cent of this is supplied directly by manufacturers. Litho claims a 40 per cent share of the balance and a 10,000-strong customer base. The highest paid director will this year receive a salary of just Pounds 34,900, excluding a profit - related bonus of Pounds 62,555.</p>

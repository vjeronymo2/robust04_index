			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Canadian business in cuts warning Business leaders and economists have warned that the financial markets' confidence in Canada could be severely shaken if the Liberal government fails to deliver big public spending cuts over the next 12 months. The warnings tempered a mildly favourable response to the package of restraint and tax-broadening measures contained in the new Liberal government's first budget, tabled by Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, on Tuesday. Markets showed little reaction to the budget yesterday. Mr Martin projected a drop in the deficit from CDollars 45.7bn (Pounds 23.30bn) in the year to March 31 1994, to CDollars 39.7bn next year and CDollars 32.76bn in 1995/96. He promised longer-term reductions in next year's budget, following a review of Canada's costly social security programmes and the system of transfers to the 10 provinces. These two items plus subsidies make up 61 per cent of Ottawa's total spending (excluding debt payments). The Liberals, who came to office last November, have pledged to cut the deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1997. The projected drop in the deficit over the next two years is predicated largely on a sharp rise in government revenues. But Mr Michael Manford, chief economist at ScotiaMcLeod, said yesterday 'the only way that the deficit is going to be materially reduced is by spending cuts.' The concern centres on the continuing spiral in Ottawa's debt burden. Despite the lower deficit, net debt is expected to rise from 67.6 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1993 to 75 per cent in 1996. Almost a third of federal revenues are channelled into debt-service payments. Among tax loopholes closed by the budget are a CDollars 100,000 capital gains exemption, and the ability of Canadian-based companies to avoid tax by channelling income through foreign affiliates. Spending cuts include the closure or consolidation of more than a third of Canada's 60 military installations as part of a 12 per cent cut in defence spending over the next five years.</p>

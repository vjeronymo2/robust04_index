			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Technology: The best of both worlds in print - Paul Taylor reports on a system that combines laser and offset A small Israeli-based company claims to have made a breakthrough in printing technology by developing the first integrated digital colour offset press ideally suited to high-quality short print runs. Indigo, a private company founded by Benny Landa in 1977, has spent the past 16 years working on technology that merges the quality and performance of printing ink and the conventional offset printing process with the power and convenience of laser-style electronic printing. The company's efforts have already captured the interest of George Soros, the international financier, who recently paid USDollars 50m (Pounds 33m) to acquire a 'small minority equity stake' in Indigo. Liquid ink and offset printing dominate the quality end of the printing industry, but offset printing is heavy on materials, time and labour. It requires skilled operation and lengthy pre-press preparation of films and printing plates. And because of the time it takes to set up a conventional offset press, the process is expensive and requires long print runs to be economical. As a result, it is generally limited to duplicating the same image page after page. Laser-style electronic printing is based on the xerographic or electrophotographic process, which employs powder toner rather than liquid ink. The process is used, for example, by modern desktop laser printers and photocopiers but it, too, suffers from a number of limitations. The relatively large particle size of the toners results in poor definition, brittle images and a lack of colour brilliance. In terms of quality, 'it cannot challenge offset printing', Landa says. Indigo overcame these limitations by developing a fine-particle liquid toner called Electroink, which was patented in 1988 and is now manufactured under licence by a range of companies including Xerox, DuPont and Ricoh. After that, Indigo, which employs 325 people mostly involved in research and development in Israel, set about developing the digital offset press. The result is a machine called the E-Print 1000, 'the first of a family of electronic printing products', says Giora Yaron, Indigo's president and a former senior executive at National Semiconductor. The E-Print 1000 takes digital information in at one end and can output fully bound colour documents at the other. The small-scale laser press - which would not look out of place in an office  -prints at a speed of 120 feet per minute, equivalent to 2,000 full-colour pages an hour and comparable to the speed of an standard sheet-fed press. It achieves a resolution of 800 dots per inch (DPI) on a broad range of papers up to A3 size - 11 inches x 17 inches - using four colour inks. (By way of comparison, a standard laser printer achieves a resolution of 300 DPI.) The Indigo press can accept industry-standard PostScript format files from a computer-based colour desktop publishing package, eliminating all of the pre-press stages. Each page can be also be printed on both sides (duplex), meaning that an entire document can be printed automatically. An optional automatic finishing attachment allows fully finished folded, stitched and trimmed booklets to be produced with no manual intervention. Low set-up costs mean the E-Print 1000 is ideally suited to short publishing runs (500-5,000 copies) - a market that some analysts suggest is potentially worth Dollars 25bn a year in the US alone. Potential applications range from short-run 'distributed' printing to greeting cards, personalised colour printing and low-volume book publishing. Pre-production versions of the E-Print 1000 are already in operation in Japan. The press will be launched formally at the International Printing Exposition in Birmingham in September.</p>

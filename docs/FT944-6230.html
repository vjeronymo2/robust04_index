			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Just short of paradise - The financial markets hoped for even more For all his repeated claims that his various pint-sized proposals were 'important' and 'substantial' Kenneth Clarke's second Budget lived fully up to its billing as the boring one in between last year's tough book-balancer and next year's would-be vote-grabber. The only really interesting aspect, perhaps, will be whether the harshest of the pre-ordained tax increases - notably the second dollop of value added tax on domestic fuel - will actually get through a troublesome House of Commons. As a shrewd politician Mr Clarke took a good deal of trouble to soothe Tory MPs' consciences by tossing extra pensioner handouts. The dullness will not be regretted by the financial markets, however. They were relying on the government not to do anything rash, and it has not, although the officially forecast numbers for spending and borrowing over the next two years are not quite up to the best expectations. For example, despite the accelerating economic boom the Treasury has only revised its estimate of the current year's public sector borrowing requirement down from the Pounds 36.1bn indicated in June to Pounds 34.5bn, when some City scribblers have had their eyes on a PSBR near Pounds 30bn. However, the vision of a PSBR as low as Pounds 5bn by 1997-98 is being dangled before a tantalised gilt-edged market. That prospective near-balance could provide the framework for a final pre-election Budget in November 1996, always supposing that the beleaguered government can last that long. The risk for the bond market is that the appeal of this return to financial prudence will be lost in another boom-and-bust exercise, as taxes are cut merrily in the next two Budgets and the economy is allowed to overheat. The Treasury has growth slowing to 3 1/4 per cent next year - highly convenient, but several City economists have recently been raising their growth projections. Political uncertainties are important for gilts, but no more so than for bond markets in other countries such as France or the US, let alone Italy. As the figures stand, UK government bonds are looking better-placed than those of most other countries. Only the UK's inflationary history is preventing this from being demonstrated in yields. One way for the government to cash in on the improved outlook and reduce its borrowing costs would be for the Bank of England to find ways of making the gilt-edged market more user-friendly for foreigners. The 'not invented here' approach has long dominated the stuffy UK government bond market. Auctions have been introduced; but the long list of stocks is regarded as confusing, liquidity is sometimes inadequate because of the absence of an open sale and repurchase ('repo') market, and there are difficulties over quixotic withholding taxes applying to some issues and some foreign investors. It is evident from the Bank of England's consultative paper that the authorities are desperate to reconcile the possibly irreconcileable. On the one hand, a repo market would attract speculative traders, increasing liquidity but arguably not raising volatility. Yet it is 'of great importance that gilt repo activity should take place within a properly-regulated framework'. Improving the mechanics of the market might help to reduce borrowing costs. The chancellor made the observation that each basis point of yield saved - each hundredth of a percentage point - would result in an economy worth Pounds 25m a year. The question is whether those savings might have to be paid for in some other way. It is difficult to imagine that an effective repo market could be introduced without allowing gross dividends to be paid on all issues. An attempt to restrict this tax exemption to foreigners only would create discontinuities and threaten, for instance, to encourage a huge trade in buying and selling coupons. If the gilt-edged market is to be truly internationalised it will have to be on the basis of interest paid gross. That would no doubt involve some loss of domestic tax revenue, through deferment and, worse, evasion, creating a big loophole to offset the closing of some tiny ones in the Budget. The tax issue will be covered in a forthcoming Inland Revenue paper, the separateness of which suggests that the authorities have not yet grasped the point. Tax inconsistencies are apparent on the domestic scene, too. For some reason the Inland Revenue is opening up tax-exempt personal equity plans to corporate bonds but not, it seems, to gilts. It is not clear why the government should be discriminating against its own paper. Is it not, anyway, a bit late to be worrying about foreign investment in gilts? True, it may have been disappointing for the Bank of England to see foreigners turn net sellers this year, leading to some sticky moments in the auctions. But net gilt issuance, some Pounds 48bn in 1993-94, is tumbling, and may be less than Pounds 20bn next year. With the balance of payments approaching actual balance there is no underlying need for external finance. Moreover UK pension funds are likely to become much more active buyers of gilts because of the introduction of a minimum solvency standard under the forthcoming Pensions Bill. By 1997-98, if you believe the numbers, they will only be able to buy gilts through the secondary market, so that foreigners will be selling, while yield spreads will be shrinking and reversing. Some might say that priority should have been given to the requirements of UK pension funds. The Goode Committee on pension law reform asked for special securities to match pension fund liabilities. But the authorities are neglecting their biggest potential domestic long-term investors in favour of solicitation of peripatetic foreigners. Can you believe it all? The government is promising a further squeeze on public sector pay and employment levels, which may be difficult to deliver. It seems to have slipped at the first hurdle of PSBR expectations for 1994-95. We are entering the politically more dangerous phase of this parliament. But we should put it all into perspective. To an Italian or Swedish investor the UK might look like an unattainable financial paradise.</p>

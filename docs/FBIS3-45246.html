Last year's start of operation of a numerical weather  prediction system, which uses an advanced Yinhe-II computer,  made the increased forecast capacity possible.    China also set up the first continental global atmosphere  watch observatory last year in Qinghai Province, which is  expected to be operational soon.    Officials say the observatory will enable China to monitor  the atmosphere, including the ozone layer and acid rain.    The observatory, which is officially known as China Global  Atmosphere Watch Baseline Observatory (CGAW) was constructed  with cooperation from the World Meteorological Organization.    The National Satellite Meteorological Center is now building  the ground segment for Fengyun-2 Meteorological Satellite to be  launched.    The satellite will be China's first geostationary  meteorological satellite.</p>

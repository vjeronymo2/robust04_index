There were more bullets than people on the streets of blockaded  Stepanakert. Serzh said to me: "We are being shot at like in a  shooting gallery. But all this will end soon. We will take  Shusha (the city fort, a former health resort on a high hill  overlooking Stepanakert--Mikhail Serdyukov)."    Shusha seemed to be and was inaccessible. There was  incessant firing from there: cannons, "barrages," and when the  snipers aimed, it was always for the forehead. Only an  out-and-out Suvorov or a totally mad descendant would dare to  assault this monster. Serzh is a person without extremes. He  just established an army of self-defense forces of Artsakh. He  is a philologist.    They took Shusha. And a lot more. They moved military  operations beyond the boundaries of Nagorno-Karabakh. Serzhik  became a national hero. Researchers will also study the  phenomenon of this commander. But for the present...    For the present, there is a new blockade. Of all  Armenia already. An economic blockade, and it is the most  merciless. There is no light or gas, and there is little to eat.  The army is shattered. The president of the republic invites  Serzh Sarkisyan to the post of minister of defense of Armenia.  He is surprised, but he leaves his family in Stepanakert and  goes to frozen Yerevan. This is where we met.    [Serdyukov] I have already been warned: It is the practice  in  the higher echelons of Armenian authority to use strictly  official forms of address: "Mr. President, Mr. Minister." How  should I address you?    [Sarkisyan] As an old friend.    [Serdyukov] Thank you, Serzhik. What kind of songs is the  minister of defense singing today?    [Sarkisyan] I am still a long way off from a personal  performance. But I like to listen to the White Guard's songs.  Malinin's, for example.    [Serdyukov] He sings sincerely: "Why do we, lieutenant, need  foreign land?" If I readdress this question to you--will you be  able to answer it?    [Sarkisyan] Go ahead and ask: Why did you seize Azerbaijani  territory. In autumn of 1992 we were able to stop the  Azerbaijani Army and got an opportunity to keep  Nagorno-Karabakh. But how was this to be done? After all,  Stepanakert was being battered by cannon from the well-known  Agdam--point-blank. You even took a picture of a little girl  with a broken leg--have you forgotten?    [Serdyukov] Can you really forget such a thing? Do you know  how she is living now?    [Sarkisyan] She is alive. But others died. Azerbaijani Army  groups that were concentrated on our borders continued to hit  cities and villages. After all, every sector of the republic was  fired on from there. And that could have gone on endlessly. It  is impossible to compare Azerbaijan's military potential in any  way even with that of Armenia, not to mention the NKR  [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. There are not many Karabakh  residents. And there was only one solution: Only through bravery  and attack could we demoralize the huge Azerbaijani force. We  circulated the disinformation that allegedly we were appeased.  We said that we expected the next attack of the Azerbaijani Army  in the spring of 1993. And we gave assurances: They will not  attack us in the winter and, of course, everyone could ease up...    [Serdyukov] And did they take the bait?    [Sarkisyan] Yes. In January of 1993 the Azerbaijanis began a  powerful offensive in the firm conviction that we were not ready  to repel them. Within two weeks they were completely exhausted.  We launched a counteroffensive. The aim was to straighten out  the front. This required going outside the NKR's boundaries.    [Serdyukov] You really got outside them very well! You  captured up to one-fifth of the entire Republic of Azerbaijan.  You were suddenly transformed from defenders of your own land to  aggressors.    [Sarkisyan] Of course, for Azerbaijan, this is aggression.  Although there is a nuance: After all, they do not recognize the  NKR as an independent state, and continue to consider the  Karabakh people as their subjects. So, what kind of aggression  is this? Our people against our people. I will say frankly: We  do not need their land. We were simply ensuring the safety of  our families. And supplying the army with captured weapons.  Furthermore, Karabakh has been completely destroyed and burned  down. Three years of war is no joke. But with what does one  rebuild? At whose expense? There is nothing in Armenia, and the  mice are dying from hunger in empty cornbins. There was only one  solution: Get the building materials in Azerbaijan.    [Serdyukov] In Azerbaijan they think they are fighting  against Armenia.    [Sarkisyan] They can be understood. It is embarrassing to  admit that, having such a powerful military potential, they  cannot achieve victory over tiny Karabakh. Although I know: They  clearly realize this among themselves. They do not want to admit  publicly in Baku that they are at war with Karabakh. After all,  they have been unable up to now to take even one Armenian  soldier captive. I met with the minister of defense of  Azerbaijan in Tbilisi recently at the initiative of Russian  General Reut. He tried to prove to me that regular subunits of  the Armenian Army were participating in the war. He showed me  the identity papers of a captured soldier with the inscription  "Volunteer." A passport with the registration is Yerevan. I  explained to him simply, in the Russian language--in the  presence of Reut: We have many prisoners, both Russian and  Ukrainian, but I am not saying that Karabakh is at war with  Russia or with Ukraine.    [Serdyukov] Does this mean that you did not succeed in  coming  closer to an agreement with your Azerbaijani colleague?    [Sarkisyan] We did not achieve anything. This meeting was an  initiative of the Russian general. His personal initiative.  Without any authority from Moscow. As he said: "He has great  personal desire for this war to end more quickly."    [Serdyukov] But what about you, do you have another desire?    [Sarkisyan] God forbid! And the Azerbaijan minister of  defense wants the same.    [Serdyukov] A paradox: Everyone wants peace, and the carnage  continues.    [Sarkisyan] The trouble is that an end to the war means  different things for us and for them. For Karabakh, the end of  the war is recognition of independence. But for Azerbaijan, as  their minister of defense put it, "the return of all of the  administrative units, including Karabakh as well..."    [Serdyukov] But this is a closed circle! With the arrival of  Geydar Aliyev, a cautious person, the hope has emerged in you  personally that you will finally come to an agreement?    [Sarkisyan] When he came to power I did have this kind of  hope. Alas, it has now been dispelled. Under Aliyev, Azerbaijan  ended up completely militarized. Everything there is now  absolutely subordinated to war. The people, the economy.    [Serdyukov] Are there really no prospects?    [Sarkisyan] I do not see any, and there is already no choice  now even for Aliyev. Because many people perished during his  time. He has to have at least some kind of justification for  this. I am confident that if in a month Azerbaijan loses a  million or two million soldiers, but at the same time returns  some part of their territory, no one will begin to reproach  Aliyev. The sacrifices will be justified. But if he does not  succeed in achieving anything, he will be held responsible, as  others were.    [Serdyukov] What millions are you talking about? What is  this, world war?    [Sarkisyan] But already today almost twice as many have been  killed in Azerbaijan as in the whole war in Afghanistan.  According to the most conservative figures, 25,000-26,000! And  in Aliyev's opinion, 3,500 persons are in captivity in Karabakh,  800--in Armenia.    [Serdyukov] But how many in fact?    [Sarkisyan] We do not have that many prisoners. He is  confusing them with those who are missing in action. But we even  earlier asked to gather up the bodies. However, the Azerbaijanis  did not do this. Why? Well, so that the people would have no  idea of the extent of their own losses. And they are not  gathering up the bodies now. Although Karabakh is ready to grant  this opportunity at any time.    [Serdyukov] How big are Armenia's losses?    [Sarkisyan] One of ours against 12 Azerbaijanis.    [Serdyukov] Serzhik, what about a campaign against Baku?  While sitting at one time at a Karabakh table I also had  occasion to hear this outlook from the mouths of soldiers of the  self-defense army.    [Sarkisyan] This was a joke, very likely, a drunken one. You  understand, Azerbaijan has an objective, and after achieving it,  it will conclude the war. Enter Stepanakert--that is all.  Period! Karabakh does not have an objective at present. It has  one task: to stand at the present line and repel attacks. There  is no point now for a Karabakh soldier to reach so that the war  will end. We do not need Baku, nor on the whole even one  centimeter of land. And the Karabakhs will return all the  territory of Azerbaijan without vacillation as soon as they  receive guarantees that they will not shoot in the direction of  their motherland.    [Serdyukov] What kind of guarantees are you talking about?    [Sarkisyan] Recognizing the Karabakh Republic. The  introduction of peacekeeping forces in the area of conflict. We  cannot believe in words anymore. After all, even in the  Azerbaijan system Karabakh was autonomous and had some  guarantees according to the USSR Constitution.    [Serdyukov] I have already been shivering with cold with  everybody in Armenia for a week. I met quite a few Yerevan  people who curse the war to the hilt. They are convinced that it  is precisely Karabakh that brought them to complete  impoverishment, chronic freezing, and a life of semistarvation.  Do you not consider the possibility of exacerbating  Armenian-Karabakh relations?    [Sarkisyan] Now is not the time for division. Only unity  will  save us today. And the leadership of Armenia declared more than  once that it agrees to any decisions at which the two  belligerents arrive. There would be peace.    [Serdyukov] Will it not become boring for you to live in  peace and quiet? What will you occupy yourself with, as minister  of defense? Or as philologist Serzhik Sarkisyan?    [Sarkisyan] I have not thought about this. But I know one  thing: The first day of peace will be the happiest day of my  life. But as a philologist, perhaps I have lost many  professional qualities.    [Serdyukov] What is your specialization?    [Sarkisyan] The Armenian language and literature. I  graduated  from the University of Yerevan and returned home--you know how  closely I was watched in Karabakh by the Azerbaijani leaders. To  them, a person who received his education in Armenia and had  some ideas and national habits was considered a social outcast.  But I was invited to the city party committee of the Komsomol  [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and I became the  supervisor of the sports and mass-defense branch. Then I became  the secretary. There I really felt the pressure. All "lucrative"  positions went only to one's own. They spat on the Armenian  language. It was forbidden to write and speak it. But after all,  Armenians living in the NKAO [Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous  Oblast] comprised 70 percent of the total population.    [Serdyukov] Peace is as good a time as any for language. But  what will you do with the uniform of a military minister?    [Sarkisyan] Well, I do not have any kind of uniform.  Remember  the old camouflage uniform I wore in Karabakh? It is in my  wardrobe. This is my entire military dress.    [Serdyukov] But what about the gold shoulderboards? After  all, the minister has some kind of rank?    [Sarkisyan] Captain of the Reserve. But this goes back to  peaceful times long ago. What am I supposed to do, confer a rank  upon myself? How could I then look into the eyes of the  professional military? After the capture of Shusha, while still  in Karabakh, they wanted to promote me to general--I refused. I  consider myself a civilian to this day. But I became military,  even if the minister, out of necessity. On the other hand, when  I meet with ministers of defense of other states (they are all  marshals), I am not intimidated. I am dressed in civilian  clothes, and I converse with them as an equal. Military rank  obligates one to something. And then I am not a particular  expert in military commands. I show up among the troops in a  regular suit.    [Serdyukov] But how do you command... without commands?    [Sarkisyan] My favorite command is "forward!" Everyone knows  this.    [Serdyukov] Is this when, pistol in hand, you lead soldiers  in an attack?    [Sarkisyan] That also has happened. But I was not minister  of  defense of Armenia at the time.    [Serdyukov] Were there many military in your family?    [Sarkisyan] Not one. A grandfather was shot in 1937. He was  a  shepherd. My father was a blacksmith since the age of 13. He has  been on pension a long time, but until now he has been in the  Stepanakert defense rayon repairing weapons. Mama has worked all  her life at the silk combine. In Nagorno-Karabakh. My wife, a  music teacher, and two of my daughters are there now.    [Serdyukov] Why do you not take them to Yerevan?    [Sarkisyan] It is warmer there. And although the bombing has  started again, both daughters are going to school. No one will  be going to school in Armenia before spring.    [Serdyukov] But the territory of Armenia is also being fired  on now. We already have the first victims. Is yet another war  starting?    [Sarkisyan] We could respond to these provocations with  power  strikes. But, after all, this will really lead to a wide-scale  war. I see two reasons here. With these incidents, the  Azerbaijanis, thinking that our army is fighting in Karabakh,  are allegedly trying to draw off some of our forces. And to show  to the whole world that they are fighting Armenia, but not  Karabakh. We are avoiding such a war in every possible way.  Although I should put our aircraft into the air, and a strike  from which they will not recover quickly will be delivered.    [Serdyukov] Are the pilots, excuse the stupid question,  Russian?    [Sarkisyan] You are being insulting. They are all Armenian.    [Serdyukov] Incidentally, nothing has been heard for a long  time about the pilots who were knocked down in the Stepanakert  skies--a Russian and a Ukrainian. I met with one of them, pilot  Bilichenko, two years ago in prison. He was convinced he would  be shot.    [Sarkisyan] Of course, they are criminals. But I think that  their life should be spared. But this is not their war, why did  they get into it?    [Serdyukov] And are the mujahidin fighting in Karabakh now?    [Sarkisyan] Afghanistan has not admitted this fact  officially. I think they are right. After all, a mujahidin is  not a soldier of the Afghan Army. They are ordinary mercenaries.    [Serdyukov] Have you succeeded in taking any of them  captive?    [Sarkisyan] Not for the time being. They fight in the rear.  They stand as defensive detachments, and they shoot retreating  Azerbaijani soldiers. But there is a captive Turkish officer. I  know for a certainty: There are many Russian, Ukrainian, and  Belarusian officers fighting.    [Serdyukov] Do you have enough such volunteers on your part?    [Sarkisyan] We do not have mujahidin, believe me.    [Serdyukov] Tell me, please, is your army helping Karabakh  with weapons?    [Sarkisyan] We acquired some things for them in third  countries, in the West. But this is meager in comparison with  what the Azerbaijanis are losing themselves and what the  Karabakhs acquire after successful strikes of the NKR defense  army. This is on the order of 120 tanks, powerful artillery, and  whole depots of infantry weapons and ammunition. Even the  Armenian Army does not have such stores of weapons as there are  now in Karabakh.    [Serdyukov] But where did Azerbaijan get so many weapons?    [Sarkisyan] They do not have to go far. A hundred tanks were  acquired recently in Ukraine. Also aircraft and ammunition.  Incidentally, they do not deny this there. They justify it by  the difficult economic situation. In addition, according to the  information of prisoners and captured materiel, it can be said  that Azerbaijan acquired many new T-72 tanks. Where? It is  obvious to us: Russia. For example, in Nikolayev they received  BMP-2's [infantry combat vehicle] not so long ago. Ammunition  was delivered from Tula.    [Serdyukov] Does our Grachev deny all this?    [Sarkisyan] Of course. The entire Russian leadership,  civilian and military, flatly refuse to admit their military  assistance to Azerbaijan. It is just a pity that your country  does not take one thing into account: Our enemy is acquiring  weapons not only from the countries of the near abroad. In  China--assault rifles. In the Czech Republic--machine guns and  grenade launchers produced in 1993. All this firepower falls on  tiny Karabakh. But how is one to understand this from the human  standpoint?    [Serdyukov] Well, fine, but did you not have a conversation  in this regard with Grachev himself. By telephone, but  man-to-man?    [Sarkisyan] Our president engages in this. But I think that  if there was a conversation with Grachev, it would not have  changed very much. The chaos that exists in the arms trade, in  my opinion, cannot even be controlled by the minister of defense  of Russia.    [Serdyukov] If you had the opportunity to talk with our  president, what would you say to him?    [Sarkisyan] I want to request one thing of Yeltsin and of  all  Russians: Act in such a way that our Karabakh does not perish.  You are powerful. Help us.    [Serdyukov] I know that general mobilization was declared in  Azerbaijan a long time ago. What is the case in this respect in  Armenia?    [Sarkisyan] The minister of defense does not need this. For  the time being. But it is difficult for me to guess what will  occur tomorrow.    [Serdyukov] Have you gotten very tired in recent years? Do  you have a desire to lie in bed for a few days and at least once  to sleep as much as you want?    [Sarkisyan] I would not refuse, of course. I do not get more  than five hours of sleep a day. But then I think of the boys who  are fighting today in the mountains in 40 degrees of frost. For  two-three months in the forward area...    [Serdyukov] What is your biggest misfortune in life--what is  it associated with?    [Sarkisyan] I have lost so many friends in recent years.  These were fellows who deserved to live. The sadness is not to  meet with them anymore on this earth.    [Serdyukov] Serzhik, for these years of the war, your chest  should be glistening with medals.    [Sarkisyan] But there are no combat decorations in Armenia.  There are in Karabakh: combat crosses of the first and second  degree. Azerbaijan has the title of national hero. They are fine  fellows.    [Serdyukov] And what cross do you have?    [Sarkisyan] Imagine, I have none.    [Serdyukov] And if you had some free time, what would you  engage in?    [Sarkisyan] I would go hunting in our Karabakh forests.  There  is no more beautiful place on earth. With Robert Kocharyan, my  boyhood friend. He shoots very accurately. With a rifle.    [Serdyukov] Better than you?    [Sarkisyan] We have not competed for a long time.    [Serdyukov] Did you have occasion to shoot in the war?    [Sarkisyan] Rarely--but it happened.    [Serdyukov] Do you get a chance to read books?    [Sarkisyan] To my great regret, no.    [Serdyukov] And you have probably not seen your family for a  long time?    [Sarkisyan] I have a real Armenian family. The husband  commands in it. I like this most of all.    [Serdyukov] Do you really have little to command at work?    [Sarkisyan] Too much.    [Serdyukov] But what is the matter?    [Sarkisyan] The fact that when I turn my ardor to my family,  it means the war has ended.</p>

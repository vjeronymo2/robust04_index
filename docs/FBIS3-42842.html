Lysenko"]    [Text] On 19 January a trial began in the military court of  the Warsaw Military District which attracted the close attention  of the mass media not only of Poland but also of other  countries. SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] Major Anatoliy  Lysenko and Polish citizen Janusz Bojarski, accused of espionage  activities against Poland, are on trial. According to the  official version of the Polish military prosecutor's office,  which has been carried by the mass media, Ukrainian intelligence  officer A. Lysenko engaged in espionage activities against  Poland and recruited J. Bojarski as a secret agent. The latter  passed on to A. Lysenko information on so-called "white  intelligence," in particular "on the economic and political  situation in eastern voivodships, theological seminaries, the  bishops of Przemysl, and so on."    Immediately after the arrest of Major A. Lysenko (which took  place on 23 August 1993), the Embassy of Ukraine in Poland  established contact with him, and literally from the first to  the last day regularly held meetings and conversations with  representatives of the Polish authorities at the highest levels,  including ministers, the general prosecutor, and the heads of  relevant services, demanding the release of the Ukrainian  officer, who had been arrested without grounds. The leadership  of the Security Service of Ukraine, which sent three letters to  the relevant Polish organs, resolutely demanded that Major A.  Lysenko be released. Two notes of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of Ukraine were presented to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Republic of Poland; the notes warned about the  possible consequences of the irresponsible actions of Polish  special services. The Embassy of Ukraine in Poland also sent one  note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of  Poland. Unfortunately, all these measures produced no results.    What was the basis for the conviction of the Ukrainian side  that Major A. Lysenko was arrested without grounds, and for this  reason should be freed immediately?    Major A. Lysenko is a rank-and-file associate of the  Mostisskiy Rayon Department of the Administration of the  Security Service of Ukraine for Lvov Oblast. He was never  involved in any intelligence activities and did not accomplish  any tasks or special assignments of an intelligence nature. As a  rayon-level employee, he had functional responsibility for  putting an end to smuggling and other criminal activities in the  border rayon, as well as for reviewing issues associated with  rehabilitation of the victims of political repression.    His arrest as a spy cannot even be considered a  misunderstanding or a consequence of the Polish special services  being poorly informed. This looks much like a provocation, the  objective of which is to sow discord in Polish-Ukrainian  relations, whose favorable development is disliked by some.    Staff members of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Republic of  Poland met with A. Lysenko seven times in prison in Rzeszow and  in prison in Warsaw on the eve of the trial. He gave the  impression of being a depressed, broken, and very frightened or  perhaps terrorized man. He was very concerned about the fate of  his seriously ill 14-year-old son. He said that he was being  intimidated with imprisonment for many years, and with being  punished even more severely in Ukraine if he returned there.  During one of the visits he said that it had been suggested that  he renounce his Ukrainian citizenship. In return for this, he  would be freed, would be able to stay in Poland and bring his  family over.    The question arises of whether Major Lysenko was arrested  with a view to forcing him to betray the motherland, or whether  the special services invented this later as a salutary way out  of the unenviable situation they found themselves in when they  failed to fabricate a "spy" case.    The military court considering the case of A. Lysenko and J.  Bojarski announced that the trial would be open and allowed  journalists to attend the trial. The court rejected the protest  of the prosecutor, after all. Perhaps the prosecutor did not  want witnesses to see a "spy affair" that has been inflated by  the mass media to the level of an international scandal turn  into a ridiculous farce.    Both defendants categorically rejected the charges of not  only spying but also any other activity to the detriment of the  Polish state.    During the initial days of the trial, the court  cross-examined defendants J. Bojarski and A. Lysenko. The entire  case was clarified in the course of the cross-examination.    Toward the end of 1992 a serious crime was committed in  Mostisskiy Rayon: Copper contacts were ripped off the rail  joints on a two-kilometer stretch of the railway. Major Lysenko  looked into this case. Aware that this crime was committed for  the purpose of selling copper to Polish smugglers, he began to  pay close attention to citizens of the neighboring state. In  January 1993 he noticed two Polish "tourists" hiding scrap  copper under the seat. Having memorized the license number of  one car, he gave instructions that it be stopped at the border  crossing in Sheginy. The person detained turned out to be Janusz  Bojarski, a small-time Polish smuggler from the small border  town of Radymno. The major let him go, but gave him his  telephone number and asked him to call when he was next in  Mostiska. The major had one goal: to get through Bojarski to the  sources of supply of nonferrous metals for Polish smugglers in  Mostisskiy Rayon. Besides, he wanted to determine which of the  Ukrainian customs officers were allowing the contraband through  in exchange for bribes.    The major did not manage to uncover the nonferrous metals  thieves. However, a good relationship developed between him and  Bojarski based on mutual services. A. Lysenko gave J. Bojarski  passes with which the latter went through customs out of turn  (at the time one would have to wait two or three days in line),  while Bojarski brought the major citrus fruit for his sick son  and merchandise from Poland.    Polish special services learned about the contacts between  Bojarski and the SBU officer, and he was arrested in June 1993.    On 23 August 1993 Major Lysenko and his entire family went  to  Przemysl, where his son was supposed to be seen by a Polish  specialist before surgery (already his fourth). He was arrested  by functionaries of the Polish Security Service immediately at  the border crossing.    He was accused of recruiting Bojarski as a secret agent,  directing his espionage activities, and receiving needed  information.    The charges of espionage against A. Lysenko and J. Bojarski  are absurd. However, it was important to someone that this case  be widely publicized through the mass media and presented in the  light of a sensational espionage affair. It was precisely in  this context that Ostankino also reported it, even after the  second day of the proceedings, after the entire case had been  clarified.</p>

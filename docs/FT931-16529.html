			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Pit closures fight stepped up FURTHER CHALLENGES to force a resumption of work at threatened pits and to refund lost earnings of laid-off miners were mounted yesterday as unions intensified their campaign to keep mines open. Following meetings at the Trades Union Congress in London yesterday, mine and rail unions also said they would next week consider a national stay-at-home day of action in protest at threatened pit closures, job losses and privatisation. That could cause friction with other unions and the TUC, which is planning a day of action next month when TUC officials expect unemployment to exceed 3m. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said he had written to the prime minister saying that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was personally liable for more than Pounds 100m paid by the government for miners' severance payments since the announcement in October that 31 pits were to be closed. Mr Scargill's contention follows the High Court judgment in December that the government had acted unlawfully in deciding to close 31 pits without a proper review. He told Mr Major that taxpayers' money had been spent unlawfully on severance payments and that Mr Heseltine was in the same position as local councillors or company directors who had incurred liabilities for illegal acts. Mr Scargill also demanded the resumption of production at the 10 pits earmarked for immediate closure, and the refunding of lost earnings for miners laid off on basic pay since October. The more important legal argument now centres on the 10 pits, which were excluded from the Department of Trade and Industry review of the original closure decision. The unions insist that the High Court ruling means a version of the industry's Modified Colliery Review Procedure has to be implemented for the 10 pits. This means it could be early summer before a decision is made. The High Court ruling appears to give the unions the right to reject the government's decision to appoint John T. Boyd, the US mining consultancy, as the independent reviewer of the 10 pits. Mr Scargill said yesterday the unions would reject Boyd and quoted from the ruling: 'It is for British Coal and the unions to decide how . . . an independent scrutiny should be conducted and who should conduct it.' The unions also argue that work should resume at the 10 pits or it may be impossible to resume profitable production when the review is complete. The TUC claims that the cost of keeping the pits open but not producing coal is nearly Pounds 5m a week. The government is determined not to start coal production. British Coal said production would stop next week at Betws colliery in Wales which is the only one of the 10 where it has been continuing.</p>

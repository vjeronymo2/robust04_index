			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [SPASENIYE "Own Information" under the rubric "Officially </F> Speaking": "On the President's Desk"]    [Text] As we have learned from reliable sources, waiting  for the signature of the president of the Russian Federation is  the draft edict "On State Strategy of the Russian Federation for  Protection of the Environment and Provision of Stable  Development," prepared by specialists of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, the  Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian  Federation Ministry of Finance, with the participation of other  interested ministries and departments and the State-Legal  Administration of the president of the Russian Federation. The  draft was drawn up in execution of the government plan of action  for 1993-1994 for implementation of the first stage of the  program "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian  Economy."    The draft was developed in order to organize constructive  interaction among organs of state power at all levels, local  self-government, entrepreneurs, and public associations for  comprehensive solutions to problems of economic development and  provision of ecological safety. It was prepared taking into  account the article of the new Russian Federation Constitution  which proclaimed the right of each citizen to a healthy  environment and also the principles of stable development  presented in documents of the UN Conference on the Environment  and Development (1992), to which our state was a signatory.    The model for stable development presupposes:    -- a balanced approach to solving problems of socioeconomic  development and preservation of a favorable condition of the  environment and natural resource potential;    -- both the restriction and elimination of unviable models  of  production and consumption and the surmounting of obstacles on  the path to the development of entrepreneurship;    -- the elimination of distortions in state expenditures and  the organization of efficient control, which should link an  effective system of state administration to individual rules and  capabilities of economic activity in the area of self-government  as well.    But, getting away from official language and shifting to one  that is generally comprehensible, in brief, the provision of  ecological safety of stable development may be defined as the  encouragement of environmental protection activity, that is,  implementation of a favorable policy in the tax and financial  spheres under conditions of development of market relations. In  other words, economic activity (new economic policy) should  ideally be oriented toward the achievement of economic  well-being in combination with Russia's ecological safety.    The main directions of the ecological policy are formed from  four sections which encompass, in the first place, problems of  justified (that is, without damage to nature or the environment)  distribution of productive forces and, correspondingly,  everything related to the extraction of resources and salvaging  and decontamination of production wastes.    Second, the creation of the healthiest possible living  environment for man in cities and rural areas.    Third, the restoration of disturbed ecosystems in  ecologically unfavorable regions, of which there are many. This  includes also problems of protecting the Volga, Baykal, the  Black and Caspian Seas, Lakes Onega and Ladoga, the Neva inlet,  regions of the Far North, and also the Kavkazskiye Mineralnyye  Vody health complex.    And, finally, there are global problems of the planet,  particularly protection of the ozone layer and prevention of  climatic changes, protection and restoration of forests,  solutions to problems of the World Ocean, and so forth and so  on...</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Daboa Youth Association has appealed to the  government to take the necessary action to protect the lives and  property of the Dagombas, Gonjas, and Nanumbas now that they  have surrendered their arms to the military task force. The  appeal was contained in a statement issued in Tamale and signed  by the northern regional president of the association, Mr.  Mohammed Mumuni.    The association pointed out that despite the recent  directives of the task force commandant to the Konkomba warriors  to gather at certain designated areas for the disarming process,  they have flouted these orders and are still attacking and  burning down villages. It cited the cases of Tabia and Sanye  which were attacked and burned last week resulting in the loss  of lives and damage to property. The association expressed  concern about the alarming rate of displaced persons and  appealed for more relief aid for them.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak reduced to Pounds 2.2m after second half setback FIERCE competition in the food industry, higher meat prices and teething troubles with a new freezer plant hit profits of Dalepak, the frozen foods and ready meals maker. At the pre-tax level they dropped from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 2.21m over the year to April 30. In the second half pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 600,000, after Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.7m) for the opening period. The group warned in March that profits would be significantly below market expectations at that time, but indicated that the dividend would be maintained. Yesterday that promise was kept with the recommendation of a 4.5p final to give an unchanged total of 6p. With earnings per share down from 23.01p to 13p, the dividend is still covered 2.2 times. Margins were affected in the second half by 'substantial increases in meat raw material prices' triggered by sterling's devaluation last September. Those higher costs could not be fully recovered through increased selling prices. Dalepak did not say how much delays in commissioning the new freezing plant had cost. The shares have fallen from a peak of 383p in January, when the interim profits were announced, making Dalepak one of the worst performers in the market in the first half of the year. Yesterday the shares fell again, closing at 193p, down 12p. Sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 42.2m, but the financial year covered 53 weeks and on a comparable 52-week basis they were 2 per cent higher. In frozen meat grill steaks, where Dalepak is the market leader, sales were slightly up, but in vegetable products there was a fall, despite a 17 per cent growth in the market. Trading profits fell from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 2.48m, with margins down from 9.7 to 5.9 per cent. Interest rose from Pounds 33,000 to Pounds 268,000 reflecting a two-year Pounds 7.3m capital expenditure programme. The group said trading conditions remained difficult, although meat prices had stabilised. New products had been introduced and the completion of the new plant should bring cost savings. Gearing at the year end was just below 40 per cent (23 per cent).</p>

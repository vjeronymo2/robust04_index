			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "CEA Opens Its Lab Doors to </F> PMEs"]    [Text] Materials, lasers, robotics, microelectronics,  environment: The CEA [Atomic Energy Commission] range of  capabilities is vast and varied. And the PMEs [Small and  Medium-Sized Business(es)] are invited to "do their shopping  there."    How to fettle an octagonally shaped porcelain plate,  automatically. The problem might appear trivial. But engineers  of the CEA's robotics unit at Fontenay-aux-Roses (Hauts de  Seine) did not consider it beneath them to work away at it. And  at the end of a few months, they proposed a solution to Jammet  Seignoles, the small Limousin-based company (30 million  francs[Fr] in annual revenue, 100 employees), which had posed  the problem.    "We dealt with persons who knew very little about ceramics,  but who knew how to think, and they came up with a method that  has the merit of being very simple," says Henri Seignoles, CEO  [chief executive officer] of the company. A prototype, built by  Cerlim, satisfied the principal condition of the specifications:  the ability to fettle an octagonally-shaped plate with facets of  unequal lengths, a task that is beyond the capability of  present-day machines.    Other examples could be cited in which PMEs have found  within  the CEA laboratories the capabilities they otherwise lacked. But  until just recently, it was up to the companies to find a way to  access this reservoir of know-how. A far from productive method  of proceeding, in the view of the CEA.    "We decided to invert the procedure and to reach out to  industry ourselves with a view to evaluating its needs," says  Alain Bugat, director of advanced technologies, the CEA  department responsible for the dissemination of technologies to  the industrial sector. A dozen or so engineers from the  different research centers have been placed on detached service  with the regional delegations of the ANVAR [National Agency for  the Development and Commercialization of Research].    This week, on 3 November, in keeping with this policy, the  CEA is opening 11 of its research centers, including certain  military laboratories, to industrial firms. Each of these  centers will offer its know-hows in a specific domain: ceramics  for the Bruyeres-le-Chatel (Essonne), lasers for Limeil  (Val-de-Marne), microelectronics for Grenoble (Isere), etc.    Enterprises interested in a technology can take advantage of  this policy in several ways. Through a simple consultation or a  full-fledged expert evaluation procedure. Two years ago, for  example, the Trefilerie des Vosges company, specializing in the  manufacture of rails for miniature trains, sought to acquire a  Japanese license for an alloy used in the manufacture of  eyeglasses and jewelry. The company requested a study by a CEA  laboratory in Saclay (Essonne). It was well that it did: The  alloy in question was found to be too prone to oxidation.    Another example: Inoteb, a small Bretagne-based company,  specializing in osseous prostheses, called upon the CEA's  analytic capabilities (gamma radiography, radioactive tracing)  to track the recolonization of prostheses by bone, in a living  organism.    The CEA's assistance can go further. Sodeva, a PME based in  Annemasse (Haute-Savoie), requested the aid of the Grenoble  center in developing an ultrasonic sprayer-drier.    "We had the know-how in the technology of power ultrasonics,  and the CEA had the know-how in spraying-and-drying technology,"  says Dominique Dubruque, the CEO of the small company (four  persons). The company sold four systems, one of them in the food  industry field.    For Sart, an enterprise with 75 employees and an annual  revenue of Fr50 million, located in Noisy-le-Grand  (Seine-Saint-Denis), collaboration with the CEA took the form of  a joint study that led to the cession of a patent. This PME,  specializing in the manufacture of gate valves, flap valves,  flowmeters, etc..., was asked, early on, to develop  magnetically-closed safety valves, based on a CEA idea (under  the Tore Supra project). It is now the proprietor of a patent,  and pays the CEA a royalty on each valve it sells. Its principal  client is currently the CERN [European Nuclear Research Center],  which has a requirement for 2,600 valves. And shortly, Sart  hopes to add the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Sport: One for the future - Tennis / John Barrett admires the young Russian, Yevgeny Kafelnikov It was one of those working breakfasts. I had arranged to meet the Russian Davis Cup captain Vadim Borisov, who was staying at the same hotel during last January's Australian Open. I was keen to discover Vadim's opinion of his 19-year-old countryman, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who I had first seen two weeks earlier in Adelaide when he had beaten Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter and fellow Russian Alexander Volkov, to win his first open tournament. In Melbourne the previous day, the youngster had come within two points of beating the world No 1, Pete Sampras. Sampras, taken to five sets, had been in no doubt about the potential of his adversary. 'He's young, has some of the best ground strokes I've ever played against and returned my serve as well as anyone ever has. In my prediction he's going to be top 20 or better in a couple of years.' Sampras could hardly have guessed how quickly his prophecy would be fulfilled. After a season which has included three wins over Michael Stich and successes against Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Goran Ivanisevic, young Kafelnikov, now a rangy 20-year-old, has won two tournaments and lifted himself to No 11 on the ATP computer rankings. Borisov will not be surprised. He had told me that day in Melbourne how ambitious Kafelnikov was. But he did have reservations. 'It will all depend upon the quality of his work. He must get stronger and learn to volley. He grew up with Andrei (Medvedev) but never worked as hard on his game as Andrei did. He can be moody, too, but there is no question, at times he can be quite brilliant.' The world will be able to enjoy that brilliance this weekend when history will be made in Moscow. For the first time since 1900, when the Harvard student Dwight Davis presented a handsome silver punch bowl, worth Dollars 1,000, for annual competition between the tennis playing nations of the world, a Russian team has reached the final of the Davis Cup. Their opponents are the four-time champions, Sweden, led by Stefan Edberg who is playing in his 30th tie and his 6th final. He is the only member of his team who has experienced the highly-charged atmosphere of a Davis Cup final which can play havoc with the nerves. The tie is being played in the 12,000 seat Olympic Stadium where President Boris Yeltsin, himself a keen tennis player, is expected to lead the cheers for his unseeded countrymen. This was not the final the world expected. The semi-finals produced two of the most extraordinary upsets in the history of the competition. In Gothenburg Sweden beat the top-seeded US after losing the first two rubbers - something that has never happened before in a Davis Cup semi-final. In Hamburg, on a fast hard court laid specially over their traditional clay to suit Stich, the defending champions lost the first three rubbers to Russia, their first defeat on home soil since the 1985 final loss to Sweden. Although Sweden have won both their previous encounters against Russia, the odds are even this year. Kafelnikov is still improving while Edberg, who will be 29 next month, is probably past his peak. Furthermore, Thursday's draw gave Edberg an opening match against the No 2 Russian, Alexander Volkov, who has always been a thorn in his side. Volkov reached his highest-ever ranking of 14 in August last year and is brilliant but unpredictable, just the sort of man all the top players hate to face. Stich was on the receiving end of that brilliance in the semi-final and in the first round this year Volkov had sealed the fate of Australia by beating their rising star, Patrick Rafter, in the tie-winning fourth rubber. The draw for the second rubber pitted Kafelnikov against Larsson, a man who had beaten him 7-6 7-6 in the final of Germany's new pre-Wimbledon grass court tournament in Halle. Larsson had been the hero of Sweden's thrilling win against the Americans at the end of September. Having won the doubles, Sweden had drawn level when Sampras, one set down in his match against Edberg, had been forced to retire with an injured hamstring. In the deciding rubber Larsson had played the match of his life to win in four sets against the No 2 American, Todd Martin, whose nerve failed him. Strong nerves will be needed by the Swedish pair in today's doubles match, so often the rubber which decides Davis Cup ties. Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman could not have been better prepared. They arrived in Moscow on Monday as the newly crowned ATP Tour World Doubles champions. Their five-set final in Jakarta last Sunday against Australia's 'Woodies' - Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde - was one of the most exciting matches I have seen for years. At 5-4 in the fourth set Woodbridge served for the title and the same player was serving at 5/4 in the fourth set tie-break. At those crucial moments the Swedes were superb, returning serve with great skill to turn the match their way. It had been the same in Gothenburg in the Davis Cup semi-final against the Americans. Their crucial tie-saving victory against Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark nearly blew the roof off the Scandinavium as the home fans went wild. However, as they will discover, a Davis Cup final on foreign soil will pose different problems. Tomorrow's meeting between Kafelnikov and Edberg is the match I am looking forward to. When they last met in Stockholm, five weeks ago on a carpet court, the Russian won 7-6 6-2. Will Edberg's greater experience of these occasions be enough to counter the growing expertise of this future champion? Personally I doubt it. Whatever the outcome this weekend, the unparalleled excitement this event has caused in Moscow proves once again the eternal appeal of international contests at the highest level. Since the Davis Cup became sponsored by NEC in 1981, the number of entries for this largest annual team competition in world sport has more than doubled to its present 109 nations. Next year a record 115 countries will take part.</p>

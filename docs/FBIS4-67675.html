			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert R. Requintina] </F>   [Text] Health Secretary Juan Flavier said yesterday that  there are eight new cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)  which causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS ),  bringing to 483 the total number of AIDS cases in the  Philippines this year.    Flavier also said the Department of Health (DOH) has decided  to temporarily withhold the distribution of information,  education and communication materials earlier found "offensive"  pending the release of guidelines.    As of February this year, Flavier said the total number of  fullblown AIDS cases was 127 while 77 persons have already died  of the incurable disease. Of the new cases, four were females  while the rest were males whose ages ranged from 31 to 33 years  old.    The health department estimated that 50,000 people harbor  the  HIV virus but are not aware of it. Less than 500 cases have  been documented and 116 have resulted in deaths from full-blown  AIDS. HIV infection in the Philippines is transmitted primarily  through heterosexual and not homosexual contact.    Flavier said that ReachOut [as published] material entitled  "Lust for Life" which contained pictures of men in anal sex  would not be released until members of the HIV-AIDS network have  agreed on the guidelines next week.    The material was also reported to have reached school  children. Apparently, he said, the Filipinos are not yet ready  for the kind of material which was funded by an American  organization and aimed at homosexuals.    Another non-government organization, Kabalikat [copartner],  which printed comics on family planning was the subject of  criticisms by the school and the church sectors. Flavier said  that the comics contained the use of condoms with the penis in  an erect position.    "As a doctor, I don't find it offensive. But if it affects  the sensibilities of some people, then we also have to discuss  this matter," he said.    Flavier stressed that the health department cannot censor  the  information materials because the DOH lacks specific guidelines.</p>

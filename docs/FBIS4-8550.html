			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "President Berisha Meets With the </F> German Ambassador in Tirana, Claus Vollers, Representative of  the European Union Troika to Albania"]    [Text] Tirana, April 14 (ATA) -- The president of Republic  of Albania, Sali Berisha, met April 13 with the ambassador of  the FR [Federal Republic] of Germany in Tirana, His Excellency  Claus Vollers, representative of the EU troika to Albania.  President Berisha said:    "I called you to this meeting as representative of the EU  troika, and the same information will also be sent to the  Belgian Foreign Ministry asking you to inform the governments of  the EU member countries of the following:    "Albania has the necessary documentation that the Greek  terrorist commando came from the territory of Greece, and after  the crime, that is, the massacre in the recruits' garrison of  Peshkepia e Siperme in the early hours of April 10, 1994, in  which it killed Captain Fatmir Shehu (age 34, born in Tepelena)  and soldier Arsen Gjini (age 20, born in Seman) and wounded many  other soldiers, out of whom three very seriously, the commando  returned to the territory of Greece in the direction of the  border crossing point of Argjirohor.    "The Greek military uniform of the criminals, the  professionalism of crime, the objects found, which are part of  the equipment of the special units, prove the argument that the  Greek commando belonged to the special units of Greece, or had a  special training. The Albanian Government, in its April 10 note  addressed to the Greek Government, although it blamed the Greek  Government for the incident, as the terrorist commando came for  its territory and returned to the same place, asked the Greek  Government to find out and punish the authors of the crime, as  it might not be directly responsible for the incident. But,  press releases of the Greek Government not only did not show  regret for the incident, but we learned that this responsibility  laid on the Greek Government was interpreted by the government  of Athens as a contradiction of the Albanian note.    "Just as in the case of the fire opened by a Greek war-ship  against an Albanian motor boat in the Albanian territorial  waters, in the Bay of Saranda on January 4, 1994, that of the  Greek mine sweeper in the Albanian territories near the Cape of  Qefali on March 10, of the two Greek armed soldiers who entered  Vidohova on March 12 and threatened Albanian citizens, or that  of the killing of Alfred Muco, 20 years old, by Greek patrols on  March 21, Greece has chosen to deny the fact giving no official  response.    "In revenge for the dispatch of the general consul from  Gjirokaster, who along with indecent activity has acted contrary  to the post of the consul he was holding without having the  approval by the host country, in complete flagrant opposition to  Article 12 of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our  consul in Athens but the first secretary of the Albanian Embassy  in Athens.    "In these conditions, Albania is not going to follow a  policy  of revenge by expelling from Tirana serious Greek diplomats, but  on the basis of Article 11 of the Vienna Convention which says  that 'In case a clear agreement does not exist about the number  of the embassy staffs, the host country may ask that this number  be in the limits it considers as reasonable and normal, taking  into consideration the conditions existing in that country and  the needs of the said mission,' asks from the Greek Government  to take all measures so that within ten days it has the same  number of diplomats in Tirana as the number of Albanian  diplomats in Athens, respectively 6 diplomats, otherwise this  number must be defined on the basis of a bilateral agreement.    "Albania asks the Council of Ministers of the EU to demand  from Greece to give an official answer on the event.    "Albania is for dialogue, but it will not accept the  meetings  offered without having received an official reply from the Greek  Government for the grave terroristic act.    "Albania demands from the Council of Ministers of the  European Union to verify all the above terroristic acts and  voices its readiness for full cooperation with these commission.  We also agree that this task be trusted to the existing  observers commission of the EU that is observing our  northeastern border, but since the chairman of the turn of the  commission for this six month period is a Greek official,  according to recognized principle of the international law, he  will not be a party in the judgment.    "We also ask the Council of Ministers of the EU to demand  from Greece to put an end to these acts condemnable by the UN  charter and which runs counter to the Maastricht principles of  which Greece has promised it will observe. We would like to  assure Greece that Albania is resolute to cooperate with the EU  and its member countries, the countries of the region and Greece  and all other countries that are interested in the lowering of  tension and the stability in the region."</p>

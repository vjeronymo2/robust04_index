			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kranti Kumar Sharma: "How Long Will the </F> Displaced Kashmiris Be Neglected?"]    [Text] The Indian delegates attending the UN Human Rights  Commission's 50th conference have declared Pakistan's failure to  get support for its resolution on human rights violations in  Kashmir as their great victory. However, the displaced Kashmiris  have played a very important role in this success. They not only  exposed the insincerity of Pakistan's worry about human rights,  but also informed the international community of its wicked  plans to spread terrorism. Will the government continue to be  uninvolved in the pain of the hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris  who are living like refugees in their own country?    Ajay Chrungoo, president of the Kashmiri Pandits  organization, Panun Kashmir, appealed to the Human Rights  Commission asking that before cultural disintegration and ethnic  genocide happens, the international community should interfere  and stop it. According to him more than 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits  had to flee the valley to avoid terrorism. Pakistan has always  tried to strengthen the fundamentalists in the valley to take  over Kashmir. Now, the Kashmiri Pandits are living like refugees  in a democratic and secular nation like India. The terrorist  activities in Kashmir have transformed into efforts to get rid  of the minority Hindus in the valley. This is the climax of the  ethnic genocide of this peace-loving group. The purpose of the  terrorists behind this violence is to annihilate all the  non-Muslim groups in Kashmir and form a society based on the  supremacy and control of one religion. The violent activities of  the terrorists in Kashmir cannot be declared appropriate because  of their political or so-called idealist values. The terrorism  in Kashmir is not a war for independence in any sense. An  independence effort that destroys other people's independence  just is not appropriate.    The Indo-European Kashmir Forum also called a press  conference to get international support for the Kashmiri Hindus.  The president of this forum is Dr. Shakti Bhan Khanna, and  includes Dr. K.N. Pandita, president of Panun Kashmir's women  branch, and the leaders of the Daughters of Vitasta and Friends  of Kashmir. These Kashmiri leaders said that the Kashmiri  Pandits have been pushed into the margins because of Islamic  fundamentalism and violence spread by the terrorists for the  last five years. About 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to  flee the valley because of murders, rapes, verbal abuse,  humiliation of women, and physical tortures. About 100,000  Pandits have been mercilessly murdered. They expressed regret  that the international community, especially the human rights  organizations and communication media, have not paid any  attention to the prolonged tragedy of Kashmiri Pandits. The  representatives of human rights organizations have not visited  even once after 1990 to observe the Kashmiri Pandits who have  directly suffered from Pakistani conspiracies. It is ironical  that none of the organizations in the world that claim to  protect human rights have taken this human tragedy seriously.  According to Kashmiri leaders, they also met with the Amnesty  International and other human rights organizations. However,  Amnesty flatly said that it only deals with terrorism in which  governments are involved. When Amnesty was told that the  terrorism in Kashmir is spread by Pakistan, it did not pay any  attention to it.    It is a result of Kashmir Pandits' activities that there is  a  possibility of Kashmir Pandits' problems being discussed in a  sub-committee meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva  this summer. Abraham Fall, assistant general secretary of the UN  Human Rights Commission, told the leaders of Kashmiri refugees  that the problem of Kashmiri Pandits is really serious and it is  imperative that an acceptable solution of this problem is found.  Some Kashmiri separatists had insisted to Abraham Fall to send a  fact-finding commission to Kashmir. However, he had rejected  this request saying that he did not want to form any  presumptions on this issue.    The Kashmir Pandits are greatly perturbed by the Indian  government's lack of interest. During the last week of December  last year, they had organized the first Kashmiri Pandits  Conference in Delhi. In this conference they declared Pakistan a  terrorist nation and appealed to human rights organization,  religious groups, and all the countries in the world to declare  Pakistan a terrorist nation for encouraging terrorism in India.  The "Delhi Declaration" was issued at the end of this  conference. This declaration said that Kashmiri Pandits will  increase their efforts to get Panun Kashmir back. It also had a  map of Panun Kashmir which shows the region from Baramula in the  northeast of the Vitasta River to Berinag as part of Panun  Kashmir. The Delhi Declaration asked that Panun Kashmir be under  the central government and that the Indian Constitution be fully  implemented there.    The demand for a separate homeland by the Kashmiri Pandits  may appear to be impractical but they have used this demand for  outlining their needs for resettlement. The Kashmiri refugees  are suffering from a double tragedy. The Pakistan-supported  terrorism has forced them to leave their homes on the one side,  and the government's neglect on the other side has made things  even worse. The demand for a homeland will not solve the  problem, however, we have to understand that the Kashmiri  Pandits cannot be totally ousted from Kashmir. Kashmir belong to  them as much as it does to those of other religions living  there. It is the government's responsibility to create the  opportunities for this peace-loving group displaced by the  terrorists to return to the valley. However, the government does  not seem to be serious at all about it. The Bharatiya Janata  Party has demanded several times in the Parliament and in the  streets for plans to resettle and return the Kashmiris to their  home. However, the government did not pay any heed to it. Should  not our government pay attention to the Kashmiri refugees after  returning from Geneva?*</p>

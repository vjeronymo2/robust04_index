			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Disgusted voters of Tunbridge revolt The Pantiles, a street of elegant shops, antique dealers and fine tea rooms, exemplifies the aristocratic, old world charm of Tunbridge Wells. But even here, in the centre of this Tory heartland town in Kent, signs of the recession are apparent. A wide, dusty window advertises a lease for the empty shop behind. Next door, the Stamp Shop is holding a 'closing down' sale. On Thursday night in Tunbridge Wells local voters wrested control of the local council from the Conservatives and handed the Liberal Democrats a gain of five seats. Many voters saw this upset as a referendum of discontent with national issues. 'I think Major and his government got a kick in the pants,' said Mr John Hopkinson, membership secretary for the Tunbridge Wells Chamber of Commerce. 'People are facing the recession. Small businesses especially are feeling the pressure and the pinch, and I hope the vote will make the government more aware of that.' Mrs Elizabeth Elliot, a customer at Gemini Cards on the Pantiles and a worker in an antique shop there, warmed to the subject. 'We are letting the government know what we think, even if we would prefer a Conservative council,' she said hotly. Pensioners who felt bitter with the government were jubilant at the results. 'I am well pleased,' said Mrs Joyce Churcher. 'We have just about had enough of this government, what with closing down hospitals and VAT on fuel.' The 'protest vote' seems to have put the nail in the Tories' coffin. Mr Hopkinson, a former Tory councillor in the north of England, said he had voted for a Labour candidate to register his own protest vote. Some electors said that local issues, rather than national policy, guided their vote. Mrs Debbie Millar, who works in the family-owned Breeds the Cutler on the High Street, the oldest store in Tunbridge Wells, said that she had not voted Tory, for the first time in her life, because she was so upset with the local authority. 'This council has ruined the town for retailers,' she said. 'They have cut our turnover by half.' She said the council had voted to build a shopping centre with chain stores, such as Boots and Marks and Spencer, which draw a large portion of her local business away. Upon reflection, she admitted that national policy had influenced her decision. 'The general attitude of government to small family businesses is appalling,' she said. 'I probably won't vote Tory in the general election.' In spite of the town's anger with the Tories, voters are reluctant to start shedding Tunbridge Wells' image as the Tory heartland. 'This was a classic case of the voters delivering a bloody nose to the government,' said Mr Steve Smith, an advertising account manager, who was posting a letter in the busy Pantiles post office. 'But I think come a national election, people will go back to 'true-blue'.'</p>

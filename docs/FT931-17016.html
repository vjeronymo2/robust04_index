			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Private View: The man who broke the Bank of England - George Soros is a speculator. He bet heavily against the ERM and won dollars 2bn. Now he is giving the money away WHEN A man makes so much money that he can afford to give away Dollars 250m it is no surprise to learn he has a theory about life. George Soros, the Hungarian fund manager who broke the Bank of England in September and gave the Bosnian Muslims a Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.8m) Christmas present, is rather different. Not only is he one of the most successful financial speculators in history but in his case the theory came before, not after, the moneymaking. Soros is a frustrated intellectual who once fancied himself a new Keynes or Einstein. As a youth in Nazi - and then Communist - Budapest, he was plagued by the philosophical problem of the subjectivity of human perceptions. He tried, and failed, to resolve the problem in a treatise called 'The Burden of Consciousness'. Even before arriving in England at the age of 17 to study under him at the London School of Economics, Soros had felt the influence of Sir Karl Popper, the Viennese philosopher of science whose Open Society and its Enemies denounced Plato, Hegel, Marx and all historical determinism. After an undistinguished merchant banking apprenticeship in the City and Wall Street, Soros found himself in charge of an investment portfolio and began to apply his ideas on human subjectivity to the market, anticipating the unexpected, betting against the conventional wisdom. At the same time, through making (and losing) money, he began to understand his own ideas better. In 1969 he set up a private mutual fund, registered offshore in Curacao in the Lesser Antilles, which he later called 'Quantum' in apparent homage to the Indeterminacy Principle of quantum mechanics formulated by Heisenberg. Soros admits that his philosophy is more of an approach than a scientific hypothesis, let alone a general theory. But he says it provides the connection between the way he makes money and the way he disburses it. In human relations - in social science, economics - objectivity is a mirage and disequilibrium the natural state, he argues. Markets cannot properly discount the future because ideas about the future are biased. The value of collateral is changed by the fact of the loan against it. In other words, beliefs alter facts. This perception, Soros says, helps him both to make money and to target his donations in a way that will influence history in eastern Europe and Russia. 'My financial and philanthropic activities are based on the same philosophical idea about the relationship between participants' thinking and the situation in which they participate,' he explained. Soros predicted the 1987 stock market crash but lost Dollars 800m, a third of the fund's then value, by wrongly calculating that the crash would start in Japan. Last September he netted perhaps Dollars 2bn when he bet massively against the European exchange rate mechanism. Since 1979 he has spent some Dollars 100m to create his Open Society Fund, Soros Foundations and Central European University throughout the former Communist bloc. Another Dollars 100m went recently to support Russian science. I asked him: is it harder to get rid of money than it is to make it? 'In my case it is.' Why is that? 'It seems to take more time and more energy. In making money you have a bottom line which gives you a pretty firm measure of success. But when you are trying to influence the shape of society you don't have a bottom line; and given that all actions have unintended consequences you certainly cannot measure success by the amount of money you give away - because that money can easily be wasted.' So what yardstick do you use? 'When I was confronted with closed societies the goal was simply to foster pluralism, to enable people to do things which were not centrally determined but autonomous and spontaneous. So we made small grants over a broad range. 'The idea was very simple: that if you expose a dogma to alternatives, it will crumble, because it will be seen to be false once you have something to compare it with. That was the first phase. 'Then came the hard part. Because when the Communist system collapsed you then had to engage in a much more laborious and in many ways boring process. You had to select key areas: the emphasis has been on education, institution-building and the media, though there are arts programmes and other things.' So you won't buy into bus factories? 'Not at all - no investments. In fact, I consider it a conflict of interest.' This was the philosophy, but it did not fully explain the motivation. George Soros agreed that he did not set out to make millions in order to do good works. The careers were consecutive: he went through a sort of crisis which ended with him delegating the fund management. 'By the end of the 1970s I was beginning to make more money than I thought I had a use for in my personal life. So I started thinking about what to do with it. I thought pretty hard and decided that what I cared about was this open society. 'It was a complicated psychological development. For me making money is not easy. To me it's always been a very painful process, very painful, involving great suffering, actually.' Painful in what way? 'Because if you lose money it's very painful and you can't make it without the threat of losing it. It's by avoiding losing money that you make it, you see. For me, investment has always been a process of pain avoidance. Pain is at the core of the process. And in fact I am not willing to take the pain. 'I was disqualified by my success. I went through a kind of internal crisis around 1979-82, where I had to re-evaluate what I was doing.' You felt your life was hollow? 'No. It was a very simple quandary: am I the slave of my own success or am I the master of my own destiny? It really was a struggle between me as a person and my fund as an organisation. It was a struggle that I won and that my fund actually lost - and it was translated into a physical loss in 1981.' Although Soros is of Jewish descent - his father survived the Russian civil war as a prisoner in Siberia - his philanthropy does not 'foster the tribal links'. I asked if he saw himself as a sort of Robin Hood, taxing the rich West to give to the poor East. 'Generally speaking, I am a critic. I am a critic of the processes. I am not an entrepreneur who builds businesses, I am an investor who judges them. My function in the financial markets is that of a critic and my critical judgments are expressed by my decisions to buy and sell. Taxation, levying, doesn't come into it.' Then are you paying a debt to society which has allowed you to take so much money from it? 'No, not in the least. I don't feel that at all. I do it because I am in a position to do it. I have the freedom and the means. I do it because I think it makes sense. I don't have any sense of guilt at all.' You have said you don't regard speculation as immoral. 'No, not at all. It's a profession - in America very highly respected, here less so. But it is a strictly professional activity.' Do you see it as gambling? 'Not at all.' You wouldn't call it hedging, though, would you? 'Also not, no. It's genuine speculation, speculative investment. It's seeking a high return on capital.' Is it a necessary function of an open society to have people like you in it? 'I think it's a necessary function for financial markets. Basically, all investors are doing what I am doing. I'm doing it more aggressively and more to the point, more clearly recognising what the objectives are, which is to make money with money.' Do you spend money on yourself? You have four houses, I believe. 'I used to collect but actually I don't have great material needs. I like my comfort. But, really, I am a very abstract person.'</p>

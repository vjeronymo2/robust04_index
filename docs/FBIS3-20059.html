Since the fire was soon discovered and the  fire-brigade was called, only minor damage was caused. The room  where the divine services are held was not damaged.    Winfried Tabarelli, senior director of the Criminal  Investigation Department for the South of Schleswig-Holstein,  said at the scene that there had been no indications of an  attack. It is impossible to guard every possible target of an  attack around the clock. Nevertheless, the attack has to be  rated as attempted murder, since six families live in the house,  he said.

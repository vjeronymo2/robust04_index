According to the latest national sample survey on private  enterprises, the total number of employers and employees in such  firms reached 3.72 million last year, an increase of 60 percent  over 1992.    The survey, which was conducted by China's Academy of Social  Sciences (CASS) and a research office of the All-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce, is designed to look at the  development of the much-talked-about private firms.    Researchers said that questionnaires were answered by owners  of 1,432 private firms.    The survey said that these firms' registered capital totaled  68 billion yuan last year, twice as much as the previous figure.  Registered capital per firm also increased by 80 percent to  268,000 yuan.    The results show that the private firms are expanding in  terms of financial strength and business scale.    The survey also found that about 40 percent of private firms  are very profitable, 20 percent are fairly profitable, and 30  percent could make ends meet, while 10 percent are operating in  the red.    By last June, private firms each with assets exceeding one  million [as received] numbered 4,072, compared with only 885 in  1992. In some areas, the total value of assets in individual  private firms exceeds 10 million yuan or even 100 million yuan  each.    The survey, headed by CASS senior researcher Zhang Houyi,  also concluded that by last June, limited companies had  increased by nearly four times over the same period of the  previous year, and firms engaging in service trade had increased  drastically.</p>

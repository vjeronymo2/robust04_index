			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Far right backs CDU presidential candidate THE National Democratic Party, Germany's radical right-wing party, yesterday threw its support behind Mr Steffen Heitmann, the Christian Democratic Union candidate in next May's presidential election. The backing is likely to embarrass Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing CDU which has stood behind Mr Heitmann, Saxony's justice minister, despite his controversial remarks about Germany's past. An NPD statement said: 'While Mr Heitmann is still a long way from taking true nationalist positions, we can expect him to speak out on uncomfortable truths.' Mr Heitmann has been criticised mainly for his views on the Maastricht treaty, which he believes is being imposed on people, his conservative views on women and suggestions that Germans need no longer be so obsessed by the country's Nazi past. At present he faces only one opponent - Mr Johannes Rau, North Rhine-Westphalia's premier, who is the opposition Social Democratic party's candidate.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / BA rejects offer by USAir pilots Pilots at USAir, the country's sixth largest carrier, yesterday unveiled a restructuring plan which would grant employees a 25 per cent stake in the airline, plus Dollars 700m in preferred stock, in exchange for Dollars 2.5bn in wage cuts over five years. The proposal by the Air Lines Pilots' Association also calls for British Airways to invest an additional Dollars 450m in USAir. BA already owns 24.6 per cent of the US carrier. However, BA rejected the call for an additional commitment on its part. 'On the basis of the conditions outlined by the USAir pilots, it is clear that British Airways could not contemplate further investment in USAir,' said Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of the British carrier. British Airways has already stated it was freezing further investment in USAir until USAir has completed its process of restructuring to the satisfaction of British Airways. Regarding the pilots' offer, Mr Peter Gauthier, chairman of the association's USAir master executive council, said: 'This is an offer to invest, not to buy. 'We are insisting that management share control as we jointly attempt to restore our airline to profitability.' The initial response to the plan was not favourable. Mr Seth Schofield, USAir chairman and chief executive, said it 'raises serious concern with respect to complex issues'. The company declined further comment until it had evaluated the proposals. In presenting its proposals, the pilots revealed the terms under which they would agree to help USAir trim one of the highest cost structures in the industry. Last week, the union had signalled its willingness to make Dollars 750m in wage concessions over a five years in return for a 'substantial' ownership position. Although USAir turned in a small operating profit in the second quarter, its long-term prospects are uncertain in view of increased competition along its east coast routes.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kumagai Gumi quits Frankfurt project Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction company, is to sell its 25 per cent stake in Frankfurt Properties Investments and withdraw from planned property development in the centre of Frankfurt. Kumagai is selling the stake to Telenorma, an electronics equipment maker and a subsidiary of Bosch of Germany. The Japanese group is closing its wholly-owned subsidiary in Holland, KTN Realty which held the stake in Frankfurt Properties Investments. Telenorma will take over the Frankfurt company. Kumagai said it had sold the stake because of difficulty in obtaining planning permission from the German authorities, the weakening of the property market and gloomy prospects for the planned project. Its withdrawal from the Frankfurt project, initially valued at Y70bn to Y80bn, and the closure of its Dutch subsidiary will result in Kumagai incurring a Y6bn (Dollars 57m) loss. The move comes on the heels of its withdrawal from a highway project in Bangkok, Thailand, and highlights the problems Japanese construction companies are facing in their overseas ventures. Kumagai said that as a result of the sale it would incur a greater loss from its overseas operations than previously forecast. Its extraordinary losses from overseas businesses is now expected to be Y32bn, rather than Y21bn as forecast in February. However, the company does not, as a result, foresee a larger net loss in the current year to the end of March. It is being helped by a larger operating profit than previously estimated and plans to offset the increased overseas loss by selling assets, such as bonds and trust funds as well as properties. Japan's ministry of finance has ordered Kankaku Securities, a medium-sized broker, to suspend corporate client transactions from March 25 to April 7 over the broker's illicit client deals, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.</p>

The sources said that two officers of the U.N. commission,  one from Great Britain and one from Belgium, independently came  to the conclusion that the shell had been fired from the Moslem  side.    The ballistics experts sent the report to the U.N.  Protection  Force (UNPROFOR), but the document apparently got side-tracked  somewhere along the way, the sources said. The sources told  TANJUG that the White House also had a copy of this report.    The French television network TF-1 recently broadcast a  report by its New York correspondent which mentioned the  UNPROFOR report blaming the Moslems for the massacre. The  official UNPROFOR report on the massacre, which killed 68  civilians and wounded around 200 according to Moslem media, said  that it was not possible to establish the guilty party.    THE WASHINGTON POST said on Tuesday that the shell which  caused the massacre at the Sarajevo market, judging from its  effects, could have come from the Moslem side. This article is  the first of its kind in a major U.S. newspaper which even  allows for the possibility that Bosnian Serbs were not  responsible for the massacre.    The massacre triggered NATO to issue an ultimatum and demand  that Bosnian Serbs and Moslems withdraw or place under UNPROFOR  control their heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo or face air  strikes. Western politicians and media, however, interpreted  this as an ultimatum and threat to Serbs, urging only them to  honour the NATO ultimatum.</p>

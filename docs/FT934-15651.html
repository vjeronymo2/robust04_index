			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Allure of the company car as strong as ever THE ALLURE of the company car is not fading as far as the captains of British industry are concerned. In spite of the reduction of tax benefits, 19 out of every 20 company directors surveyed drives a company car, with the average cost of the benefit being Pounds 10,863. Few directors opt for the cash alternative, choosing instead from 37 separate car makes - most of them fast luxury models. About a sixth of the total - 255 directors - drive BMWs, 254 drive Jaguars or Daimlers, and 145 favour Mercedes. Perhaps surprisingly, only one director has a Porsche and only two directors - both chief executives - opt for a Rolls-Royce. The average age of the male directors surveyed is 47. Only 50 of the directors are women, with just two of the 222 companies in the survey employing women as their chief executives. The average total package received by women amounted to Pounds 91,531, compared with the Pounds 157,017 received by male executives.</p>

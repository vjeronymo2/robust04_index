			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> BIDS FOR CURBSIDE RECYCLING  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday decided to put its curbside recycling contract out  to bid instead of granting it to current waste hauler Athens Disposal.  </P> <P> Monterey Park's recycling program will be citywide, rather than phased in, and  will allow single-family residents to combine recyclable aluminum, glass,  newspapers, cans and bottles in one container for pickup once a week. The City  Council will also require the hauler to deposit trimmings from city parks and  medians in compost bins.  </P></p>

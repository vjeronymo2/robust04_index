			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned item under the rubric "A New Newspaper": "As an </F> Aid to the Georgian Village"]    [Text] Helping and aiding the troubled Georgian village is  the patriotic and noble mission that has been undertaken by the  newly formed Georgian Village Society (Professor Bidzina  Sardzhveladze, president). Its purpose is to unite the efforts  of anyone who cares in order to help the village get on its  feet. This aim is promoted by the Society's newspaper KARTULI  SOPELI [Georgian Village] (Vaso Kasradze, editor), the first  edition of which came out the other day.    The lead article on the first page presents the program by  which the newspaper promises anyone concerned about the village  to regularly discuss relevant themes. The editors anticipate  that both farmers and specialists will need advice, help, and  relevant information in order to deal with specific problems.  This will be offered to readers under rubrics such as "Theme of  the Week," "Commentary," "News From the Villages," "Market  Prices," "The Hard Working Farmer," "Letters to KARTULI SOPELI,"  "A Scientist's Opinion," "What's New in Legislation," "Questions  and Answers," "Chronicle of the Life of Business Circles,"  "Stock Exchange News," "Prices," and "The Family Purse."    The newspaper also intends to pay special attention to offer  advice on taking care of orchards, vineyards, field crops,  plantations, and livestock sections, advice which will be useful  to readers through the years. In this way it emphasizes that it  wants to be as practical and useful as possible and help its  readers solve their problems.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government yesterday said it would sternly deal  with any domestic moves to support or praise North Korea's  policy or ideology.    Security-related cabinet officials, in a meeting Monday,  agreed on the necessity of establishing a tight security posture  in the nation with tensions mounting on the Korean Peninsula in  the aftermath of North Korea's confrontations with the  international community over its nuclear issue.    "The officials reaffirmed their will to prevent at any cost  a  situation that may cause public anxiety about security or  threaten stability in the everyday lives of the people," said  the Prime Minister's Office after the meeting. It said they  agreed that both domestic and international measures are  necessary for this purpose.    Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, while presiding over the  meeting,  made it clear that any activities praising Pyongyang such as  those actions by a student group, Hanchongnyon [Korea Federation  of General Student Councils], in a recent rally in Kwangju,  would not be tolerated, the office said.    The government defined the recently formed Hanchongnyon as a  pro-Pyongyang organization and ordered a crackdown on it.    Prime Minister Yi and other participants reviewed in the  meeting recent development in the North Korean nuclear issue and  recent military movements in the Communist country, it said.    The participants also reviewed the government preparations,  including those by the military, for any possible mishaps, the  office said.    "The officials also agreed that maintaining national  consensus is most important in maintaining security here," it  said.    To enhance its capability for gathering information on North  Korea, the participants decided to keep open 24 hours a day  channels of dialogue with the United States and strengthen  cooperation with the U.S. forces here against any contingencies,  the office said.    Those who attended the meeting included both deputy prime  ministers, Yi Hong-ku for unification affairs and Chong Chae-sok  for economic affairs; Kim Tok, director of the Agency for  National Security Planning (NSP); Home Affairs Minister Choe  Hyong-u; Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui; Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae; Information Minister O In-whan; and Vice Foreign  Minister Pak Kon-u.    Meanwhile, many officials in the related government  ministries, including the Prime Minister's Office, the Foreign  Ministry and the National Unification Board, were on regular  duty Sunday and yesterday, the nation's Memorial Day.    Premier Yi inspected offices of major government ministries  and agencies Sunday to check their duty posture.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (4): The industry plays its Green card - The implications of aluminium beverage cans' success in the US On the face of it, you would not expect Mr Leslie Boyd to speak favourably about aluminium beverage cans. As a Scot who worked for British Steel Corporation before moving to Highveld Steel in South Africa some 25 years ago, he would seem an unlikely advocate of this particular form of packaging which has made a big dent in demand for steel, at least in one market sector. Yet he speaks enthusiastically about aluminium beverage cans 'taking over all over the world'. Steel cans can't compete, he suggests, because the aluminium variety lend themselves much more to recycling. Today, Mr Boyd is a director of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and chairman of its industrial group, which now has a vested interest in the development of aluminium beverage cans in that country. Highveld's Rheem division started up a new aluminium can plant last year, which exceeded rated capacity almost from day one, and is expected to make a big contribution to Highveld's earnings in 1994. Mr Boyd already is suggesting that Anglo's next big capital investment in South Africa might be a USDollars 1.5bn aluminium can sheet plant to provide raw material for can-making. Significantly, given his views on the subject, aluminium can recycling in South Africa, which started only nine months ago, has already reached 20 per cent - a level not yet reached in many more mature markets, and one that the rest of the global industry finds heartening. For, in the past 30 years, aluminium beverage cans have elbowed out the steel variety and taken virtually 100 per cent of the US canned beers and fizzy drinks market. The industry, dominated by a handful of large groups operating globally, is now taking lessons learned in the US to other markets the world over. In the US, some 95bn cans of beer or fizzy soft drinks are consumed every year - an aluminium can a day for every man, woman and child - and output outstrips even the production of nails and paper clips. Aluminium beverage can-makers exercise the same attention and precision as do makers of the metal for an aircraft wing, using the highest-powered computers to design containers that can withstand three times as much pressure as there is in in a car tyre and also support 250 lbs in weight. Careful design has enabled the industry to cut the amount of metal needed to produce aluminium cans. Today's can weighs about 0.48 of an ounce, down from about 0.66 of an ounce in the 1960s, yet producers expect to reduce that by another 20 per cent. The success of the aluminium beverage can has left the aluminium industry with a problem: about 10 per cent of global demand for its metal comes from one product in one country. So it is spending heavily to spread the 'gospel' of the aluminium beverage can around the world. To promote the use of aluminium beverage cans outside the US, the industry leans heavily in its 'green' credentials, claiming that aluminium cans may be recycled on a 'closed loop' system (from cans to scrap and back to cans again in only a few weeks). The relatively high value of aluminium - aluminium cans are worth six to 20 times more than any other used packaging material, and are the most valuable used package found in household waste - enables the industry to spread the word that can recycling gives collectors a decent income. Last year, for example, the US industry is estimated to have paid out about Dollars 900m for used cans, money that went back into local economies to benefit individuals, schools, churches'scout troops and other local organisations. However, this is not simply altruism on the industry's part - it needs this recycled metal, because it is cheap. As much as 95 per cent of the energy needed to produce new aluminium is saved by recycling old metal, because aluminium 'stores' energy. This is important, because the average smelter uses as much power as a town of 500,000 people to produce new aluminium. On top of that, there are capital savings because a re-melting plant costs only one-tenth as much as a smelter. Steel producers point out that the high cost of new aluminium means it only makes economic sense to use aluminium cans if more than 60 per cent of them are recycled. Not many markets achieve this level. The US recycling rate of about 66 per cent means that last year roughly 600,000 tonnes of aluminium, worth about Dollars 900m, escaped from the system, possibly to be thrown away. In the US, recycling of used beverage cans (known in the jargon as UBCs) is facilitated through more than 10,000 recycling centres. There is no shortage of recycling infrastructure in Europe either. British Alcan in 1991 opened a Pounds 28m remelt plant dedicated to UBCs at Warrington in the UK; and others are operated by Granges in Sweden, VAW in Germany, Elval in Greece, Alcan and Reynolds Metals in Italy, and Pechiney in France. Together they have an annual capacity of 120,000 tonnes, helping to turn old beverage cans into new ones. There are also many secondary smelters throughout Europe remelting UBCs into new ingots for other high-quality aluminium products. In Europe, several aluminium companies are financially backing an organisation which promotes aluminium can recycling, Acre (Aluminium Can Recycling Europe). Acre helped South Africa's equivalent organisation prepare the groundwork for that country's roaring start to aluminium can recycling. According to Acre, Europeans worked their way through 56,050 tonnes of aluminium beverage cans last year, up from 39,595 in 1992; and at least 29 per cent were recycled, up from 26 per cent. Mr Richard Holder, chairman of Reynolds Metals of the US, now one of the world's biggest aluminium can producers, says the industry can expect growth in the US to come by taking share from glass and plastic containers for products other than beverages. 'Outside the US there are wonderful opportunities,' he suggests. Reynolds built its first aluminium can plant with local partners in Brazil in 1988. It has been expanded three times, and a second plant is under construction. The Brazilian company is also constructing plants in Argentina and Chile. Mr Holder says: 'When we've finished we'll have the capacity to make 5bn cans a year - but that's only 5 to 6 per cent of the market. So if growth trends follow the US pattern, the market opportunities are obvious for many years.'</p>

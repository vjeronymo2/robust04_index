			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Number of references to MMC may drop Merging companies are to be allowed to offer a wider range of undertakings to the director-general of fair trading in an attempt to cut the number of mergers referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The proposal, outlined in the de-regulation bill yesterday, was one of the measures designed to cut out unnecessary overlap in the roles of the Office of Fair Trading and the MMC and to reduce the period of uncertainty for companies caught up in competition investigations. Instead of referring the merger to the MMC, ministers can now accept undertakings from merging companies to dispose of parts of their business. The bill would allow ministers to accept a wider range of undertakings, for example on regulating the prices of certain goods of the merged business. The government also proposes to allow companies to give undertakings as an alternative to a monopoly reference to the MMC. The OFT and other regulators are also to be allowed to accept undertakings or ask the MMC to investigate an anti-competitive act under the 1980 Competition Act without carrying out a formal preliminary inquiry. Lawyers said the measures should result in a change of culture at the OFT and lead it into a dialogue with companies. The bill also contains measures to reduce the burden on small businesses by cutting the range of restrictive trade agreements which have to be notified to the OFT. In a separate development yesterday the government announced that from February 9 it was to raise the assets threshold above which mergers qualify for review from Pounds 30m to Pounds 70m.</p>

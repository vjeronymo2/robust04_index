			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Cable &amp; Wireless seeks to grow with US alliances Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, is in talks with US telecoms companies about an alliance. Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, said a 'further interest in the United States' was essential to the group's strategy of standing apart from international alliances between large operators. C&amp;W's US negotiations are aimed at boosting its US subsidiary, CWI, which supplies long-distance services to small and medium-sized companies. CWI's turnover of Pounds 383m last year made it one of the larger 'second division' long-distance US carriers after AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint. Lord Young said the seven local Bell telecoms companies were particularly attractive to C&amp;W. They are seeking partners to break into the US long-distance market when regulations are changed to allow this. 'They are the sort of people who have direct access to companies,' he said, but did not rule out acquisitions of smaller operators. C&amp;W has links with Bell operators in its non-US businesses - notably with US West, the regional Bell operator covering 14 mid-western states, in One-2-One, a UK cellular mobile network. Speaking on the eve of C&amp;W's annual general meeting, Lord Young said the company's strategy remained 'totally viable' even if Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest concern, joins AT&amp;T's Worldsource venture which aims to supply one-stop services to multinationals. It emerged last week that Hongkong Telecom was in talks with AT&amp;T. Lord Young claimed that C&amp;W was in a 'totally different market' from the alliances formed in the past year by AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint with European operators including BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. He said C&amp;W's target was small and medium-sized trans-national companies. 'The other alliances are geared to only 1,000 multinationals worldwide, which we are not interested in,' he said. Lord Young confirmed C&amp;W was in talks about consortia to launch second operators to the national monopolies in the larger countries on mainland Europe.</p>

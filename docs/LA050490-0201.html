			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO RAPE ISN'T HATRED?;  </P> <P> LAW: TO EXCLUDE FROM PROSECUTION ACTS COMMITTED AGAINST WOMEN WOULD BE A  MOCKERY OF DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION.  </P> <P> Last December, a man walked into the engineering school at the University of  Montreal armed with a hunting rifle. He entered a classroom and divided the  students he found there into two groups: women and men. Shouting at the women,  "You're all a bunch of feminists," he picked them off as if they were ducks in  a shooting gallery. By the time he had finished his deadly stalk, he had killed  14 women and injured many others. A note found in his pocket after he had  killed himself declared that women had ruined his life.  </P> <P> The man in Montreal killed these women because he hated them -- not as  individual persons, but as women. The law in this country would not, however,  consider these murders crimes of hate.  </P> <P> We have come to use the term hate crime to refer to a crime committed not out  of animosity toward the victim as an individual, but out of hostility to the  group to which the victim belongs. The attack in Howard Beach, in which one  black man was killed and two were beaten by white assailants, is one of the  most notorious examples in recent years.  </P> <P> Some states have enacted laws specifically directed at hate crimes. California,  for example, requires the collection and analysis of statistics on hate crimes.  Other states either elevate a crime such as second-degree assault to  first-degree assault where the assault was motivated by the victim's membership  in a particular group or establish a separate crime such as "ethnic  intimidation."  </P> <P> Recently enacted legislation directs the federal government to gather  statistics on such crimes.  </P> <P> None of these laws include gender as one of the motivating characteristics that  can turn an ordinary crime into a crime of hate. The new federal law, for  example, considers hate crimes to be those impelled by the victim's race,  ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Other, similar laws recognize as  crimes of hate only those motivated by the victim's race, color, creed,  religion or national origin.  </P> <P> Thus, if a woman is beaten, raped or killed because she is a woman, this is not  considered a crime of hate.  </P> <P> "Race, color, religion, sex and national origin" has become a kind of refrain  in our laws against discrimination. These characteristics invariably appear  together as the forbidden criteria for the allocation (or withdrawal) of  benefits such as education, employment and housing. One must, therefore, do a  double-take when reading a discrimination statute that does not include gender  as one of the forbidden bases for conduct.  </P> <P> The reason for this exclusion cannot be that there is no problem. The special  risk faced by women in this country because they are women cannot be denied. We  have learned to order our lives according to this special danger, so much so  that when we refuse thus to arrange our lives, we are held equally as  accountable as our aggressor for any injury that results.  </P> <P> Nor can the reason for failing to recognize some acts against women as hate  crimes be that it is impossible to differentiate between those crimes and  "ordinary crimes." We do not worry about this evidentiary snag in declaring  that crimes motivated by the victim's race, creed or national origin are hate  crimes. Indeed, one of the purposes of the new federal statute is to establish  a method for identifying crimes of hate.  </P> <P> We are not, it is true, accustomed to thinking of crimes against women in the  same way that we think of racial or ethnic violence. We tend, instead, to treat  brutalizing acts against women either as isolated cases -- that is, as events  brought about by some specific characteristic or conduct of the victim -- or,  in rare cases, as manifestations of racial or ethnic hatred.  </P> <P> Thus, in searching for the reason why a group of boys brutalized a jogger in  Central Park last spring, virtually everyone turned to race; the boys were  black, the woman was white. But another white jogger in the park that night --  a man -- was also beaten, was not raped, was not, in short, treated as if he  were less than human. It is at least curious, therefore, that people did not  seize upon the one feature distinguishing the two runners -- gender -- and  declare that a catalyst for the boys' most savage crime.  </P> <P> This hesitation in pronouncing an act victimizing a woman a crime of hate is no  reason not to pronounce it so. Indeed, this hesitation may be a symptom of the  very pathology that produces such a crime. To deny that the outrages committed  in Montreal are crimes of hate is to defy the facts, and to deny such acts our  censure is to signal that crimes committed against women because they are women  do not trouble us very much. That is a message welcome to no one but the  misogynist.  </P></p>

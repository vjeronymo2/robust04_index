			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Rio Algom falls by two thirds RIO ALGOM, Canadian subsidiary of the UK mining group RTZ, suffered a two-thirds drop in first-quarter earnings on lower mineral prices and stiff competition in the metals distribution business, writes Bernard Simon. But Mr Colin Macaulay, chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting that the company was continuing to seek sizeable base-metal acquisitions, mainly in North America. Rio Algom has earmarked a large chunk of its cash reserves, which totalled CDollars 180m (USDollars 151m) on December 31, for takeovers. Net earnings skidded to CDollars 4.9m from CDollars 14m a year earlier. Mr Macaulay said 1992 earnings would be similar to the 51 cents a share earned in 1991.</p>

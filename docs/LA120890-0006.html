			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> CITY WILL TEST NEW WARNING SIREN  </P> <P> Residents near the Ventura Harbor, the Ventura Keys and Pierpont Bay will hear  the blare of a siren next week as the city of Ventura tests the latest addition  to its emergency warning system. The siren, installed last month on Harbor  Boulevard, is one of 10 that the city uses to notify residents of an emergency.  </P> <P> The city has relied on sirens for several decades, using earlier versions  during World War II, said Barry Simmons, information officer for the city's  Fire Department.  </P> <P> If the sirens go off during an actual disaster, residents should tune their  radios to emergency broadcasting stations for information, Simmons said.  </P> <P> Simmons said the area is in particular need of a warning system because of its  location. An earthquake along an ocean fault line could produce a wave powerful  enough to travel a mile inland, he said.  </P> <P> Attached to poles 20 to 30 feet off the ground, the sirens are powered by  electrical motors and operated by radio control. They are regularly tested the  first Friday of each month at 10 a.m. But this month's testing of the Harbor  Boulevard siren will be between 1 and 4 p.m. Monday. VIVIAN LOUIE  </P></p>

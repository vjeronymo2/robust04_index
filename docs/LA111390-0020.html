			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WARNER CENTER COPES WITH A HIGH VACANCY RATE;  </P> <P> OFFICES: THE LARGE SUPPLY OF EMPTY SPACE IS DUE PARTLY TO A PUSH BY DEVELOPERS  TO GET THEIR PROJECTS ON BOARD BEFORE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS MAKE FUTURE PROJECTS  MORE DIFFICULT.  </P> <P> Marvin Gayle was a die-hard Westside veteran, having kept offices for more than  20 years in Century City and in Beverly Hills for a decade before that. So when  the business litigation and personal injury attorney was asked by his young  partner and secretary to consider moving to the Warner Center in Woodland Hills  to be closer to where they all live, he flatly refused.  </P> <P> "I just wasn't interested," Gayle said. But not wanting to appear inflexible,  he agreed to look at a new building owned by the Voit Cos. "I came out here,  looked at it," Gayle said, "and told them we were moving."  </P> <P> That was in September and now, Gayle said, he commutes from his Encino  residence in less than 15 minutes. He has a view of the Santa Susana Mountains.  His Valley-based clients like his new location and his Westside clients haven't  shunned him. "Once they get here, they're impressed," he said.  </P> <P> About two decades after the Warner Center's first building rose out of corn  fields, the 1,100-acre master-planned development -- built on the former ranch  of late Warner Bros. President Harry Warner -- is the Valley's answer to  Century City and is home to about 14 million square feet of commercial space.  </P> <P> But like much of the office market in Southern California, Warner Center has  felt the impact of the nationwide commercial real estate slump and is saddled  with a large supply of empty space. Gayle doesn't have many neighbors in the  so-called Warner Center VI, the 20-story office tower that opened in January at  a construction cost of about $100 million. The building is only about 35%  leased.  </P> <P> Indeed, the average vacancy rate for all of Warner Center is about 20%, which  is much higher than the 14% overall vacancy rate for the Valley in the third  quarter, according to a Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services  study. And while some local office markets, such as Westwood, had vacancy rates  above 20%, the rate in downtown Los Angeles actually fell during the quarter to  13% -- a 17-month low.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Warner Center has become a prestigious business address within the  Valley, and it has some hidden strengths for the future. The high vacancy rate  in Warner Center is partly due to the push by developers to get their projects  on board before local growth restrictions make future projects more difficult.  </P> <P> Many developers, including big national companies such as JMB Realty, Trizec  Properties and LaSalle Partners, have plans to build large projects in Warner  Center. JMB, for instance, plans to develop 22 acres surrounding the Blue Cross  of California headquarters on Oxnard Street, which it purchased two years ago.  </P> <P> But after Warner Center III, a 26-story office tower developed by Voit, is  finished early next year, there will probably be a few years in which no  construction takes place in Warner Center.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, developers in Warner Center with buildings to fill concede that  they must take a long-term view of profits, and that means offering prospective  tenants costly concessions such as several months free rent and free parking to  entice them to move in.  </P> <P> "It takes you a little longer to make a decent return on investment in today's  marketplace," said Richard B. Shapiro, vice president of Elins Development,  which recently opened a 60,000-square-foot office building in Warner Center. It  could take three years after construction starts for a developer to reach an  operating profit, Shapiro said.  </P> <P> A few new buildings account for nearly all the vacant space in Warner Center,  including the Warner Center VI project, which Voit -- Warner Center's biggest  landlord with about 3 million square feet of office space -- opened with  partner Copley Real Estate Advisors of Boston. Other buildings nearby that  opened recently include a two-building office complex by Trammell Crow, and the  Elins building.  </P> <P> Warner Center is bounded by Vanowen Street on the north, Topanga Canyon  Boulevard on the west, De Soto Avenue on the east and the Ventura Freeway on  the south.  </P> <P> Derek Graham, an office-leasing specialist at Coldwell Banker Real Estate  Services, said tenants continue to be attracted by Warner Center's rental  rates, which at $1.80 to $2.50 a square foot are lower than downtown Los  Angeles and Westside rates. Warner Center rents are slightly higher than rents  on Ventura Boulevard in Encino and Sherman Oaks -- the Valley's other major  business area -- but local growth limits have also created a shortage of space  along the Ventura corridor, which has helped funnel tenants west to Warner  Center.  </P> <P> Shapiro of Elins Development said business people are also increasingly viewing  Warner Center as "a viable place" to locate because buildings are newer and  have more amenities than in other areas of Los Angeles, and a diversified labor  pool lives nearby.  </P> <P> Also, with little additional office space likely to be added to Warner Center  for at least a few years after Voit's Warner Center III is opened next year, "I  think we're slowly creeping into a landlord's market," said Sheryl L. Mazirow,  a senior marketing consultant at Grubb &amp; Ellis in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> It could stay a landlord's market if Warner Center developers keep facing more  bureaucratic snags before projects can be approved. The Warner Center Specific  Plan, the master plan for the area, is now being updated and many developers  have put projects on hold until the new plan is adopted by the Los Angeles  Planning Department, which isn't expected until late next year. Development in  Warner Center and elsewhere has also been slowed because of the savings and  loan crisis, which has made it harder to obtain financing for real estate  projects.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Warner Center has begun attracting a broader range of tenants,  said William Lassetter, marketing director for Voit's Warner Center properties.  Until recently, Warner Center offices were occupied almost exclusively by  insurance and health-care companies, such as Transamerica Insurance, Cigna  Health Plans and Chubb Group. Within the past year or so, however, other types  of businesses have started to move in, including law firms, software companies  and more offbeat businesses such as Malibu Grand Prix, an operator of amusement  parks that feature amateur auto racing.  </P> <P> Warner Center also recently landed its first entertainment company tenant,  movie theater and cable TV operator United Artists Communications, which last  month signed a lease for 14,000 square feet in Voit's Warner Plaza VI.  </P> <P> But while new tenants are moving in, there's also the possibility that as space  grows tighter, old tenants will move out. Just last week, Health Net, a health  maintenance organization that has been in Warner Center since 1984, announced  plans to move to Thousand Oaks by 1994. The company, which leases more than  100,000 square feet from Voit, said the decision was motivated by its desire to  own its own building to accommodate its rapidly expanding work force.  </P></p>

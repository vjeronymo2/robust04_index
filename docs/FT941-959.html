			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Gaviria to head the OAS The Organisation of American States yesterday elected Mr Cesar Gaviria, the president of Colombia, to be its new secretary-general, George Graham reports from Washington. Mr Gaviria's election, by 20 votes to 14, capped a sometimes hostile campaign in which smaller OAS members, in the Caribbean and Central America, complained that their interests were being trampled by the heavyweight countries of South America, as well as by the US. The smaller states had backed Mr Bernd Niehaus, foreign minister of Costa Rica, to succeed Mr Joao Baena Soares of Brazil, the outgoing secretary-general. Each country has one vote but the alliance of the small appears to have broken up in the face of Mr Gaviria's candidacy. Mr Gaviria is due to step down as president of Colombia in August.</p>

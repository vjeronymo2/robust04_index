			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Teltschik appointed to head BMW division BMW, the German luxury car company, has appointed Mr Horst Teltschik, the former foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to its management board to head a new department handling environmental, transport, and trade issues. Mr Teltschik, 52, played an important role in helping to shape policy ahead of German reunification in October, 1990, before leaving to become head of the foundation which controls Bertelsmann, the big publishing, music, and electronic media concern. The foundation concentrates on cultural and political research programmes. He will leave the foundation to join BMW in January. His appointment reflects a growing awareness among German car companies of the need to develop a more comprehensive, co-ordinated, and far-sighted policy on international issues which affect their business, but are not directly connected with manufacturing.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ekofisk safety plan 'inadequate' THE NORWEGIAN Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, has expressed concern over 'inadequacy' of proposals submitted by Phillips Petroleum Norway to improve the safety and operational reliability of the main processing and transportation facilities of the North Sea Ekofisk field centre tank, the hub of the world's largest oil transportation system. Last October, the NPD warned Phillips that it was considering an order to close the tank by the winter of 1995-96 for safety reasons. The directorate is deeply concerned for the safety of personnel at the tank, its operational reliability and relentless subsidence of the field, which poses hazards to the facility. It said it would study Phillips' proposals for interim risk-reducing measures until mid-February before making a final ruling. But it was not satisfied with the premise on which technical evaluations for the proposed measures were based. The NPD ordered Phillips, operator of Ekofisk with a 37 per cent stake in the field, to submit interim measures - which the directorate would have to approve - for continued operation of the facility until a long-term plan could be presented in July. In response, Phillips said it was quite possible to achieve safe operations by applying modern safety and maintenance management principles but that it would enhance fire protection and provide an additional escape route at the tank. To deal with field subsidence, Phillips is expanding water injection capacity through the use of a temporary facility from July 1993 while studies for permanent expansion are completed. 'We believe our proposals will enable the tank to meet necessary safety criteria for personnel and equipment. Our plans are to continue working with our co-venturers and government officials to ensure that Ekofisk will remain open, safe and economically sound for all parties involved,' Mr Sander Bull-Gjertsen, a Phillips executive said yesterday. About 18bn cubic metres of gas is transported annually through the Ekofisk system to a consortium of European buyers and about 40 per cent of Norway's petroleum production is processed there.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Bundesbank says EC powers need reform THE European Community should revamp its decision-making processes if it is to assume its proper role in world affairs, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank. It must also make corrections to the Maastricht formula to ensure that political union advances in step with moves towards economic and monetary union, he told a meeting in Berlin yesterday. Without changes in decision-making, including the clarification and implementation of subsidiarity, 'political, economic and monetary union could prove unacceptable to the people of the community', Mr Tietmeyer claimed. The principle of subsidiarity should be established and implemented according to the German definition: 'Give power to the upper political level only when the tasks in question cannot be achieved at the lower level of authority.' 'It is time subsidiarity was taken seriously and preparations made to put it into effect,' he added. Without it, political, economic and monetary union could prove unworkable, as had been demonstrated in other unions based on an undue concentration of power. Calling for 'new and more appropriate' decision-making structures, Mr Tietmeyer said there should be no 'super-bureaucracy, but an organisation with clearly-defined competences and decision-making powers'. He repeated a Bundesbank statement made two years ago which insisted that if monetary union were to prove durable, it needed to be underpinned by a more far-reaching association in the form of full political union. 'Here, as the debate has shown, seems to lie a main deficiency of the Maastricht concept that needs to be corrected in 1996, when the section on political union will in any case be reviewed,' he said. Mr Martin Bangemann, the vice-president of the European Commission, denied yesterday that he was referring to Denmark when he called recently for member states which refuse further integration to consider whether they ought to leave the Community, Reuter reports from Helsinki. Mr Bangemann made his statement last Saturday at a congress of Germany's Free Democratic party. Danish politicians have reacted angrily to Mr Bangemann's statement, with the prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, advising the commissioner to do his job and leave decision-making to EC governments. Mr Bangemann, on a visit to Finland, told a news conference in Helsinki: 'I do want Denmark to be a member of the Community.' Bundesbank policy, see Capital Markets Page</p>

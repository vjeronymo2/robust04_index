			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / The softly-softly approach to closing down the pits: Michael Smith looks at the lessons in subtlety the government has learnt in its handling of the mining industry THE TACTICS are as subtle now as they were previously clumsy. The government's move to close three pits it reprieved in March demonstrates that it has learnt from the public relations disaster of nine months ago, when it attempted to shut three fifths of Britain's mining industry. Last October the government was forced to withdraw hastily its plans to close 31 pits. It had tried to achieve too much at once and, some corporation executives feel, drawn needless public and parliamentary attention. This time, through its agent British Coal, the government has adopted a softly-softly approach. Twelve pits reprieved in March as a result of the public furore that followed October's announcement are, it seems, to be closed in stages and, the government hopes, without fuss. The first three - Rufford in Nottinghamshire, Markham in Derbyshire and an unnamed third - have already been earmarked for closure and the chances are most of the rest will follow in the next year. In marked contrast to October's approach British Coal will not publicise its plans. Closure proposals will be put to the workforce for approval, instead of being presented as a fait accompli. British Coal headquarters will not make public announcements before any workforce decisions. The speed with which the government has moved to close mines it reprieved less than three months ago may surprise the public, but few in the industry have been taken aback. Although the March white paper gave a stay of execution for the 12 pits - and for a further six that are being mothballed  -the government did little to make room in the market for their output. In the 10 weeks since then, market conditions have deteriorated significantly. The improved efficiency of nuclear power plants and a move by the Pollution Inspectorate to enforce tighter controls on coal-fired power stations have reinforced the elec-tricity generators' lack of enthusiasm for buying coal. If the dozen reprieved pits are to be kept alive British Coal needs to sell at least an extra 12m tonnes of coal this year and more still in 1994-5, when the tonnages required under existing contracts fall. Developments of the past few months make that an impossible task. British Coal will be lucky to secure 8m tonnes more in each year. In asking the workforces at Rufford and Markham to approve closure British Coal is stressing the role of unfavourable geological factors which, it says, will limit the pits' lives. But local officials are also emphasising the marketing conditions. More influential on the mineworkers' thinking is the government's notice that it intends to end in December a scheme that allows miners at redundant pits to transfer to other mines and gives them enhanced severance terms if they decide to leave the industry altogether. That will encourage the miners to consider leaving. Meanwhile, those who want to stay on will probably not be able to depend on Conservative politicians coming to their rescue as they did in October. Conservative MPs will be given a chance to vote against the government only if Labour uses one of its supply days to force a debate. The government, buoyed by its more pragmatic, gradualist strategy, believes that it would still win the day.</p>

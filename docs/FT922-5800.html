			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: CIBC sets aside CDollars 1bn to cover losses on O&amp;Y CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, the biggest lender to Olympia and York, has set aside a special provision of CDollars 1bn to cover possible losses from the debt-burdened property developer. As a result of this provision, the bank suffered a second-quarter loss of CDollars 440m (USDollars 370m) or CDollars 2.55 a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 186m or 90 cents in the three months to April 30 1991. CIBC said that despite the big second-quarter loss, it was confident of a profit for fiscal 1992 as a whole, and that it had no plans to cut its dividend. The report by CIBC, Canada's second biggest financial institution, is the first time the bank has discussed its exposure to O&amp;Y. It said that its total exposure to O&amp;Y is CDollars 860m, somewhat lower than analysts had estimated. About half of the loans apply to the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands, with the rest split between properties in the US and Canada. The CDollars 1bn provision covers not only the O&amp;Y exposure, but also an unidentified troubled account in Australia, and possible further losses due to the poor business conditions in Canada. Mr Donald Fullerton, who retires as chairman next week, said the bank considers the provision to be sufficient to 'cover a wide range of developments' and 'to put the O&amp;Y problem behind us'.</p>

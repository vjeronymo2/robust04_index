			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia aims to be the region's leading supporter  of women's development programmes in anticipation of the UN  Conference on Women in Beijing this September and the World  Summit for Social Development in March 1995, an Australian  official told THE NATION.    Priorities for this year's overseas assistance are boosting  cooperation with non-governmental organization (NGOs) and  enhancing small programmes that are of mutual benefit to  countries involved, said Ellen Shipley, a counsellor in the  Technical and Economic Cooperation Section of the Australian  Embassy in Bangkok.    Australia's overseas aid programme has come under attack  from  its own NGOs for being too aligned with Australia's commercial  interests at the expense of helping the poor abroad.    According to an embassy press statement, half of the A$  [Australian dollars] 1.4 billion in overseas aid earmarked in  the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau  (AIDAB) 1994- 1995 budget will go to 13 countries in Southeast  Asia and the Indian subcontinent.    Shipley said Australia wants to cooperate better in this  area  because "we're located in this region -- we want to be a  complete partner in this region."    She was attending a workshop here along with 30 development  project officers from Australian embassies in 13 countries, from  Vietnam to Pakistan. The training session was the second held  in the past 18 months, giving participants -- a number of them  locally hired -- a chance to exchange views and learn about  policy development.    Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating recently pledged  A$350  million over the next four years to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.    Hieng Sokchea, Senior Administrative Clerk in the  Development  Cooperation Unit of Australia's Phnom Penh Embassy, said the  four sectors he's pinpointed were education, agriculture, health  and infrastructure. Australian aid to Cambodia doubled to A$92  million in the 1994-95 fiscal budget.    Sokchea said more than 15 bridges, costing an estimated A$10  million, will be built along Road 5 from Phnom Penh to  Battambang.    For Laos, A$48 million was promised over the next four  years.  One-third will go to training and human development programmes,  while one-fifth is for infrastructure projects.    Vietnam's aid was doubled to A$140 million, making it the  third top overseas recipient after Papua New Guinea and  Indonesia.    For Thailand, Shipley said one third of the Bt [baht] 500  million assistance pledged is geared toward educational  programmes and, although there is a focus on rural programmes,  Canberra is "looking at bigger infrastructure programmes".    Shipley pointed out that one of Thailand's most crucial  problems is income disparity, so her country is supporting a new  programme on small local NGOs that will have an impact on income  generation.</p>

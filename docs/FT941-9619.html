			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Arts: Chamber-sized Turandot in Cardiff - Opera A 'coming-of-age fable'? This is not the answer many opera-lovers would give if faced with the riddle of categorising Turandot. Puccini's final opera, conventionally treated as fantastic fairy-tale spectacle, has frequently been agonised over by tender-hearted liberals on account of the monstrously violent view of male-female relationships expounded at its core. Given the character of Liu's death and Turandot's eventual submission, the idea that the piece could ever be staged to embody positive, even PC values - to represent a 'developing personality moving toward fruition' - seems improbable. The above quotations are extracted from a Welsh National Opera programme-book interview with Christopher Alden, producer of the company's new Turandot. Fortunately, his show proves itself a much sharper, snappier framing of the argument than in advance I could have believed possible: not completely successful, in truth, but replete with a decisive, individual brand of theatricality that adds new zest to one's experience of the whole work. Alden - twin-brother of David, whose ENO Mazeppa, Masked Ball and Ariodante have provided London opera-goers with some of their most celebrated deconstructionist splendours (or, according to taste, miseries) of the last decade - uses the limitations of the Cardiff New Theatre stage-space and the in-built restrictions of WNO production scale to make this a chamber-sized Turandot, in which startlingly beautiful stage feats are accomplished with streamlined simplicity. Brilliantly designed by Paul Steinberg, the set is an enclosing curve of purple corrugated iron, marbled in patterning, and capable of reflecting and enriching the bold variations of storybook costume-colour and lighting in which each narrative shift is signalled. The China thus summoned up is a curious dream-world blend of antique ritual and rigid Maoist regimentation (the three masks seated at bright red desks and typewriters, the tiered chorus in white school-shirts and black ties). At its best this novel evocation of Gozzi-via-Puccini is full of clean-cut, witty imagery; at other times it is too obviously reliant on the slow-motion parading and floor-level trailing of identikit-surrealist modern opera production. The concern to humanise both main characters and to treat Liu and Timur as Jungian 'guiding shades' is not comprehensively carried through - how could it be, since it is not what Puccini intended? And withal, the freshness of the approach and the wholehearted commitment of all its executants certainly plead tolerance of the attempt. Saturday was one of the WNO Chorus's best evenings in years. It was also a good outing for the company's casting department: worthwhile newcomers (such as Anthony Stuart Lloyd, the soft-grained young Timur) and company regulars (David Barrell, the drily skilful Ping) in smaller parts, an interesting choice of principals. Mary Jane Johnson's singing of Turandot may be an acquired taste - notes simultaneously hard and curdled mingle with powerful, radiant ones - but her presence is exactly judged; Edmund Barham's first Calaf, very well studied, lacked his usual forceful projection (an unannounced cold?); in her British debut the American Patricia Racette, a soprano at once vibrantly emotional and subtly reticent, gave Liu's music more definition than anyone else on stage. The disappointment was the conducting of Carlo Rizzi, who unfolded some parts of the score with sparkling precision, rushed, flubbed and fumbled others, breathed too little air into the panoply of exquisitely finished nocturnal sonorities, and generally gave the impression of not having focused an 'all-through' interpretation of the opera. When he has, this will be a Turandot of unusual distinction. Welsh National Opera: in repertory in Cardiff, Birmingham, Southampton and Bristol until April 22</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / FDA acts on aids to quit smoking THE US Food and Drug Administration has ruled there is no evidence that non-prescription products to help smokers quit actually work, and they are to be withdrawn from December. 'These products are safe enough,' said Mr Mike Shaffer, a public affairs officer at the FDA. 'But there is no evidence that they work. We're not saying they don't work, just that we don't know if they do.' The products, supported by millions of dollars of advertising, include Cigarrest, Bantron, Tabmint and Nikoban. Tabmint, a chewing gum containing silver acetate and which is supposed to make smoke taste unpleasant, is available in Britain. The withdrawn products do not include Nicorette gum and nicotine patches which, although available without a prescription in the UK, are not available over the counter (OTC) in the US. The US move led to calls yesterday in the UK for all OTC smoking cessation products to be withdrawn, including patches and nicotine gums. Ms Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, a charity dedicated to helping smokers give up, said there was no evidence any products worked when bought at a chemist without a prescription.</p>

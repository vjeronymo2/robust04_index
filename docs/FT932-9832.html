			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / People: Benson picks up Costain Costain, the UK construction group, yesterday moved to strengthen its board further with the appointment of Sir Christopher Benson as chairman. Sir Christopher, 59, is chairman of Boots the retailer and chairman until July of MEPC property group. He is also chairman designate of Sun Alliance. He takes over in June as chairman of Costain succeeding Peter Sawdy, 61, who has been chairman for two and a half years during one of the most difficult periods the group has faced. The company last year made a Pounds 148.6m pre-tax loss after making further substantial provisions against its housing and commercial property operations. In a bid to reduce its large debts, Costain recently sold its Australian mining operations to Peabody Resources, part of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, in a deal worth Pounds 198m. Costain has also received several approaches from potential purchasers for its loss-making UK housebuilding operations. It is thought to have wanted to appoint a high profile chairman to help chief executive Peter Costain and a new management team reduce the company's debt further and restore its fortunes. The appointment follows the replacement of a number of senior executives including Tom Slee, the former finance director, and Gordon Haworth, main board director responsible for American operations. Keith Egerton, director responsible for commercial property operations, also left the group following Costain's decision to retreat from that sector.</p>

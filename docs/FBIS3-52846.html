			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel will not withdraw from Gaza and Jericho on  14 April, the date set in the Declaration of Principles [DOP]  with the PLO. This may be inferred from the remarks of Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, who said today that there is no target  date for the withdrawal. Rather, he said, there is an  understanding that the implementation of the DOP will last four  months after the agreement has been signed. Peres was asked  whether that meant that the withdrawal would start toward the  beginning of summer, and he replied: We will try to do it  earlier.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 10 January  quotes Peres as "voicing his confidence that progress will be  made in the Taba talks and noting that the DOP cannot be  implemented in one go."]</p>

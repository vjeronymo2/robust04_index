			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry  Legal Department today told CTK that a visit of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic cannot legally be prevented  beforehand.    The statement says that Zhirinovskiy is the legally elected  deputy to the Russian State Duma and is thus entitled to have a  diplomatic passport of the Russian Federation. A new agreement  on visa-free relations between the Czech Republic and the  Russian Federation will change nothing in the position of  holders of diplomatic passports. It points out, however, that  holders of diplomatic passports just like all other foreign  visitors should abide by Czech law.    Zhirinovskiy, Russian ultra-nationalist and chairman of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which gained a victory at the  Russian parliamentary elections in December, is currently  travelling Europe. In an interview with REUTER he said that "the  Czech Republic will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few  breweries in which the beer will turn bitter will be left of the  Czech Republic."    Tomas Hoffmann, a Prague solicitor, said today that  Zhirinovskiy could come to the Czech Republic without any  invitation. However if he were to violate the law he could be  prosecuted in any way as any other citizen who violates the  legally protected interests of the Czech Republic. According to  experts, the State Attorney's Office should deal with  Zhirinovskiy's statements and should consider whether or not  Czech laws were violated by these statements.    Given the fact that Zhirinovskiy is a member of the  parliament of a foreign state, who although he is travelling  privately, uses diplomatic protection, the matter appears to be  very delicate. If the State Attorney's Office were to take a  preventative stand on Zhirinovskiy's remarks now, it would mean  preparing for a visit and possible statements aimed against the  Czech Republic and its interests.</p>

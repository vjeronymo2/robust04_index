			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Borthwicks' flavours decision justified MR JOHN Thomson, chairman of Borthwicks, said the improved results for the year to March 28 justified the decision to dispose of the meat business and concentrate on natural flavours and food products. Pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 1.29m, helped by exceptional profits of Pounds 226,000 relating to profits on the sale of a trademark less reorganisation costs. Last time there were exceptional charges of Pounds 633,000. At the operating level profits were Pounds 1.76m, compared with Pounds 1.16m which included losses of Pounds 543,000 on discontinued businesses. Turnover fell from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 44.4m but stripping out the Pounds 13.9m from discontinued businesses there was a 19 per cent rise. Mr Thomson said that 'operating margins had widened, from 2.25 per cent to 3.98 per cent, reflecting a striking improvement in the underlying quality of the ongoing businesses'. Especially pleasing had been progress at Globe Extracts in the US where although profits were similar there had been a move to higher quality. He added that the group was increasing its emphasis on the natural flavours business as shown by the acquisition of Cooke Tweedale &amp; Lindsay. In giving greater importance to the final dividend the proposed distribution is raised to 0.6p (0.5p) for a total of 1.1p (1p). Earnings per share came out at 1.8p (0.1p).</p>

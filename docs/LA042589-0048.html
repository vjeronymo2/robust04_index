			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS BUYS EQUIPMENT TESTING FIRM  </P> <P> Cambrian Systems in Westlake Village acquired the assets of JCS Technology in  Los Gatos for an undisclosed price. Both companies make equipment to test disk  drives, the devices that store and retrieve data in computers.  </P> <P> Cambrian sought the acquisition because it wants to be "a broad-line supplier"  of various disk-drive testing products, said Bert Munnikhuis, Cambrian's vice  president of marketing and sales. "They were a perfect match," he said.  </P> <P> The acquisition will add about 10 people to Cambrian's work force of 120  employees, he added.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Opinion Poll Shows 60 Percent of </F> Italians Are Undecided"]    [Text] Turin -- Who will win the elections? It is  impossible to say at present, given the very high proportion of  those who are undecided, with confusion reigning supreme. This  is the conclusion reached by the ITER social research center,  which conducted a survey on the attitudes of Italians just over  a month from the election date. No winners or losers emerge  from the investigation. "We were not aiming to carry out an  electoral survey," explained ITER Director Bruno Babando, "in  the first place because we believe such surveys are unreliable.  We preferred to analyze the issues and problems --as perceived  by Italians -- which will have to be addressed by our new  representatives."    It is apparent from the survey -- conducted on a  representative sample of Italy's population (1,426 interviews)  -- that confusion and uncertainty still prevail among the  voters. In fact, over 79 percent say they find the present  political situation confusing, and no less than 58 percent say  they have not yet decided whom to vote for. Furthermore, 56  percent state that in the upcoming elections the candidates'  personality will be more important than their party allegiance.  In this respect, electors showed that they had fully understood  and correctly assessed the changes introduced through the new  uninominal system.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> EVALUATING GTE MINORITY CONTRACTOR MENTORSHIPS;  </P> <P> PROPONENTS SAY THEY HELP EVERYONE; CRITICS HAVE DOUBTS.  </P> <P> It was the summer of 1987, and the executives of Butler Service Group, one of  the country's biggest suppliers of temporary technical help, faced a dilemma.  </P> <P> A big customer, GTE California, announced that it would shift a substantial  share of its business to firms run by minorities as a result of pressure from  the California Legislature.  </P> <P> Butler, operated by white men and owned by a company traded in the  over-the-counter stock market, had a choice.  </P> <P> It could forfeit what had been a $12-million-a-year relationship with GTE. Or,  somehow, Butler could forge an alliance that would let it hang onto as much of  the business as possible within the constraints of GTE's affirmative action  dictates.  </P> <P> Butler took the latter course.  </P> <P> It handed over to an employee its Southern California operations, including an  office in San Dimas and a work force of dozens of engineers. It stocked the  board of directors of the new firm, Telco Services Inc., with Butler executives  and signed a contract to handle most of the administration and management of  the company for a fee. In exchange, Butler kept 49% of Telco's stock, leaving  Telco's Latino chief executive with just enough of a stake to satisfy the  California Public Utilities Commission's criterion for minority ownership.  </P> <P> In Butler's strategy, along with the similar paths charted by other GTE labor  contractors, lies a parable about the limits on government's ability to alter,  by fiat, the habits and ties that for decades have blocked minorities' access  to the billions spent by California's biggest utilities.  </P> <P> Rather than create opportunities for existing minority firms or for new  companies independent of what civil rights groups decry as an "old boy" network  of contractors, GTE has given more than $9 million yearly in contract labor  work to three firms partly owned by and closely tied to longtime, non-minority,  GTE contractors -- a fact the vendors and GTE acknowledge.  </P> <P> An additional $3 million has gone to a Los Angeles firm -- run by a white male  employed for years by one of the non-minority contractors -- whose minority  status has been called into doubt. GTE auditors contend that the white male,  rather than the Native Americans who own two-thirds of Main Communications,  actually runs the company.  </P> <P> In the process, minority business people have, indeed, gotten a toehold in a  segment of the telecommunications business that previously was closed to them.  One minority firm late last month bought back the 49% of its stock held by its  non-minority "mentor," securing its independence just short of two years after  its founding.  </P> <P> But the entree has been costly. Those firms with ties to a non-minority company  have paid out half their profits -- and sometimes a significant portion of  their revenues, as well -- to white-owned companies that had been doing  business with GTE all along.  </P> <P> GTE insists that its reliance on minority firms with ties to familiar,  reliable, white-owned vendors has aided the phone company and minorities alike.  </P> <P> "Part of the thinking for having mentorships is to get minority companies up  and running so they get some . . . work, they develop a capital base and they  learn the business, bearing in mind it's to their advantage to become  independent, because they don't have to split the money for certain contracts,"  said Larry Cox, a spokesman for Thousand Oaks-based GTE California.  </P> <P> "I think it's really unfair," he said, "for anyone to expect minority  companies, brand new to the industry, to be able to go in and compete at the  same level as a company that's been there 10 or 15 years with millions of  dollars."  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), author of the legislation that  persuaded California's biggest utilities to promise 20% of their business to  women and minorities by 1993, disagrees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 65% Are 'Fronts'  </P> <P> "What you're describing," Moore said, "are people who refuse to change and  refuse to do business in the manner we proposed."  </P> <P> The difficulties faced by the state's utilities in finding capable minority  companies -- and, perhaps, the utilities' hesitancy to do business with them --  are reflected in experts' estimates that as many as 65% of the contractors  counted by the utilities as minority- or woman-owned in fact are "fronts"  controlled by white males.  </P> <P> Of California's seven largest utilities, GTE has claimed the biggest progress  in meeting the 20% minority contracting goal. But civil rights groups have  informed the PUC that they are dubious about the $83.2 million in minority  contracts that the company claimed for 1988, and GTE has agreed to a complete,  independent audit of its minority procurement program.  </P> <P> For years, GTE contracted with an established group of national companies to  supply the technical personnel -- engineers, cable splicers, linemen and others  -- needed to extend telephone service to growing communities. Butler, Burnup  &amp; Sims, Volt Information Sciences and a few others acted as temporary  services, recruiting the workers, serving as their employer and sending them  where they were needed by GTE. Only one of the vendors, Carrier Communications,  had non-traditional ownership; the Nevada firm is headed by a white woman.  </P> <P> When the Legislature in 1986 ordered public utilities to create or expand  minority procurement programs, GTE quickly recognized contract labor as a  service that could fairly readily be obtained from minority vendors. "Job  shops," as the temp services are called, require little more than an office and  a telephone to start. And GTE was willing to give the new companies time to get  established before insisting that they, like their non-minority predecessors,  assume the riskier task of bidding on the construction work involved in  stringing phone service to fringe developments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shift to Minorities  </P> <P> "This was an area where we could break in quickly," said Steven J. Carr, a GTE  purchasing agent who, at the time, was responsible for recruiting labor  contractors.  </P> <P> In mid-1987, GTE let its existing vendors know that it would be shifting its  contract work to minority companies. Within weeks, according to state  corporation records and interviews with the principals of the companies, their  minority replacements were in place.  </P> <P> Butler helped form Telco in August. Hood Corp., a Whittier firm that long had  done underground construction work for GTE, helped establish Atramentech Inc.  Hood purchased a 49% share of the Upland firm (its name is from the Latin word  for "black") and assigned a top executive to help Atramentech's black  president, former college professor Elizabeth Johnson, learn the job shop  business.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Joe C. Baker, who had run Volt's West Coast job shop operations,  took the upheaval at GTE as his cue to quit the big temporary service and  devote full time to Main Communications, a firm he had started in 1983 with his  wife Jeanine and her father, Arthur F. Main, both of whom are registered  members of the Potawatomi Indian tribe.  </P> <P> That fall, GTE began to take job slots away from its longtime vendors,  reassigning them to the new firms. Technical workers for the first time were  encouraged to jump between companies, if it meant joining a minority  contractor. Butler simply transferred most of its work force to Telco.  </P> <P> In December, Volt, with an investment of about $10,000, took a 49% share in the  last of the new minority companies, KV Telecommunications. KV's chief  executive, E. Keith McKeague, an ethnic Hawaiian, said he proposed the  association to Volt Executive Vice President Jerome Shaw, with whom he had been  friends for years. McKeague owns 41% of the firm. Its other minority owner,  Vice President John L. Bettis, is a black man who quit a job at Volt to join  KV. Bettis owns 10% of the company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confused and Outraged  </P> <P> By the end of 1988, the switch-over to the minority firms was complete. At  Thanksgiving time, GTE supervisors had informed the last 50 or so Burnup &amp;  Sims employees -- a group that numbered 300 less than two years earlier -- that  if they wished to continue working at GTE, they would have to go to work for  one of the minority firms.  </P> <P> Though telephone contract workers by nature are itinerants, crisscrossing the  country to extend phone service to newly developing communities, many were  confused, even outraged, by the turmoil unleashed at GTE. Especially angry were  those who left Burnup &amp; Sims: Not only did they give up one of the best  benefits packages in the industry, they said, but they also lost service  credits toward vacations, sick leave and retirement plans.  </P> <P> Moreover, many simply did not like being told, in effect, for whom they were  going to work.  </P> <P> "I won't ever work for anyone in a forced situation," said one engineer who  refused a job offer when Carrier called to say it had taken over his slot from  Burnup &amp; Sims. "This is a free country," he said, "and I'll work for  whomever I want to work for." The engineer, who was afraid that he would be  unable to work again for GTE if he were identified, left Southern California  rather than continue doing his old job for a new company.  </P> <P> And what of the deals cut to create the new firms?  </P> <P> Each of the three companies with ties to a majority contractor contends that it  satisfies the state's criteria for being a minority vendor -- 51% minority  ownership and genuine day-to-day control in the hands of a minority group  member. Each has been examined and approved by auditors hired by GTE.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Was a Crock'  </P> <P> Yet the mentorships have drawn much suspicion. Assemblywoman Moore first  questioned GTE about the status of Telco and Atramentech -- and about Main, as  well -- in October, 1987, shortly after they began doing business with the  phone company. Competitors in the tight-knit world of contract labor cast  aspersions on each others' credibility. The contract workers themselves heard  the rumors and wrote off the contracting program as a bureaucratic boondoggle.  </P> <P> "The general feeling I got from everybody out in the field was that it was a  crock," said Doug Parrish, whom Butler assigned to direct Telco's recruiting  efforts and who now is a recruiter for Volt in Orange.  </P> <P> GTE officials concede that it was in the interest of the longtime contractors  to lose as little as possible in the transition to minority procurement.  </P> <P> "These guys had been in business with us for quite a while," said Carr. "It was  big business for them -- a very lucrative business. To just bail out because  somebody changed their mind about what the rules were didn't make much sense."  </P> <P> The new companies have varying degrees of independence from their mentor firms.  </P> <P> Take Telco. Carr, the GTE purchasing agent, says Butler "brought forth" Telco.  Adds Parrish: "It would be hard for me to say in no uncertain terms that  (Telco) ran itself." According to Cox, GTE decided last week to conduct a new  audit of the firm's minority status.  </P> <P> Telco's first 51% owner, Ebert J. Vallejos, who now works for a Butler  subsidiary in Sacramento, referred calls about the two firms' relationship to  Butler. So did its new majority owner, Kathryn Ellis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Minorities Benefit  </P> <P> Marc D. Freedman, Butler's general counsel, insists that Telco -- whose  executive office is at the same New Jersey address as Butler's -- is an  independent firm. But he is not shy in explaining Butler's rationale for  helping create Telco. "Would you rather make 100% of a requisition, none of it  or some of it?" Freedman asked. "If part of your market is taken away, you as a  businessman look for a way to retain as much of it as you can."  </P> <P> Beyond the protection of Butler's interests, he added, at least two minorities  have benefited from the founding of Telco -- Vallejos, a Latino, and Ellis, a  white woman. "Their lots in life have improved in terms of experience,  compensation and things like that," Freedman said.  </P> <P> Atramentech, by contrast, severed its formal ties with Hood nine days ago when  its president, Elizabeth Johnson, bought out Hood's 49% stake -- in part to put  an end to questions about her company's minority status. Until then, she  acknowledged, the doubts, if misplaced, were understandable.  </P> <P> "I've read all the federal legislation," Johnson said before the repurchase,  "and we're organized right out on the ledge."  </P> <P> Legislators may have intended that contracting programs allow minority firms to  stand on their own, Johnson said. But she is convinced that without alliances,  minorities will fail.  </P> <P> "From a competitive, capitalistic perspective," Johnson said, "I don't think  the small company will survive doing it that way."  </P> <P> Main's founders know how hard it is to get started without backing. They pooled  all their resources -- including mortgaging their homes -- to raise the  $175,000 with which they opened the firm's doors, according to Joe Baker, the  company's chief operating officer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question of Status  </P> <P> But a GTE audit concluded that Main is not a minority company. The auditor said  Baker runs the business, and both competitors and engineers employed by Main  say they share that impression. While it conducts a new audit of Main's status,  GTE is not counting $2.9 million in business with Main toward its minority  contracting goals.  </P> <P> But Baker -- outraged that the first auditor based his finding on paper work,  never visiting the company's Westchester office -- is insistent that the firm's  three owners share in all major decisions. And he notes that more than half of  Main's 87 employees are minority group members.  </P> <P> Carr says he carefully weighed the new companies' minority status before  inviting them into GTE's circle of vendors. When non-minority firms proposed  blatant "fronts," he rejected them.  </P> <P> One underground construction firm, Carr recalled, "brought in a black fellow  and said, 'Here's our boy, we're going to make him the president and owner of a  new company. Don't worry about the quality of the work; we'll be taking care of  that for you.' "  </P> <P> But Carr, in picking contractors with ties to GTE's traditional vendors, also  passed over at least 20 small firms unallied with non-minority companies.  </P> <P> "I had a responsibility to GTE of California to find good people, and in an  effort to do that, I had to utilize those companies that could recruit talent  we had experience with and understood our system," he explained. Some of the  firms that came forward seemed to have been thrown together over a few beers,  Carr added. "I was most comfortable with the companies we went with."  </P> <P> GTE got more than comfort out of the arrangements, though, according to  Johnson, who while benefiting from Carr's decisions detected some cynicism in  the phone company's strategy.  </P> <P> "It makes GTE's life easier if a minority company stays with a majority  company," she observed, "because the old grandfather way of doing business is  going to continue, and obviously the majority company is going to keep the  minority company in line."  </P> <P> GTE has placed the new contractors on notice that they must "have the resources  and ability to stand alone" by November, according to Carr. GTE officials,  however, say that standard has not been defined; Carr suspects that it would  allow Telco's relationship with Butler, for one, to continue.  </P> <P> In the meantime, some of GTE's new contractors shake their heads in wonder at  the forces let loose when the phone company set out to dramatically boost its  dealings with minorities.  </P> <P> "Up until a couple of years ago, nobody wanted an association with minorities  whatsoever," said Bettis of KV. "Now that there's money to be made in it,  everybody's jumping on the minority bandwagon."  </P> <P> </P> <P> GETTING A TOEHOLD: MINORITY-OWNED CONTRACTORS  </P> <P> MINORITY COMPANY  </P> <P> Atramentech Inc.  </P> <P> Upland  </P> <P> NON-MINORITY AFFILIATION  </P> <P> Originally 49% owned by Hood Corp. of Whittier.

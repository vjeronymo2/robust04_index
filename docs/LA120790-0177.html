A pink Cadillac would seem appropriate," he said.  </P> <P> The status-conscious rich in Britain can pay the price of an average saloon car  for the privilege of a personalized license plate, and the government has been  cashing in by selling unique numbers that were previously withheld.  </P> <P> License plates are made up of officially issued letters and figures.  </P></p>

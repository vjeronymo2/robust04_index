The mainland co-convenor of the sub-group, Professor Xiao  Weiyun, said after it met yesterday that there was no way for  the Chinese and British Governments to discuss the appointments  of principal officials for the first SAR government following  the collapse of the Sino-British talks on political reform.  "Under such circumstances, there won't be any talks on the  civil service as the talks on the Legislative Council electoral  arrangements have broken down," he said.    The statement came despite repeated calls by Governor Chris  Patten and Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang for China to  discuss with the British side the through-train arrangements of  principal officials. The decision is set to add further to  uncertainty in the civil service, where many senior and middle-  ranking officials already feel anxious about their future.    Some officials privately are understood to be worried that  China may set up a "second stove" for the civil service and  allow only officials who have toed Beijing's line to serve after  1997.    The Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, said last night he  was  not prepared to comment on PWC meetings. But in Beijing,  Professor Xiao said the chief executive-designate of the SAR  would name candidates for the positions of principal officials  before the changeover to ensure that the SAR government could be  formed on July 1, 1997.    The precise timing of nominations had yet to be discussed,  he  said, but suggested the search for the right people could take  some time. "It may take three months, six months, or 12  months," he said.    The political sub-group decided in its previous session that  the chief executive-designate could be named as early as 1996  when the Preparatory Committee for the SAR would be in place.    Although the PWC said China should refuse to talk to Britain  on the transition of the civil service, Professor Xiao stressed  that committee members hoped that most civil servants would stay  beyond the changeover.    Before the souring of Sino-British relations there had been  on the British side an understanding that Britain could consult  with China to draw up a list of senior civil service officials  to serve beyond 1997. The list would then be taken by the chief  executive who would nominate the candidates and report to the  central government for appointments. But the latest position as  spelt out by the PWC would mean that the chief executive, who  will be appointed by the central Government, could choose the  senior officials on his own.    However, PWC member Lau Siu-kai said it was unlikely that  there would be a major reshuffle among the key government  officials after 1997. "The number of potential candidates to be  major government officials is small. There won't be much choice  for the chief executive-designate," he said.    Defending the PWC's position, Professor Xiao insisted that  the Basic Law did not allow for any consultation with Britain on  the through-train for civil service officials. The line-up for  the SAR government officials should be decided in accordance  with the Basic Law.    The Hong Kong co-convenor of the sub-group, Leung Chun-ying,  said that there was no way for China to discuss possible  candidates with Britain until the chief executive-designate was  named.    The political sub-group also decided that to ensure a smooth  transition in the civil service, China would invite the entire  civil service to indicate before 1997 their willingness to stay  in the service after the changeover. Quoting Article 100 of the  Basic Law, Professor Xiao said public servants in the pre-1997  government might all remain after 1997.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: New orders at MAN fall by 14% in first half NEW orders at MAN, the German engineering group, fell by 14 per cent to DM8.6bn (Dollars 5.4bn) in the six months to December as a result of the world economic slowdown and the slackening of Germany's own post-unification jump in demand. But the group still expects turnover and profits to be maintained for the whole of this year (to June 1992) due to a high backlog in orders. MAN, whose products include trucks, printing equipment, diesel engines and industrial plant, said new domestic orders declined by 12 per cent and those from abroad by 16 per cent. Turnover in the July-December period - the financial year runs to end-June - was down by 0.5 per cent to DM8.4bn; while domestic sales were 21 per cent higher, foreign sales fell by 13 per cent. The best performance came from MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the commercial vehicle subsidiary, which produced a rise of 14 per cent in sales to DM3.8bn. This unit has benefited considerably from demand connected with the supplying and rebuilding of the east German economy. Truck sales in other markets also advanced. By contrast, MAN Roland, the printing equipment manufacturer, suffered a 7 per cent drop in sales to DM1.2bn. MAN Roland recently announced plans to shed around 750 workers as a result of declining orders. The total number of MAN group employees went down by 900 people in the July-December period to 63,700. Because of its continuing high backlog of orders, worth DM18.4bn at end-December, a 1 per cent rise on the previous year, MAN still expects turnover to show an overall rise in the 1991-92 financial year. It said profits should be roughly unchanged. Last year, MAN increased its net profits by 24 per cent to DM406m on turnover which was 16 per cent higher at DM19bn.</p>

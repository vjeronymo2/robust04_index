			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion by Professor Toshiyuki Munekata of Teikyo </F> University, Professor Tadashi Nishihara of the National Defense  Academy, and Councilor Yoshiji Nogami of the Foreign Ministry's  Foreign Policy Bureau; presided over by Takashi Kawauchi, chief  of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Foreign News Department; from the  "Verification of North Korea's Suspected Nuclear Development"  series; part two in a two-part series: "How Is Japan Going To  Deal With Possible Military Confrontation?"]    [Text] [Kawauchi] The DPRK (North Korea) has stated that  if economic sanctions are imposed against it, it will take that  as a declaration of war. There is a danger that great ambiguity  might lead to a military collision based on misunderstanding.    [Nogami] The suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons  development has continued since 1985 when the country joined the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). After its participation  in the NPT, it took seven years for North Korea to accept  inspections of its nuclear-related facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). After the issue  arose concerning its failure to report two nuclear-related  facilities, the country played games, making good use of  facilities which it already reported. North Korea has not  suddenly gone to extremes, but instead is playing a  long-sustained game. It is difficult for us to try not to lose  our patience with the game.    However, because the operating of the second plutonium  production line at the radio-chemistry laboratory (located in  Yongbyon north of Pyongyang) is a problem, we have to think  about the time limit....    [Munekata] If those in the substructure who support the Kim  Il-song and Kim Chong-il administration become a monolithic  party, there is a possibility they will usurp power from Kim and  his son. For this reason, the Kim administration has kept the  substructures separate and has adopted a system which places  them under mutual surveillance. Such people in the substructure  brought about the Rangoon incident and the 1987 bombing of a  South Korean airliner in a bid to please their "boss." We  cannot say such an incident will not happen again. The current  situation on the Korean peninsula is the most strained since  1953 when the Korean war ended.    If something happens, Japan will fall into a panic, but will  be unable to do anything. If a second Korean war breaks out,  the loser will not be North or South Korea but Japan, for Tokyo  will become a loser in the eyes of the international community  since it did nothing. How will the international community view  a country that is "unable to provide water and fuel" to the  Australian Navy conducting warlike actions and patrols in the  Sea of Japan?    [Nogami] We should seriously consider the pending issue of  "acquisition and cross-servicing agreements" (ACSA) that provide  logistical support to allied nations since the enforcement of  ACSA is possible through administrative measures. I do not say  this only for the sake of dealing with the situation on the  Korean peninsula. It is unusual that although the security  treaty has been concluded, Japan has not yet signed such an  agreement.    Moreover, in view of domestic laws, how should we view the  connection between the Road Traffic Act and transportation of  the Self-Defense Forces [SDF]? Current laws ban the shipping  and discharging of explosives and ammunition at night. Does  this apply to emergency cases? There is no legal conformity.  It is the same with the issue of using SDF airplanes to rescue  overseas Japanese. The related bill was killed at the previous  Diet session.    [Munekata] There is a possibility the Ground Self-Defense  Force [GSDF] may be ordered to establish watch points along the  coast in view of the possibility of refugees coming to Japan.  However, it is not a security order nor a defense order.  Places with a view of the coast are generally used as parks.  Even if GSDF units try to enter a park for such activities,  they cannot enter due to park regulations. It is out of the  question.    [Kawauchi] Some believe North Korea's nuclear weapons  development will lead to competition in development of nuclear  weapons among northeast Asian nations. Moreover, an increasing  number of people are doubtful of the efficiency of the U.S.  nuclear umbrella in the post-Cold War era.    [Nishihara] It is inappropriate to deal with the PRC and  DPRK nuclear issues in the same manner. The PRC is a  superpower, and its nuclear program is relatively transparent.  However, suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons  development has triggered a U.S. concern that "Japan may also be  armed with nuclear weapons." Although Japan has maintained it  "will not become a nuclear power because it has the three  nonnuclear principles [of not introducing, not producing, and  not possessing nuclear weapons]," this is not persuasive. Japan  needs to raise a clear argument that "nuclear armaments do not  benefit its national interest." What Japan should say is that  it may become a nuclear power if the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty  is scrapped or Japan becomes isolated as a result of hostility  with neighboring nations, but that in the current situation  there is no possibility of it deciding to become a nuclear power.    [Nogami] During Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to  the United States in February, he said: "The option of  possessing nuclear weapons would be against Japan's national  interest." He added: "The possibility of Japan becoming a  nuclear power is quite an insensible argument which ignores the  sentiments of the Japanese people." I am sure the United States  understood this view. So far we have been able to coexist with  the nuclear weapons of the PRC and Russia because of the U.S.  commitment to a nuclear deterrent. There are now arguments in  the United States about whether it should abide by its security  promise to the Far East. It can be said that the view of Japan  becoming a nuclear power has been entangled in these arguments.    [Munekata] As Nishihara says, if Japan clearly states "it  will arm itself with nuclear weapons under certain situations,"  then Japan will win the trust of foreign nations. Although  Japan possesses a military strength of 270,000 soldiers, it does  not call it a "military force." However, people in Southeast  Asia do not trust this change in the wording. They are  concerned Japan may maintain that "it does not possess nuclear  bombs, only special bombs for self-defense." Japan's emotional  nonnuclear policy is meaningless to such concerns. Without  consistency in its logic, we cannot dispel foreign apprehension  about Japan becoming a nuclear power.    [Nogami] However, I want to emphasize that Southeast Asia  has deepened its understanding of Japan's "defense-only"  principle. Security dialogues with those nations have been  promoted. What is regrettable is that security dialogues with  South Korea have not. Since Japan has just begun a dialogue with  the PRC, its future task is to promote dialogue with South Korea.    [Kawauchi] I am concerned that, in the long run, Western  nations will fail to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear  weapons. They will not stop nuclear proliferation, but will try  to prevent the use of nuclear weapons which have already been  developed. What can we do? It has been stated in the United  States that the preemptive use of conventional weapons is the  only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons.    [Nishihara] Certainly there are arguments that we have to  deal with the nuclear installations of middle powers by using  conventional weapons.    [Nogami] The prevention of North Korea's possession of  nuclear weapons is not an issue that concerns only nuclear  nonproliferation. In negotiations to normalize diplomatic  relations, will Japan talk with a North Korea that possesses  nuclear weapons? Or will Japan negotiate with a North Korea  that gives up its possession of nuclear weapons? These are  totally different. There is a possibility North Korea's economy  will collapse while it possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea's  major concern is the reconstruction of its economy. Their task  is how to deal with foreign nations by using the nuclear card.    [Nishihara] While playing its nuclear card, North Korea will  advance along the road of isolation, and its economy will  collapse. On the other hand, while helping North Korea become  isolated, Japan is trying to prevent the situation from  developing into military action. While playing for time, both  sides are waiting for the situation to turn to their advantage.    [Kawauchi] However, do you not think we will have to pay  dearly for the sudden collapse of the North Korean structure?    [Nishihara] That will present a serious situation to South  Korea.    [Nogami] North Korea wants to deal with its economy. In  recent cases, senior government officials have been removed to  take responsibility for their failure to deal with economic  issues.    [Munekata] In North Korea, the people feel "all or nothing."  There is a view that North Korea will choose between two  courses: one is that the situation will develop into a second  Korean war, and another is that North Korea will adopt a  Chinese-style policy of opening up to foreign nations.    [Nogami] The North Korean people, who have been gradually  obtaining external information, are feeling a sense of  isolation, though no one says that. They think Russia and the  PRC will be unreliable in their time of need. The PRC has  maintained it has no influence on North Korea.    I think we need to seek a way of dispelling this sense of  isolation by North Korea.</p>

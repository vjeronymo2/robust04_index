			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mitsubishi Corporation recently announced it  will enter the Cuban market and formalize its presence in Cuba.  Martin Rodin, president of Mitsubishi Motors in Cuba, was  interviewed by Mariela Diaz.    [Begin recording] [Rodin] We have been working in Cuba for  almost 14 years. Mitsubishi's decision came after eight months  of work. This decision encompasses more than importing and  selling vehicles. Once the decision to enter the Cuban market  was made, the Japanese sent a work group to Cuba to examine all  technical aspects involving the vehicles.    [Diaz] What types of vehicles will you be marketing?    [Rodin] The automobile will be the Lancer. They will be  used,  for now, as rental cars for tourism. There is also a great  demand for diesel engine box vans, minibuses for 12 and 26  passengers. Following today's or tomorrow's signing of the  contract with Transimport (as heard), we will begin to import a  full line of trucks, both medium and heavy load. [end recording]</p>

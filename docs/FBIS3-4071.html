The  results of such control, according to Mr. Yin, will be the key  to development of the national economy this year.    The meeting centered on examination work by the banks  nationwide, confirming that the main theme of financial  supervision this year would concentrate on inspection of  financial institutions with strict restrictions on the scale of  loans for fixed assets investment by those institutions.    This year is very important, according to Mr. Yin, as it be  the time when intensive restructuring of the financial system  takes place. Following the change of functions by the central  bank, it should concentrate on supervision and administration of  financial institutions with strengthened inspection.  Examination work would guarantee effective implementation of  the restructuring of the financial system and help financial  enterprises develop in a healthy way while at the same keeping  the financial system in order.    Mr. Yin stressed that inspection departments of various  levels of the bank had to gather their strength to launch  examination work on the control of loans for fixed assets  investment in the second half of this year. They had to deal  harshly with excessive releases of loans, loans coming from  working capital and loans for speculation in real estate shares.</p>

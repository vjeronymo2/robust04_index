			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENTENCED TO SCRUBBING  </P> <P> It's sort of like Dad making Junior wash the car for not keeping his room clean  -- there's a certain neatness to it, both literally and figuratively. At the  suggestion last week of Supervisor Gaddi A. Vasquez, Orange County is studying  an ordinance to impose jail sentences and stiff fines on repeat graffiti  scribes who practice their "art" in unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> In a twin effort to counteract such defacement, the county is considering  Vasquez's proposal to set up a program in which persons sentenced to jail time,  including those convicted of besmirching property, could be assigned to a  graffiti-abatement program. Already a local Municipal Court judge has praised  the idea as a possible sentencing alternative to alleviate jail overcrowding.  </P> <P> Currently, minimum-security jail inmates are regularly assigned to work crews  that clean up flood control channels and roadsides, including painting over  graffiti. Vasquez's program would designate crews specifically for graffiti  removal.  </P> <P> Orange County's 29 cities spend about $1 million annually to rid themselves of  unsightly graffiti, using city crews, private contractors and volunteers. A  county-run graffiti-removal program could be a less-costly alternative for  cities. It also could provide an appropriate way to fit the punishment to the  crime.  </P></p>

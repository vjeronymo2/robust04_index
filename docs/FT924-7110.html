			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / A storm in a coffee cup: Falling prices and a world glut have led coffee producers and consumers to seek a new quota pact For the past two years, the world's coffee producers have been forced to swallow a bitter brew. Plummeting prices and excess supply threaten the livelihood of more than 25m coffee workers from Brazil to Indonesia. The product, once known as green gold, is losing its lustre as the economic mainstay of many developing countries. An experiment with the free market has left the industry, with total sales estimated at Dollars 34bn a year and a daily consumption of 2bn cups, in its worst crisis for decades. After the collapse in 1989 of the International Coffee Agreement - a pact between producers and consumers controlling exports to ensure price stability - a world glut caused coffee prices to slump to almost a third of the level of the late 1980s. Most growers have been selling at well below cost for the past two years. The current state of the industry is so serious that growers, exporters, processors and buyers - led by Brazil, the largest producer, and the US, the largest consumer and processor - have put aside competing interests to come to the negotiating table. Following a first round in September, crucial talks will begin next Monday at the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) in London to try to conclude a new coffee pact, re-establishing quotas to limit exports and stabilise prices in an admission that the free market has not worked. Hitting 22-year price lows in August of less than 50 cents a pound in New York, coffee has been overtaken by sugar as the developing countries' main earner after oil. Unlike oil, however, coffee supply cannot simply be turned on and off, so growers in the 50 main producing countries have to sell at the lower prices or stop production. Their ability to boost prices through holding back supplies is weakened by the considerable stocks in the hands of consuming countries. The results are abandoned plantations across the developing world and out-of-work coffee pickers, whose anger threatens to spill over into social unrest. In some countries, such as Colombia, the principal alternative crop is the coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine. The outcome of the talks is keenly awaited, particularly in Brazil, which has been the biggest producer almost continuously since the 1760s when Cappuchin monks in Rio de Janeiro began growing seeds smuggled from French Guyana. Mr Jose Dias de Goveia, a 76-year-old farmer in Pocos de Caldas, Brazil's coffee heartland, says: 'I've been in coffee all my life but the last four years have been the worst I've ever seen. We're talking survival.' Production costs are Dollars 65 a 60-kilo bag, but he is forced to sell at Dollars 40. He has cut staff to a third, reduced land under cultivation from 500 to 400 hectares, and is producing what he calls 'ecological coffee', because he cannot afford fertilisers. In southern Minas Gerais, the world's most productive coffee belt, such stories are common. Growers are abandoning coffee, which has always been a volatile commodity and sensitive to climatic changes, for eucalyptus, nuts and passion fruit. On many farms cattle graze between the remaining coffee bushes. In the past three years the number of coffee bushes in Brazil has fallen from 4.2bn to 3.2bn. Only 20 per cent are thought to be properly cultivated; quality is suffering and thus flavour is deteriorating because coffee prices are too low for growers to invest in fertilisers and technology. The current crop is expected to yield fewer than 20m bags compared with 43m in 1987-88. Although these figures are significant, the impact of the coffee price slump is even greater on many smaller coffee-producing nations, where coffee is the principal foreign exchange earner. Growers have little alternative but to turn to cocaine production to sustain their families. In Colombia, disenchanted pickers are raw fodder for recruitment into cocaine production cartels. In Brazil, industrialisation has diminished coffee's contribution to export earnings to less than 4 per cent this year compared with 21.5 per cent 15 years ago and 50 per cent in the early 1960s. However, coffee cultivation remains a labour-intensive business and Mr Christian Ottoni, head of the Pocos do Caldas Rural Union, warns: 'The social consequences of the price collapse have been devastating.' He estimates that 1.5m to 2m of the 10m workers dependent on Brazil's coffee sector are unemployed and adding to the growing number of slum-dwellers in the cities. Ironically, it was Brazil that scuppered the coffee accord. It was angered by US attempts to reduce its export quota to allow Colombia and Central America, which produce the milder varieties of coffee favoured by Americans, to increase their exports. The Bush administration was motivated by a determination to provide economic support for these countries in return for co-operation in the war against drugs. The Brazilian Exporters Federation (Febec), which had been convinced that the world's largest producer could only stand to benefit from a free market, has had its hopes shattered as the country has seen coffee income fall from Dollars 2.5bn a year to little more than Dollars 1bn since 1989. Despite the glut on world markets, Brazil is struggling to fulfil its export commitments this year of 13m bags. It is reportedly even importing low-grade coffee to meet the requirements of its home market - now the second-largest in the world at 10m bags. By contrast, Colombia more than doubled its crop since 1989 to 18m bags and has seen earnings increase to match those of Brazil. Brazil's growers put part of the blame on disgraced President Fernando Collor's policy of deregulation. While Colombian growers have received government subsidies and support in technology and marketing since the pact collapsed, the Brazilian government in 1990 closed its Coffee Institute, which controlled supply and sales. The government's curbs on subsidies for agriculture meant growers had no access to cheap finance, domestic prices were subjected to successive price freezes and exports were hit by an overvalued cruzeiro. The Brazilian coffee sector was also discredited internationally by charges in New York of insider trading in coffee futures  -after the government's sudden suspension of coffee exports in March last year - allegedly linked to the corruption scandal which caused Mr Collor's downfall last month. But Mr Luiz Sergio de Paiva, from Brazil's National Coffee Council, says most of the blame for the current crisis must be laid at the door of the small group of processors which dominates the market. 'It was not a free market at all,' he says, pointing at a map on his wall. 'All the world's coffee grows between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn in the third world and thus lacks planning and development. The consumers are all in Europe and the northern hemisphere. Five big first-world companies process half the world's coffee. In a so-called free market it will always be producers that lose and processors that gain.' With many Febec members facing bankruptcy, the federation has yielded to growers' demands and is backing a new agreement. 'We did not expect that being without an accord would be so hard or so long,' admits Mr Oswaldo Aranha Neto, Febec president. But coffee diplomacy is a delicate business. The International Coffee Organisation includes 50 coffee-exporting nations (representing 97 per cent of world production) and 21 importing countries (responsible for 80 per cent of consumption). Negotiations bring together countries as diverse as Germany, Cuba, Vietnam and Ethiopia, and previous talks have been acrimonious. The producers might seem to be in the weak position. Mr Alexandre Beltrao, head of the ICO, estimates that producers have been losing Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn a year worldwide since the accord collapsed. But the tables may soon turn. The price has started to recover quite rapidly over the past few weeks as Brazil has admitted its crop is lower than expected, and now stands at more than 70 cents a pound. Consumers and processors are beginning to be worried about a possible dearth of supplies, particularly as it takes four years for a bush to start producing beans. Industrialists worry that the low prices have caused quality to drop even further. Mr Beltrao points out that the income lost by producers 'is money which should have been directed towards investment'. The price recovery is generating renewed optimism among producers that the sector may be poised for revival, rendering a pact academic. But prices were at 130 cents when the accord collapsed and Mr Beltrao says: 'Prices have not risen enough to dissuade anyone of the need for a new accord. I think by the end of the year we'll have a framework agreement.' Negotiations on a pact may, however, be affected by a change of administration in the two main participating countries. The new Brazilian president, Mr Itamar Franco, is from Minas Gerais, which produces half of Brazil's coffee, and is thought to be sympathetic to the idea of an accord. The position of Mr Bill Clinton, US president-elect, is less clear, though Mr Jorge Cardenas, of the Colombian National Growers Federation, says he is not worried that a change in the White House means the US will cool to the idea of a deal. In September a serious hurdle was overcome with agreement on the concept of universal quotas, covering exports of producers to all destinations rather than just to ICO members, and guaranteeing that exports offered to member countries would be on at least as good terms as to non-members. Under the previous agreement, producers sold surplus supplies to non-members at cheaper prices, which then sold the coffee on to member countries. The remaining obstacles include a system for controlling shipments, agreeing on prices and quota sizes. The issue of selectivity will also have to be resolved to allow consumers to obtain the types of coffee they prefer, such as robusta or the milder arabica. Mr Beltrao stresses that the return to a pact would not mean the sector had lost its taste for the free market. 'I don't see a pact as an alternative but as a five-year transition period,' he says. Whether the worst is over for those whose livelihood depends on coffee rests largely on the outcome of this month's negotiations. Although a new pact might push up prices for coffee lovers, the hope is that the ensuing price stability and quality would act like a caffeine shot to stimulate consumption above the 72m bags at which it has stuck. Mr Paiva warns: 'We must remember that coffee is not the only drink in the world.'  -----------------------------------------------          A LOT LESS COFFEE IN BRAZIL  ----------------------------------------------- The top overall consumers  ----------------------------------------------- 1991               60kg bags      Kg per                    (million)      capita  ----------------------------------------------- US                   18.89         4.52 Germany              10.48         7.92 Brazil                9.20         3.78 Japan                 6.00         2.92 France                5.56         5.84  ----------------------------------------------- The top drinkers  ----------------------------------------------- 1991                 Kg per                  capita a year  ----------------------------------------------- Finland              11.51 Sweden               11.13 Norway               10.66 Denmark              10.59  ----------------------------------------------- The top exporters  ----------------------------------------------- Coffee year            60kg bags 1991/92                (million)  ----------------------------------------------- Brazil                   21.74 Colombia                 15.42 Indonesia                 4.02 Ivory Coast               3.57 Guatemala                 3.29 Mexico                    2.98 Costa Rica                2.27  ----------------------------------------------- Source: ICO  -----------------------------------------------</p>

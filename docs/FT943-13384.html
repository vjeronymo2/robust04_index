			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Woodlands avoid sell-off: Government plans executive agency status for Forest Enterprise The government yesterday formally ruled out privatisation of Britain's public forests but announced new incentives for tree-planting for timber and a more 'businesslike' structure for the commercial arm of the Forestry Commission. Announcing the results of an Pounds 833,000 review of the forestry sector initiated by the government in March last year, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, left open the possibility of a change of heart on privatisation at some future date. 'Our conclusion is that, at this stage of their development, the Forestry Commission woodlands should remain in the public sector,' he told the Commons. He said environmental, recreational and public-access needs had been taken into account in the decision against a sell-off, as had the fact that the forests were mostly not fully mature and would raise only about Pounds 750m, compared with a book value of Pounds 1.7bn. Mr Lang said that Forest Enterprise, which manages the commission's 1.1m hectares, would become an executive agency under the government's 'next steps' programme aimed at increasing efficiency and providing better value for taxpayers' money. 'There will be improved accounting and costing arrangements, helping to ensure that the costs and benefits of commission programmes are better measured.' Some 180,000 hectares of commission land have been sold off since the start of the 1980s, and these sales will continue. But the government plans to strengthen protection for continued public access to woodlands that move into private hands. Incentives to encourage the private sector to plant new commercial forests are to be increased by 10 per cent, with Pounds 3m in new money and an additional Pounds 1m reallocated from reduced grants for re-planting. The changes were broadly welcomed by the forestry industry. Mr Peter Wilson, chief executive of the Timber Growers Association, said planting of conifers for timber had fallen dramatically since controversial tax incentives were dropped in 1988. 'Prior to 1988 the pendulum was stuck on the commercial side. Then it swung completely towards the environment. This is a swing back to a more sensible balance,' he said. However, other forestry and landowner organisations were not convinced the increases in grants were sufficient to attract new investment. Conservation groups welcomed the abandonment of privatisation, but expressed concern that commercial objectives could override environmental ones in the new Forest Enterprise agency. 'We're not persuaded that we're not going to see more commercial plantations in the wrong places, which aren't driven by environmental criteria,' said Ms Fiona Reynolds, director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "French `Yes' to Norwegian EU </F> Demands"]    [Text] Paris -- Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland  yesterday paid a flying visit to Paris to meet the country's top  political leaders. She came directly from Strasbourg. Both  Prime Minister Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand  received the Norwegian guest -- the latter at the Elysee Palace.  But there was no suggestion of dinner or any social  pleasantries at the present time, in the days leading up to the  funeral of Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst.    According to the Norwegian prime minister, one of the most  concrete things to emerge from the visit was that the French  voiced "positive reactions" to Norwegian demands to the effect  that the country needs time and a gradual transition to the EU's  [European Union] agricultural policy.    EU prices on agricultural produce from day one of membership  -- the arrangement that has been proposed hitherto in the  negotiations -- are unacceptable to Norway. And Prime Minister  Brundtland said that inside the EU great importance will be  attached to the view France takes on such issues.    "This is after all a classic field for France," she said.    Fish and agriculture are still the most problematic issues  in  the present phase of the negotiations. As far as regional  policy and what support arrangements Norway and the other  applicant nations will be covered by are concerned, things have  been moving back and forth over the last few days. But  Brundtland said yesterday that she could not imagine that it  will be impossible to achieve some movement on issues to do with  regional support arrangements.    "The question of money has come further to the fore  recently.  It is linked to the EU's internal allocation policy," she said  at a press conference.    Brundtland's visit to Paris is part of the Norwegian  strategy  to work on the EU countries' capitals. While the EU Commission  in Brussels has been accommodating on Norway's position on many  issues, it is expected that the biggest problems are likely to  arise in individual member countries in the final phase of the  negotiations.    "When you approach the end of the negotiations the EU  capitals begin to see things in context. And then the tactical  game starts everywhere," she said.    The whaling issue was also raised in Paris yesterday by  Prime  Minister Balladur, but the pressure on the Norwegians from the  French on this issue is less than that from several other  countries. The Norwegian Embassy has received around 800 "whale  letters."    Norway is still intent that the timetable for completion of  the negotiations by 1 March should hold. But asked whether she  herself takes the view that Norway is in an ideal position, she  said that "we have a few more undecided areas than Sweden."    Brundtland also took the opportunity to invite Prime  Minister  Balladur to Norway. It is 10 years since a French prime  minister visited.</p>

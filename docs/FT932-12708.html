			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Transformation of the Triangle Trust - The two men behind Mayflower's rapid acceleration into the fast lane IN LESS than four years Rupert Hambro and John Simpson have transformed the shell of Triangle Trust, the old Tri-ang toy holding company, into Mayflower, the UK's leading automotive design and engineering group. Barely pausing for breath in the midst of an aggressive 1-for-1 rights issue announced a month ago to raise Pounds 34.6m, the Mayflower twosome jumped last week to take advantage of the financial collapse of IAD (UK) to buy Britain's leading independent automotive design house out of administrative receivership. Mayflower entered the automotive scene as an unknown quantity less than two years ago with the purchase of Motor Panels out of the receivership of the parent company CH Industrials in a deal worth Pounds 14.8m. Now the combination of Motor Panels and International Automotive Design has created for the first time in the UK an automotive design, engineering and manufacturing group that has the resources to challenge some of the leading continental European houses such as Pininfarina, Italdesign, Bertone and Idea of Italy and Karmann of Germany. Shaven-headed - apart from a pencil moustache - and with a taste for colourful ties Mr Simpson, chief executive of Mayflower, has begun to cut a distinctive figure behind the scenes of the motor industry. With the backing of Rupert Hambro as non-executive chairman, he is well on his way to achieving his ambition of building a Pounds 100m public company. Mayflower currently has a market capitalisation of about Pounds 95.5m. Its turnover of Pounds 67.8m last year, which was forecast to rise to some Pounds 70m this year, will now advance by about Pounds 40m in a full year through the addition of IAD. The company has grown rapidly out of the opportunities and problems facing Mr Simpson and Mr Hambro by the late 1980s. Mr Hambro, who broke away from Hambros Bank with his father and two brothers in 1986 to establish JO Hambro in corporate finance and investment management, had a problem of what to do with Triangle Trust, a loss-making, publicly-quoted company. Hambro had bought into the company as an investment opportunity but had failed to make a go of the group's operations spread across toymaking, financial services and advertising. Mr Simpson, aged 50, was looking for a vehicle to gain a stock market quotation for his privately-owned mini-conglomerate Timelaw (RPHM), which by 1989 chiefly comprised Ribbons, a maker of webbing for seatbelts, parachutes and other safety harnesses, and a direct marketing company PHM. Prior to setting up in business on his own account, Mr Simpson's main commercial experience had been with Bunzl, where at the age of 28 he had been one of the company's youngest divisional managing directors responsible for the Rolex Paper Company. The two decided to join forces. In 1989 Triangle Trust paid Mr Simpson and his business partners Pounds 11.2m for Timelaw - Pounds 4.5m in cash and the rest in shares. Mr Simpson became chief executive with Rupert Hambro staying as non-executive chairman. The company's name was changed to Mayflower. Of their respective roles Mr Hambro says: 'I bring the City connections. I act as a sounding board. John Simpson and David Donnelly, the finance director, run the industrial operations and acquisitions.' Mr Simpson was set on expanding his new company in engineering and manufacturing. Motor Panels was the first big opportunity to arise. Such opportunities do not come easily. By the time IAD fell into administrative receivership three weeks ago, it was the 111th company that Mayflower had looked at. It had previously had contacts with International Automotive Design and Mr John Shute, its pugnacious founder and chairman, but the price had always been too high. IAD's receivership changed the two groups fortunes. In 1989 the Cinvest venture capital group had bought into IAD, acquiring a 13.5 per cent interest for Pounds 4.5m which valued the group at Pounds 33m. Mayflower has now paid Pounds 3.25m in cash to acquire the IAD business and assets from the receiver together with the shares of IAD's overseas trading subsidiaries, which did not go into receivership. The combination of IAD's established design expertise and international reputation in the world auto industry and Motor Panels' greater experience in manufacturing could now produce a highly effective combination in the intensely competitive world arena for automotive design, engineering and manufacturing services. Motor Panels, the Coventry-based automotive engineering group, already operates in vehicle engineering design and development through to tooling and manufacturing. Before the IAD acquisition Mayflower was already expanding rapidly and was in the midst of its second rights issue in less than two years with the Pounds 34.6m it was already raising aimed at financing its existing ambitious expansion in the UK and the US. It raised about Pounds 17m in 1991 to buy Motor Panels. Mayflower increased its pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.7m last year on turnover of Pounds 67.8m and with a workforce worldwide of close to 1,000. IAD incurred a loss of Pounds 105,000 on turnover of Pounds 62m for the year to the end of April 1991, its last audited accounts. It also has a workforce approaching 1,000 worldwide, including a large number of independent consultants, with just under 300 in the UK. It suffered 'substantial losses' of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m in the last 12 months. Based at Worthing, West Sussex, IAD has carried out contracts for many of the world's leading vehicle makers since it was formed by Mr Shute in 1976. It has established a presence in most of the world's leading car producing countries with subsidiaries in Germany, France, Spain and the US and liaison offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Moscow. IAD has played a leading role in the design and prototype development of a wide range of vehicles including the Ford Scorpio estate car, Ford's Lincoln Town Car in the US, the Volvo 440, the Mazda MX-5 sports car and the three-door Fiat Tipo as well as electric and light commercial vehicles. The Motor Panels business in the UK and in the US has recently won, or is at an advanced stage of negotiations on, several large contracts. Even before the IAD takeover Mayflower had moved into the fast lane and expected capital investment to jump from Pounds 3m in 1992 to about Pounds 23m this year, chiefly for the development of its plants and equipment in the UK and in the US. Its turnover more than doubled last year to Pounds 67.8m (Pounds 27.4m), and Mr Simpson had forecast that turnover would rise to Pounds 110m-Pounds 120m by 1995, before IAD dropped into Mayflower's lap. Privately owned, IAD was brought down by a lack of financial resources in recession. Mayflower is seeking not to repeat the mistake. At the time of the rights issue it had a Pounds 1.4m cash balance and no bank borrowings. Gearing was expected to rise to only 26 per cent in 1994, when the Motor Panels expansion programme was expected to be at its peak. IAD will worsen the ratios, but according to Mr Simpson the opportunity was too good to be missed.</p>

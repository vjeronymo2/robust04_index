			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> PROVOCATIVE, CORROSIVE 'EDMOND' UNRAVELS AFTER A PROMISING START  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton's production of David Mamet's "Edmond" starts with a lone  sax man dressed up like a Blues Brother and blowing hard under a moody  spotlight.  </P> <P> The guy's not bad -- the riffs are bluesy, progressive, a little off; it's the  right foreshadowing for Mamet's corrosive black comedy of low-lifes and living  in New York City. Yeah, mournful, urgent and a bit crazy, not bad.  </P> <P> But it all unravels soon enough after the last notes are played. Under Leonard  Meenach's unimaginative direction, the drama is the stage equivalent of labored  breathing. Making the intense, scatological and almost always provocative Mamet  stiff is some accomplishment.  </P> <P> Then there's the acting. Mamet's characters, especially the principals, are out  of reach for most of these student actors. Many of the performances walk the  wire with weak legs, and with Mamet, there's never any net.  </P> <P> "Edmond" is a spookily intriguing play, but it's not one of his best works --  too often it's sensationalistic without being resolved. The scenes are often  padded with popular cliches of New York seediness and sex, moments stuck in  resin. But "Edmond" does have a dirty force that can tie us to a sense of doom,  of a life careening away from itself as Edmond (Michael Denney) pinballs from  one ugly encounter to the next.  </P> <P> The plot begins with ordinary domestic turmoil. Edmond, a middle-aged tie and  suit, leaves his wife, goes drinking in a bar and then embarks on a quest for  sex that takes him into Manhattan's underground. He's pushed around in almost  every scene -- even street shills beat on him -- and in turn he starts to  brutalize those he comes across. What's unsettling is how quickly he becomes a  part of the seaminess.  </P> <P> Most of these moments spit with violence or the threat of it, but "Edmond"  never strays far from its nature as one long off-color joke. Edmond, no matter  how bad the situation gets, always wants to know how much it's all going to  cost. How much are the hookers? How much to play the corner shell game? How  much for that knife?  </P> <P> It's his mantra. He's a middle-class nebbish who adjusts but never really  understands the implications of what's happening to him. It's sad, but funny,  too. He's the butt of the cosmic joke, life's punch line.  </P> <P> At CSUF, it would help if we weren't so removed from Edmond. Denney's hold of  the character is too tenuous -- he doesn't seem to fully understand what  motivates Edmond to leave his wife and take this trip down, and how he's  changed during the journey. Without the actor putting the meaning between the  lines, the audience can be left dangling.  </P> <P> Most of the cast members generally take a hard-boiled stance in approaching  their roles. Another mistake of Meenach's is to minimize variation in the  characters; not all New Yorkers, seedy or not, are this humorless and cynical.  Even a pimp can have irony in his soul.  </P> <P> Still, there are a few capable performances. Rich Ascroft as the black prisoner  who sexually humiliates Edmond and then begins something of an inmates'  marriage with him is dynamic in his few scenes. George Anthony Herrera, in a  handful of parts from a shill to a policeman, has a natural delivery, as does  Sylvia K. Biller, who plays a waitress Edmond sleeps with and accidentally  murders.  </P> <P> In prison, Edmond comes to realize something of what he is. This self-knowledge  sets up the play's controversial ending. Most critics have condemned the moment  when Edmond gently kisses the prisoner who has earlier sodomized him and holds  his hand lovingly as simplistic and disingenuous.  </P> <P> But that misreads the scene. Mamet isn't laying out a moment of love and  redemption; the scene is the playwright's last big sneer at Edmond and what he  represents. It's a manifestation of the Everyman's weak acceptance of his place  in the world, and that acquiescence deserves harsh laughter.  </P> <P> 'EDMOND'  </P> <P> A Cal State Fullerton production of David Mamet's play.

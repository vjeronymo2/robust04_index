			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submission of completed forms. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Both the PMN and SNAP programs have a review period of 90 days, subject to suspensions and extensions described in section VII.A. for the SNAP program and in the PMN final rule (40 CFR 720.75). To ensure that new chemical submissions are reviewed and decided on jointly, the Agency encourages submitters to provide both the PMN form and SNAP addendum to the PMN and SNAP coordinators. Failure to provide both programs with the requested information at the same time could result in delays in the review of a submitter's notice seeking acceptance of a new chemical as a class I or II substitute concurrent with review under the PMN program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures for handling confidential business information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency recognizes that, where appropriate, information submitted to the PMN and SNAP programs may need to be held confidential. EPA has determined that all CBI submitted as part of the joint PMN/SNAP review should be maintained and treated in a manner consistent with TSCA security procedures. Confidentiality claims will be processed and reviewed in a manner consistent with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. This approach was selected because the majority of data provided to SNAP under the joint review process will come from the PMN form. Submitters should note that while TSCA and CAA may have different language describing CBI handling procedures, there is no substantive difference in how CBI is maintained under the two statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Agency Review of New Substitutes under PMN and SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preparation of public docket and Federal Register notices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the letter of receipt has been issued, the PMN program will prepare a public docket and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, as described in the final rule for the PMN program (40 CFR 720.75). The PMN program manager will consult with the SNAP program in preparing the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Joint review process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA will complete joint evaluations of new chemicals serving as class I or II substitutes under section 5 of TSCA and section 612 of the CAA. This joint review process will be coordinated to ensure that there is consistency in the final decisions made under the PMN and SNAP programs. To ensure agreement in the decisions, EPA offices will work in concert to develop toxicity, exposure, and risk profiles for those substitutes and applications that come under joint TSCA and CAA review authority. The Agency will also coordinate its review of the completeness of the information supplied and any subsequent data requests to minimize the reporting burden on the submitter. Submitters should note that Agency decisions to restrict production of particular chemicals under TSCA will, in the case of joint PMN/SNAP applications, also have the effect of restricting production of substitutes undergoing review under the SNAP program. However, companies that produce substitutes only being reviewed under the SNAP program are not required to cease production during the SNAP review period in the case of existing substitutes, and in the case of new substitutes, manufacturers may introduce the substitute into interstate commerce 90 days after submitting their complete notification to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the review, the PMN and SNAP programs will work to arrive at a consistent decision regarding the new chemical under review. Consequently, listing decisions under SNAP will reference any conditions also incorporated into the PMN review (e.g., submission of additional toxicity information, restrictions on use, etc.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a substitute meets the conditions for general PMN approval but not for SNAP acceptability, the company may produce and market the substance in question once the 90-day period has elapsed. However, EPA will commence a rulemaking to prohibit the use of the substitute as a class I or II substitute. If the chemical fails to meet the conditions for PMN approval, the submitter is barred from producing the chemical and consequently is effectively barred from marketing the product as a substitute for a class I or II compound. Submitters should note, however, that CAA section 612 places considerable emphasis on identifying and promoting the use of substitutes which, relative to others, reduce overall risks to human health and the environment. To the extent a substitute offers such risk reduction, EPA will make every effort to facilitate production and use of that alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Communication of decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The PMN program will use the existing TSCA regulatory framework for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicating decisions on the new substitute to the submitter. The SNAP program will provide public notice of decisions regarding the acceptability or unacceptability of a substitute following the process described in section VII.A.3.g. EPA will contact the submitter to determine how best to list the substitute under the SNAP program if necessary to protect the confidentiality of the alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Joint Review of Substitutes under SNAP and FIFRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background on Use of Ozone-Depleting Chemicals in Pesticides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain pesticides are formulated with class I and II chemicals. Examples include the use of methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane) as an inert ingredient, or the use of methyl bromide as an active agent. Pesticide products that contain class I and II compounds must be reformulated as these chemicals are phased out of production pursuant to Clean Air Act section 604. This section describes how the Agency will handle reviews of these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any new pesticide or amendment of an existing formulation is already subject to Agency approval under current provisions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), Public Law 100&hyph;460, 100&hyph;464 to 100&hyph;526, and 100&hyph;532. However, as of the effective date of the SNAP program, new pesticides or formulation changes based on class I or class II substitutes will also be subject to review under section 612 of the CAA. These authorities apply in all cases where a manufacturer amends a pesticide product to replace chemicals being phased out under CAA section 602 or 604. Similarly, registrations of new pesticide products will also be subject to SNAP review if the new formula contains chemicals functionally replacing class I or class II compounds which would otherwise have been used in the new pesticide formulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Review Responsibilities Under FIFRA and CAA/SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, review responsibilities for pesticide products under the CAA SNAP program will focus on a substance's ozone depletion and global warming potential. The FIFRA reviews will address factors commonly examined during pesticide amendments and registrations. The two program offices responsible for these reviews will coordinate their efforts at critical junctures and share pertinent data to ensure appropriate technical consideration of the substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Data Submission Requirements and Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preparation of applications. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Agency has reviewed the data submission needs for the SNAP and FIFRA pesticide amendment/registration process and found no significant overlap. Because there is so little overlap, the Agency requires that a submitter requesting review under both SNAP and the Office of Pesticide Programs' (OPP) pesticide amendment/registration process submit all information ordinarily required for the OPP process as well as a fully completed SNAP information form. A copy of the FIFRA form should be submitted to OPP, and a copy of the SNAP form should be submitted to the SNAP Coordinator. The SNAP form can be obtained from the SNAP program. For further guidance, SNAP submitters may also consult the SNAP Guidance Manual, which is available from the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a registrant is submitting an amendment to a product registration under FIFRA that currently contains a class I or II substance, he or she should note in section II (``Amendment Information'') of the FIFRA form that the amendment was filed in response to the CAA production phase-out. Similarly, if a registrant is submitting an application for a new pesticide registration that would otherwise have been based on a class I or II compound, he or she should note in Section II of the FIFRA form that the registration includes a class I or II substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

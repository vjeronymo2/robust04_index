			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When credit is overdue In a recent Briefcase reply, you said all Commonwealth citizens were entitled to a personal allowance to set against dividend income in the UK. I am a British citizen with full rights of residence in the UK and my husband also is British. But since my marriage 27 years ago, I have been resident and ordinarily resident in Switzerland. I have a small income from UK investments amounting to about Pounds 2,000 a year and I have claimed back tax above the 15 per cent withholding tax each year. It appears that I might have been entitled to claim back the withholding tax as well. If this is so, how far back can I claim? Yes, you have been entitled to payment of the whole of the tax credit on your UK dividends after April 5 1990 because your personal allowance is Pounds 3,005 for 1990-91, Pounds 3,295 for 1991-92, and Pounds 3,445 for 1992-93 to 1994-95. Write to the foreign dividends office to which you have submitted your claims and ask it to transfer your file to the international claims office (with a request that it sends you forms for section 278(2)(a) supplementary claims for 1990-91 onwards). The rules were different before April 6 1990. Whether any further refunds are due for 1988-89 and 1989-90 (which is as far back as you can go, under the general six-year time limit) depends upon your husband's world-wide income. It seems unlikely that anything further will, in fact, prove to be due for those two early years. You could ask also for a copy of the free booklet IR 20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

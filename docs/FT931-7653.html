			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cost-cuts help Sapporo to 18.2% rise SAPPORO Breweries, a leading Japanese food and beverage company, yesterday reported a rise in profits for the year to December on firm beer sales and aggressive cost-cutting. The company posted an 18.2 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y10.7bn (Dollars 90m) on a 3.5 per cent increase in sales to Y551.7bn. The company's operating profits surged 96.4 per cent to Y12.6bn. Sapporo said it cut costs by Y6.1bn in marketing and other areas. It also gained Y11.3bn in its sale of securities holdings and recorded evaluation losses on its securities portfolio of Y5.5bn. However, the company's after-tax profits fell 9.4 per cent to Y3.6bn due to a rise in extraordinary losses caused by the liquidation of its can-manufacturing subsidiary.</p>

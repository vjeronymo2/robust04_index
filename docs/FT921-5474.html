			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Alcatel/ITT Alcatel-Alsthom's purchase of ITT's minority stake in its telecoms subsidiary is a logical conclusion to what was always couched as a medium-term venture. On the face of it both parties benefit, ITT because it is realising a Dollars 400m net profit, Alcatel because it can now consolidate all the earnings of its most profitable division. On closer inspection, though, Alcatel looks to have done the better of the two. It is buying the stake at a multiple of around 12 times this year's earnings. The generous structure of the cash payments should mean Alcatel will avoid any dilution when it reports its 1991 results a month from now. In addition, ITT's promise to hold its new shares for five years gives the group a useful defensive edge. It is perhaps thus less surprising that Alcatel's shares responded with a robust rise. In the race between Europe's telecoms giants the gap between it and Siemens and the likes of Ericsson is becoming ever wider.</p>

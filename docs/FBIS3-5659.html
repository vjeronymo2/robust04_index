It  was a timely observation. Vietnam is among the emerging  economies where Singapore companies and individuals have moved  in aggressively to take advantage of business opportunities.  But if long-term investor interest is to continue, Vietnam must  speed up the pace of its market reform. With the U.S. trade  embargo now lifted, essentially this means putting in place the  legal and financial systems that will promote investment. The  stakes are high. The investment pool overseas -- Vietnamese  firms and individuals-- number over two million, concentrated in  France, Australia, and the United States. They are keen to  invest in their homeland but only as market opportunities  broaden.    This essentially means reform of Vietnam's institutional  framework. Priority must be given to its moribund banking  industry, which needs to be automated and computerised.  Vietnamese local banks are woefully undercapitalised, with  capital adequacy of just 2 percent of their assets. Foreign  bankers, wary about operating in Vietnam's banking environment,  still regard it as a risky market. One of the biggest threats  to the lending operation of foreign banks is that they are  virtually unprotected and vulnerable in the absence of a  mortgage law. Local banks, however, are able to take out  mortgages against borrowers' assets unlike the foreign banks. A  mortgage law to provide equal protection must be enacted soon.    This is not to say that the reform process has been at a  standstill. The passing of the bankruptcy law is certainly a  welcome first step. Foreign bankers have always harboured the  fear that if a company folded, the banks would have no means to  recover loans. But the general uncertainty has led foreign  banks to confine themselves to the safer business of trade  financing and offshore loans to Vietnamese projects, leaving a  vacuum for financing of vital domestic infrastructure projects.  Above all, Vietnam should also open the market to more foreign  banks. It can only benefit from such a move. The domestic  banks will get an injection of much-needed hard currency when  they team up with foreign banks. The foreign shareholders will  also inject sophisticated banking techniques and  entrepreneurship. As it stands, foreign banks are not  restricted from setting up wholly-owned branches -- there are  currently nine foreign bank branches in the country. But  Vietnam's State Bank, which is the central bank, is too slow in  issuing licences. As a result, only one licence was issued for  the whole of last year, and that was to Standard Chartered. The  pace of change must quicken. Vietnam, after decades of war,  must maintain the momentum of regulatory reform if it is to  achieve its objective of becoming the new Asian tiger early in  the next century.</p>

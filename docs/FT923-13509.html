			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Sarajevo food aid gives way to fighting BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA was last night engulfed in fresh fighting just hours after a United Nations relief convoy for the first time brought food into the Sarajevo suburb of Dobrinja, besieged by Serb forces for three months. As soon as the supplies were delivered to the 40,000 inhabitants trapped between the airport and the Serb-controlled western suburb of Ilidza, the ceasefire broke down. The renewed shelling of Dobrinja, an ethnically-mixed suburb giving direct access from Ilidza to the airport, coincided with an escalation of fighting throughout the republic. In the eastern town of Gorazde, Serb irregulars stepped up their 90-day siege by sending in tanks and heavy artillery. The aim is 'ethnic cleansing' of the town's 35,000 inhabitants, 70 per cent of them Moslem, to make it part of the Serbian-dominated region of eastern Bosnia. Elsewhere Belgrade radio reported that Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army, had regained control of the northern town of Odzak, which forces from Croatia had captured a week ago. Croatian radio denied the report. Belgrade radio also reported that Serb forces had started to attack Mostar, the capital of the largely Croat-inhabited region of western Hercegovina, which last week was declared 'a state within a state' by Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats and an ally of Croatian president Franjo Tudjman. Mr Tudjman last night called on the international community to intervene, while Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic again said food relief convoys, while welcome, would not stop the killing, or stop the republic from being divided along ethnic lines. Western diplomats said ships sent by Nato, or backed by the Western European Union, to control the Adriatic as a means of tightening sanctions against Serbia would 'not have the slightest effect'. 'The killing is getting worse. There is no political will to stop the fighting,' a senior US diplomat said. Serbs step up pressure, Page 3</p>

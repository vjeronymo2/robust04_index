			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Aerospatiale to announce 1,000 job cuts AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aerospace company which has a 37.9 per cent shareholding in Airbus, is expected to announce 1,000 job cuts today as a result of declining defence helicopter and commercial aircraft business, writes Paul Betts. The company's guided weapons business has been badly hit in recent months. Job losses are also expected at Eurocopter, the joint venture with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany. The Airbus decision to trim production is also affecting Aerospatiale's commercial aircraft workload.</p>

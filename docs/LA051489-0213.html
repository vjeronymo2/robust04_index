			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Terns Return -- The endangered California least tern has come back to the Bolsa  Chica wetlands, with 13 nests spotted May 8 on the estuary's south island by  state Fish and Game biologists. That compares to 36 nests counted on May 6,  1988.  </P> <P> "We're a little slow compared to last year," said Esther Burkett, Fish and Game  unit biologist for north Orange County. But Burkett and her colleagues counted  at least 40 adult least terns in the wetland reserve, which means there should  be more nesting activity soon.  </P> <P> In the coming week, "the least terns should be in full fling," Burkett said. In  addition, nesting activity by elegant and Caspian terns was viewed on Bolsa  Chica's north island. Elegant and Caspian are among several species of tern --  and the closely related black skimmer -- that have been expanding their  breeding range northward in recent years, to the surprise and delight of  biologists, ornithologists and birding hobbyists.  </P> <P> Also nesting in Bolsa Chica are endangered Belding's savannah sparrows. The  tiny bird hides its eggs in the pickleweed, so Burkett urges visitors to the  Bolsa Chica to stay on the boardwalk and trails to avoid accidentally crushing  a nest. Dogs, which can spell disaster for the ground-nesting birds of the  reserve, are strictly forbidden.  </P> <P> In the coming weeks, visitors should be able to spot chicks of such shore bird  species as the black-necked stilt and the American avocet. "It's a pretty neat  time to be out," Burkett said. "There's a lot happening right now."  </P></p>

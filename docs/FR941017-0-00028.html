			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the Task Force's review, Treasury determined that, while Section 103.29 remains a useful deterrent, its required records, informally referred to as $3,000 logs, had been requested and used infrequently by law enforcement. Because Section 103.29 does not specify the format in which the $3,000 logs should be maintained, law enforcement use of the logs is labor intensive. Log information must be retrieved manually and computerized. This is a cumbersome process which, when weighed against other immediate leads in the hands of law enforcement, such as suspicious transaction reports, criminal referrals and informants, may have discouraged requests for the $3,000 logs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury has evaluated the cost of compliance with the $3,000 log requirement to financial institutions against its benefits to the law enforcement community. Treasury believes that Section 103.29 imposes an expensive and time-consuming burden on financial institutions and that its recordkeeping requirements can be reduced substantially without compromising its deterrent effect or utility to law enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reaching this determination, Treasury consulted with the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (Advisory Group), a committee comprising 30 representatives from the financial services industry, trades and businesses, and state and federal government. The Advisory Group stated that the financial institution's resources could be more effectively devoted to the detection and reporting of suspicious transactions and implementation of ``know your customer'' programs and procedures. Treasury expects to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining the elements of anti-money laundering programs, including ``know your customer'' policies and procedures incorporating, among other things, verification of identity when establishing a customer relationship, and suspicious transaction reporting. In light of these initiatives, Treasury has determined that Section 103.29 should be modified to lessen the amount of information that must be obtained and recorded and to permit retention of this information in records kept in the ordinary course of business, in a manner consistent with the record systems that may already exist in financial institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recordkeeping Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rule requires deposit accountholders' financial institutions when issuing or selling a bank check or draft, cashier's check, money order or traveler's check for $3,000 or more in currency to obtain and maintain records of: the name of the purchaser; the date of purchase; and, the type(s), serial number, and the amount in dollars of each of the instrument(s) purchased. The financial institution must verify that the purchaser is a deposit accountholder and has been identified previously, or verify his or her identity and record the method of verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new rule requires a financial institution issuing or selling the same monetary instruments to a person that does not have a deposit account to obtain and maintain records of: the name, address, social security or alien identification number and date of birth of the purchaser; the date of purchase; and, the type(s), serial number and the amount in dollars of each of the instrument(s) purchased. The financial institution must verify the purchaser's identity and record the method of verification and specific identifying information ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  state of issuance and number of driver's license).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financial institutions must continue to treat contemporaneous purchases by an individual as one purchase. Multiple purchases by an individual must also still be treated as one purchase if they are known to the financial institution. Information to be maintained may be recorded on copies of, or other records relating to, the instruments purchased. All records must still be maintained for five years and made available to the Secretary upon request at any time. As with all records required to be maintained under the BSA, the records must be filed or stored in a way as to be accessible within a reasonable period of time. Section 103.38.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much of the information, required formerly to be kept in centralized chronological logs, is available generally in account or other records, or on the originals or copies of the monetary instruments. These copies, along with other records kept in the ordinary course of business, may satisfy the requirements of this Final Rule and may be kept in any format. These records must be accessible within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the nature of the record, and the amount of time expired since the record was made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA'S DEFENSE HUMBLES FOOTHILL  </P> <P> With a share of the Century League lead on the line, Santa Ana and Foothill  high schools played a rough and tumble game Friday. Santa Ana got rough and  Foothill tumbled.  </P> <P> The Saint defense was in top form, while the offense picked its spots in a 21-6  victory in front of 3,000 at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> The victory kept alive the Saints' hopes of a fourth consecutive league  championship. They will be no worse than tied for first place with either Villa  Park or Santa Ana Valley, who play tonight.  </P> <P> It was also the fourth consecutive year that Santa Ana (7-2 overall, 3-1 in  league play) had defeated Foothill. Only a week ago, the Knights (4-5, 2-2)  were on top of the league with a 2-0 record, but back-to-back losses to Santa  Ana Valley and Santa Ana have left their playoff hopes in jeopardy.  </P> <P> The victory was secured by a fierce defense, which limited Foothill to 20 yards  passing and 153 total yards.  </P> <P> Knight quarterback John Shanahan completed only four of 19 passes. But, in his  defense, he had little time to throw.  </P> <P> Shanahan did pick up 60 yards rushing, but most of that was gained while  running away from pass rushers. He was sacked three times, twice by Oswaldo  Guerra.  </P> <P> The Saint defense gave the offense time to right itself after a sluggish start.  Santa Ana let a couple of opportunities get away early in the game.  </P> <P> The Saints finally took the lead just before halftime on a 16-yard touchdown  pass from Jesse Rosas to Gus Valencia.  </P> <P> "We were getting nowhere running the ball," Rosas said. "I told the coaches we  should throw more. Going into the game, I was expecting to throw more. Once we  started doing that, everything was fine."  </P> <P> Rosas loosened up the Foothill defense. He completed 7 of 13 passes for only  105 yards, but threw for 2 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Rosas also rushed for 62 yards, including a crucial 46-yard run that set up the  Saints second touchdown.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, Foothill's Nick Sanfilippo recovered a Rosas fumble on  the 17 and, six plays later, Shanahan scored on a 6-yard run to cut the Saint  lead to 7-6.  </P> <P> Foothill appeared to have the Saints stopped on their next possession. But, on  third down, Rosas burst up the middle on a quarterback draw for 46 yards to the  Foothill 32. Rosas capped the drive with a 10-yard fade pass to Octavio Medina,  who made an over-the-shoulder catch in the back of the end zone.  </P></p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Paris offers 2,000 troops for Rwanda: Italy may also be ready to help stop the slaughter France told the Western European Union defence group yesterday it was ready to send troops to stop the ethnic slaughter in Rwanda but apart from a half promise from Italy won no immediate pledges of support from other allies. France told a meeting of ambassadors from the nine-nation WEU in Brussels it was ready to send a battalion and reinforce it up to a level of 2,000 troops if necessary, diplomats said. Italy said it would not exclude sending troops, but made no firm commitment. Mr Willem van Eekelen, WEU Secretary-General, said after the meeting ambassadors would meet again on Tuesday to assess which countries were ready to make a contribution to the mission. He said the WEU would coordinate any operation rather than run it directly and that there was agreement that any mission would have to be carried out with United Nations approval. His comments follow pressure from France for African and European partners to intervene in Rwanda to stop continued killing there. Graphic pictures and accounts of the massacre of thousands of people brought back by French television and visiting ministers, have helped spur France into action, as well as frustration that a month after a UN resolution authorising a new UN force, there is still no sign of it getting anywhere near Rwanda. France has intervened in Rwanda before. It sent in 600 soldiers in 1990 to stop the Hutus and Tutsis killing each other and broker a power sharing arrangement. This eventually bore fruit in last year's Arusha accords, an investment of French diplomatic and military effort that Paris evidently does not now want to see wasted. To avoid charges of acting in a maverick or neo-colonial manner, France is keen to persuade other Europeans to join it in sending troops. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur told the leaders of Benin and Mauritius that French intervention would be strictly humanitarian, designed to bring some calm and food to the country before handing over to planned UN reinforcements. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, was meanwhile on visits to Ivory Coast and Senegal. Paris hopes that Senegal, which has already offered troops to the UN force, might be ready to send them earlier, under some sort of new UN resolution covering the French initiative. France would like UN authority under Chapter 7 of its charter; this would allow intervention without the approval of all sides to a conflict that is required under Chapter 6 and has so far stymied the arrival of the new UN force. General Paul Kagame, commander of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), reiterated yesterday his opposition to intervention by France, because it had trained the Hutu-dominated government forces. The French government yesterday strongly denied French soldiers may have shot down President Julien Habyarima's plane on April 6, the incident that triggered the violence.</p>

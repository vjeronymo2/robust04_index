			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / London trails on economic growth GREATER London will perform worse than any other UK region this year in terms of economic growth, while Wales will lead the way to recovery, according to National Westminster Bank. The bank warns in a report that growth will be 'very modest' over the next five years, with unemployment expected to fall only slowly from a peak of 3.25m at the end of this year. It says demand will be constrained by several negative factors including large fiscal and trade deficits, high consumer debts and worries about job insecurity. The bank's economists say economic activity in Greater London will increase by only 0.4 per cent this year, compared with the 0.9 per cent growth expected for the UK as a whole. Wales will be the fastest growing region, with its economy expanding by 1.1 per cent. Growth in the UK as a whole next year will be 2 per cent, the report says, with East Anglia, the east Midlands, the south-west and Wales expanding faster than other regions at between 2.2 per cent and 2.4 per cent. The weakest region next year in terms of growth is expected to be Northern Ireland, which the bank believes will see output increase by just 1.6 per cent. Between 1993 and 1997 Yorkshire and Humberside will be among the leaders in regions experiencing relatively fast growth, the report says. Banks will find little demand from companies for loans during the next few years because of fears about economic prospects, says a report by Lloyds Bank. It adds that many businesses are likely to continue shutting down parts of their operations rather than expanding them. Economic and Financial Outlook, March 1993.

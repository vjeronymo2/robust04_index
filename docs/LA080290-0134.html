			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WANTED: POSITIVE IMAGE FOR A VALLEY WITHOUT ONE  </P> <P> Two years and more than $40,000 ago, a coalition of San Gabriel Valley cities  started desperately seeking an image.  </P> <P> The search is still on, but the region's would-be spin doctors crept a bit  closer to their goal Tuesday, with the issuance of a final report by the San  Gabriel Valley Image Project Task Force.  </P> <P> The task force, formed of city officials nine months ago, grew out of a  consultants study commissioned in 1988 that recommended an all-out effort to  promote the area as a desirable place to live, work and invest.  </P> <P> Tuesday's report paves the way for a new nonprofit organization to come up with  an image-making strategy. The organization is expected to be incorporated this  week, and will be headed by a 10-member board of directors, including city  officials, developers and investors, said Richard Zimmer, president of the  Synthesis Group, the task force's consulting firm.  </P> <P> Zimmer said the organization's initial budget is $141,500, including funding  for a management firm, brochures, pamphlets, videos and a business development  center.  </P> <P> According to the report, participating cities are expected to pay $78,000 for  the first year of operation, and the business sector's share is estimated at  $63,500.  </P> <P> Alhambra, Baldwin Park, Duarte, Irwindale, Monrovia, San Marino, South Pasadena  and West Covina are expected to take part.  </P> <P> There have, however, been a few dropouts since the original survey was  commissioned in 1988. Azusa is one.  </P> <P> "The project does have merit," Azusa City Administrator Fred Diaz said. "But at  this point in time, the council is interested in social programs for youths."  FRANKI V.

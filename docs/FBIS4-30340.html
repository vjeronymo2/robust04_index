			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0109 GMT on 26 June, during its regular "Sunday  Discussion" program carries a live interview with Kozo Watanabe,  deputy secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] from  the NHK studio in Tokyo. Watanabe is interviewed by Takashi  Yamamoto, NHK commentator, and Naoki Tanaka, noted economic  commentator.    Asked by Yamamoto to comment on Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's  resignation, Watanabe says it was an inevitable choice by the  minority government. He explains that at the moment, the  coalition parties would rather take a wait-and-see attitude on  how the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] will react, and would not actively seek to  regain political power.    Answering Tanaka's question on what caused the failure of  the  Hata administration, while Watanabe admits that the issue of the  "Kaishin" group was not handled properly, he emphasizes that the  administration as a whole, and Hata personally, were not at  fault, and even claims that the resignation itself "has not  damaged Mr. Hata's reputation in any way."    However, when asked by Yamamoto if Shinseito is actually  expecting Hata to be reelected as prime minister, Watanabe  denies this, saying the sole reason behind the resignation was  Hata's desire not to create a political vacuum when the Naples  Summit is held in July, as in the case of the summit last year.  He also stresses the importance of talking with the SDPJ at  this point.    As to Shinseito's strategy in dealing with the present  political situation, Watanabe refuses to go into detail, saying  Shinseito will decide on this after looking at how the LDP and  SDPJ react. He expresses a willingness to talk with all  political parties, except the Japan Communist Party. He also  denies reports that Shinseito actually wants to form an alliance  with certain forces both in the LDP and SDPJ to effect a general  reconfiguration of political forces immediately. However, he  does not deny political realignment is a future goal if  Shinseito and the other coalition parties become the opposition,  and a general election is held.    Turning to the possibility of forming an alliance with  rebellious LDP and SDPJ members to form a new majority  government, Watanabe replies indirectly: "In politics, it is  important for people who have similar political ideals and  policy concepts to work together. I believe many SDPJ members  seriously want to promote political reform and to create  politics for a new era. There are also such people in the LDP.  I think it is important to form a new political force for the  next era with such people."    Asked by Tanaka if such an alliance is likely to materialize  before the next prime minister is elected, Watanabe admits that  the present situation is such that no one can tell what will  happen next. However, he terms the present confusion as labor  pains preceding the birth of new political norms.    The interview ends at 1020 GMT.</p>

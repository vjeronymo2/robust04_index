			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (11): Our ideas for your investment - Biotechnology companies are carefully choosing research areas which have the highest appeal to potential funders It is difficult to trust anyone when trying to assess the promise of biotechnology research and development. The reason lies in the nature of the biotechnology industry, not as a scientific enterprise but as a capital-raising machine. Biotechnology is usually defined as drug development and manufacture using living organisms rather than inanimate chemicals. But as almost any biotechnogy company executive will eventually concede, biotech R&amp;D in the private sector is as much a means for raising funds as pushing the frontiers of knowledge. How it is presented therefore, is coloured not only by the objective standards of a peer-review scientific journal, but also by the more old-fashioned need to persuade those with money to hand it over. It takes at least seven years for a potential drug to go from the laboratory bench to the market. During that period, the company must secure enough capital to pay for salaries, clinical trials, regulatory fees and marketing. According to Mr Steven Burrill, of San Francisco merchant bank Burrill and Craves, the 1,400 or so companies that make up the US biotechnology industry alone need Dollars 5bn a year to survive. That cash comes from from venture capitalists, money and securities markets and large pharmaceuticals companies seeking smaller partners. Each has many demands on its cash and management resources, especially now, when healthcare reforms around the world add a new level of uncertainty to the business of researching and developing new drugs. But there is much that a biotech company can do in R&amp;D management to raise its bargaining power with the suppliers of capital. Foremost, it can choose carefully the areas of research which appeal to investors. In principle, it wants to research into diseases which: have a high profile, so that a typical investor is familiar with at least its name; which can be treated by a relatively small number of specialists - biotechnology companies cannot afford to have large sales teams knocking on the doors of the western world's general practitioners. Mr David Robinson, chief executive officer of San Diego, California, company Ligand Pharmaceuticals, says that his company chose to work in cancer therapy partly there are a relatively small number of treatment centres in the US, so 'you only need a sales force of 50'; which has clear end points to a course of treatment, such as complete recovery, rather than marginal improvement. This makes the results of clinical trials less equivocal, which in turn is likely to shorten both the time taken to complete the trials and the deliberations of regulatory authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration. At Cor Therapeutics of south San Francisco, work is being carried out on a drug called 'Integrilin,' which is used to try to prevent the dangerous complications that arise from a heart treatment called angioplasty. 'The trials are done on a 30-day time frame,' says Mr Vaughan Kailian, president and chief executive officer. '(Assessing) Integrilin is relatively easy because of its clear endpoints.' If the patient is more likely to emerge from the 30 day period without life threatening complications, the use of the drug can be deemed a success; which affects not just the elderly - there are powerful economic and ethical reasons for regulatory authorities to speed the approval of treatments that affect children and people of working age. It is widely recognised that cancer drugs progress relatively rapidly through the approvals process, even in the face of, for example, evidence of severe side effects. Only a handful of illnesses meet these criteria, so it should not be surprising that biotech companies usually work on projects aimed at treating at least one of three conditions: Aids, heart disease and cancer. The formula is not foolproof against the rigours of scientific research. In the 1980s, several biotech companies began research programmes into septic shock, a condition which meets all four of the above criteria for securing funding. In financial terms the research programmes were successful. Money poured into the companies involved, and three US biotech operations, Centocor, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Xoma, of Berkeley, California, and Synergen of Boulder, Colorado saw their market capitalisations rise to a combined total of Dollars 4.5bn two years ago. Since then, their potential septic shock drugs have met with serious problems in clinical trials and today the three companies' combined market capitalisation is less than Dollars 1bn. Such setbacks are more than just a jolt for the biotech company concerned and for potential patient beneficiaries of a successful drug. They are used by the suppliers of biotech capital as evidence that the risks are very high and therefore as a lever to wring concessions out of the companies in return for that capital. The large pharmaceutical companies in particular are keen to extract concessions in the form of increased rights to market any drug developed. Mr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president of clinical research of the US company, Schering-Plough, argues that the biotechnology companies want to keep too much in the way of marketing rights for drugs that are still in the early stages of research and development. 'We need to go for the innovative (in biotech companies): those products that are going to take care of needs that haven't been covered yet,' he says. 'That's going to be a more risky investment. And we're being told: 'Don't expect that you can get the rewards. We expect you to make the investment but we'll decide how much you can get in return.'' He warns that, as a consequence, 'pharmaceutical companies like ours or any other big pharmaceutical company are going to be a lot more cautious in what type of investments (they make).' Some large drug companies have already scaled back their involvement in biotechnology on the basis that the risks are simply too great. 'Why produce drugs through biotech, when you can make the compounds through classical chemistry?' asks Mr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D director of Elf-Sanofi, the French drugs company. 'For the next few years, we will try to mimic the products of biotechnology through classical chemistry.' In private, few heads of large drug companies agree with Mr Simon. They say that in practice, investing in biotechnology companies is more than just buying into a possible new drug. 'Biotech company employees have a dedication and enthusiasm as well as talent and the desire to work long hours that is hard to find in a large organisation,' concedes one. And the arguments in favour of the promise of biotechnology R&amp;D seem slowly to be gaining the upper hand. Ten years ago, deals between biotech companies and their big drugs company partners usually saw the exchange of all marketing rights to biotech research programmes for capital and a promise of royalty payments should a drug be successful. The formula was not popular among biotech companies for two reasons: Much of the 'financial upside' of developing a popular medication is being able to benefit from profit margins in manufacturing and sales. As a drug progresses through the sequence of clinical trials towards approval, its value increases sharply. Selling rights later, rather than sooner, can earn a lot more money for a small company Ms Jane Shaw, the chief operating officer of one of the few biotechnology companies to have made it to consistent profitability, Alza of Palo Alto, California, says that times have changed. It used to be hard to secure a deal for anything other than a royalty arrangement, she says, but today she can view 'royalties (as) somewhat limiting. We can now take higher risks for higher rewards.' The compromise is for a biotech company to sell only limited marketing rights in return for the capital injection. Glaxo of the UK, for example, has a five per cent stake in Gilead Sciences of California. Gilead has a number of compounds in the late stages of development, but Glaxo has no rights to them. 'Glaxo is sharing co-promotion rights but only in code-blockers (which are still in the earliest stages of research),' says Mr Michael Riordan, chief executive officer. Biotech research and development is a battleground. One the one hand are the small biotechnology companies which have ideas, expertise and energy but not cash or marketing power. On the other hand are the large cash-rich pharmaceuticals companies with huge sales forces, yet struggling to maintain morale in the face of healthcare reforms and job cuts. The biotech companies want to give away as few of their ideas as possible in return for the greatest investment they can secure. The pharmaceutical companies want to secure as many rights - preferably global rights - in return for a large stake and limited cash commitment. The balance of power is shifting only slowly, and the skirmishing goes on.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                Pay scales in the biotechnology industry          Average compensations for chief executive officers*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                Base     Annual      Potential size                 salary      bonus  share options                                                 value  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Small               dollars    dollars        dollars                     161,000     51,700      1,530,400 Mid-size            dollars    dollars        dollars                     216,000     59,000      1,132,800 Large               dollars    dollars        dollars                     235,800     67,900        842,700 Top-tier            dollars    dollars        dollars                     293,300    117,700      3,510,100  --------------------------------------------------------------------- In the US, 54 per cent of chief executive officers in the biotechnology sector received a cash incentive in 1992, which averaged dollars73,000; also, 61 per cent received option grants, reported at face value - the number of options times the the exercise price; 21 per cent of CEOs exercised shares in 1992, realising option gains (appreciation) of dollars1,359,400.

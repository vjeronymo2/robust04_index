			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Gardening: Magnificent magnolia THIS WEEKEND sees the abrupt end of the yearly return on my garden's longest-running investment. I do not mean the swimming pool, which has now drowned its yearly quota of hedgehogs and is staying open in the hope of drowning a few squirrels. I mean my magnolia. Magnolia grandiflora has opened, flowered and turned brown, leaving me wondering if the wait has been worth it. Experts have no doubt. In his classic book, The Well Tempered Garden, Christopher Lloyd writes that this magnolia: 'is the shrub for whose sake any outmoded old parsonage, however riddled with dry rot, should be acquired with enthusiastic pride.' In my case the old vicarage came first, then the dry rot, and then the magnolia. I am a magnolia missionary, and missionaries usually have been converted, too. Twenty-two years ago, I was converted by a single grandiflora which had grown to the eaves of a great Elizabethan manor of pinkish stone in Somerset, where it released occasional flowers from the candle-shaped buds. the Elizabethans would never have seen a grandiflora. Its home is in the American south and it did not arrive in west country gardens until the early 18th century (although another fine evergreen, Virginia, got to England before 1700 and can still be seen in quantity in Florida, even on swampy ground). Grandiflora also migrated to the Mediterranean. Perhaps it occurred only in the 19th century. It certainly suited the migrant. In England, a grandiflora may produce one flower to every square yard of greenery. In Italy, they are mesmeric, growing freely in the open to the height of tall trees in the parks of great villas from the Veneto to Tuscany. In England, we have to wait for flowers until summer and, even then, they appear only if you have observed an essential warning. Grandifloras grow freely from seed, but seedlings vary and, in Britain, most refuse to flower. Christopher Lloyd referred in 1970 to one seedling, probably aged 50, which had still to flower for the first time. The only way to buy a grandiflora is to buy one grown from a cutting off a proven flowerer. Cheap stock is useless. I had often suspected that the Italians would simply sow seed and get away with it in their hotter sunshine. But as you drive from Pisa airport into Florence your first, fine foreign impressions are the nurseries which grow big grandifloras, trees which the great Italian artists never saw. I did my homework six years ago. In his useful book Three Gardens, the great plantsman, Graham Thomas, prefaces his usual lists of plants with chapters of brief reminiscences. He describes the evergreen magnolia which had been picked for his new garden: it was a newcomer, called Maryland. Even in its second year, it was bearing several flowers. 'There was I,' says Thomas, 'revelling in the lemon fragrance of great globes of cream, with no need to administer potash or any other plant medicine.' In 1988, I ordered my Maryland, paid a suitably high price and put it, facing south, between two windows. Maryland is not a pure grandiflora but it has the best of both American bloodlines. One parent is grandiflora, the other Virginia. It is a southerner on both sides of the blanket but, nonetheless, it is supposed to flower before all others. After three years, I started to notice growth, not flower. Thomas did refer to 'great bulk' for Marylands of the future, although his check-list indicates only 'eight feet by seven feet.' In its sixth season, mine is 10ft high already, bulging forwards, branching sideways, and grating testily against the windows whenever the wind moves the side branches. Everybody is adamant that these magnolias should not be pruned, and Lloyd even says owners should sit indoors in gloom rather than cut their way out. In the fifth year I had one flower, and this year we have gone ex-dividend at three, which I would represent as a tripling of output if I was writing a report for the market. But this result is not Maryland as Thomas describes it. Like many others, I think I have bought Exmouth, although they asked for it and I did not. Exmouth is a respectable senior citizen: the first batch of grandifloras in England all died in frost late in the 1730s, and one of the few which re-established was in an Exmouth garden in Devon. At the time, nurserymen travelled happily to pay five guineas for a slice of the tree. Exmouth is supposed to flower within seven years, so I suppose that mine could be warming up. Meanwhile, what can we all do about that persistent problem, reluctance to flower on this great evergreen? Perhaps you own a seedling from the past which has virtually no intentions of flowering. If so, you should curse the previous owner and decide if you are sufficiently fond of leaves alone. Otherwise, you can try heavy dressings of potash, applied in springtime, or some artful pruning. It is no use cutting back the top growth because you will only stimulate more growth and delay its ripening into wood for flowers. Instead, you might try ringing. You should cut away a strip of outer bark, about a  1/2 in wide, near the base of the tree and run it three-quarters of the way round the trunk. The job is best done early in the year as its aim is to prevent too much sap from rising and forming leaves, not flowers, above. The strip should not be taken too deeply, and on no account should you continue the ring right round the trunk and allow the ends to meet. Otherwise, you will cut off sap altogether. The final option is to be more insistent than I was and to profit from the intervening years of demand. Maryland is scarce but sometimes available, and if you insist on seeing it and having it verified, you might be looking at cream globes in 1996. If you start the hunt, do not let the price deter you: if you track the right variety, you are saving yourself between five and 20 years' delay. It is no use complaining at the price of a short-cut to one of the best scents in the world.</p>

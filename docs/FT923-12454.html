			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: NS and trusts I NOTE in the prospectus for various National Savings products that there is provision for trust holding. Can I become a holder acting as a trustee for my wife as beneficiary, and will she be able to receive the income from such trust holdings up to the personal allowance level without liability for tax? I do not wish such income to be regarded as mine by the Inland Revenue. My reasons for wanting to act as trustee is to invest and administer capital on her behalf to generate income and to minimise tax and administrative involvement for her. She will have no taxable earnings apart from the proposed investment income. We recommend that your wife's investments be held by her in her own name. The arrangement which you have in mind would be likely to provoke an attack by the Inland Revenue under section 674a of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, under which the income could be deemed to be yours.</p>

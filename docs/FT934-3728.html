			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / EU seeks to open up postal services Telecommunications ministers of the European Union yesterday called for formal legislation to open up European postal services to competition, while safeguarding common service standards for all customers. The ministers asked the European Commission to produce draft legislation before July next year, but they steered clear of the sensitive subject of which postal services should be protected from competition. They said the Commission should come up with a definition of these 'reserved' services, which could include basic domestic letter services. Ministers also sidestepped the issue of exactly what should constitute a basic minimum telephone service after 1998, when the EU telecoms sector is completely liberalised. Preparatory discussions between national officials had revealed sharp differences of opinion between member states, such as Britain, which wanted competition to be introduced into most sectors of the market, and others which wanted to draw up a wider list of universal services to which all customers have a right. A compromise resolution approved yesterday will include a list of minimum services already defined in other EU telecoms legislation. The actual services supplied as a right to customers will be defined by the governments themselves. The resolution says consumers will be entitled to 'a defined minimum service of specified quality . . . and, in the light of specific national conditions, at a reasonable price'. Separately, ministers threw their weight behind a group of television manufacturers, broadcasters and satellite operators who are working on new standards for digital television broadcasts in the EU. Ministers yesterday said common digital broadcasting standards were essential to the development of the new technology, which promises more channels and greater flexibility for consumers. But they said digital television would be 'market-led'. The group was formed by the German Telecoms Ministry in the aftermath of the debacle over the Commission's original plans for the development of analogue high-definition television, which foundered when broadcasters did not follow the transmission standards laid down by the member states. The EU strategy - watered down in the face of opposition from the UK to extensive funding - is now based on the encouragement of wide-screen television programmes and transmissions. References to set satellite transmission standards will be excised from an earlier directive.</p>

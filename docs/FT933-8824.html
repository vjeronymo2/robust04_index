			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: Training grabs the attention Many corporate videos are synonymous with the corporate snooze: 20 minutes of largely irrelevant ramblings which have to be tolerated in order to glean one or two pieces of useful information. Many are already out of date just a few months after being produced. The result? Many a corporate video quickly ends up with the last batch of company slides - gathering dust on the shelf. 'There must be a minimum of 500,000 businesses that have produced audio-visual material in the past four to five years,' says Mike Smith, managing director of Bradford-based YPL Communications. 'I bet 490,000 of them are not being used.' Smith's company specialises in training material and corporate presentations on the latest electronic media: CD-Rom and Laserdisc. The Laserdisc system he promotes, under the acronym of Bra (Barcode random access), allocates a barcode number to each section of the presentation on the disc. By clicking a light pen over the barcode in the accompanying catalogue the presentation jumps to the relevant section. Usually the images appear on a television screen, although the Laserdisc player can be attached to a projector for larger audiences. 'Bra enables you to produce the presentation from scratch or to take old linear videos and put them into the system and provide them with a directory,' says Smith. 'Bra is not particularly good if you need intelligence. CD-I is probably a better system for that.' One Laserdisc can incorporate 36 minutes of video, 54,000 slides or a combination of the two. Each disc has a dual soundtrack - one could be in a foreign language to promote overseas sales. One of YPL's most prominent customers is the Patent Office, for which YPL has installed 170 systems. The disc is used in conjunction with a work book to explain how the patent system works. Smith believes that at a cost of under Pounds 10,000 to put ageing slides and video on disc, many small businesses are overlooking the chance to make substantial business impact.</p>

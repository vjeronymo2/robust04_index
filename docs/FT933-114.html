			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: MGN shares sale nets Pounds 358m NEARLY TWO years after Mr Robert Maxwell's body was found in the sea, Mirror Group Newspapers has become an orthodox public company with a wide range of institutional shareholders. More than 100 separate institutions put in bids for blocks of shares under the bookbuilding exercise run by Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, joint administrator to Robert Maxwell Group, the main private Maxwell vehicle. Yesterday Mr Talbot announced that all 219.68m shares on offer - 54.8 per cent of the total - had been sold at 170p. This was a little less than some analysts had forecast but a figure that is still seen as a considerable achievement. The MGN flotation in May 1991 was set at a price of 125p but the shares fell as low as 50p before gradually climbing back after a period of suspension. The shares closed at 177p on Tuesday and yesterday fell 7p to 170p after sale. In a formal statement Mr Talbot said yesterday: 'The strength of the institutional demand for MGN shares has permitted the sale of the entire holding in MGN at an attractive price and we have completed the international offering earlier than anticipated.' The sale will raise a gross figure of Pounds 373m with expenses expected to be about Pounds 15m. The MGN shares were effectively controlled by four banks - National Westminster, Goldman Sachs, Midland and Lloyds - all of which held them as surety for Maxwell loans. The banks are owed about Pounds 295m although the picture is complicated because different banks hold different parcels of shares at different prices. Three of the banks will receive their money back in full, including interest. The offer price was not high enough to cover the loans of one of the banks; believed to be Lloyds. The banks will receive their money within a matter of days but a final settlement for unsecured creditors, including a surplus of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m, will take longer. Some assets of Robert Maxwell Group have still to be sold and a number of claims are likely to be pursued by the administrator on behalf of creditors, including Maxwell pensioners.</p>

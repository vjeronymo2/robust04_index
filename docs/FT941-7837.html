			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Management: An invitation to think afresh - Book Review It says something about the difficulty of describing Charles Handy's latest book that its title is different in Britain and the US. In Britain it is entitled The Empty Raincoat; I read The Age of Paradox*, the version published in the US, in which there were 'several structural changes'. Handy's other published work is hard to describe and this book is no exception - there is no neat bookseller's slot which suits. It is not a textbook and certainly not a business book expounding the latest management fad. I have the same difficulty with Peter Drucker's books. Handy's earlier book, The Age of Unreason, is written by a thinker who wishes to stimulate others to think, hopefully some of them in business. If the management of business is more than just earning a living and if, in the broadest sense, such management must evolve, then the very few writers - Drucker and Handy are two  - who write conceptually and philosophically about business, are precious. Handy has a significant advantage over Drucker because he writes so well. However, The Age of Paradox is not for business people exclusively - that would be much too narrow an audience. If you are part of, think about, care about, or are in any way influenced by the world of work, and who is not, this powerful and moving book is for you. I am now much less comfortable than I was before reading it. If that was his intention, in relation to the management community, then, at least with me, he has succeeded. However, I suspect, honest man that he is, that Handy had no such intention and wrote as he did partly out of some retrospective dissatisfaction with the positiveness of The Age of Unreason. To those who enjoyed this book, beware. The Age of Paradox is a sequel only in the sense that it follows The Age of Unreason in time. The Age of Paradox is deceptively easy to read. The writing is so good and the style so smooth that one is caught up, initially, with sheer enjoyment in the act of reading. It is not until the various propositions, gently advanced, are taken on board that disquiet arises. If, as a manager, one has tried to think larger thoughts to contemplate an end game for one's nation, business or self, then The Age of Paradox is worrying. I recognised a little too much of the corporate me, and did not like what I saw. But what I saw was the truth. That is not to say that, other than for the purposes of this review, I would have turned from the book. On the contrary I was virtually enthralled by it. Some fundamental ideas are advanced. The most compelling is that the organisations in which we work are less and less relevant to the business challenge. It is as if someone, in this case Handy, had directed my attention to a reality which previously, at best, I perceived but dimly. This invitation both to rethink and think afresh is the book's chief appeal. Frequently I wanted to say, in happy surprise: 'That's it] Exactly.' The thought occurred that Handy was writing for his and my generation. I considered whether present generational dissatisfaction might have coloured the book but, by the time I had finished it, I had concluded this was not the case. Age and experience may have contributed, and so they should, but the book's appeal is not to any particular generation. I suspect with some satisfaction that economists will generally dislike the book; all those ideas and insights but no graphs or tables and only a single curve, the Sigmoid. Economists aside, I would prescribe The Age of Paradox particularly for middle managers, university vice-chancellor aspirants and all politicians below 50. This cross section, if they read with open minds, could be helped a little to make a future difference. Finally, I was struck by the book's basic morality. Not judgmental, but putting human concerns before the reader when describing thoughts and concepts which are about people and their behaviour, not about transient organisational structures. The reviewer has been the chairman of several leading British companies. *Published in the US by Harvard Business School Press (Dollars 22.50); in the UK as The Empty Raincoat by Hutchinson (Pounds 12.99)</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Papandreou calls old allies into his cabinet GREECE'S newly elected Socialist prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, yesterday named a cabinet dominated by old political allies from his first term in office. He did not appoint a deputy prime minister, but created a special cabinet post for Mr Antonis Livanis, an adviser who worked closely with him when the Pasok was in power from 1981-89. The post of economy minister went to Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, Pasok's most popular member, but who is suffering from cancer. However, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, a young economist, will be alternate economy minister and is likely to represent Greece at EC finance ministers' meetings. The foreign minister's job went to Mr Carolos Papoulias, a specialist in Balkan affairs, while Mr Theodoros Pangalos got back his old post as alternate foreign minister in charge of EC relations. Ms Melina Mercouri, the actress, returns to head the culture ministry. Mr Papandreou's personal physician, Dr Dimitris Kremastinos, was appointed health minister. Meanwhile, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, outgoing premier, is stepping down as leader of the New Democracy party. Blast from past, Page 16</p>

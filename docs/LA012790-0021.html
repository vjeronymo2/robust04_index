			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCNALL, VACHON GET THEIR NICHOLLS' WORTH OF ADVICE FROM FANS  </P> <P> For the past nine years, I've been pulling my hair out watching Bernie Nicholls  play. He continually turns the puck over in the offensive zone, he seldom looks  to make a pass, and when he does, it is an attempt at perfection that usually  ends in a turnover.  </P> <P> But most frustrating are his half-hearted attempts at back-checking. It seems  when he doesn't have the puck, the game is not quite as important. Throughout  his career, the Kings have allowed more goals than they've scored when Bernie  is on the ice, a rare feat for a top-10 scorer.  </P> <P> My hat is off to Rogie and Bruce for realizing that all five attackers need to  play defense and not just your two defensemen.  </P> <P> DAVID HARTMIRE, North Hollywood  </P></p>

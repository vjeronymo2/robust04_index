			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / BBC audience share hopes 'wildly optimistic' The BBC is 'wildly optimistic' in thinking it could hold on to 30 per cent of the television audience by the end of the century, the Commons national heritage committee warned yesterday. Mr Gerald Kaufman, committee chairman, said the BBC would have to adapt to the coming world of 500 channels otherwise it would 'vanish down the technological plug'. The BBC believes its audience share will fall to about 30 per cent by the end of the decade from the current level of about 40 per cent. Mr Kaufman, launching the committee's report on the future of the BBC, said he did not see any way that the organisation's present structure could be maintained beyond the extension of the royal charter - now being debated. The committee predicted 'a media revolution' - with the television set replacing 'everything from travel brochures and travel agencies to newspapers and the postbox'. In spite of the threat from technology, the committee decided to recommend that the BBC's royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996, should be renewed for a further 10 years. They added 'with great reluctance' that the licence-fee system of financing the BBC had 'the fewest objections to it'. The 10-year extension, Mr Kaufman said, would give 'sufficient time for the BBC to be able to work out a viable and vibrant future for itself'. Future options for the BBC ranged from linking up with a large international media conglomerate to concentrating on programme supply. The committee also emphasised that ways must be found to make the licence fee - at present Pounds 83 a year for colour TV - less of a burden for those on low incomes. Mr Kaufman appealed to the BBC to exercise humanity in prosecuting licence-fee defaulters when it was clear they could not afford to pay. The possibilities include: a lower-cost additional licence for households with more than one television set, a car radio licence or one-off payment for a car radio, large hotels paying a licence for every room beyond 50, and dealer licences being increased from 50p to at least the level of a full licence fee. The National Heritage Committee also advocated that a single complaints body should be set up to deal with every complaint relating to broadcasting. The report was welcomed yesterday by Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, as 'a generous recognition of the BBC's value and achievements'.

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT TASTE OF NUTMEG  </P> <P> Nutmeg is exotic stuff.  </P> <P> You can put it in soup. You can put it in stew. And it's wonderful on spaghetti  or fettuccine.  </P> <P> You can put nutmeg almost anywhere, except behind your ears, and you wouldn't  be doing anything someone hasn't already tried and made popular in another  culture or style of cuisine.  </P> <P> East Indians use it to season meat. Italians love nutmeg sprinkled on cooked  spinach. Germans add it to sausage and Scots grate a little into their  ceremonial haggis. Even the British like a hint in their steak and kidney pie.  </P> <P> It would seem that many of us, who instinctively use it exclusively in eggnog  or spice cake and other baked goods, are beginning to discover the magic of  nutmeg in savory dishes as well.  </P> <P> Until recently, I wouldn't have recognized nutmeg if it weren't ground and  bottled in a little jar, with a nutmeg label on the front. But one whiff of  warm, sweet, spicy nutmeg (freshly grated) and the ground stuff, will  eventually work its way to the back of the cupboard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finger-Protective Piece  </P> <P> Although it comes all the way from the moist climate of the tropics, whole,  dried nutmegs are readily available in most supermarkets. And if you watch out  for your knuckles, the nut-like seeds can be grated on a cheese grater.  </P> <P> There are a number of various types of specific nutmeg graters to be had. Some  work like a pepper mill and others have a little storage compartment and a  finger-protective piece that helps push the nutmeg over the grater.  </P> <P> Considering the price, though, it is definitely worth investigating the  different kinds, to determine which suits you best.  </P></p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Education bill stalled by angry Tory peers The government may be unable to push its education bill through parliament without substantial revisions because of growing opposition to the measures in both the Commons and the Lords. The bill, which would create a teacher-training agency and restrict the use of student union funds for political activity, was introduced into the Lords last month. But, according to backbench Conservative MPs, the legislation came under such intense fire from peers that ministers are uneasy about moving it to the committee stage where it would be scrutinised clause by clause. One Tory MP said the government was moving on to other legislation while it decides what to do. He said: 'The government did not anticipate that it would be so severely opposed and it has shaken them a bit.' The bill was attacked at its second reading debate last month by a number of Tory peers as an infringement of the rights of student unions. That was followed by a second challenge from a Lords procedure committee which complained that the bill had been poorly drafted. The Lords committee on the scrutiny of delegated powers said that the bill gave the education secretary almost unlimited powers to decide how student unions could spend their money. 'The House may regard as inappropriate the delegation of legislative power to interfere with the freedom of association of students,' the committee said. Lord Graham, a Labour whip in the Lords, said no date had been set for the bill to go its committee stage up to the week beginning February 7. 'A bill that received its second reading on December 7 should have moved on by now,' he said. 'The government is clearly concerned by what is going on.' Department of Education officials believe that the bill is not facing any real difficulties. 'We are determined to press on,' said one. But if the bill moves to the Commons in its present form, it would probably be opposed by two former education ministers, Mr Robert Jackson and Sir Rhodes Boyson, and by the Conservative chairman of the Commons education committee, Sir Malcolm Thornton. Mr Jackson said last week that the proposals to restrict the rights of student unions were so unjust that they they might infringe the European Convention on Human Rights. Sir Rhodes believes that the reform of student union funding was satisfactorily dealt with by legislation he introduced when he was an education minister 10 years ago. 'We should really be focusing on more important issues now,' he said.</p>

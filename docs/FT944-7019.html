			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Malcolm Barr steps down to end feud Mr Malcolm Barr agreed to step down as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust yesterday in a boardroom shake-up, which spells an end to the family feud at the motor and leisure group. Mr Barr, who is also the outgoing chairman of the Leeds Permanent Building Society, gave way to pressure from rebel shareholders led by his nephews, Nicholas and Robert Barr. The brothers, who speak for almost 30 per cent of ordinary voting shares, are joining the board along with their fellow rebel shareholder, Mr Kerry Firth. The boardroom deal came after an EGM had dissolved into chaos as the warring parties held a series of frantic talks in front of shareholders. The EGM failed to start and was eventually adjourned until Monday while financial advisers attempted to negotiate a deal to end the feud. The board had wanted to enfranchise the non-voting A shares, which represent 80 per cent of the equity and are owned almost entirely by institutions. However, the rebels won support from shareholders representing more than 50 per cent of voting ordinary shares. Enfranchisement now seems likely to be voted through at the reconvened EGM next week. A second meeting had been requisitioned by the rebels to remove Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director. However, both Mr Parker and Mr Small will stay on the board as part of the latest deal. The agreement follows six weeks of acrimonious dispute between the Barr generations over the future of the family business. The brothers wanted to demerge the two divisions to unlock shareholder value. The board countered with warnings from motor manufacturers that the new company could lose its lucrative car dealership franchises. Before details of the deal emerged, Mr Nicholas Barr denied that his uncle's departure would resolve the dispute. 'That would make it sound extremely personal, which it is not,' he said. 'Much has been said about family feuding and clearly there are differences of opinion. But this is not a personal issue, it is a commercial one.' Malcolm Barr will become life president.</p>

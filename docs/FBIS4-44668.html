			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Germany Pursuing Its </F> Hypersonic Propulsion Research"]    [Text] Having developed the concept of a  hydrogen-cooled asymmetric two-dimensional exhaust nozzle, MTU  plans to build a Mach 7 ramjet demonstrator in 1995.    German experts are continuing their research to develop a  propulsion system for their "Sanger" hypersonic orbital plane  concept. They are working on the basis of a  liquid-hydrogen-propelled combination turbojet/ramjet engine.  Consisting of a rectangular air inlet followed by a diffuser, it  has a turbojet engine equipped with an enclosure system that  isolates and protects it during the hypersonic phase. It then  terminates in an afterburner duct that serves as the combustion  chamber for the ramjet, and a two-dimensional exhaust nozzle  with an expansion tail pipe. The turbojet engine propels the  plane up to approximately Mach 3.5. Then, between Mach 3.5 and  Mach 3.8, during the transition phase, the ramjet kicks in to  accelerate the assembly to Mach 7.    This hypersonic technology research program began in 1988  and  is being conducted under the aegis of the Ministry of Research  and Technology with the participation of the DLR, the "space"  and "planes" divisions of DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AF], and  Volvo, all of whom are working under MTU's leadership. Since  1992, the Russians of the TsAGI have joined the research  relative to the scramjet technologies.    As of today, the definition is almost complete, and testing  has commenced on the components of the ramjet portion, such as  the air inlets, combustion chamber, exhaust nozzles, and the  cooling system, all of which have practically been defined.  During an initial phase (between 1990 and 1992), the engineers  had to develop design and simulation software, new  instrumentation, and the aerodynamic definition of the air  inlets and combustion chambers. Concurrently, they began testing  the components. In 1991, they simulated Mach 4.7 with a cooled  combustion chamber 33 cm in diameter. Then, a hot air generator  reached 2000 K (corresponding to Mach 7), and in December 1992,  a cooled ramjet reached Mach 7 (in simulation).    Several types of exhaust nozzles (rectangular, axisymmetric)  were studied and tested. The choice finally boiled down to  hydrogen-cooled asymmetric two-dimensional exhaust nozzles.  Under test, they withstood exit temperatures of 2500 K or  2227. A special effort was devoted to the expansion tail  pipe, whose role is important with respect to the  engine/fuselage integration. The pipe is protected by  carbon/carbon. In March 1993, a complete nozzle underwent a  satisfactory test with 2400 K and 1500 K at the tail pipe.    Since the completion of these initial tests on individual  components, the German researchers have embarked on a new phase.  It is to culminate in the realization of a complete  demonstrator, a ramjet engine baptized the TDR 500, by 1995. It  will be 7 meters long and will consist of an adjustable-section  rectangular air inlet, a circular combustion chamber 50 cm in  diameter, and a two-dimensional exhaust nozzle with expansion  tail pipe. Since facilities capable of testing such an assembly  are not available in Europe, the tests will be conducted either  in Russia or in the United States.    And in a third phase, the engineers plan to embark on the  supersonic combustion stage. That is, on the scramjet engine  that is to be studied in cooperation with the German DLR and the  Russian TsAGI.</p>

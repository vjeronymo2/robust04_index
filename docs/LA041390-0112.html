			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Paramount Modifies Rental Fees: Paramount Pictures, which last year provoked a  congressional investigation after changing the film rental fees it charges to  discount movie theaters, said it has modified the fees. Paramount said it will  now charge theaters a percentage of a film's box office gross four months after  a movie is released, instead of five months after the release.  </P> <P> In the first four months after release, Paramount will continue to charge  theaters a minimum per person payment of $1.05 for adults and 75 cents for  children, or 35% of the box office gross, whichever is higher. Paramount last  May instituted the minimum per-capita payment, prompting an outcry from  discount movie theaters, which show second-run films for an admission price as  low as $1.  </P></p>

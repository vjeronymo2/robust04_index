			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / US-style public funding proposed for CrossRail The Corporation of London is to send a team to the US to study public-sector financing schemes which could be used as a model for building the long-delayed Pounds 2bn CrossRail link in London. In the past two weeks the corporation, the local authority for the City, has presented the Department of the Environment with a complex proposal for a levy on its business rates to raise about Pounds 50m a year. The money would be used to secure borrowings that would contribute to the cost of CrossRail, which would link British Rail lines in the east and west of London via a tunnel between Liverpool Street and Paddington stations. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources committee, said yesterday that the idea could 'bridge the gap' - of as much as Pounds 500m - between public funding for CrossRail and the amount which the private sector is prepared to invest as risk capital. The corporation believes CrossRail could be vital to London's infrastructural needs by easing the pressure on the Central Line, and has previously warned that the project could collapse if the government waits for conventional private-sector finance. Consequently, it is looking at adapting US schemes in which local authorities raise money from a bond issue which is backed by the regular revenue stream from business rates and local taxes. The corporation only spends Pounds 70m of the Pounds 700m it raises in taxation, but a review is likely to cut revenue by as much as half from 1995. Mr Cassidy believes business ratepayers will accept a slightly smaller reduction if they know that the levy is being used for infrastructural improvements from which they will benefit. The corporation is discussing the scheme with officials at the environment department, which would have to approve it. Approval would also be needed from the Treasury, which has previously been unwilling to allow business rates to be earmarked for transport. The corporation team will visit the US before Christmas.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE RALLIES, EDGES TEXAS EL PASO  </P> <P> Dan McGwire, plagued by interceptions throughout the night, scored on a  one-yard run midway through the fourth quarter Saturday to give San Diego State  a 34-31 Western Athletic Conference victory over Texas El Paso.  </P> <P> McGwire, who entered the game ranked ninth in the nation in passing efficiency,  had six passes intercepted, including three that led to UTEP scores.  </P> <P> But his winning touchdown, with 8:17 left, capped a 14-play, 80-yard drive.  </P> <P> San Diego State improved to 4-3-1 overall, 2-2 in the WAC. UTEP is 2-7 and 1-4.  </P> <P> The Miners' Dominick Cefalone was short on a 58-yard field-goal attempt that  would have tied it with 1:44 remaining.  </P> <P> UTEP led 21-7 after one quarter. Howard Gasser passed 62 and 45 yards to Reggie  Barrett for two touchdowns, and linebacker Ken Sale returned an interception of  a pass from McGwire 27 yards for another.  </P> <P> But San Diego State answered with 17 second-quarter points, starting with  McGwire's nine-yard pass to Robert Claiborne. Andy Trakas kicked a 35-yard  field goal and Darren Wagner scored from the five-yard line.  </P> <P> The Aztecs amassed 554 yards of total offense but had seven turnovers.  </P> <P> Wyoming 24, New Mexico 23 -- Quarterback Tom Corontzos threw a 34-yard  touchdown pass to halfback Dabby Dawson in the fourth quarter and the Cowboys  held on for the win at Albuquerque, N.M.  </P> <P> The Cowboys' victory wasn't secure until New Mexico quarterback Jeremy Leach,  passing for the two-point conversion attempt, hit the crossbar. Leach had  thrown an 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terance Mathis as time ran  out to close the score to one point.  </P> <P> The touchdown pass was tipped by Wyoming linebacker Vaughn Henderson, but  Mathis, who became the all-time National Collegiate Athletic Assn. leader in  career receiving yardage, grabbed the ball in the middle of the end zone.  </P> <P> New Mexico, which has lost four games this season by seven points or fewer,  went for the victory, but Leach could not find an open teammate and finally  fired a pass that sailed into the crossbar.  </P> <P> Wyoming improved to 3-5 overall and 3-2 in the conference. New Mexico, losing  its seventh in a row, is 1-8 and 0-5.  </P> <P> Mathis finished with eight catches for 110 yards to move past Marc Zeno of  Tulane in all-time receiving yardage. Mathis now has 3,772 yards. Zeno had  3,725 yards from 1984-87.  </P> <P> Leach, who completed 26 of 50 passes for 343 yards, threw an 82-yard touchdown  pass to Eric Morgan, and wide receiver Mike Henderson scored in the first half  on a 33-yard reverse.  </P> <P> Colorado State 50, Utah 10 -- Tony Alford ran for a WAC record 310 yards and  three touchdowns as the Rams won at Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Alford scored on runs of 54, 42 and 63 yards and broke the conference rushing  record of 302 yards, set by Kevin Lowe of Wyoming against South Dakota State in  1984.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following sharp differences within the ranks of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command  [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril, Mustafa Khamis, a PFLP-GC  leader, today decided to split from the PFLP-GC and form what he  called the Popular Front-General Islamic Command.    Mustafa Khamis, who was a member of the PFLP-GC Central  Committee and member of the Palestine National Council, said  today in Amman that he has decided, along with a group of the  cadres operating in the territories, to split in the wake of  severe financial and administrative corruption within PFLP-GC  ranks.    The group that split from the PFLP-GC, led by Mustafa  Khamis,  accuses Ahmad Jibril and the PFLP-GC leadership of no longer  being able to run the PFLP-GC, saying their fighting is not in  the interest of the Palestinian people and its cause.    Khamis said Jibril's nationalist attitude and his arrogance  have driven him to destroy the PFLP-GC, noting that the decision  to split follows the failure of the PFLP-GC leaders to persuade  Jibril to change his unilateral conduct during the meetings of  the PFLP-GC Central Committee, held in Damascus last month.    The PFLP-GC was established in 1968 when Ahmad Jibril split,  along with dozens of his supporters, from the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine, led by George Habash, against the  background of personal competition between the two men over the  leadership of the front.    The PFLP-GC today forms a part of the Damascus-based  Palestinian opposition factions.</p>

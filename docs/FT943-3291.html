			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Fiat row hits new car sales data Disagreement between Fiat, the Italian car producer, and rival European carmakers importing cars into Italy, has created confusion over the publication of new car sales figures in Italy. The conflict, exacerbated by the inability of the Italian government to provide prompt information on new vehicle registrations, is undermining the disclosure of west European new cars sales data. The traditional arrangement between the two Italian motor industry trade associations - Anfia for the domestic industry and Unrae for the importers - for the exchange and joint publication of sales figures has broken down. The Anfia/Unrae figures, which report wholesale deliveries to dealers rather than domestic registrations, have become increasingly unreliable, as they are distorted by the high volume of cars being re-exported from Italy to neighbouring countries. Fiat has insisted that the task of reporting new car sales should be handed over to the Italian government, but the Transport Ministry is still struggling to provide quick and accurate registration data. Traditionally the government has required 3-4 months to produce the data, but the Italian motor industry is hopeful that this can soon be reduced to less than 10 days. According to estimates released by Acea, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association - using a combination of registration and wholesale figures for Italy - overall west European new car registrations rose by only 0.6 per cent year-on-year in July to 915,000, while registrations in August rose by 4.7 per cent year-on-year to 1.081m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                          January-August 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Volume     Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                          (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Aug' 94  Jan-Aug' 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET          8,517,000      +6.0       100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group      1,369,000      +4.5        16.1         16.3  -Volkswagen            882,000      +1.8        10.4         10.8  -Seat                  224,400     +18.4         2.6          2.4  -Audi                  222,000      +1.8         2.6          2.7  -Skoda*                 41,000     +11.8         0.5          0.5 General Motors***     1,094,000      +5.1        12.8         13.0  -Opel/Vauxhall       1,048,000      +4.4        12.3         12.5  -Saab**                 36,000     +35.3         0.4          0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen   1,083,000     +11.6        12.7         12.1  -Peugeot               651,000     +10.3         7.6          7.3  -Citroen               432,000     +13.5         5.1          4.7 Ford group***         1,004,000      +5.8        11.8         11.8  -Ford                  997,000      +5.9        11.7         11.7  -Jaguar                  7,000      -9.9         0.1          0.1 Fiat group****          946,000      +6.0        11.1         11.1  -Fiat                  738,000     +10.1         8.7          8.3  -Lancia                119,000      -4.5         1.4          1.5  -Alfa Romeo             78,000     -10.5         0.9          1.1 Renault                 918,000      +8.8        10.8         10.5 BMW group               543,000      +5.8         6.4          6.4  -BMW                   269,000      +2.7         3.2          3.3  -Rover                 274,000      +8.9         3.2          3.1 Mercedes-Benz           288,000     +34.5         3.4          2.7 Nissan                  275,000      -4.5         3.2          3.6 Toyota                  219,000      -4.1         2.6          2.8 Volvo                   137,000     +17.5         1.6          1.5 Mazda                   127,000     -10.5         1.5          1.8 Honda                   121,000      +6.1         1.4          1.4 Mitsubishi               84,000     -17.2         1.0          1.3 Suzuki                   52,000     -24.8         0.6          0.9 Total Japanese          927,000      -7.4        10.9         12.5 MARKETS: Germany               2,219,000      -0.3        26.1         27.7 Italy                 1,284,000      -2.5        15.1         16.4 France                1,297,000     +14.7        15.2         14.1 United Kingdom        1,443,000      +9.8        16.9         16.4 Spain                   620,000     +20.4         7.3          6.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ***Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. **** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association) estimates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

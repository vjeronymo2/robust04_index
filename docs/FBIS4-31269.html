			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG)--Ejup Ganic, vice-president  of the Bosnian Moslem-Croat Federation, retained his inflexible  position after a third round of talks with special U.N. Envoy  Yasushi Akashi in Geneva on Tuesday evening that the Federation  could only accept a four-week-long ceasefire for war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Proceeding from a declaration adopted by  the contact group on Bosnia on May 13 in Geneva, Akashi has been  insisting on a four-month truce.    In Ganic's view, everything else but a four-week ceasefire  would imply retaining the status quo from which only the Serbs  would benefit. He also reprimanded reporters at the Palais des  Nations for ignoring his accusations of the Serbs.    "I have seen all the papers and my statements are nowhere to  be found.    "Today I told (U.N. Secretary-General Butrus) Butrus-Ghali  he  is chiefly to blame for the spreading of the ethnic cleansing  policy in the world," said Ganic aggressively.    Regardless of his fervent anti-Serb campaign, Ganic is no  longer able to hide from the reporters the simple truth that the  conference is being undermined by the Moslem-Croat side.    Early in the afternoon, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic  said the Serbs were prepared to accept Akashi's suggestion for a  four-month ceasefire and that some results conducive to peace  would be achieved in Geneva after all. More bilateral talks  will be held in the evening.</p>

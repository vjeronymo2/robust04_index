			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Enso firm on offshoot bid price Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish forest products group, said yesterday it had no plans to raise its bid for the outstanding shares in Berghuizer Papierfabriek, its loss-making Dutch paper subsidiary. This is in spite of criticism from some shareholders that its offer of Fl 50 a share is too low. The Finnish company said the takeover was the best way to safeguard Berghuizer's future. Berghuizer was expected to post further losses in 1994 and 1995, and there was no likelihood of a resumption of dividend payments in the 'foreseeable' future, it said. 'Enso believes that it is offering a generous strategic premium over the net present value of the underlying cashflow potential of the shares, and is not prepared to improve its offer,' it said.</p>

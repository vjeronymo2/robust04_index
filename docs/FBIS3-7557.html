The other ruling coalition parties have said, if the UN  Security Council decides to impose economic sanctions on North  Korea, "Japan should go along with them."    However, Chairman Murayama of the SDPJ, which has maintained  friendly relations with the Workers' Party of Korea in North  Korea, has said, "Japan should work for dialogue with North  Korea rather than go along with the economic sanctions  immediately."    There are concerns within the government and ruling  coalition  parties that a rift could be created in the coalition government  depending on what action the SDPJ takes.    The UN Security Council has begun studying the possibility  of  imposing economic sanctions against North Korea after it refused  to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency. In response, the SDPJ, at a  24 March meeting of its Central Executive Committee, decided to  speedily study its strategy in dealing with the issue of North  Korea's suspected nuclear development.    It is possible that, during Diet deliberations, SDPJ cabinet  members could be asked to vote on whether U.S. Forces in Japan  impose a naval blockade against North Korea as part of economic  sanctions. The party, therefore, has concluded that it needs to  shape a party consensus on the issue of North Korea's suspected  nuclear development.    The SDPJ plans to announce its official view after  collecting  information starting early this week. People in the SDPJ are  increasingly cautious about how to handle the issue. Secretary  General Kubo says the party wants to "adopt a policy of dialogue  with North Korea" on the grounds that: 1) It fears that North  Korea might respond to external pressure by acts of terrorism;  and 2) there is no guarantee that the imposition of economic  sanctions against North Korea will force the country to accept  the nuclear inspections.    For this reason, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and other  ruling coalition parties are saying "it is difficult to predict  whether the SDPJ will announce a responsible policy on the issue  as a ruling party."    It is said the SDPJ has always been "pro-North Korea" in its  longstanding policy on the Korean peninsula. The SDPJ  normalized its relations with South Korea when former Chairman  Yamahana visited that country last September. There is a  feeling the relationship between the SDPJ and the Workers' Party  of Korea is not in good shape. The SDPJ, however, plans to  continue its friendly relations with the Workers' Party of  Korea. The U.S. Congress is concerned that the "Hosokawa  government may not be able to deal resolutely with the issue of  North Korea's suspected nuclear development because cabinet  members have close ties with North Korea."    A Shinseito source said some people in the ruling coalition  parties are wary of the SDPJ, saying "we will have to work so as  not to produce a useless international misunderstanding."</p>

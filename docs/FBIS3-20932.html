			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a cost of billions of German marks, Siemens AG,  Berlin/Munich, intends starting chip production in Dresden. A  new semiconductor factory for computer memories and logic  circuits will be set up in the Saxon capital, probably employing  1,200 people. A group spokesman confirmed that major  investments are planned in microelectronics. But the details  will not be announced until Federal Research Minister Paul  Krueger is in Dresden on 23 December.    The construction of a microchip factory in Dresden was  already under discussion about two years ago. When Siemens was  looking at various possible sites to build such a factory, the  then Federal Trade and Industry Minister Juergen W. Moellemann  came out strongly in favour of the Saxon capital. But at the  same time he refused "special financial support" for the  project. As Siemens market researchers came to the view that  sales of memory chips would decrease significantly over the next  few years (because of their greater capacity), the Semiconductor  Division was grappling with enormous losses, and the subsidy  offered was not what the group expected, at the time Siemens put  the project on hold.    Now a decision has evidently been made. According to a  report in the magazine "BILD", a chip factory costing one  billion German marks [DM] will be built in Dresden with a DM300  million government subsidy. It was further reported that DM2.4  billion will be invested at the Saxon location over the next 10  years. The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology will  grant as much as DM30 million a year in subsidies to specific  research projects at the factory under the budget heading  "Microelectronics Research and Development." Siemens could, of  course, also claim the normal investment subsidies available in  eastern Germany.    The factory, to be built on a site close to Dresden airport,  is initially intended for dynamic memory chips (the so-called  DRAM [dynamic random access memory] semiconductors), but will  later also make logic circuits, in particular customer and  application-specific chips (ASIC [application-specific  integrated circuits]). The memories will, so to speak, secure  the necessary basic quantities of work, on which ASIC  manufacture can then be built up. When completed, the factory  will probably employ 1,200 people, 100 of them in the  laboratory. The same number of jobs will be secured or created  with future suppliers.    Siemens is understood to be seeking additional industrial  partners for the new works. It will cooperate with the Dresden  Microelectronics Center (ZMD), in which the Commerzbank AG and  the Dresdner Bank AG, both of Frankfurt, have a holding, and  which Siemens is already providing know-how, managerial staff,  and orders. There is also the possibility of cooperation with a  Fraunhofer Institute that developed out of the ZND's precursor  company. Microelectronics could thus again become one of  Dresden's major industries.    How far Siemens' proposed involvement in Saxony denotes a  change in company policy in the semiconductor sector remains to  be seen. Dresden is likely to make the 16 and 64 megabit memory  chips. Under earlier plans, the former was to have been built  with U.S. computer giant IBM in France. A new factory was not  previously planned for the 64 megabit chip either. Instead,  existing manufacturing plants were to have been adapted  accordingly. But it seems that the chip boom that has resumed  in the meantime has led to a rethink.</p>

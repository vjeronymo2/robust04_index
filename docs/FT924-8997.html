			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Drink: The market's fruitiest malt - Giles MacDonogh savours a malt whisky - in San Prospero FEW, foolhardy people ever visit the swollen village of San Prospero in the north Italian province of Modena. There is nothing much to see apart from a handful of jerry-built modern factories and a huge vinification plant for the local, Lambrusco wine. One might well have imagined that the wine, or indeed grappas and liqueurs, would be quite sufficient to satisfy the largely communist workforce, but no. A careful study of drinks behind the counter in the high street bar reveals a well-thumbed bottle of the Macallan single malt standing proudly aloof from the ranks of amaros and amarettos. The Macallan is a seven-year-old: unknown in Britain, where the range kicks off with a ten-year-old spirit. San Prospero is unlikely to be any different from any other village in northern Italy: malt whiskies like the Macallan are all the rage, with the Italians drinking twice as much of the stuff as we do in Britain. They also drink a lot of the Macallan seven-year-old, which is currently ranked eighth most popular - and that includes blended whiskies. The Macallan's rating is a tribute to the extraordinary skills of Armando Giovinetti of Milan. It was Giovinetti who introduced the Italians to malt when he managed Glen Grant a few years back. He later fell out with the men at Glen Grant and since then he has been promoting the Macallan. That Glen Grant's loss was the Macallan's gain is clear to Allan Shiach, Macallan's chairman. It was Shiach who created prestige malt when he took the courageous decision to launch a Macallan single malt in 1969. At that time the distillery was known only as a source for blending. The first ten-year-old malt was released ten years later in 1979 after a decade of heartaches. Shiach likes to compare his 1969 decision to opening a restaurant: you equip the kitchens, hire the staff, but you don't open the doors to customers for another ten, long years. Macallan's success has vindicated Shiach's faith in his own whisky. Since that time he has launched 18- and 25-year-old malts on a regular basis and occasionally sold even older spirits for fantastic prices. The family firm has sold off half its equity: 25 per cent to Remy Martin, and 25 per cent to Suntory, but a richer, sleeker Shiach remains in control. In spite of the launch of countless superb old malts since 1979, the Macallan remains the one which captures the drinker's imagination as the ne plus ultra, and nothing looks like toppling it for the time being. So what makes the Macallans so special? All malt whisky is the product of a micro-climate, spring-water, a set of stills and an ageing technique. For the Macallan, it is the latter which is all important: the Macallan has always led on its oak barrels; more particularly on reused Oloroso casks from Jerez in Spain. The Macallan claims to be the only whisky aged exclusively in 'sherry-wood'. When other distilleries use 100 per cent sherry casks, it is only for a special vintage release, and not for the whole range. Reluctance to use only sherry is not just a question of taste: sherry casks cost Pounds 250 a piece as opposed to Pounds 35 for the more prevalent Bourbon wood. Sherry wood engenders problems of its own: you must go to Spain to select the oak; then you must keep an eye on the casks to make sure the sherry companies do the right things with them. It would not do for the casks to develop the bacterial 'flor' which gives the special character to fino sherries. This was noticable in the tasting of eight different Macallans I did with Allan Shiach. First we tasted the fresh, young spirit before it had been put into cask; next came a whisky aged in a cask which had housed a dark, sweet sherry which had given the whisky a buttery, nutty character. A lighter sherry wood, possibly from a young oloroso was far less obtrusive. Next came a new Bourbon cask, immediately noticable by its up-front new Kentucky oak flavours. The fino cask whisky was peculiar, the bacterial flor from the sherry had made the Macallan taste leathery, much like an Island malt. The last three were a rich, raisiny amontillado, a nutty dry oloroso, and a sweet, buttery oloroso. An excellent demonstration of just how important is the cask to the finished product. The sherry oak makes the Macallan the fruitiest, most raisiny malt whisky on the market. Some whisky drinkers hate the taste, which brings the spirit half way to cognac, rounding off the rough edges which make other whiskies an acquired taste. It is hard to know which school is the purest, for some would claim that all good whisky was aged in old wine, sherry or even port casks in the past, and that it is only cost which deters distillers in our own day. Whatever the case, these arguments do not bother many Italians and the people of San Prospero are happily unaware that the controversy even exists.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARING SET ON BKK LANDFILL SAFETY PLANS  </P> <P> State health officials will hold a public meeting Wednesday to detail  environmental safety measures that have been taken at the BKK Corp. landfill,  once Southern California's primary toxic waste dump.  </P> <P> The dump stopped accepting toxic waste in 1984, and officially closed its toxic  section last year.  </P> <P> West of the closed section, BKK still operates a 443-acre dump, accepting  non-hazardous trash. It is the second-largest facility of its kind in Los  Angeles County and is one of the nation's largest.  </P> <P> BKK expects to continue operating this part of the landfill until 1995, said  Jake Amar, the firm's environmental systems manager.  </P> <P> State officials require closed dumps to submit plans for future maintenance of  their sites. After the plans are approved, the state issues a "post-closure  permit" to the facility. The 6:30 p.m. meeting at the West Covina Senior  Center, 2501 E. Cortez St., will focus on the permit process.  </P> <P> At the three-hour meeting, state health department officials will give a  presentation and then allow time for questions from the public.  </P> <P> During the last six years, BKK has spent nearly $38 million in improvements and  equipment related to closing the toxic area, Amar said. The firm covered the  area with clay ranging in depth from six to 20 feet, he said. There is also an  intricate system that collects gas generated by the decomposing wastes and uses  it to run electricity-generating turbines. The energy is sold to Southern  California Edison.  </P> <P> Later this year, state health officials said, they expect to hold a formal  public hearing on the post-closure permit.  </P></p>

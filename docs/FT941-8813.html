			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Bosnian Serbs 'to pull back all heavy weapons': Russians receive pledge from Karadzic that ceasefire will be observed Russia yesterday seized the initiative in the Bosnian crisis, apparently winning the Bosnian Serbs' agreement to pull back all their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, said that 400 Russian peacekeeping troops would be sent immediately from Croatia to the Bosnian capital, and 400 more would be dispatched from Russia itself. This followed assurances given to Mr Churkin by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, that he would abide by the ceasefire and withdraw the heavy artillery. Mr Karadzic declared after meeting Mr Churkin in Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters: 'We are going towards the end of the war, at least in Sarajevo and that might be the introduction of the end of the war in all Bosnia-Hercegovina.' Mr Bill Aikman, spokesman for the United Nations forces in Sarajevo, described the promised withdrawal as 'a very heartening development'. Although many previous pledges by the Bosnian Serbs have come to nothing, Mr Aikman later spoke of 'a very significant withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces off the hills around Sarajevo' taking place last night. 'We are talking about convoys of equipment moving off the hills,' he added. Most western countries yesterday refused to send substantial additional troops to bolster the UN operation in Sarajevo. The Russian leadership is anxious not to be sidelined as Nato and Washington assume a higher profile in the Bosnian crisis. It is also obliged to take into account its nationalist constituency at home, which sympathises with the Serbs. In an interview on Russian television, Mr Churkin said: 'We can say that any air strikes on any Bosnian Serb positions are ruled out for the simple reason there will be no targets for these strikes to hit.' Mr Karadzic said: 'We are very grateful to Russia for its involvement in the resolution of the crisis. We have accepted the proposal and the request by Russia concerning the withdrawal of heavy weaponry.' Admiral Mike Boorda, commander of Nato's southern forces, had said earlier in the day: 'We are a long way from complete compliance.' Defence ministers from several Nato countries will meet in Italy on Sunday, hours before the expiry at midnight GMT of a Nato ultimatum. If the withdrawal and collection of heavy weapons is not completed by that time, the UN commanders on the ground can ask Nato to carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. In London, the British government rejected sending more troops to former Yugoslavia to reinforce the peacekeeping operation around Sarajevo. In an implicit sideswipe against the US, which has no ground troops based in former Yugoslavia, British ministers suggested that western nations which have yet to contribute to the UN forces in Bosnia should meet the call from General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, for an extra 3,000 troops.

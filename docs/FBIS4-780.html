			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sello Motlhabakwe] </F>   [Text] The ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of  the Nation; MK], would not be deployed in any capacity in Natal  should guerrilla activity arise in the province in the  post-election period, MK commissar Andrew Masondo said  yesterday. He said the issue of deploying counter-insurgency  forces in the province would have to be dealt with by the new  Parliament, which would be in command of the integrated armed  force. The ANC's force would not be in existence after the  current process of integration into a new defence force, Masondo  said.    Camps to which MK members were reporting in the run-up to  amalgation into the new force had a strict code of conduct  designed to avoid a possible repeat of the problems encountered  with the National Peacekeeping Force in Bloemfontein, he said.  Men and women at assembly points would undergo a three- to  six-month training period in preparation for their non-partisan  role in the SA National Defence Force.    Masondo said all the armed forces in the country would have  to undergo an orientation period to create a single, unified  army. Training would ensure and maintain professional standards  so that the army could meet national and international  obligations. The top command would be determined by the new  president, he said.    He said 16,000 MK troops would assemble at various assembly  points identified in conjuction with the present SA Defence  Force [SADF] and the Joint Military Co-ordinating Council.    An advance party of 400 cadres were already in the camps  preparing to receive 8,000 others who would report next week.  The assembly points would also be administered by MK  commanders. Recruits were currently assembling at Walmansthal  north of Pretoria, Bourke's Luck in the eastern Transvaal and  Hoedspruit in the western Transvaal. MK military hardware  stored in the neighbouring states would be brought home and  would be added to the national arms inventory, he said. This  would be done according to a formula drawn up in discussions  with the SADF. Joint security mechanisms had been agreed on by  the Joint Military Co-ordinating Council, Masondo said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, June 7, IRNA -- Iran strongly condemns  Israel's aggression on Lebanon particularly its recent air raid  on Ba'labakk, a senior Iranian envoy told Lebanese President  Ilyas al-Hirawi and Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz here last  night.    The envoy, Foreign Ministry director general for Mid  East-North African affairs, Hojjat ol-Eslam Kazem Khonsari, said  the Zionist regime's plots were not restricted to Lebanon alone  but were aimed at all nations of the region. He said the  Lebanese people have the right to defend themselves against the  Zionist regime.    Khonsari denounced the abduction of Mustafa Dirani on May 21  by Zionist troops and said the silence of international circles  against this latest act of state terrorism indicates their  helplessness vis-a-vis the United States.    Dirani the leader of Lebanon's Momena (Faithful) movement,  was kidnapped from his home in Ba'labaakk by a helicopter-borne  team of Zionist commandos.    Meanwhile, Lebanese daily AL-NAHAR wrote in its Tuesday's  edition that Khonsari's visit is aimed to bring calm to Lebanon  and called it an effort to end the Zionists aggressions on  Lebanon.    The daily said that in his meeting with Lebanese officials,  the Iranian envoy underlined the need for coordination between  the Lebanese Government and Islamic resistance at such a crucial  juncture.</p>

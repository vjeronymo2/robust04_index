			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Irish Life lower but free of exposure to GPA IRISH LIFE, Ireland's largest fund manager in the life and pensions market, reported an 8 per cent drop in embedded value for 1992, from IPounds 540m to IPounds 494m. That was better than market expectations which anticipated a fall to IPounds 475m. Funds under management at the year-end amounted to IPounds 4.81bn (IPounds 5bn). Principal causes of the fall were adverse tax changes, and losses on investments of IPounds 40m, of which IPounds 24m was accounted for by the write-down of the interest in GPA, the aircraft leasing group. Policyholder funds suffered an additional write-down of IPounds 46m attributable to the group's shareholding in GPA, but as a result 'neither our policyholder nor our shareholder funds carry any remaining material exposure to GPA'. Overall premium income in the core Irish market fell 8 per cent to IPounds 412m. Individual single premium business, plunged 45 per cent to IPounds 55.7m. The associated business, Irish Life Finance Group, saw a 29 per cent rise in its home loans portfolio to Pounds 276m and a 53 per cent increase in its finance loan portfolio to IPounds 61m. Premium income in the UK improved 6 per cent in sterling terms, but turned into an 8 per cent drop on conversion into punts. A drop in dollar premium income translated into an almost unchanged IPounds 77.7m. Net profit was IPounds 31.7m (IPounds 30.7m) and earnings 10.54p (10.23p). The final dividend is 5.44p for a total of 8.44p; last year's payment of 5.44p was the first since privatisation.</p>

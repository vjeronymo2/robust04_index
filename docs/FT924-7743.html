			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Man in the News: Street-fighter's tough stance - Ray MacSharry Ray MacSharry has caused something of a commotion in Brussels during the past 10 days. The Irish agriculture commissioner has won his trial of strength with Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the European Commission. The question now is whether the same ruthlessness will bring back a world trade reform deal from next week's EC-US negotiations in Washington. The MacSharry-Delors row is unique. Although Mr Delors has been outvoted before in the 17-member college of commissioners, nobody had publicly taken on probably the most powerful chief the Commission has had. Mr Delors should have had ample warning the confrontation was coming. But, perhaps overprotected by his staff, he seems to have misjudged his man. Mr MacSharry believes his boss was systematically undermining him - the words 'sabotage' and 'betrayal of trust' were used - in his efforts to settle long-standing rows with the US about subsidised food exports which are delaying conclusion of the Uruguay Round world trade package. Mr Delors believed the Irishman was going beyond what was compatible with this year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and was on the point of clinching a deal which would be lopsided in America's favour. The Commission president vigorously denies allegations that he was defending the interests of France, where the unpopular government is desperate to placate farmers ahead of next March's legislative elections. Mr MacSharry took a gamble. On November 4 he wrote to Mr Delors, explaining bluntly why he was resigning his negotiating responsibilities and turning them over to the president. 'Delors in this sort of situation normally turns it into a crisis of confidence and the commisioners back off,' one senior EC official said. 'This will be a one-day wonder,' predicted another, after the resignation became public. Yet by last Tuesday night, after the two men confronted each other in the presence of two senior colleagues, Mr MacSharry was back on the team, with a free hand to deliver a farm trade package if he can. Mr Delors, by contrast, if the attitude of his staff is any indication, is bitter and defensive. 'He has been damaged,' says one commissioner. Mr MacSharry, 54, once described as having 'dark, Transylvanian good looks', is undemonstrative and canny. Though he left school early, he has renowned mastery of the complex briefs which have fallen to him during his career. And he defends them with unshakeable nerve and obstinacy. As Irish finance minister in the short-lived administration of Charles Haughey in 1982, his plans to cut a spiralling budget deficit are widely judged to have lost his Fianna Fail party that year's election. One Irish politician said it was then that 'MacSharry showed his nerve, and (he) has never lost it since.' When he returned to the finance ministry in 1987, 'Mac the Knife', as he became known, took up where he left off and cut 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product off government borrowing in nine months, saving Ireland from a debt crisis. As agriculture commissioner, two years ago he was facing the unanimous opposition of EC farm ministers to his plans for the most radical overhaul in the CAP in its 30-year history. He glowered through more than a year of abuse. Yet by May, the reform had been almost bludgeoned through. His normal negotiating tactics, however, are a mixture of poker and horse-trading. His move against Mr Delors looked more like a chess gambit; the first move was clear, but the subsequent moves were far from obvious. The French daily Le Monde, said Mr Delors dismissed Mr MacSharry's resignation as a mouvement d'humeur. Some movement. It solidified majorities in the Commission and among the 12 member states in favour of a deal, flushing out - at least temporarily - an Anglo-German alliance against the French. Mr Delors and Paris were on the spot, as Europe in recession contemplated the prospect of trade war and decided to try again. Brought up in one of the toughest schools of politics, the Fianna Fail party which has dominated Ireland since independence, Mr MacSharry is no stranger to the black arts of political street-fighting. One of his favourite films is The Sting. There was a time in the build-up to the crisis when it was not entirely clear whether Mr MacSharry was after a Uruguay Round deal or Mr Delors' head. One long-time MacSharry-watcher who heard the early rumblings was always clear what the farm commissioner was after. 'MacSharry deals in substance. He doesn't care about Delors; what he won't abide is people who get in his way on substance.' Throughout the clash, the Delors camp took refuge in form, rather than substance. Several of their colleagues found Mr MacSharry's tactics unseemly and distressing for the Commission's reputation, but on the substance of the matter - even Mr Delors' aides concede - most were behind the Irishman. The substance in question has several parts. Mr MacSharry deeply resents suggestions he has caved in to American pressure. In his view, he was negotiating within the framework of the CAP reform; Mr Delors never sought to disprove this. Mr MacSharry further believes that the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round 'can be settled in five minutes' with the US, provided they can settle the oilseeds dispute, on which they are close to a solution. Deeper into the substance, almost certainly, is MacSharry's fear that failure to settle would prompt a host of challenges to the new CAP from the EC's trading partners, which would unravel his achievement in farm reform. For all the furore, it is also part of the substance that Mr MacSharry left negotiations in Chicago on November 3 because the US refused to accept his bottom line - not because of Mr Delors. If the US does levy its punitive tariffs on EC goods in three weeks, Mr MacSharry would certainly back EC trade reprisals. And while hopes are high for next week's talks, Mr MacSharry has again demonstrated that he does not budge easily.</p>

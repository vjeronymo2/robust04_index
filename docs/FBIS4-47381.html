D. Sirotenko and Ye. V. Abashina, All-Russian </F> Scientific Research Institute for Hydrometeorological  Information; UDC 551.583:631.559(47+57)]    [Abstract] The results of simulative modeling of the  influence of global warming on Russian agroclimatic resources  and agricultural production are generalized. Scenarios of both  models of the theory of climate and paleoclimatic  reconstructions were used in the computations. The totality of  the collected data indicates that the development of warming in  scenarios of models of general circulation of the atmosphere  would lead to a substantial aridization of the climate of Russia  in which it would be reasonable to expect a decrease in  agricultural productivity, but the development of a warming  under the scenario of an interglacial optimum would result in a  universal moistening of climate and a substantial increase in  agricultural productivity. The following scenarios of change in  important climatic factors by the year 2030 (in comparison with  1990) are visualized: an increase in the concentration of carbon  dioxide by 20% (CO[.sub]2[/] x 1.2); an increase in the  background concentration of tropospheric ozone by 30%  (O[.sub]3[/] x 1.3); a decrease in the content of soil  organic matter by 20% (HUM x 0.8). It is demonstrated  that the  direct influence of an increase in the carbon dioxide gas  concentration would be capable of offsetting the agricultural  losses associated with a climatic change under the most  unfavorable scenario. However, the negative impact of an  increase in the content of other greenhouse gases, especially  tropospheric ozone, and anthropogenic degradation of soils would  make this possibility problematical. It is emphasized that with  any variant of global warming there will be a need for radical  restructuring of the entire agricultural management system. The  simulative modeling of this biospheric system, however, may  reveal safe and economically feasible ways to bring about such  adaptation. References 17: 9 Russian, 8 Western.</p>

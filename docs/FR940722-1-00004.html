Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received additional data that confirm that failure of the subject switches does not pose an unsafe condition. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  C. Dale Bleakney, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ACE&hyph;130W, FAA, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1801 Airport Road, room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4135; fax (316) 946&hyph;4407.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Cessna Citation Model 500/501, 550/551, S550, 552, and 560 series airplanes, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 12, 1993 (58 FR 19069). That action was prompted by a report of failures of the left and right landing light switches due to heavy current at the switch contacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have required modification of the landing light electrical circuit. The intent of the modification was to preclude the possibility of failure of the landing light switches, which could lead to smoke and an electrical fire in the cockpit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received additional data gathered from an analysis that was conducted of the switch failure scenarios and the landing light switch design itself. These data indicate that the switch can adequately carry the current associated with either incandescent or halogen landing light installations. Apparently, the landing light switches that were involved in the reported incidents were of poor quality and were produced in only a small limited batch. The failure scenario analysis indicates that the switches shorted internally, allowing an odor and a trace of smoke to be released in the cockpit. In each case, however, the amount of smoke that was produced neither created a hazard nor interfered in any way with the safe operation of the aircraft. Further, contrary to what was previously reported, no fire occurred during any of the incidents as a result of the switch failure; the only identified discrepancy in some of the incidents was the discoloration of the switch cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, further investigation of one of the reported incidents revealed that a wire connected to one of the failed switches had discolored due to overheating caused by an undersized wire splice. (The undersized wire splice may have been installed as a result of questionable maintenance.) This parictular problem is considered to be an isolated incident and independent of the switch problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There have been no further failures of these switches since the original incidents that were reported (in 1992). As the limited number of suspect switches have appeared to have been purged from aircraft service by attrition, no recent failures have occurred. In addition, the FAA has not received any recent Malfunction or Defect Reports concerning these switches. This reduction in such reports supports the premise that poor quality switches are no longer found in the operators' inventories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the recent analysis data and other evidence presented, the FAA concludes that the switch failures are internal to the switch itself and do not cause sufficient smoke or arcing in the cockpit to create a hazardous condition. The FAA has determined that failure of the subject switches does not present an unsafe condition. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore, is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;19&hyph;AD, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 12, 1993 (58 FR 19069), is withdrawn.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Renton, Washington, on July 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> S.R.

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CITY TO DECIDE ON PROPERTY TAX LEVY  </P> <P> Property owners in Anaheim will be levied an annual tax of about one-half  percent per $100 cash value of their property this fiscal year if the City  Council approves the increase at its meeting tonight.  </P> <P> If passed, the tax will be effective immediately and payments will be due with  regular property taxes in November and April.  </P> <P> City officials say the tax is necessary to repay interest and payments on a  $10-million bond that the city took out in 1986 to make storm drain  improvements. The bond issue was approved by voters.  </P> <P> Property owners are taxed annually to service the debt at a decreasing rate,  said Ron Rothschild, administrative services director.  </P> <P> Anaheim property owners would pay the increased tax for the next 15 years until  the debt is repaid, if the City Council approves the ordinance.  </P></p>

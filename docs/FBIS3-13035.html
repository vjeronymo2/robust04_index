			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign </F> Ministry, by Pierre Beylau and Henri Bainvol; place and date not  given: "Extremist Settlers Must Be Neutralized"]    [Text] [Savir] This appalling massacre will not be without  consequences. From a religious and moral point of view, much  time will be needed for passions to recede and wounds to heal.  From a political viewpoint, the only way to overcome this  tragedy is to implement the Oslo agreement. I understand the  Palestinians' situation. They are reconsidering their position,  and then we need to hold talks away from the media to make sure  the agreement comes into force more or less within the agreed  upon time frame. The Palestinians understand that the Hebron  killing was an isolated act which the whole of Israeli society  condemns very strongly.    [LE POINT] This raises the problem of Jewish settlements in  Gaza and the West Bank...    [Savir] One cannot solve the issue of settlements at this  point. It will be dealt with as part of the negotiations on the  final status of Gaza and the West Bank, which will start two  years after the entry into force of the interim autonomy  agreement. Of course, outside the scope of the negotiations,  Israel is free to decide where its own interest lies. I do not  believe that the time has come to send a signal that might spark  delusions. The Oslo approach is a gradual one. We steered  clear of anything related to the most contentious issue:  sovereignty. For decisions to be made on the future of the  settlements, we need a large consensus among Israel's  population. Racist, violent, and extremist settlers must be  neutralized. And they will be.    [LE POINT] The Palestinians seem intent on securing new  concessions from Israel: disarming the settlers; bringing an  international force into the occupied territories...    [Savir] We must stick to the agreement. If we call that  into question, the whole process will collapse. 'Arafat knows  perfectly well that we listen to him when he is being  reasonable. The agreement does mention a temporary  international presence. Therefore this is an issue we can  discuss. The PLO is also confronted with a formidable  challenge: to control the Hamas movement, which has been doing  all it can to sabotage the peace process. Hamas will likely be  the biggest obstacle to peace.    [LE POINT] Do you still believe in peace?    [Savir] It will be a difficult peace, fraught with violence  and tragedy. If the Palestinians manage to establish open and  effective economic institutions, a multiparty political system,  and a reliable leadership, things will work out. Something very  important was born in Oslo. Everybody fears it may now be  destroyed. The true secret of the Oslo success consisted in the  creation of common interests. We must go all the way with this  process.</p>

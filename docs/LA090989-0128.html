			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH STOPS CORONA DEL MAR'S STREAK  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High School learned the painful lesson Friday night that a team  can't live off its past accomplishments and glory.  </P> <P> The Sea Kings entered their season opener with the longest unbeaten streak (14)  in Orange County, but they was no match for Huntington Beach in a stunning 19-6  loss in front of 2,200 fans on Huntington's Sheue Field.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar posted a 12-0-2 record while winning the Division VI  championship last year, and big things were expected again with some talented  players such as twin receivers Warren and Weston Johnson returning.  </P> <P> But the Johnsons never got their hands on the ball as Huntington Beach limited  Corona del Mar to only 44 yards passing and intercepted two passes. Tailback  Brian Lucas was the only standout for the losers, gaining 102 yards in nine  carries, including a 76-yard touchdown run that kept his team from being shut  out.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach, which won only two games last year, piled up 178 yards  rushing and 16 first downs as it controlled both lines of scrimmage and outhit  the defending champions.  </P> <P> Doug Cunningham, a converted wide receiver, gained 98 yards in 24 carries and  scored a touchdown to lead the Oilers' rushing offense. Kelly Cotton, a  transfer from Los Amigos, added 31 yards in seven carries and also scored a  touchdown.  </P> <P> "I was excited about our chances this season going into the game, and now I'm  really excited," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe said. "The kids have  dedicated themselves since last January to having a winning season.  </P> <P> "They worked hard in the weight room and it showed tonight. Last year, we  didn't have a running game. Tonight, we ran against a good football team. I'm  surprised, but I also know how hard the kids have worked."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach didn't exactly get off to a rousing start, throwing an  interception on its first play and losing possession on a fumble the next time  it had the ball. But Cunningham led the Oilers on an 80-yard drive late in the  first quarter with some fine running that resulted in a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach's defense limited Corona del Mar to only one first down in the  opening half, and the Oilers extended their lead to 12-0 early in the third  quarter following an interception by Cunningham, who doubles as a strong  safety.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar had problems generating offense all evening, but the Sea Kings  had figured to start slowly this year with a sophomore quarterback in Todd  Kehrli. Kehrli completed only 6 of 17 pass attempts, repeatedly overthrowing  open receivers.  </P> <P> "The kid just needs to get some playing time," said Dave Holland, Corona del  Mar coach. "We didn't have the ball much tonight, and they've got almost their  entire defense back, so this was a big test for him. We're going to be all  right. It will just take time."  </P></p>

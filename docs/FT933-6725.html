			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Roads scheme for Heathrow PLANS TO relieve traffic congestion around London's Heathrow airport and the south-west section of the M25 motorway were published by the Department of Transport in a consultation paper yesterday. Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick, the engineering consultants, have recommended a road and rail project that could cost up to Pounds 830m. It could eventually lead to faster Underground and rail links to Heathrow from London's Waterloo station and relieve pressure on Thames bridges. It includes a Pounds 580m road which would need a Thames crossing. The consultants offer a choice of rail routes to complement the Pounds 580m road proposal - which is to build a new road from the A3 Hook junction in Hampshire to the A4/A312 near Heathrow to relieve the heavily congested routes through town centres in this area. Route 1, which would cost Pounds 250m, would go via the Kingston Loop and the Windsor line. It would use existing lines but require tunnelling at Heathrow, a new flyover at Twickenham and a third track on the Windsor line. There would be interchange facilities with the forthcoming Paddington to Heathrow Express rail link and with the London Underground Piccadilly Line. Route 2 would cost Pounds 200m and follow the Kingston Loop and the Shepperton branch line as far as Kempton Park. It would then go north, crossing the Windsor line along a new track parallel to the proposed road. It would need limited tunnelling at Heathrow before connecting directly to rail and underground lines. Copies available from Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick, Scott House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hants. Pounds 20.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 10 March within its  regular 8-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the Republic.    Reporting from Maglaj, Hajrudin Fermic says that "the  chetniks are once again showing their criminal face and as well  as an intention to kill as many civilians as possible and ruin  the city. To do so, they are indiscriminately using all means,  shells of all calibers, snipers, antiaircraft weapons.  Yesterday afternoon, a new massacre was carried out in Maglaj:  One person was killed and 13 civilians seriously wounded from a  tank shell fired on the very center of the city from (Procijep).  Many of those people will remain permanently disabled.  Unfortunately, before this, four people were also killed  yesterday by snipers and howitzer shells and mortar bombs. If  we recall that the chetniks have again sent back a convoy  carrying food, the picture of the Maglaj inferno, of the  sufferings and agony of the population will be complete."    Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "last night on the  Brcko battlefield did not pass without aggressor's attacks. The  enemy used 82-mm mortars to pound Vranovaca, Cupici, (Kladanj),  and [name indistinct], while infantry battles were waged in  [words indistinct] of the Brcko battlefield." Further on,  Deronjic says that "the aggressor's regrouping on the Brcko  battlefield is more and more (?intensive). During last night,  movements of enemy military trucks were noticed along the Donja  Mrka-Lipovac-Donji (Radjici) line. Movements of chetnik armored  vehicles have been observed on the central section of the Brcko  battlefield, as well as along the Potocari-[name indistinct]  line."    A correspondent reading a report by the 3d Corps (?Press  Center) reports that "the chetnik offensive on the Zavidovici  battlefield is going on" and that, as for other regions covered  by the 3d Corps, "chetnik artillery is shelling (?Bugojno,  (Dubac), and the free villages of the Donji Vakuf and Gornji  Vakuf regions. Zenica and Travnik were shelled with a shower of  projectiles. The truce signed between the Army of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) is  being respected in general. However, there are still  provocations, particularly by sniper fire."    Izudin Durakovic reports from Gracanica that "last night on  this section of the battlefield passed in occasional  provocations with antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft  guns on the defense positions and with Bofors guns on populated  places. The defense lines are still stable and unchanged."    Mirza Sadikovic reports that "in the last 24 hours, the Serb  aggressor's attacks on Bihac gained in intensity. Artillery and  infantry assaults on the defense lines on both Bihac section of  the battlefield and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Heights are  particularly frequent." "Several howitzer shells were fired  from (Goriok) at Bihac (?and its) outskirts and [name  indistinct] region, as well as the Bihac-[name indistinct] road  and villages on the right bank of the Una River are under  constant artillery fire."</p>

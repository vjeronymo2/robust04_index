			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STALLONE'S STARDOM  </P> <P> Thank you for Christon's insightful article. I have admired Stallone's drive  and career since he walked into my office as a virtual unknown starring in a  tiny film called "Rocky."  </P> <P> As then-president of the Rogers &amp; Cowan Motion Picture Division, I, along  with my staff, had the assignment of publicizing "Rocky" and, ultimately,  Stallone.  </P> <P> It was apparent from the first meeting that Stallone knew who he was; it was  not apparent that he would become the biggest movie star in the world, but, as  the early moguls of this industry always said, a star is born when the camera  loves you and the audience loves you -- and both did when he played the roles  that were pure Stallone.  </P> <P> I always wonder why the media finds it necessary to look for more. Stallone is  Stallone, and a very good one at that. "Macbeth"? "Richard III"? Leave them to  Derek Jacobi, perhaps the greatest stage actor of our time (but) who just  doesn't work on the screen.  </P> <P> Christon points out Sly's human side and the pain that goes with always being  in a window. Maybe it will help the public understand what goes on when one  becomes a "star."  </P> <P> DALE C. OLSON  </P> <P> Dale C. Olson &amp; Associates  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

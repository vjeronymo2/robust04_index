			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ALLY WINS PARTY POST OVER HARD-LINER  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev secured the election Wednesday of his nominee as  the Soviet Communist Party's deputy general secretary, winning a showdown with  the party's resurgent conservative wing.  </P> <P> Vladimir A. Ivashko, a moderate party leader from the Ukraine, defeated Yegor  K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the party's powerful Politburo,  for the post as Gorbachev's deputy, according to the official Soviet news  agency Tass.  </P> <P> Ivashko's election by delegates to the current party congress was an important  victory for Gorbachev. It not only gave him a like-minded deputy to manage the  party's affairs on a daily basis, but it should help stem the conservative tide  that has seemed to threaten his political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> The contest between Ivashko and Ligachev was, in many respects, the climax to  the struggle between those party officials wanting to accelerate and broaden  perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, and those concerned about the  party's virtual abandonment of many long-held positions.  </P> <P> A vote for Ivashko, 58, was portrayed throughout the debate as a vote for  perestroika, a vote for Gorbachev, a vote for faster, more fundamental changes.  </P> <P> Conversely, a vote for Ligachev, 69, was presented as a vote to consolidate the  party around its traditional Marxist positions and to reinforce the discipline  that has enabled it to lead the country for 73 years.  </P> <P> Details of the election results will be available this morning, editors at Tass  said, and the relative balance of forces within the party will become clear  only then. A third candidate, Leningrad professor Anatoly Dudyrev, 45, who  nominated himself, was also on the ballot but not thought to be a real  contender.  </P> <P> In a separate ballot, delegates reelected Boris Pugo as the chairman of the  party's Central Control Commission in charge of discipline, Tass said. Pugo had  only nominal opposition.  </P> <P> The contest for deputy general secretary, a new post created as part of a broad  reorganization of the party, was fought without compromise. Ligachev declared  that he was running as the "Marxist-Leninist" candidate, and Ivashko stressed  his unquestioning support of Gorbachev and his reforms.  </P> <P> "I believe there is an overwhelming majority who support the principles of  Marxism-Leninism," Ligachev said, calling for the party to pursue "a union of  democratic forces supporting socialism" to press ahead with careful reforms but  without losing its orientation.  </P> <P> Radicals rushed to the microphones in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses to  protest. If Ligachev won, they warned, tens of thousands of people, probably  more, would quit the party. Ligachev, who has sought such a "self-purge" of the  party, seemed unperturbed.  </P> <P> Amid this uproar, Gorbachev intervened in the debate to cite obscure Central  Committee rules, prepared more than two years ago, that candidates could go  onto the ballot only if there were no objections against them. Radicals quickly  restated their criticism of Ligachev as objections to his candidacy, and  Gorbachev called for a vote on whether Ligachev could be a candidate.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Ligachev was voted off the ballot, 2,293 to 1,916, stunning even  radical reformers. Whether Gorbachev had engineered this was unclear, but he  and his supporters did not disavow the result.  </P> <P> Ligachev's supporters, caught by surprise, were not prepared to mount a similar  challenge -- even if they had the votes.  </P> <P> Again, there were protests, including direct criticism of Gorbachev for the  "shabbiness" with which Ligachev, a veteran leader, was being treated.  </P> <P> And then another vote, 2,349 to 1,816, reversed the earlier decision on the  grounds that the party congress could overrule the procedures of the Central  Committee.  </P> <P> "Americans have a lot of bad jokes about 'who's on first?' " a Communist Party  official said after watching the congress turn into a political and procedural  shambles Wednesday afternoon. "But that question is so painfully relevant right  now. Up or down, in or out, we have little idea of who is being elected to  choose our fate, and that is what reduces even the most cultured among us to  ranting and raving."  </P> <P> In this confusing seesaw, Gorbachev appeared distressed and uncertain about how  to proceed. What might have been a clear political victory for his forces was  now complicated by procedural errors.  </P> <P> And the strength of his own position clearly rested on his appeal to the  delegates for their support rather than on a fully accepted political vision.  </P> <P> The elections came as the 4,700 delegates to the congress, which opened July 2,  slowly began to conclude their debates over the party's new platform, its  statutes and other declarations and prepared to elect a new, policy-making  Central Committee before closing on Friday.  </P> <P> Gorbachev had told delegates to the congress that the two people at the top of  the party hierarchy should hold similar views to ensure the implementation of  perestroika, the smooth functioning of the 18-million-member party and the  consolidation of the country's increasingly disparate political forces.  </P> <P> "It is important that these two people be close," Gorbachev said, making it  clear that he wanted Ivashko -- and no one else.  </P> <P> Ivashko, who had been the leader of the Ukrainian party, has hewed close to  Gorbachev's reformist line over the past five years, and he has moved rapidly  from a local party secretary's post in Kharkov in 1986 into the top levels of  the Soviet political hierarchy under Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "As much as I have before, no matter what my job, I will be working for  perestroika," Ivashko pledged. "We have to do everything to renew the party and  change its priorities. . . . "We have to understand, too, that without us,  without the party, nothing will be left of perestroika."  </P> <P> But Ivashko, quite suddenly, seemed a very flawed candidate rather than a man  who could, in the manner of the U.S. vice president, ensure support for the  national leadership from a critical region.  </P> <P> Summoned back to Kiev, where the Ukrainian Parliament is in emergency session  to debate the republic's sovereignty and discuss a political strike by coal  miners, Ivashko, along with other members of the Ukrainian delegation here,  refused to go -- and quit his post as president of the Ukraine.  </P> <P> Accused of showing greater loyalty to the Soviet party than to the Ukrainian  nation and the government that he headed, Ivashko resigned abruptly on  Wednesday, saying that he could not continue in the face of the deputies'  opposition, particularly that of Communist Party members of the Ukrainian  parliament.  </P> <P> Even a party spokesman said he was unable to explain, however, why Gorbachev  would nominate to the No. 2 party position a politician who had just  acknowledged in a formal letter of resignation that he did not have the support  of Communist Party members from his own republic.  </P></p>

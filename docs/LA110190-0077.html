			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILITANT SOVIET MOLDOVANS BESIEGE BORDER POSTS;  </P> <P> ETHNIC UNREST: FRICTION IN THE SOUTHWESTERN REPUBLIC BALLOONS INTO A REVOLT  AGAINST COMMUNIST RULE.  </P> <P> Moldovan militants by the thousands besieged checkpoints on the Soviet-Romanian  frontier Wednesday and threatened to massacre KGB border guards as an ethnic  quarrel in the southwestern Soviet Union ballooned into revolt against  Communist rule, reports from state-run media said.  </P> <P> "People are destroying Lenin monuments and hate everything associated with the  Soviet Union, Soviet army and Communist Party," Yuri Roshka, first deputy  chairman of the Popular Front, a grass-roots organization, reported from  Moldova's capital of Kishinev. "A mass campaign against the Communist Party is  well under way."  </P> <P> Although reports from Roshka and other Moldovan nationalists could not be  independently confirmed and journalists were barred from southern areas of the  republic, Soviet media including Pravda confirmed sieges and seizures of party  offices.  </P> <P> Although no large-scale acts of violence were reported, events over the past 24  hours in the largely agricultural land where more than 4 million people live  marked the latest breakdown of Soviet authority and the Communist Party's  standing in society.  </P> <P> "One clear aim is noticeable behind these and other similar instances of  flagrant lawlessness, namely, to excite anti-Communist hysteria to the limit,"  V. Tsyra of the Moldovan Communist Party's Central Committee staff warned.  </P> <P> Matters came to a boil in Moldova last Thursday when a 150,000-member ethnic  minority, the Gagauz, began unauthorized elections to create a parliament for  their own separate state, which they proclaimed in August after complaining of  discrimination by Moldovans.  </P> <P> Reacting swiftly, the nationalist leaders who took power in Kishinev earlier  this year nullified the elections and proclaimed a state of emergency. The  Kremlin agreed to a request from both sides and dispatched heavily armed  Interior Ministry troops to keep the peace.  </P> <P> However, many Moldovans, finally free to utter nationalist demands after  decades of repression, accused President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Moscow of  blatantly favoring the "Gagauz extremists." More than 30 busloads of  discontented nationalists set out for the Prut River that marks the  Soviet-Romanian boundary, the Popular Front reported.  </P> <P> Before sunrise, more than 3,000 nationalists surrounded border checkpoints at  Goteshty and Stoyanovka to demand the withdrawal of two regiments of Soviet  Interior Ministry troops patrolling the Gagauz area and their replacement by  Moldovan police, the official Tass news agency reported. Interfax, an  independent news service, said as many as 7,000 Moldovans took part.  </P> <P> At Stoyanovka, crowds showered the checkpoint with rocks and burned down the  fence that surrounded it, Tass said.  </P> <P> "The blockaders threatened to annihilate the personnel and their families and  to 'wipe the posts from the Earth,' " it reported, quoting officials of the  elite KGB unit that guards the Soviet border.  </P> <P> Protesters also threatened to cross into Romania to seek assistance there.  Moldovans and Romanians share a common language and heritage, and Moldova --  officially called Moldavia until last summer -- was part of Romania until the  Kremlin annexed it in 1940.  </P> <P> When news of the rampage along the frontier reached Kishinev, a helicopter  whisked First Deputy Premier Konstantin Oborok and other top officials to the  scene, where they opened talks with the militants, Tass said.  </P> <P> Late last week, as many as 40,000 Moldovans, calling themselves "volunteers,"  streamed to the borders of the Gagauz area to challenge the minority group's  independence claim, and reports reaching Moscow indicated that as they return  home, they are focusing their hostility on the Communist Party.  </P> <P> In Kishinev, returnees held a mass rally to demand that the Communist Party  cease being "the hand of Moscow on Moldovan territory.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the uneasy dialogue that began last week between Gagauz  secessionists and Moldovan regime was institutionalized with the setting up of  a "bilateral conciliatory commission."  </P> <P> Moldova's Gagauz are Turkic-speaking Orthodox Christians whose ancestors fled  from northeastern Bulgaria to present-day Moldova to escape Ottoman rule during  and after the Russo-Turkish war of 1806-1812.  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Nuclear tries to clean up its contaminated image: A look at the environmental case for building more nuclear power stations as British Coal this week raises questions about the economics of an industry under government review The environment is a central plank in the nuclear industry's case for building more power stations, even though many people associate nuclear stations with radioactive contamination. Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility which supplies a quarter of the electricity in England and Wales, says in its submission to the government's nuclear review: 'Nuclear power is an essential part of policy to achieve the government's current environmental commitments and its long-term sustainable development objectives.' The utility's first argument is that nuclear stations emit virtually no pollutants. Unlike fossil fuel generators they produce no sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides, the main causes of acid rain, nor do they emit carbon dioxide, the 'greenhouse gas' which is thought to cause global warming. By Nuclear Electric's calculations existing nuclear power stations save emissions of 840,000 tonnes of sulphur and 17m tonnes of carbon a year. The UK is committed to bringing carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and lower targets are likely after that. The company says that more nuclear power is essential if these targets are to be met. Its second point is that nuclear power is much cheaper than it looks because of its relatively small environmental impact. The submission cites findings by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment which measures the cost of environmental damage from fossil-fuel power generation. These suggest that the nuclear industry saves more than Pounds 300m a year compared with coal-fired plants. State-owned Scottish Nuclear estimates that its operations will save Scotland Pounds 450m in environmental costs between 1995 and 2010. The third point is that nuclear power is the only significant fuel source which pays its full environmental cost. Coal and other fossil fuels damage the environment but do not foot the bill. The main environmental cost is disposing of nuclear waste and decommissioning old plant. Nuclear Electric says that this is included in the price of nuclear-generated electricity. Scottish Nuclear says its stations 'make full provision for these expected future costs. The costs are therefore internalised in the cost of nuclear generation'. Much of the debate surrounds the claim that the government will be unable to meet its targets for pollution levels - particularly for carbon dioxide - without nuclear power. The only forecasts the government has made appeared in the Department of Trade and Industry's Energy Paper 59, published two years ago. Of the six possible scenarios in the paper, only one - which assumed low economic growth and high energy prices - showed lower carbon dioxide levels in 2000 than in 1990. All forecast sharp rises up to 2020. One reason was that the paper assumed nuclear power would decline as ageing stations were shut down and not replaced. But the fossil-fuel power generators, such as National Power and PowerGen, are more optimistic that the targets can be met. They point to the cleaning equipment being fitted to two of the largest coal-fired stations and the tough new targets being introduced by the pollution inspectorate. One fossil-fuel official said: 'We think we can get there with room to spare.' Greenpeace, the environmental group, has submitted a detailed rebuttal of the nuclear industry's claims. It accepts that nuclear emissions are low, but says this advantage is greatly outweighed by other problems, particularly radioactive waste. Greenpeace says it would be more sensible to reduce emissions through greater energy efficiency, renewable energy, and better use of fossil fuels. Nuclear Electric has anticipated these objections. Its submission says that even if all these alternatives were exploited to the maximum, they would still not yield as big a result as building more nuclear power stations. One of the problems for the nuclear industry is that its estimates of the cost of environmental damage by fossil fuels are only that - estimates. For the industry to deliver its benefits in cash terms the government would have to introduce measures to make fossil fuels pay their full environmental costs. Scottish Nuclear suggests a tax on fossil fuels, legislation which places a premium on nuclear electricity, and a system of pollution permits which could be traded among power generators. A group of leading energy academics headed by Professor Ian Fells of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne suggested to the government that an 'energy policy framework' be created to overcome the short-termism of the markets and bring out nuclear's long-term environmental advantages. The academics said: 'Nuclear power has an important role to play in environmental protection, security of supply and ultimately to compensate for exhaustion of fossil fuels. It would not be prudent to leave its fate to market forces.'</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Total to withdraw from Canada TOTAL, the French energy group, is withdrawing from Canada as part of moves to sharpen the focus of its international operations. Total will receive about CDollars 180m (USDollars 140.7m) from the sale of its 53 per cent stake in Total Canada Oil and Gas of Calgary. It has sold its 18.8m shares to an underwriting syndicate led by Nesbitt Thomson, a Canadian broking company, for CDollars 9.75 a share. The French group is concentrating its international efforts on oil and gas properties in Colombia and Indonesia. It has also recently been granted concessions in Burma and Algeria. Total will make a handsome profit from the sale of its Canadian subsidiary, which was spun off from Colorado-based Total Petroleum North America in mid-1991 at CDollars 5.75 a share. Total Canada's business centres on exploration and crude oil and gas production, while Total Petroleum's focus is downstream refining and distribution. The Canadian company's investment rating has benefited from aggressive exploration programmes in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Total Canada earned CDollars 6.1m in the first nine months of last year on net revenues of CDollars 57.7m.</p>

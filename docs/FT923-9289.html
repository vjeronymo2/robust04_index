			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand shareholders split over board SHAREHOLDERS in Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, are split over whether to endorse a proposal for a new board of directors which will be voted on at an extraordinary meeting of the board of representatives on August 10. UNI's board of representatives is comprised 50 per cent of company employees and 50 per cent of shareholders, representing some 60 per cent of the company's share capital. Mr Martin Imbach, representing Geneva-based CB Capital Bank, Uni's third-biggest shareholder with a 4.28 per cent stake, has complained that the proposed board includes only two new people. Uni's board of directors and Mr Jan Erik Langangen, president and chief executive, resigned at the end of last month. This followed the board's failure to gain full backing from shareholders for a share issue this autumn to raise up to NKr2bn (Dollars 343m) in fresh capital. Shareholders had become disillusioned by Mr Langangen's failed strategy to create a pan Nordic insurance alliance and the NKr4.7bn investment to acquire a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia Forsikrings. Mr Helge Dietrichsen, a Uni Storebrand spokesman, said yesterday that although the board of representatives could 'technically' reject the proposal, it was unlikely to do so because several leading shareholders had endorsed the proposal before it was publicly announced. Mr Imbach said that Mr Anders Echoff, an Oslo attorney who was offered the post of chairman, works in the same law firm as the head of the nominating committee, which put his name forward.</p>

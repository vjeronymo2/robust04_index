			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Snecma loss widens to FFr804m Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine manufacturer, suffered increased net losses of FFr804m (Dollars 136m) last year, compared with a deficit of FFr794m in 1992. It resulted from declining sales and the costs of restructuring measures. The company warned of continuing difficulties. According to the group, which manufactures engines for military and civil aircraft, the losses were largely due to exceptional charges related to the sharp fall in turnover to FFr19.57bn last year from FFr22.84bn in 1992. Exceptional charges in 1993 rose to FFr995m in 1993 from FFr570m the previous year. Snecma said cost-cutting and restructuring would be 'followed and amplified in 1994'. Snecma said there were some reasons for encouragement. Net debts were reduced to FFr1.12bn at the end of last year from FFr2.56bn at the end of 1992. Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which was privatised last year, is set to take control of Co-operation Pharmaceutique Francaise (Cooper) following the decision by one of Cooper's largest shareholders to back its FFr3bn bid. Sabeton, which holds 21 per cent of Cooper, had previously declined to support the offer. Rhone-Poulenc had set a target of winning 67 per cent of Cooper's shares to proceed with the bid.</p>

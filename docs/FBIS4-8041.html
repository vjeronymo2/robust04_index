			<p>BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 8 Apr (TANJUG) -- Democratic Party  Chairman Zoran Djindjic told Jagodina Radio today that Russia  will raise the issue of lifting the sanctions against the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the UN Security Council within  a month.    "During our visit to Russia we drafted a request, which  expresses joint views of all leading Russian parties as regards  Yugoslavia, demanding that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  the Russian Federation raise the issue of lifting the sanctions  at the UN Security Council," Djindjic said, adding that he had  received assurances that a majority in the parliament would vote  for this document, about which the Yugoslav public will be  informed either today or tomorrow.    "Russians have a clear interest to show their teeth to the  West on the example of Yugoslavia, and to show that Russia has  not lost the position of a superpower. They will do it not  because of the Serbs, but because of Russia," Djindjic said.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Cherry auction fetches Dollars 13.7m: Saleroom Furniture and works of art collected by the late Wendell Cherry, co-founder of Humana, one of the world's largest providers of healthcare services, realised Dollars 13.7m (Pounds 9.1m) at Sotheby's New York auction house at the weekend. The sale was a great success, and was almost 95 per cent sold by value. The top price, Dollars 2.2m, was paid for an elaborate desk, mounted by a clock, confidently attributed to Boulle, the leading French furniture maker of the early 18th century. It was part of the grandiose furnishings of Cherry's 5th Avenue apartment. A 17th century Florentine bronze of Hercules wrestling with a bull, attributed to Tacca and once owned by King Louis XIV, sold, above estimate, at Dollars 1.43m, while a George II giltwood 12-light chandelier, attributed to Mathias Lock, fetched Dollars 827,500. In contrast Sotheby's auction of Old Masters had a mixed response. It totalled Dollars 13.145m., but was less than 60 per cent sold by value.</p>

Kolesnikov Has Not Resigned"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Observers do not rule out  that the rumors of Mikhail Kolesnikov's resignation have a  connection with the intentions of the presidential entourage to  go ahead with the so far postponed reorganization of the  military agency envisioning the transfer of some of the defense  minister's functions to the General Staff chief. In this event,  the head of state would like to have a different general filling  the position of General Staff chief, who will be subordinated  directly to the president. Besides, news of differences among  the top command may help discredit the military agency, thus  providing an opportunity to reorganize the Defense Ministry and  carry through shakeups there even despite the resistance of  Pavel Grachev, whose relations with Boris Yeltsin have clearly  soured of late.</p>

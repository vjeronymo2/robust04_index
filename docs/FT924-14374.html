			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Standard sues over Bombay scandal STANDARD Chartered Bank, the British bank, yesterday stepped up its battle to recover money it lost in the Rs35bn Bombay securities market scandal by filing a fraud claim against Citibank, the US bank which was also active in the Indian capital markets. In a claim filed yesterday in New York, Standard Chartered is suing Citibank for Rs1.16bn (Pounds 24m), alleging fraud and breach of contract in securities transactions in Bombay, between September 1991 and March 1992. Citibank denies liability. The scandal, which erupted in April, has resulted in about 15 arrests, the resignation of a cabinet minister, the liquidation of two small Indian banks and heavy losses at some other financial institutions, including Standard Chartered, which says it lost Rs8.9bn. The three sets of disputed transactions between Standard Chartered and Citibank took place in the informal inter-bank securities market, which is at the centre of the scandal. According to the claim, Standard Chartered in each case, bought bonds from Citibank , but the US bank did not deliver the underlying securities, since transferring ownership of securities is cumbersome in Bombay. Instead, in common with market practice, Citibank passed to Standard Chartered bankers' receipts, which are written promises to deliver securities at a future date. On one occasion, it also passed a Securities General Ledger (SGL) transfer note, which is an instruction to the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to transfer securities from one bank to another. In the transactions central to the claim, the bankers' receipts and the SGL note passed by Citibank to Standard Chartered were not issued by Citibank but by affiliates of Canara Bank, a fast-growing Indian bank. Trading third-party receipts and SGL notes was common practice. But Canara Bank's affiliates apparently ran into difficulties and were unable to deliver the securities to Standard Chartered. Standard Chartered claims it paid Citibank for securities the US bank agreed to deliver. It accuses Citibank of misrepresentation and, in the case of the SGL note, knowingly passing a 'worthless' instrument. Citibank's case is understood to be that Standard Chartered has no claim against Citibank, only against the issuers of the bankers' receipts and SGL note. Standard Chartered has separately filed a criminal complaint in India alleging that it was defrauded by two former employees and a group of Indian brokers and bankers. They deny the charges, which are being investigated by government authorities.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Warhol works disappoint - New York Art Auctions of impressionist, modern, and contemporary paintings and sculpture - produced mixed fortunes for Sotheby's and Christie's in the opening two sessions in New York this week, writes Antony Thorncroft. Sotheby's sold only 53 per cent of the 78 lots on offer by value, for a total of Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 5.7m). There was negligible bidding. The great disappointment was Andy Warhol - with only two of 12 paintings by him finding buyers. 'Old Telephone', painted in 1961, made Dollars 552,500, below estimate. It was a bad evening for Mr Charles Saatchi, who was trying to sell his version of Carl Andre's bricks, 'Equivalent VI'. The Tate Gallery has never been forgiven for paying Pounds 6,000 for Equivalent VIII, another group of firebricks by Andre, but the price now looks cheap. Mr Saatchi was hoping for Dollars 300,000 for his version; in the event they failed to sell. Paintings by Franz Kline and Clyfford Still, both of which were expected to top Dollars 1m, were also not sold. The more experimental sculpted works did best, with auction records for Mark di Suvero's creation of weathered timber, rope and nails (which fetched Dollars 470,000), and for Donald Judd's construction of 10 stainless steel units fitted to a wall at six-inch intervals (Dollars 233,500). In contrast, Christie's was encouraged by its Tuesday auction, selling all the top lots. The most important contemporary painting on offer this week, 'Number 19, 1948' by the leading abstract expressionist artist Jackson Pollock, in which he dripped and poured paint on to the canvas, sold for Dollars 2.42m, slightly above its top estimate, to a private European collector. A 1967 painting by Francis Bacon, 'Study for a portrait in a revolving chair', was on target at Dollars 1.2m, while 'White Brushstroke I' by Roy Lichtenstein, in which he parodied the spontaneous brush stroke which characterised abstract expressionism, made Dollars 728,500. There was keen bidding by European and American private collectors at the Christie's auction. Other names to sell were Robert Rauschenberg, whose 'Nettle' fetched Dollars 717,500, and Jasper Johns, whose 1980 'Untitled' realised Dollars 607,500. The prices are well below levels of four years ago but they suggest that more modest estimates attract buyers back to the market.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Observer: Whisky sour Everyone knows Whisky deserves more attention than Soda, so Chris Patten's Norfolk terrier decided to take matters into its own paws. Still smarting from the star treatment accorded to fellow pooch Soda when it went awol nearly two years ago, Whisky decided to bite back. Unfortunately, sinking your teeth into a 21-year-old workman has consequences in Hong Kong, even if you chew bones with the governor nightly. Whisky was unceremoniously carted off to the official dog kennels for observation - a risky way to gain attention in a place where canine criminals have been known to incur the death sentence.</p>

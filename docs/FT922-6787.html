			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Managing health care in Czechoslovakia HEWLETT-PACKARD has been selected as the prime vendor by Universal Health Insurance Company (VZP) to set up computer systems to handle health care for the Czech republic. The value of the contract is estimated at USDollars 10.5m (Pounds 5.83m). VZP, which was established late last year by the Czech National Council, is to replace the previous 'no-cost' centralized health care model of the Czech republic. Sister republic Slovakia is expected to set up its own health care system in the near future. The planned HP open systems-based computers will be installed at VZP headquarters in Prague and at 75 branch offices within the Czech republic. Beginning in the second half of 1992, the system will handle all payments to doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. Record keeping for the 10m eligible insured persons and the collection of insurance premium payments will begin officially at the start of 1993. The HP computing systems, which are adjustable to meet the computing needs of the individual branch offices, will include a client/server configuration using HP's Precision Architecture RISC-based HP 9000 Series 800 business servers, HP-UX Unix-based operating system, personal computers, data terminals and printers. The system will offer the ORACLE relational database management system as well as applications software developed by APP Systems, a Czech software developer. The first HP computers are already being installed for applications testing, with the bulk of the systems scheduled to be installed in the second half of this year.</p>

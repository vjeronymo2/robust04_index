			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> READER CAN'T BEAR ARTICLE ON HUNTING  </P> <P> Boy, oh boy . . . Sounds great . . . What does a guy have to do to become a  heroic great bear hunter like Mr. Rose? Scaring an animal up a tree with a pack  of "radar packing robotic" dogs and shooting it between the eyes with a shotgun  sounds like the sport for me! Is there a secret handshake in this club? Does  ESPN plan on covering it this fall? Or is this like playing baseball? To be any  good do you have to have started as a boy? Kudos to The Times for occasionally  (Nov. 14) writing one of these reminders that this is not a sport. It's nothing  but cold-blooded murder!  </P> <P> WILLIAM PIKE, Carlsbad  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ASPHALT COMPANY IS OPERATING IN DEFAULT  </P> <P> Huntway Partners L.P., a Valencia company that operates oil refineries that  make liquid asphalt, said it is in default of some provisions of its credit  agreement with its bank, although it is current on interest and principal  payments.  </P> <P> Huntway said it is operating in default with the "acquiescence" of the bank.  </P> <P> Huntway also said that in response to its greater need for working capital -- a  result of higher prices for oil, a key ingredient in asphalt -- the bank agreed  to increase the amount of money available to Huntway for working capital under  various credit facilities. The combined total of the two facilities remains $41  million, but the working capital line has been increased by $5 million to $15  million.  </P></p>

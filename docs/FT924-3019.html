			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: The S word: teach yourself summit-speak What is subsidiarity? The principle - originally a part of Catholic doctrine - that decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level. But this is only one definition among many. Cynics say subsidiarity means anything and nothing. Many believe EC leaders at Edinburgh should sort out what the word actually means before they start deciding how it should be applied. . . . . and transparency? Euro-speak for openness. The Community would be more 'transparent' if policy-makers consulted citizens more often, held more debates in public and refused to use words like subsidiarity and transparency. So why do we need these principles? To bring EC decision-making 'closer to the citizen', according to the conclusions of the October's Birmingham summit. Member governments and the Commission believe greater openness will help a disgruntled populace understand how and why the Community acts. The application of subsidiarity - or 'nearness' as the leaders described it at Birmingham  - should ensure that citizens are not vexed by unnecessary EC measures which could be better handled at national level. What might be decided at Edinburgh? Rules for applying subsidiarity: for example, the circumstances in which member states, rather than the Community, should take responsibility for telling their citizens what to do. The big member states have also pressed for the right to put legislation through a subsidiarity test at the draft stage. These efforts have been resisted by their smaller EC partners who see this as a way of overriding their ally, the Commission. It all sounds a bit theoretical - what will this actually mean? There could be substantive changes to legislation. Some measures may be scrapped or amended. The Commission and member states have been compiling hit-lists of existing and proposed EC laws which could be revised or withdrawn in the interests of subsidiarity. The real argument will be about the size of the legislative bonfire and what should be on it. The UK, for example, has suggested that 71 directives should be scrapped, including some controversial environmental and social affairs legislation. The Commission has a more modest list of 24. Will there be any real effort to increase transparency? Certainly. John Major's idea of televising the opening of the Birmingham summit was pooh-poohed by fellow leaders, but at Edinburgh they will consider giving the public 'access' to important policy debates between ministers - possibly by televising them to journalists. What are the likely benefits of all this? Well, if decision-making is made more open and guidelines on subsidiarity are respected, policy-makers may at least think twice before drafting or approving unnecessarily intrusive legislation. . . . . and the risks? The main risk is that member states will use the subsidiarity principle as a weapon to fight for national interest, by resisting legislation they do not like. That could undermine the single market, disarm EC environmental legislation, much of which has to be centrally policed, or render Community competition policy toothless. But at least the process will be out in the open, won't it? Not entirely. Much of the wheeling and dealing between member states will still go on behind closed doors - in meetings between senior diplomats in Brussels, for example, or at so-called 'informal' meetings between ministers. Policy debates may prove entertaining - although speechifying in nine languages seems unlikely to top the TV ratings - but the serious horse-trading will still take place in camera rather than on camera.</p>

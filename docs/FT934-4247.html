			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Zurich offers feeling of security, even at peaks - A third year of strong growth Barring a last minute catastrophe, the Swiss stock market is about to complete its third year in a row of handsome double digit growth. Yesterday, the all-share SPI index finished at a record 1,782.81, a dazzling 44 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year, while the narrower SMI index of 18 leading shares was an impressive 33 per cent ahead at a peak of 2,819.3. Both indices also advanced strongly this week, in response to a combination of good economic statistical news and rumours - a couple of them a bit wild - of mergers and acquisitions. Yet the near unanimous message of equity analysts, both in Switzerland and in London, is that the Swiss market is still a good one to buy. 'It is still one of the markets where the investor has the least cause to worry,' says Mr Nick Stevenson, European equity strategist at London bankers SG Warburg. 'We are still fundamentally positive,' echoes Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Banksal Oppenheim (Schweiz) in Zurich. 'The interest rate story is not over, and Switzerland has a better record on inflation than most other European countries.' The argument for the Swiss market, in a week when the latest statistical reports from the federal government showed inflation down to 2.2 per cent and annualised GDP rising 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, is not as difficult to make as one might think. 'The market has been liquidity driven, and that will continue, but it will also be more earnings driven than other European markets,' says Mr Bernhard Tschanz of Credit Suisse in Zurich. The basic point is that the long awaited economic recovery in Europe is still looking uncertain, and in those circumstances, the renowned defensive qualities of the Swiss market plus the country's strong currency make it a safe bet. Moreover, in spite of its long and strong run, the Swiss market is still not that expensive on fundamental grounds compared with other European markets. Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss brokerage research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, points out that the market is only 28 per cent ahead of the previous peak in 1987, and he estimates that current prices are at about 13 times 1994 earnings. Although the prospects for economic recovery in Europe are uncertain, the leading companies in the Swiss market are all expected to show continued earnings growth. Baer estimates that overall earnings will be up 25 per cent next year compared with a probable 16 per cent growth this year. And analysts believe that the reliability of earnings estimates in respect of Swiss companies is far greater than that on companies elsewhere. The leading Swiss companies may have adopted international accounting standards in the last couple of years, but everyone knows that they have not lost their ultra conservative tendency to stuff away and use reserves to smooth out earnings trends. The big Swiss banks, which are having a spectacular year thanks mainly to volatile securities and currency markets, are piling up provisions as high as they can so that even if next year's results are not as brilliant as this year's, they can still show some profit growth. Many industrial companies, for whom 1993 has not been pleasant at all, are doing the same thing, on the grounds that a little more red ink this year won't bother anyone, but will help their expected rebound next year. Thus, the expectation is that the market will continue rising, although Mr Tschanz and others caution that there is not the same upside potential as there has been. They also warn that it will become more difficult to pick winners. 'It will be much more important to pick the right stocks in 1994. This year, you just had to pick the right sectors,' Mr Tschanz says. For the moment, the top banks, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies are still the favourites, although other interest rate sensitive stocks, such as the electric utilities, Electrowatt and Motor Columbus, have attracted a lot of interest lately. These two are also the subject of merger speculation, as both Credit Suisse, which controls Electrowatt, and Union Bank of Switzerland, which controls Motor, are said to want to shed these peripheral activities. Retailers got a boost this week from the report that real consumption of private households rose an annualised 2.7 per cent in the third quarter. But cyclical stocks are lying low, as recent reports from engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri and cement producer Holderbank indicated that no upturn is yet in sight. Sceptics about the Swiss market could point to that sure sign of excess, wild rumours, appearing in recent days. According to one story floating around this week, Ciba, the pharmaceutical and chemicals group, would take over Ems-Chemie, the specialist chemical maker run by the controversial Christoph Blocher. And there was a tale on Thursday that CS Holding, parent of Credit Suisse, had taken a stake in Germany's Commerzbank. The more serious worry, if it can be called that, is an earlier than expected economic recovery in Europe. 'If you believe in a big recovery, Switzerland is the last place you want to be,' Mr Stevenson says.</p>

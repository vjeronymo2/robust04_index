In connection with the implementation of construction  projects -- the construction of a hotel in Almaty by the ABV --  machines and structural steel have so far been exported.  Moreover, telephone systems, television and radio sets,  medicine, medical-technical equipment, and drugs are supplied.  Altogether two dozen Austrian companies already are active in  Kazakhstan, eight have their own representations. Many  enterprises handle the market via Moscow. The 40 participants  in the fourth Austrian economic mission in Kazakhstan were very  satisfied with the talks.    The export business is facilitated by a credit line  established by the Control Bank. However, importance is  attached to a high Austrian net output (70 percent), Richter  stressed. The Kazakh Alem Bank is responsible for inclusion in  the guarantee line.    The Kazakh Government has worked out a list of priorities,  which encompasses 34 projects that can be included in the  guarantee line of the Control Bank. Documentation on 15  projects with a volume of $350 million (about 4.2 billion  schillings), on which an expert report already exists, have been  passed on to the Alem Bank.    B.V. Utemuratov, deputy minister for foreign trade, stressed  that there are already 21 joint ventures with Austria. Among  the projects already in progress are the delivery of machines  for the production of enamel varnish wires, the establishment of  a plant for plastic doors and windows, a spirits factory, the  delivery of electronic television and radio facilities, and of  medical equipment.    The Voest-Industrieanlagenbau Company wants to modernize a  metallurgical combine in Karaganda and build two continuous  casting plants. The project will probably cost 4 billion  schillings (Austrian share). The project is to be implemented  in a consortium with Turkish and Japanese partners. One is also  negotiating on the establishment of joint ventures within the  framework of the agreement on railroad cooperation.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Delors paints future of EC in rosy hues THE European Community faces two more years of low growth. But assuming interest rates and employment costs fall, it can look forward to balanced budgets, falling unemployment and 3 per cent annual growth in the second half of the decade, according to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. In an after-dinner presentation to EC finance ministers on Friday night, he offered a seductive vision of Europe's prospects by the year 2000. He was careful to point out that his economic model was not a forecast. It was more a tool for focusing minds on what had to be done for the EC to return to the path of economic virtue. As such it provided clues to his forthcoming 'White Paper' on competitiveness. Mr Delors insisted that 'Europe is not a mature economy'. The EC needed to recapture the spirit of the 1980s when the prospect of the single European market generated jobs and growth. In order to keep pace with the US and Japan, ministers needed to focus on three areas: Competitiveness. Lower interest rates and a higher dollar would strengthen Europe's position, he said, but ministers also needed to tackle the costs of hiring labour. If employment costs were judged to be too high, member states needed to decide whether to reduce spending in other areas such as health. Alternatively, they could finance high social costs through other measures such as the carbon energy tax. Labour markets. While avoiding specifics, Mr Delors suggested enough flexibility to draw guarded applause from Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer. Strengthening the relationship between growth and jobs. Mr Delors remains wedded to big capital spending projects, particularly in the area of telecommunications or US-style 'information highways'; but he also believes that Europe could create more jobs by marginally lowering its rate of increase in productivity in service industries. If member states can make progress in these areas, prospects for growth and jobs will improve dramatically, according to Mr Delors. Other factors would be a more favourable outlook for world trade, including an agreement in the Gatt Uruguay Round; an increase in investment from 19 per cent of EC gross domestic product to 24 per cent; and higher global savings rates. On this basis, Mr Delors suggested unemployment could fall from 11 to 7 per cent, and budget deficits in the EC could fall by 5 per cent in 1996 to zero by the year 2000. This must look like a stairway to heaven for Europe's economies as they struggle to escape recession; and Mr Delors no doubt intended it as such. Yet the implicit message is that the EC is condemned to two more tough years. This makes it highly unlikely the Community will be ready to form an economic and monetary union by 1997.

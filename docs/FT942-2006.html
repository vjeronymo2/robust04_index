			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profits boost for Steel The spotlight fell on British Steel as analysts hastened to upgrade profits and dividend expectations after the group returned to profit with fig-ures at the top end of market expectations. The shares responded by rising 5 3/4 to 139p and it was the day's best performing stock among FT-SE 100 constituents as 11m shares were traded. Profits for the year to April 1994 came in at Pounds 80m, against a loss of Pounds 149m in the previous year, but it was the 50 per cent increase in the final dividend, making a year's total of 2p, which brought most surprise. Analysts were pleased by the positive tone of the results meeting and said the new legal challenge to the European Commission asking it to adhere more strictly to its Steel Aid code was a sign of the renewed confidence at the group. The upgrading of current year expectations moved the range from a previous Pounds 199m to Pounds 300m, to Pounds 270m to Pounds 325m, while that of the dividend moved from previous expectations of 3p to a new range of 4p to 5.5p.</p>

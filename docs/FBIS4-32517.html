			<p>BFN     [Text] [First announcer] General Rasim Delic, chief of  staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, has been interviewed by  Slovenia Radio and TV. Coming up are excerpts from this  interview.    The first question asked by the Slovene Radio and TV  reporter  was: What is the current situation in the battlefields? You  have recently toured the front lines. Delic replied:    [Second announcer] As a matter of fact, I am almost  constantly touring the frontlines because that is the only way  to be in command and in charge of your units. This is not  merely a matter of visiting confrontation lines. This is rather  a matter of gaining an insight into the situation and of  carrying out the orders and decisions I issue on behalf of my  general staff to the units under my command. We should say we  expected that this signed cease-fire might hold in combination  with those demands we had raised as a condition for our signing  it -- that is, that the problem of Gorazde ought to be resolved,  that the NATO ultimatum and UN Security Council resolutions are  carried out and that the Serb aggressor's combat operations in  other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina should come to an end.    What we are finding on the ground, though, indicates that  these fundamental demands have not been honored and this in  itself means that no basic conditions have been created for this  agreement to come into being. We were ready, we had prepared  maps, we had specified locations for liaison officers'  observation points. The Serb side, however, did not accept this.    [First announcer] He stated that this failure to comply with  the cease-fire was yet another reason for the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army and the Croat Defence Council [HVO] to maintain their  combat preparedness at an increased level. There was also a  question about new weapons. Asked whether weapons were finding  their way to Bosnia-Herzegovina and if so, how, General Delic  said:    [Second announcer] Apart from what has been captured from  the  enemy, one should say that most of the weapons, including those  shown on TV, have come out of Bosnia-Herzegovina's factories.  These are the main sources of our weapon supplies, as the  embargo is after all being implemented as regards the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army as opposed to the other countries of the  former Yugoslavia. Peace would come sooner if there were no  embargo despite the fact that many are saying that the opposite  would take place. If there were a balance of weapons and if the  Serb aggressor were to start suffering defeats, that would force  him to change his policy or to replace the people who have  bloodied their hands as he would want to have this problem  solved.    [First announcer] One of the questions was how the joint  headquarters of the army and the HVO is operating. General  Delic said:    [Second announcer] It ought to be said that the joint  headquarters has not been set up [5-second transmission break]  cannot order. The essence and the aim of this joint  headquarters is to speed up the resolving of the remaining  issues and further issues in the relations between the army and  the HVO and to seek solutions. In other words, this is a  coordinating body which suggests solutions in these spheres.  The intention behind the establishment of this headquarters and  new bodies within the joint headquarters was to gradually create  a joint, unified command body of the federation's future army.    [First presenter] The next question was: Do you believe that  there will be no more clashes between the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army and the HVO?    [Second announcer] It is logical to believe that they should  not take place,as all political conditions have been created for  sorting out things on the ground in the way they should be  sorted out, to the satisfaction of both peoples. I personally  think there is no reason for such a clash. Hence, our shared  goal is to fight the Serbian aggressor.    [First announcer] The last question: Every war has its own  logic, its roots, its beginning , its culmination and, of  course, its end. Which stage has the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina  reached? General Delic said:    [Second announcer] In terms of balance of powers, I  personally think that the war has reached its peak. I believe  that the Serbian aggressor has no longer the potential to  reinforce its ranks. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has the  strength to embark on the liberating phase of armed struggle.  This is, of course, a simplified view as it does not take  account of international factors and their influence on the  armed struggle in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has hitherto been a  very important element. In any case, in my opinion, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has finished the defensive phase of war  and is now entering the phase of war for liberation. Anyway,  preconditions have been created for pressing ahead. Obviously,  this renders the Serbian aggressor impatient in a sense as this  creates pressure for finding a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina  as soon as possible -- hence, everything they have occupied by  force and aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina may come under  threat, Army General Rasim Delic, chief of staff of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, said at the end of the interview with  Slovenia Radio and TV.</p>

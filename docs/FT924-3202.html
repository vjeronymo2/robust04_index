			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Leading Article: The threat to India INDIA HAS experienced a nasty shock, but it can recover. The destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya by Hindu militants on Sunday night has outraged Moslems everywhere. The erection of a makeshift Hindu temple in its place has compounded the damage. The fierce religious passions that have been unleashed by the right-wing Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) threaten the stability of the sub-continent. The focus has naturally been on the past two days of rioting; by last night the death toll had reached 400. Yet India has survived events of similar dramatic impact, including the assassinations of Mahatma Gandhi by Hindu activists, Nehru's daughter Mrs Indira Gandhi by Sikhs, and her son Rajiv by Tamils. Moslems have long been in conflict with the Indian state in Kashmir, as have Sikh terrorists in Punjab. The republic has been subjected to religious and sectarian disputes since the great partition of 1947. The birth of modern India and Pakistan was marked by bloody internal conflicts; there have since been two wars between them. A state that can survive all that during its first half-century of independent existence will not easily be driven to self-destruction. The urgent task for the Indian government now is to re-establish order. This would best be achieved by the continuance in office of the prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao. Mr Rao's policy of appeasing the BJP, particularly during the early months of his initially shaky government, was one of the errors that led to the disaster at Ayodhya. But a change of government would not necessarily lead to greater stability. In July Mr Rao tried to deflect the BJP's campaign against the mosque by referring it to the Supreme Court. Now he has the chance to act with greater force. He has begun to do so. The site around the Ayodhya mosque/temple has been cleared of 50,000 militants, with no casualties. There is a delicate tactical problem to settle here. Delhi is pledged to restore the mosque, but if it dismantles the makeshift temple, now widely regarded as a holy place, it may alienate moderate Hindus. The ideal solution, the building of a shrine to each religion, side by side, and the dedication of the site to national reconciliation, may be unreachable. Leaders of the BJP and allied organisations have been arrested and charged with inciting violence. This is a calculated risk by Mr Rao's administration. It might further inflame militant Hindus, but, against that, virtually the entire Indian press has come out against the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. Moderate Hindus are appalled; the flirtation of some of them with the BJP, an upper-caste led party, may be over. Thus strengthened, Mr Rao stands a chance of reasserting the government's authority and concentrating on his programme for economic liberalisation. Success in that endeavour is a prerequisite if modern India is to survive. Mr Rao has shown courage on the economic front; he must now act to restore India's tradition of religious tolerance.</p>

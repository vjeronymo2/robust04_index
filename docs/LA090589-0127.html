			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BJORN BORG, SINGER EXCHANGE VOWS  </P> <P> Former Swedish tennis star Bjorn Borg and Italian pop singer Loredana Berte  exchanged vows in a Protestant church ceremony today, 24 hours after their  civil wedding at city hall.  </P> <P> A pastor from Berne, Switzerland, celebrated the private Lutheran ceremony in a  tiny downtown church. Church officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity,  said about 20 guests attended. They included Borg's parents, his son Robin and  Adriano Panatta, a former player who captains the Italian Davis Cup team.  </P> <P> As they had been Monday, reporters and photographers were barred from the  ceremony. An Italian weekly magazine, which had been given exclusive rights to  the story, employed bodyguards to keep onlookers and reporters outside the iron  fences of the church.  </P></p>

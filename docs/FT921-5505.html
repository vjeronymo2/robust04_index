			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Bush promises to veto bill increasing tax on the rich PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday promised to veto new legislation that would increase taxes on the wealthy, as the Senate pressed forward with a bill to do just that. Mr Bush had already threatened to veto a tax bill agreed last week by the House of Representatives, and yesterday repeated his warning for a revised version of the bill pushed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee. 'The House passed a tax increase, which I'll veto, and now the Senate is going about the same business,' he declared yesterday, as the debate over what sort of tax package is needed took centre-stage in the presidential election campaign. Mr Bush has challenged the Democrat-dominated Congress to pass his package of fiscal measures, including a cut in the capital gains tax, which he claims would help to stimulate the still weak US economy. The Democrats have challenged his package, saying it is financed by accounting gimmicks and complaining that it favours the wealthy. They have countered with a proposal to give a tax credit to middle-income families, to be paid for by higher taxes on the rich. Senator Bentsen's version of this proposal would provide a tax credit of Dollars 300 (Pounds 171.40) per child, to be paid for by a new 36 per cent top-rate tax band which would affect couples earning over Dollars 210,000. Both the rate and the threshold are higher than the version passed last week by the House, countering President Bush's charge that the measure would result in a tax increase for the middle class. The Bentsen tax package is estimated to be worth Dollars 60bn over six years. President Bush has been constrained in his attacks on the Democrats in Congress by the challenge he issued them in his State of the Union speech; by asking them to work in a bipartisan way to pass his package of tax measures by March 20, he has hindered himself from criticising them. Now that the Democrats have produced their version of the tax package, including the increase in income taxes on the wealthy, a measure anathema to Mr Bush, he is free to attack them again. The president also said he now regretted his 1990 budget compromise with Congress, in which he agreed to an increase in taxes - breaking his 1988 'no new taxes' campaign pledge - in exchange for caps on discretionary spending. 'Every once in a while, you've got to do something that tastes like castor oil,' he said, but concluded that the compromise was in his view, a mistake.</p>

He also said that the withdrawal of the Russian forces from  the former Soviet republics and from foreign countries creates  problems in providing housing for Russian servicemen.    He said that next year the volume of housing construction  will be increased and that in 1996-97 all servicemen will be  provided with comfortable apartments.    He stated that a peacekeeping force would be created in the  Volga Military District on the basis of the 27th motorized  infantry division.    In addition, there is a motorized infantry division in the  Leningrad Region which can also be used as a peacekeeping force.    This will be enough for tackling all peacekeeping tasks  within the CIS and by decision of the UN, he said.    He expressed the opinion that Russia's air force can perform  any peacekeeping mission without preliminary training.    On Tuesday, Grachev visited the construction site in the  Samara Region where 1,910 apartments are being built for  servicemen. From the Samara Region he went to Udmurtia where he  met with local leaders</p>

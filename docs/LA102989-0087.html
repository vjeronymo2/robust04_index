			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NFL SUPERMAN NOT REACHING THEIR USUAL HEIGHTS THIS SEASON  </P> <P> They're known as "athletes," as if the rest of the quarterbacks in the National  Football League have trouble getting out of a huddle without tripping.  </P> <P> They're known as "prototypes" of the NFL quarterback of the future, as if Roger  Staubach and Fran Tarkenton never played the game.  </P> <P> And they're both called "Superman," although both are acting more like Clark  Kent these days.  </P> <P> They're John Elway and Randall Cunningham, and they are the worst nightmares of  defensive coaches in the NFL. They specialize in turning beastly plays into  beauties with their improvising, their nimble feet and their rifle arms.  </P> <P> And about the only thing they wanted to say Thursday was that although they'll  both be on the field at Mile High Stadium in Denver Sunday, they won't be  playing each other -- or even paying that much attention to each other, for  that matter.  </P> <P> "I don't think John Elway and I are looking at it like that," Cunningham said  when asked about Sunday's showdown between the two quarterbacks everyone seems  to think are the most athletic in the NFL.  </P> <P> "All this prototype thing is blown out of proportion," Cunningham insisted,  noting there are many other athletic quarterbacks in the league, including a  newly emerging one, Green Bay's Don Majkowski.  </P> <P> Elway, in a conference call with the Eagles' press corps, said, "The press  always makes a big thing about quarterback versus quarterback."  </P> <P> He agreed with Cunningham that whoever had the best game between the two  quarterbacks Sunday would probably win the game, but added, "That's the case in  just about any football game."  </P> <P> The pair had nothing but nice things to say about each other, as might be  expected the week before they meet.  </P> <P> Cunningham, who has been compared with Elway ever since he broke in as a  starting quarterback, said, "I thought when you're compared to John Elway, that  was a compliment. I like his style, he's low-key and not controversial.  </P> <P> "He's been to the Super Bowl twice. Unfortunately, he hasn't won one, but give  him time. He'll get one."  </P> <P> Elway said he had only seen Cunningham play in two Monday night games. "I've  been impressed with him. He's a better runner than I am. He has great speed and  a very strong arm."  </P> <P> The two have more than that in common this season, however. Both are having  off-seasons statistically, both seem to be running less and both are winning  more. The Broncos sport a 6-1 record and a three-game lead in the AFC West,  while the Eagles are 5-2 and trying to keep pace with the 6-1 New York Giants  in the NFC East.  </P> <P> Elway said that, at least in his case, his numbers are off because his team is  running better. Cunningham said that as long as his team is running and  winning, he's not going to complain about poor passing numbers, either.  </P> <P> "I haven't been throwing nearly as much because now we have a running game,"  Elway said. "My objective is to go out and win. I'm not going to worry about it  (his quarterback rating)."  </P> <P> Elway's running numbers also fell off last season, something he attributed to  leg injuries. "I'm as healthy now as I have been in a couple of years," he  said.  </P> <P> He's picked up 107 yards on 26 carries, including runs of 29 and 31 yards. But  the Broncos sport a decent 1-2 running punch of Bobby Humphrey and Sammy Winder  that enables them to control the ball without having to resort to their passing  game as they have in the past.  </P> <P> And, Elway said, that he and Cunningham are running less might have something  to do with the fact that they're improving as quarterbacks. "It'll decrease as  time goes on and we're more comfortable with our offenses. You often scramble  because you're not sure what you're doing when you're back there."  </P> <P> Denver Coach Dan Reeves said there's little to choose between the two  quarterbacks. "I think both of them are outstanding and we're fortunate to have  athletes like that at quarterback."  </P></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Bosnian Serbs in accord on aircraft INTERNATIONAL peace mediators and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic agreed yesterday that all Bosnian Serb aircraft should be put under United Nations control at airfields around their base in Banja Luka. The agreement came after one of the meditators, Lord Owen, former British foreign secretary, bluntly accused Bosnian Serb forces of violating the UN resolution banning flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina. But the accord appears to amount to a concession to the Bosnian Serbs, as the aircraft will not be moved out of Bosnia as planned earlier. Instead, they will be stored and confined to hangars at the Banja Luka airfield under the supervision of UN forces. Mr Cyrus Vance, joint mediator with Lord Owen in the Yugoslav conflict, said: 'We have reached a satisfactory solution.' The agreement was reached after the two men held talks in Belgrade with Mr Karadzic. Earlier the peace envoys met Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic, who had backed a plan for Bosnian Serb forces to hand over aircraft to the Yugoslav federal army. Their visit came as Serb forces claimed to have routed Moslem and Croat defenders of Jajce, in central Bosnia. Bosnian army commanders yesterday denied the town had fallen. The loss of Jajce would be another severe setback for the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group, who comprised 44 per cent of the pre-war population of 4.35m. Serbs control some 70 per cent of Bosnian territory and Croats about 25 per cent. The fighting highlights how difficult it will be to gain compliance on the ground with the new Bosnian constitution published by Lord Owen and Mr Vance in Geneva yesterday. Aimed at preventing the division of Bosnia, it calls for the central government to control foreign, trade and defence policies but gives wide powers to 7-10 new regional governments. It proposes extensive international involvement in the internal affairs of a future Bosnian state, especially to enforce human rights. The constitution would give foreign judges a majority on both a constitutional court and a human rights court. The Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia would appoint human rights ombudsmen and an international human rights commission for Bosnia-Hercegovina with a wide remit to investigate abuses. There would also be international supervision of the melding of the three Bosnian forces into a single national army, though the plan does not provide for a long-term UN peacekeeping role. The central government would have representatives from the four communities (Serb, Croat, Moslem and 'other'). Parliament would have a lower house elected by proportional representation and an upper house appointed by provincial governments, broadly reflecting an ethnic balance. Representatives of the warring factions met Mr Martti Ahtisaari, the Finnish mediator for Bosnia, in Geneva to discuss the proposals.</p>

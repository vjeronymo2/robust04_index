			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following review of the 10 May issue  of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Al-Azhar and Ulema Support Organizing Religious Rulings    2. Ulema and Preachers Conference Convenes After 'Id    3. Al-Mansurah University Organizes Course for Prayer  Leaders    4.

The report says that the ulema stressed that passing  religious rulings is a "serious task" that must not be left to  irresponsible and unqualified people. The ulema say that  al-Azhar Mosque and the Islamic Research Council are the only  parties qualified to pass religious rulings so that the Muslims  may unify their stance and eliminate their differences. The  report cites named ulemas' views on the issue.  <H5>  ULEMA AND PREACHERS CONFERENCE CONVENES AFTER 'ID </H5>   A 150-word unattributed report on page 2 notes that the  second general conference of ulemas and mosque preachers will  convene under Awqaf Minister Muhammad Mahjub after 'Id al-Adha.  The three-day conference will discuss numerous important issues  affecting the Islamic and Arab nations through research papers  prepared by senior ulemas. It will also discuss the tasks of  preachers during the current stage.  <H5>  AL-MANSURAH UNIVERSITY ORGANIZES COURSE FOR PRAYER LEADERS </H5>   A 1,200-word report by Khalid al-Kilani on page 3 states  that  after a request from the Awqaf Ministry, al-Mansurah University  has arranged an advanced course for prayer leaders and preachers  in al-Daqahliyah Governorate to qualify them for the job. A  named prayer leader said that the course opened the  participants' minds to new horizons and linked them to their  "political and legal society." They learned how economic  wars--which affect the Islamic world, particularly Egypt--are  launched. The head of the Legal Studies and Consultations  Center, Dr. Muhsin al-Bih, said these courses will broaden the  role of universities in serving society. He notes that the  center drafted a program outlining the "state's general policy"  in all fields so that the prayer leaders will benefit from their  activities.  <H5>  WRITER PRAISES BANNING SATELLITE DISHES IN GOVERNORATES </H5>   In a 700-word column "With All Frankness" on page 6, Basyuni  al-Halawani praises the Dumyat and al-Daqahliyah governors'  decision to ban the use of satellite dishes in cafes and clubs  to protect ethics and prevent perversion. He says that  satellite programs carry dissolute films representing foreign  values and behavior into our Islamic society. He says this  deluge of films is designed to extricate what has remained of  our Islamic roots, values, and traditions. He notes that  several Arab and Islamic countries have made "courageous  decisions" banning the use of satellite dishes.  <H5>  WRITER VIEWS BOOK ON ISLAMIC RESISTANCE TO WEST'S DOMINATION </H5>   In his 800-word "Islamic Views" column entitled "The Western  Challenge to the Islamic World" on page 7, Islamic Writer Dr.  Muhammad 'Imarah discusses a book by Jewish writer Martin  Kramer, who reviews Muslim ways of resisting the Western  invasion of the Islamic world. He notes that Kramer lists all  the conferences that the Muslim leaders have held on this  subject, stressing that they have all failed. Kramer concludes  by saying that the Muslims never agree on anything. 'Imarah  admits that Kramer is right that the Muslims have consistently  differed in all their conferences, but he notes that this is  only half the truth because he fails to say why they differed.  'Imarah asks if the Muslims differ because they believe in  Islam.  <H5>  WRITER CRITICIZES FOREIGN-FUNDED RESEARCH </H5>   In a 650-word column, Majdi Salim reviews development of the  colonialists' attempts to dominate other countries. He notes  that the colonialists now have "local ideological and cultural  agents." He says that the West's attempts to dominate the  Islamic countries have local advocates. Under the claims of  "freedom and civilization," they introduce the West's defects.  The "most dangerous" thing they are doing is their public  activities and research on social, economic, and cultural  aspects of Egyptian society funded by foreigners. This research  must be checked, he concludes.  <H5>  WORLD ISLAMIC COUNCIL APPEALS TO YEMENIS TO STOP BLOODSHED </H5>   A 150-word report by Jamal Salim on page 20 notes that the  World Islamic Council for Relief and Call has issued a statement  appealing to the Yemeni parties to exercise self-restraint and  immediately stop "the bloodshed of Muslims." The report notes  that the council appealed to the Arab and Islamic heads of state  to act promptly to contain the crisis and initiate a fraternal  dialogue between the two parties. The statement "condemns the  enemies of Yemeni unity who instigated the sedition."  <H5>  WRITER SLAMS WESTERN INDIFFERENCE TO BOSNIAN TRAGEDY </H5>   A 300-word column by 'Adil Dayf on page 21 notes President  Clinton's defense of U.S. vacillation on dealing with the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the West's inaction. He says that  this reflects the magnitude of the tragedy of the Muslims in  Bosnia and Western "plotting and indifference." He says that  the new world order is "plotting" against the Muslims and is  "rewarding" the Serbs for their crimes against Muslims.</p>

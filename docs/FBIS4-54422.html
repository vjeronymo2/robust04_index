			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 26 April (MTI) -- According to the  chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz), Viktor  Orban, there will be no coalition agreement between the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ), and all guesses of this kind are provocations  by the MSZP. Orban made the remarks at a rally held in Budapest  on Tuesday [26 April].    The Fidesz chairman's firm position is interesting in light  of the fact that numerous conjectures have appeared in press in  the past weeks, whereby the liberal SZDSZ and the Socialists  would reach agreement and enter into coalition. As four liberal  parties -- Fidesz, SZDSZ, Agrarian Federation, and  Entrepreneurs' Party -- have already formed an election  alliance, a possible agreement between the SZDSZ and the MSZP  would question this agreement.    Reacting to the guesses so far, several Fidesz leaders have  firmly stated they are not willing to cooperate with the MSZP.  "In order for the SZDSZ to agree with the MSZP, they would have  to betray us first," Orban said.    According to Orban, the MSZP is not in the favorable  position  it presents itself to be. He predicted that the alleged  advantage of the MSZP will further dwindle in the remaining  period of the election campaign.</p>

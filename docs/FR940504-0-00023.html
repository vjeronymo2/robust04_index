CDM focused on collecting VOCs from the application, conveying, and bagging stages of the end seal lining process. Warehousing areas were disregarded by Lake and CDM as being infeasible to control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDM performed a complete RACT analysis tailored specifically for Heekin's Hamilton County, Ohio can manufacturing facility. A total of five end seal lining processes (10 applicators) were considered for control. Before discussing the results of CDM's RACT study, it should be noted that CDM disregarded the carbon adsorption control option because of the difficulties encountered with regeneration. Steam regeneration of spent carbon creates a hazardous waste requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costly disposal. Hot air regeneration requires an incinerator which duplicates the incinerator control technology option. Also, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that hexane, the major solvent in the end seal lining compounds, has a poor adsorption efficiency. Thus, Lake's reporting of a cost effectiveness figure for a carbon adsorption collection system is not supported by CDM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDM focused on thermal and catalytic incineration as preferable control options and determined that the capital cost for a catalytic incinerator system was $1,854,600, approximately $320,000 higher than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capital cost of a thermal incineration system. The annual operating expense for the catalytic incineration system was estimated to be $1,608,719 per year, $2,008,719 per year for thermal incineration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dividing the annual cost to operate the control system by the quantity of VOC reduced yields the ``cost effectiveness'' of the control system. CDM's analysis utilized three figures for the quantity of VOC removed per year: (1) The quantity of VOC removed to reach equivalence with the general end seal compound limit of 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon (i.e., 27.89 tons per year); (2) the quantity of VOC removed assuming a 40 percent capture efficiency (i.e., 87.70 tons per year); and (3) the quantity of VOC removed assuming that Perlis' 80 percent capture efficiency is correct (i.e., 175.4 tons per year). Heekin does not believe that an 80 percent collection efficiency on the system is possible but has calculated the ``cost effectiveness'' for comparison purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDM determined the following ``cost effectiveness'' figures. For scenario one, removal of sufficient VOCs to reach equivalence with the 3.7 pounds per gallon emission rate limitation, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $71,597 per ton of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $57,681 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario two, removal of VOCs with a 40 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $23,235 per ton of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $19,310 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration. For scenario three, removal of VOCs with an 80 percent capture efficiency, the ``cost effectiveness'' is $10,853 per ton of VOC removed for thermal incineration and $9,020 per ton of VOC removed for catalytic incineration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the above detailed ``cost effectiveness''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures were calculated based on can end residence times through the collection system reported by Lake. However, Heekin's actual residence times are much shorter. Lake reported a total residence time for Van Camp of 1.5 minutes. During the Perlis test, a residence time of 3.0 minutes was contrived to gain an 87 percent capture efficiency. Heekin's process lines have a total residence time from lining to stacking/bagging of only 20 to 65 seconds. The discrepancy between Heekin's residence time and the Van Camp/Perlis residence times means that the collection efficiencies for the capture system if it were to be installed at Heekin would be much lower than the collection efficiencies reported by Lake. Thus, the cost effectiveness figures estimated by CDM are on the low side compared to what Heekin could actually attain because the amount of VOCs removed would be much lower. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Add-on control is not used on any end seal compound coating lines. USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible for this application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

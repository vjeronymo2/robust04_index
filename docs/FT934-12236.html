			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo finance chief quits ALL EYES will be on the performance of Lasmo today after confirmation came late in trading yesterday that finance chief Mr Michael Pavia is to resign at the end of this week. Last week Lasmo repeatedly denied any imminent boardroom changes. The departure has been widely tipped in the market, with speculation gathering momentum over the past few days. One market watcher believes that more boardroom moves could be on the way. 'It is an overweight board at the moment,' he said, adding that the company is likely to pause a while for the City to digest the consequences of Mr Pavia's leaving. The finance chief's departure is by far the most important change that the City was expecting. 'He has paid the price for Ultramar,' said one analyst. Sentiment surrounding Lasmo plunged after its acquisition of rival oil company Ultramar early last year. Takeover interest in Lasmo, on which there has been steady speculation since British Gas's unsuccessful attempt several years ago, may be heightened by Mr Pavia's resignation. Potential bidders may see the departure as a willingness on the part of Lasmo to take on new ideas. European companies, as opposed to UK-based ones, are expected to show the most interest. Upbeat oil analysts believe the shares will bounce today as Lasmo has cleared the air of the persistent market rumours. 'It will mark a turning point,' said one. Yesterday the shares held unchanged at 145p in moderate turnover of 2.9m, although the announcement came in the last half-hour of trading. Others believe the market had already factored Mr Pavia's departure into the share price, although they think there will be a short-term boost on the news. 'We may see US buyers becoming excited.' US interests are thought to account for over 20 per cent of Lasmo shares. Early speculation on a successor to Mr Pavia again focused on Mr John Walmsley, former finance director of Enterprise Oil who left the company earlier this year.</p>

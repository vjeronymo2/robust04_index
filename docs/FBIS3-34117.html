During its five days of meetings, the committee  discussed the two issues of arms control and regional security  arrangements. It also discussed working papers and ideas  submitted by Egypt and Jordan and a joint Russian-American  working paper, a compilation of what was discussed during the  committee's previous meetings.    The group also discussed a paper submitted by the  International Atomic Energy Agency on measures to inspect  nuclear weapons.    During the meetings, members also formulated a joint paper  to  be presented to Mideast capitals to form an official opinion and  prepare for the paper's presentation during the meetings of the  General Committee slated to start in Doha at the end of April.    MENA has learned that the coming meeting of the second  working group will be held in Turkey during March to prepare for  the meetings of the General Committee.

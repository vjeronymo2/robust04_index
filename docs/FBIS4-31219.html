			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Brcko, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croats on Monday  evening shelled from multiple rocket launchers civilian targets  in the Serb town of Brcko in the north, TANJUG's correspondent  reports.    An all-out alert has been sounded in the town.    According to incomplete reports, the attack was launched  from  the Croat positions at Vucilovci around Orasje, some seven  kilometres northwest of Brcko. There are no reports on  casualties, but material damage is extensive. This was the  seventh artillery attack on Brcko in the past four weeks, and  the fourth launched from Bosnian Croat positions. In all four  attacks, the Croats used 128-mm shells. The Moslems mostly use  tank shells. The first six attacks left seven people dead and  40 wounded, including several children.    U.N. observers, who have been deployed in Brcko since May 7,  have conducted their own investigations into all the attacks on  Brcko, which is situated at the neck of the vital corridor  linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb  Republic.    The Serbs on May 7 proclaimed a unilateral truce in the  Brcko  area and reached agreement with U.N. peacekeepers on the  deployment of U.N. observers in the town. Early in May, the  local Croat commander in Orasje announced an all-out attack on  Brcko by the combined Croat-Moslem force whose only aim, he  said, was to cut the Serb corridor along the Sava River.</p>

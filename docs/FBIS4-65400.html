			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Government policy statement delivered by Prime Minister </F> Silvio Berlusconi to the Senate in Rome -- live]    [Excerpts] Mr. Speaker, Senators: The government I am  presenting to the chambers of parliament, and for which I am  seeking your confidence, in itself marks a completely new event  in our country's public life.    First, this government has been born of a republican  parliament for the first time elected on the first-past-the-post  system desired by the vast majority of citizens. Second, the  government's support is based on elected MPs in political  parties which have never had ministerial responsibilities. This  radical innovation is the fruit of a long and tortuous crisis of  credibility of our institutions -- a crisis which swept away in  name and deed the quasisupremacy of the parties which 50 years  ago gave life to the Italian republic.    Good policies are always the result of reflecting on what a  maestro of renaissance ideology called the experience of things  ancient and things modern. Indeed, what is new, for better or  worse, is defined by its relationship with what is old. On this  question -- in other words, on our relationship with the  fundamentals of 50 years of republican life -- we must make one  thing once and for all clear from the outset, because domestic  and international public opinion is curious about and interested  in this change, and in some cases it is understandably concerned.    This government sees itself, without any doubt, as being  within the legal foundation embodied in the constitution of  1948. Following the defeat of fascism in Europe the choice of  democracy as the as the supreme value of liberal action is the  common and explicit objective of all components of the majority.    The past has been judged in different ways, but all agree in  considering civil liberty as the basis for public life and in  loyally respecting our constitutional architecture. The unity  of the country and its indivisibility is another principle on  which the majority agree without any reservation. Italy is a  republic with a strong system of local and territorial autonomy  wanted by all constituents on the basis of a long tradition  whose roots are set in the communal life. The world sees us as  the country of 100 cities, and our geographical, political, and  cultural landscape would be unrecognizable if the great and rich  variety of life which both unites and distinguishes the North  from the South is not taken into account. Within these limits  and boundaries, the majority regards with respect and interest  the federalist debate, which is old and new both in its European  dimension and in the sense of a better working of the nation.    Loyalty to NATO, economic and political cooperation in the  European Community, the repudiation of war as a way of solving  international disputes, the principles of the Helsinki  conference on the stability of borders, on the defense of human  rights, and on the self-determination of peoples and  noninterference: These are other fundamental components of this  coalition's identity and the programme with which it has  undertaken to form a government able to match up to Italy's  international role.    Notwithstanding the great progress made in the Middle East  peace process and the extraordinary election of Nelson Mandela  as president of South Africa, new wars are breaking out across  the world. In the heart of black Africa, in Rwanda, terrible  acts of violence are even being carried out on poor and  defenseless children. The Bosnian tragedy on our doorstep  continues to make the news, but neither Europe nor the United  Nations seem able to bring it to an end. Anywhere in the the  world where freedom and human rights are brought into question,  Italy's voice must be heard, and the government will make every  effort to make it heard. Solidarity, based on the Christian and  humanistic roots of our culture, is at the heart of our foreign  policy.    The foreign minister is in Brussels, and is already at work  to affirm and strengthen Italy's leading role in the European  Union. Italy will support the widening of the Union, even toward  East Europe, and increasing commercial links with the free trade  areas of North America and the Pacific -- also to avoid the  consolidation of spiralling protectionism. Careful  consideration of the Maastricht Treaty must not delay the  realization of the unification program, and we must forbid any  indulgence concerning common defense or foreign policy.    Two important foreign policy appointments are the European  Council meeting in June, and the G-7 summit. In the first of  these meetings the realization of Jacques Delors' white paper  will be discussed and the new president of the Union's  Commission will be chosen. In Naples, where Italy is playing  host to the leaders of the world's major industrialized nations,  careful attention will be paid to the issue concerning the  treaty of friendship with Russia, and the summit will be the  occasion to consolidate our country's role in the world as well  as its tried and tested diplomatic skills.    Senators, respect for our country's republican traditions  and values cannot be unjustly used to hinder the process of deep  change and renewal that our people urgently and passionately  demand from us. The citizens have every right in the world to  demand this from their representatives in the government. For  years institutions and political parties were the same thing.  Laws and civil servants -- starting from the cabinet -- were  totally controlled by the forces which, under the old  proportional system, represented the country. It has quite  rightly been said that parties must step back today, while  maintaining the role assigned to them by the constitution. I  can add that we must move from the government of parties to the  government of institutions. We are lucky because those who wrote  the constitution devised a process to introduce any kind of  change, provided they do not affect the state's form and the  nation's unity. We must carefully follow that process.    One of the main characteristics of the majority which has  created the new cabinet can be seen by everybody: The forces  which support this government are together not because of some  alliance decided by the parties, but because they have received  a direct mandate from voters. What we called the Freedom  Alliance was an alliance for the elections which has now become  a government coalition with a clear mandate from the citizens.  [passage omitted]    We now have to take a step: We must return the power to  public institutions, starting with parliament. We must  re-create a strong respect for the state and respect for the  cabinet. We must repeat that private associations, parties, and  movements have an essential role to play. But this role is  clearly different from the role played by those in charge of the  administration of public assets and those who are in the cabinet.    In this framework, it is very important to have a correct,  competitive, and loyal relationship with the Left and Center.  [passage omitted] I have to be very frank with the secretary of  the Democratic Party of the Left who said that he wants to  oppose the government democratically and within the limits of  the constitution. He called this cabinet a government which  humiliates Italy. This is not a good start. [applause] This is  the country's legitimate government, freely chosen by the voters  and led by me, chosen by the head of state. To call it  humiliating is a gratuitous insult to the prestige and honor of  the country. [applause] [passage omitted]    The presence in the cabinet of ministers belonging to the  National Alliance cannot be used as an excuse for a campaign of  defamation. [passage omitted] The opposition not only has the  right but also the duty to prepare -- with all its forces and  also with all the tricks of the trade it knows -- an alternative  to this government. But it has no right whatsoever to pursue  the goal of stopping the country from having a government.  [applause]    Senators, the government's economic program has as its first  goal the broadening of the country's productive base and the  creation of new jobs. Prosperity and happiness in this country  will first of all depend on the country's ability to give to  citizens of all ages -- and to the young in particular -- a  decent job and wage. Businessmen and the fantastic network of  small and medium enterprises which created wealth in this  country -- in the fields of agriculture, industry, and trade --  want to be helped to conquer new markets again, to be able to be  competitive and to increase productivity in order to create new  jobs. All the parties I spoke to while forming this cabinet  told me that the creation of new jobs is a hard but possible  task and that the fulfillment of this task must absolutely  follow economic and social recovery after years of stagnation.  We must control inflation and we must act to control and reduce  public debt. This means that there is little scope for new  public spending. [passage omitted] One thing is certain: State  bonds cannot be written off in any case whatsoever. The public  savings belonging to people who put their trust in the state  cannot be damaged. The government knows very well that recovery  will not be sustainable without deep and sharp action on public  spending. This is what the financial markets demand, and this  is what is required to slow down the growth of public debt.  This is also a necessary condition if we want to participate in  the process of European integration and it is a condition for  the long-term fall of interest rates and for the resumption of  private investments. [passage omitted]    A modern state, a big industrial nation -- deeply rooted in  West Europe and wide open to the world -- has many resources,  often hidden by the figures relating to the public sector. The  government and the ruling class must use these resources in  order to induce growth. This is the main task of a liberal  government. This is the the government's objective. There is  an Italy of the private sector -- both in the production and  service sectors -- which can and must be encouraged to stand on  its own feet. [passage omitted]    We must change a lot and free the private sector from  oppressive obstacles, from the weight of a suffocating  bureaucracy, from a tax burden which has become too heavy too  quickly and which has proved to be a burden for those who create  wealth and useless for the state's finances. [passage omitted]    The Greens in Italy have not yet become -- in spite of the  importance and appeal of their ideas -- as important as in other  European countries. However, this government thinks that the  research and proposals made by the Greens over all these years  must be used by the government as part of its policy. [passage  omitted]    A fundamental part of our program concerns the structure of  public and private health care. This is a very sensitive area  for Italians. Citizens know that too much is being spent and  that it is being spent badly. There is a great deal of chaos  and the inefficiency of services is a permanent slur on the  right to health care. It is urgent that managers run hospitals  and that the health care system is made more efficient and  competitive. We all feel bound to keep this promise, this  undertaking, without any reservations.    We undertake, within the first 100 days of this government  --  in the first stage of our program -- to unveil our legislative  proposals for reducing the tax burden on companies which create  real, new, jobs, for making it possible to hire workers on a  names basis; for making it possible for companies with between  three and 15 employees to hire directly; for modifying training  contracts so that they present more of an incentive to  companies; for introducing temporary work contracts and  modifying the previous government's proposals, for introducing  norms which make it possible to set working hours and create  part time jobs, above all for women, as well as other measures  which increase flexibility in the workplace; for revising norms  concerning public contracts in order to avoid the continuation  of the freeze on public administration contracts. The  government undertakes to speed up the process of privatizing  state companies, starting with INA, STET, ENEL and ENI; to  remove the tax on incomes of less than 10 million lire -- also  to meet the expectations of millions of senior citizens, who  have the right to be protected and to have the purchasing power  of their incomes safeguarded, safeguarded -- and to introduce  tax incentives to stimulate investment, especially in small and  medium-sized companies. [passage omitted]    The government's priorites will be to reduce the number of  laws, using regulations and other administrative instruments  wherever this is possible, to simplify direct and indirect  taxation, and to run the public administration keeping in mind  the needs and interests of the citizens, on whom the nation is  built and society's affluence based, and who should not be the  enemies or victims of bureaucracy. [passage omitted]    The system of guarantees safeguarding the interests of  citizens in all areas will be confirmed and strengthened, from  the administration of justice to information, a sector --  especially as far as concerns radio and television -- which must  be assured of a market comprising a qualified public presence  alongside a variety of other operators.    This government wants to bring morality to public life. This  work has been undertaken by brave judges, by press and sectors  of the political and social world. This is a government of  irreproachable people, who respect the laws and moral code of  public life. [applause] This government will not question the  independence of the judiciary. The penal system will be  supported so that those pending investigations of suspected of  corruption will be held in an atmosphere of civilized law and  respect for all laws by the Justice Ministry, the judges, and  those representing the plaintiffs and the defendants.    The government's first task is to guarantee order and public  safety so that citizens' lives are respected and safeguarded.  In this area my predecessors' record is far from negative.  Organized crime and the Mafia remain a danger and a cause for  alarm, and it would be suicidal to lower our guard now. A long  season of civil reawakening, which has visited public  institutions and society -- all of society, but especially in  the South -- has had extraordinary results. The Mafia has been  recognized for what it is -- a single, organized criminal  organization with historical and social roots which are  difficult to destroy without a collective effort on the part of  the state and the public.    Alongside the work of many honest judges, of many police  officers, Carabinieri, and of the Armed Forces, are the  committed protest movements which have raised their voices  against crime and the Mafia. The question of the often  ambiguous and always insidious links between Mafia and politcs,  between organized crime and the parties, has been tackled head  on. This country can boast of and is honored by what has been  done in the war against crime without prejudicing freedom or  constitutional rights. In common with every other area, there  are still serious problems which must be solved. The legal  authorities and the judicial police must be supplied with  improved instruments with which to operate, investigating judges  must be properly equipped, and all judges must be guaranteed  their independence and peace of mind.    At the same time, according to various sources, including  the  best informed sectors of the legal world, it would be opportune  to revise the legislation concerning cooperation the law, known  as the supergrass phenomenon. On this matter, the government  bows to a fundamental principle: It will not do anything to  weaken the capacity to cooperate or to corrode criminal  organizations from within, but it will actively operate to  prevent the supergrass phenomenon from becoming a flagrant  violation of rights. Among others, two great Italian judges  gave their lives in the battle for law against the Mafia, and in  their name -- the names are Giovanni Falcone and Paolo  Borsellino [applause] -- the government feels obliged to  continue this work. [applause]    The problem of a conflict of interest in government has  quite rightly been raised, sometimes fairly and at other times  with a touch of spite and to score all too obvious political  points, insofar as the head of this government is a businessman.  It is our belief, beyond the only too obvious considerations,  that the prime minister is fully aware of his role as the  guardian of public interest, and that Italy has a strong system  of checks and balances. There is the head of state, with whom we  have a relationship based on trust and to whom we send our  respectful regards; the anti-trust authority; the publishing  watchdog; the judiciary, the collective nature of the Council of  Ministers and its decision-making procedures; and, of course,  the special role of the opposition. Turning to the  strengthening of some of these powers, which still lack official  sanction, in its first sitting the Council of Ministers has  already decided to set up a committee of experts who by the end  of September will be called upon to make proposals which we will  undertake to transform into draft laws. The government asks,  above all in this area, that it be judged on its deeds and not  on the basis of preconceived ideas.    On the other hand, we must point out that everything is  possible as far as checking conflicting interests, apart from  one thing: You cannot establish that a businessman does not  have the same political rights as all other citizens.  [applause] There is nothing in the constitution or the legal  system of this country which casts even the slightest doubt on  the legitimacy of the formation of this government or on the  task of leading it which the head of state has given me.  [passage omitted]    Today there are conditions for a real change, to give new  breath to the great love and passion for freedom which for  centuries has fuelled our highest and most serious political and  civic life -- the state. The state has no other ideology but  that of tolerance and the most honest rejection of any form of  racism, of anti-Semitism, of xenophobia. It has the duty to  respect all minorities, including the ethnic minorities, to  attain a balance in its relationship with the different  religious beliefs. These are principles and values which we  reaffirm with conviction because we are against all forms of  intolerance and discrimination and are aware of the dangers  lurking behind any form of anti-Semitism, historically the most  odious form of discrimination in Europe but not the only one, of  defining one's neighbor as the enemy.    With the Catholic church, beyond the Concordat, there is a  relationship of coexistence and collaboration. I take advantage  of this opportunity to wish His Holiness Pope John Paul II, a  pope who has done much for freedom and peace in the world, my  heartfelt hopes for a speedy recovery. [applause]    The task of building a freer Italy belongs to everyone, to  the lay Italians and to the Catholic Italians, of which I am  one. It is a task to be carried out starting from the most  extraordinary social institution which recent times has produced  -- education open to all. [passage omitted]    Today everybody, or nearly everybody, says they are liberal  democrats. This is triumph of which we ought to be proud. If  words have any meaning, this means that the power of the state  should put a barrier, a limit, coinciding with the sphere of  indvidual rights. When a citizen ends up by depending for his  own survival on professional politicians and bureaucracy, then  it becomes useless to talk of freedom. When an excessive part  of earned or saved income is confiscated by the bureaucracy  without being put into necessary and defective services, then  the limits of power are breached and beyond the intentions an  illiberal government is born. [applause]    Without haste, without trauma, with cautious gradualness,  the  government intends to work so that the tax system gets only the  amount compatible with absolute collective needs, returning  overpayments and therefore giving greater freedom. What will  become of the social welfare state if too much is asked of the  traditional social services in crises? What will become of  solidarity? My personal reply and that of the government on  this matter is not unequivocal. Austerity implies eliminating  social benefits of the past because progressive degeneration has  led to an impoverishment of the whole of society which is an  inefficient and deceptive reflection of social solidarity. But  this should coincide with a new beginning of a policy of real  solidarity counting on effective and decisive support for the  weakest sectors, for the less protected, for those who live in  real conditions of marginalization and suffering and poverty,  which constitute a daily affront to modern society. [applause]    If I were to say what the final legacy of our government  would be, I would say that this would be demonstrating that a  freer society can be a more solid society, more coherent, and  that there is no need for a sullen government, which is a  stranger to the lives of our people, to carry out the aims of  autonomy for the individual and communities.    And it is with this spirit, and without any other meaning,  that the government has decided to set up a minister for the  family. [applause]    We will work with parliament, in a constructive dialogue  with  the opposition, on a program, approved by the political majority  in the country. It is our constitutional duty. We will attempt  to discharge it with dignity and with compassion.    The government is aware of the fact that there is a  disparity in the balance between the two houses of parliament,  with a different distribution of seats. The government believes  that it will work to respect the autonomy of the opposition.    Only an open and loyal dialogue based on mutual effort and  mutual recognition of values can produce what the country is  waiting for and what it needs -- a government of change, a  working government that enjoys the confidence of parliament and  a phase of political stability in which the majority and  opposition play their different but complementary roles. On  this point we are open to a dialogue with the opposition, in  particular with the Center, which evolves from the tradition of  Christian populism. To renounce this role would be an act of  pure irresponsibility to the country.    From this point of view I have no difficulty in asking even  the opposition, and independent senators, for a vote of  confidence which will represent respect for the needs of the  government and not necesarily as a political credit for the team  I have the honor to lead.    Finally, allow me to remind you, Mr. Speaker and senators,  of  the real spirit fuelling the coalition, the government, I have  the honor to lead. Ours is a country of extraordinary vitality,  capable of miraculous leaps which surprise the world, and joie  de vivre. For some time difficulties in political life, the  crisis in the ruling class, and a certain atmosphere of mistrust  have introduced into Italy a certain amount of universal  pessimism and skepticism which risks turning into a subtle and  lethal poison.    Our aim is to overturn this situation. Our focus is on the  people who, having more experience of life and its harshness  than of palace politics, still know that the institutions and  the state are the mirror of society. Even I, as others before  me, have had a dream -- the dream of complete openness and  returning to society, from which so many new parliamentarians  and ministers come, that impulse, vitality and creativity which  are the real great genetic heritage of the Italian people.  [applause]    To reach this goal the prime minister needs your help and  support for the government but the country also has a strong,  and I would say desperate, need to again find its strong will  and stubborness, its taste for challenge and exploring new  things, the pleasure of dislodging, wherever they might be, the  bad temptations of fear, envy, and factiousness.    My government aim remains that which made me take up  politics  and the civic duty of challenge. I believe in a great  collective enterprise, in a great adventure which has need of  fire and moral faith. I believe that it is possible to dream  with eyes wide open of the reality that is coming -- the future.  I believe that we will be able to build a more just Italy, a  more generous and more solicitous Italy toward those who need it  and those who suffer, a more modern and efficient Italy, more  prosperous and calm, more orderly and safer.    I am absolutely convinced that with the help of God and man  we will manage it. Thank you. [applause]</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: IADB agreement spurs prices of Argentina's debt PRICES in Argentine debt have rallied following the country's agreement on Tuesday for a debt reduction package with its international bank creditors. The accord was struck at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Santo Domingo. Dealers also reported some profit-taking by investors who had taken positions ahead of an agreement. The market had firmed steadily in recent weeks, as expectations of an agreement mounted. In the wake of the accord, Argentina's commercial bank debt rallied from 44 cents on the dollar to 45 cent, while its 11 per cent Eurobond issue due 1993 rallied from 102 to 104. The agreement is set to reduce Argentina's funding costs and increase access to the international capital markets for private sector companies. Argentina returned to the international capital markets in September, when it launched a Dollars 300m two-year Eurobond at a yield spread of 510 basis points above the comparable US Treasury. That deal has tightened dramatically to a spread of 290 basis points, the last 25 basis points in the wake of the agreement. Argentine Eurobonds are now almost as tight to US Treasuries as Venezuela's Eurobonds, which fell back after the country's failed political coup earlier this year. According to dealers, the flow of bond issues from Argentina is set to increase, with deals for its two telephone companies, which recently completed equity offerings, believed to be among the next batch of issues. The conversion of Argentina's commercial debt into Brady bonds under the agreement will 'attract more international interest, pushing yields down further', according to Philip Harvey, a director of Morgan Grenfell. In the next few weeks, dealers will start trading the Brady bonds on a when-issued basis. 'People are still digesting the news. Some will decide to take profits, and others will hold on for conversion into Brady bonds, hoping for further gains,' said Mr Willem Naves, head of emerging markets at NMB Bank.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Westminster council made house repairs worth Pounds 12m 'for free' Westminster City Council has failed to charge its leaseholders for Pounds 12m of repair costs since 1988, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy claims in its journal Public Finance today. People who bought their properties either under the Tories' right-to-buy legislation or as part of the council's controversial designated sales policy, currently under investigation by the district auditor, had major repair work carried out for free. The council said it had instigated its own investigation into the backlog of charges and was seeking legal advice. It said: 'There have been concerns over procedure. It may be that the report highlights inefficiency.' Labour councillors claimed yesterday that the council had been guilty of 'appalling negligence and incompetence' and suggested that the officers responsible could be liable to be surcharged. Ms Jill Selbourne, who speaks for the Labour group on housing, told Public Finance: 'The housing revenue account, that is the tenants, are paying for all this scandalous behaviour (the failure to charge for repairs earlier). This is surchargeable. Somebody, somewhere, is responsible for this via negligence.' Cipfa's journal says the surcharge could be as much as Pounds 22m, once lost interest on the charges which should have been collected is taken into account. However, Labour councillors did not claim yesterday that there is any link with the alleged use of the designated sales policy to 'gerrymander' the council's housing stock by selling properties in electorally marginal wards to potential Tory voters. Westminster also emphatically denied any links with alleged gerrymandering, saying: 'This is not the result of a corrupt policy.' Mr Bill Roots, the council's chief executive, told Public Finance: 'We have a major issue which goes back a number of years. We have taken copious legal advice on what we can do. 'We have tried to weigh up the council's responsibilities and roles to lessees as opposed to its wider responsibilities.' Mr John Magill, the district auditor leading the investigation into the 'homes for votes' allegations, has qualified the council's accounts for 1993-94. He told the journal: 'Preliminary findings suggest that there has been a significant under-recovery of costs over several years.' Ms Selbourne adds in the journal that the council's legal advice on whether the charges could be recovered from leaseholders was 'contradictory'. The consensus of five legal opinions sought by the council indicated that it would only be able to recover 18 months of charges, she said. Mr Peter Bradley, another Labour councillor, said yesterday the backlog in charges would be a 'major shock' to leaseholders, who now faced 'enormous bills' of up to Pounds 20,000. He said one leaseholder in his ward had already been 'presented with a bill for Pounds 12,000', which she could not afford.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Portuguese Prime Minister Silva  spoke of bilateral relations, which in the last few years have  enjoyed a significant boost. He noted that trade has increased  by 30 percent. Silva went on to mention the negotiations  between Israel and the European Union. He advocated an  identical accord to that in force with the European Free Trade  Association countries.    Prime Minister Rabin said he did not believe that the  Israeli  troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho would take  place in the next two weeks as it had been reported. Rabin is  optimistic but said the next three months was a more reasonable  period for a final accord.</p>

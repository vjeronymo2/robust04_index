			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Casado and Marta Salomon] </F>   [Text] One problem that President Itamar Franco and Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso still are unable to solve is  who will carry on with the plan to stabilize the economy after 2  April, the deadline for candidates to resign from their  executive branch positions.    Finance Minister Cardoso has not been able to give an  objective answer to questions about his future -- as a minister  or a candidate -- since the rules to control inflation were  released 48 hours ago.    He chose to remain ambiguous. "You are talking as if I were  irreplaceable," Cardoso said ironically early yesterday morning.  Then he rambled: "If I wanted to run I would have done what was  easiest: freeze prices, increase salaries..."    Pressure on the minister from inside and outside the  government to run is growing. The pressure is directly  proportional to the belief that, with the plan, the election  will coincide with a process of a substantial drop in the  inflation rate.    In the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] -- the  minister's party and the government's main supporter in Congress  -- the consensus is that there are no alternatives to Cardoso's  candidacy and that right now, when the plan has just been  released, is the right time to begin organizing the campaign in  the streets.    The beginning of a movement within the party to put Tasso  Jereissati -- PSDB president, former Ceara governor, and one of  Cardoso's strongest allies -- at the head of the Finance  Ministry is already noticeable.    Jereissati is a former almost-minister. He was announced as  the finance minister during the Jose Sarney administration,  replacing Dilson Funaro, who had resigned. Funaro was the  creator of the Cruzado Plan and is a participant in the current  plan's genesis. His nomination, however, was vetoed by the most  important PMDB leader of the time, the late Ulysses Guimaraes.    Cardoso has a seductive scenario in front of him. The  ingredients are the real prospect of an improvement of his  public image in conjunction with an anticipated drop in the  inflation rate. He has also been receiving signs of a genuine  possibility of mounting a broad multiparty alliance to support  his candidacy.    It would be a renovated version of the extinct Democratic  Alliance. In it, the minister-candidate's PSDB would join forces  with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] of Bahia Governor Antonio  Carlos Magalhaes [ACM], the anti-[Orestes] Quercia PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] faction, important  factions of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] of Paulo Maluf,  the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], and the PP [Popular Party].    The main target would be candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  of the PT [Workers Party], who has been the favorite in all  surveys on presidential succession for more than a year.    The Bahia governor -- the main PFL leader -- has been  talking  about the issue with influential PSDB leaders such as Ceara  Governor Ciro Gomez.    On 1 March in Congress, ACM allies tried to include on  today's voting agenda a constitutional amendment that not only  would have extended the deadline for the incompatibility of  governors and mayors, but also would have included ministers.    Lula's PT already has perceived such behind-the-scenes  maneuvers and started discussing how to prevent the economic  plan from becoming an electoral jumping board for Cardoso by  facilitating an alliance of the PSDB with center-right factions.  The alliance Lula wants and needs most is precisely one  including the minister's party.    The finance minister, in turn, decided to make time (days).  He needs another Cardoso at the Finance Ministry and also a  minimum period to make sure that the URV and the real will leave  the drafting board the way it was planned.</p>

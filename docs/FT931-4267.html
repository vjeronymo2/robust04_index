			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (20): Customers welcome EDI plan - Utility application / Invoicing services BRITISH TELECOM has started sending selected customers their telephone bills by electronic data interchange (EDI), writes John Kavanagh. It is just one of many public utilities looking at cutting costs for itself and its customers by using EDI to send detailed invoices for services. Tesco, for example, is talking to BT, gas and electricity supply companies and local authorities about this extension to its use of EDI. It expects to forge at least one such link this year. BT has been testing the idea with computer market leader IBM since initial negotiations in 1990. Both companies run EDI services and are also heavy users. They worked together to develop a summary invoice based on the international Edifact format standards for EDI messages. There is already a link between their EDI networks, so the data could be passed from BT's billing system into its EDI network, across to IBM's service and into its accounting systems. 'As a recipient of 34,000 BT bills totalling Pounds 14m a year, IBM was a natural partner in this project,' says Mr Andrew Cottam, one of the project managers on the BT side. 'We already had a working partnership with IBM through its involvement in our OneBill service, which provides consolidated bill information. 'With big customers, typically a van dumps a load of paper printed with all the billing information and a team of people key it into a computer system for accounting purposes.' IBM reports 'significant improvements' from the EDI link. An entire month's OneBill data is now fed directly into its computer system in 30 seconds: previously it took a fortnight to have all the information keyed-in. In one test, an entire year's data was transmitted in 8.5 minutes, saving 27 per cent of one staff member's time. BT is now verifying IBM's findings in trials with a dozen customers and expects to launch the service nationally this year. 'There was great demand from other customers to join the trial,' says Andrew Cottam. 'We produce 400,000 telephone bills and 250,000 reminders every day. And companies are increasingly recognising that these bills are an important source of information on their use of voice and data networks and other services. 'This also has implications for us: customers want bills that are easily understood and can be incorporated into financial planning systems to help monitor and control costs.' BT has yet to decide on charges for this service - or whether to charge at all. 'It's saving customers considerable time and money by eliminating data entry  -and it's also saving us money,' says Andrew Cottam says. 'We don't know what we'll charge - if anything.'</p>

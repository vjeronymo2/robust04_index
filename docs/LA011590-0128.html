			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DYLAN TAKES STAGE -- AND SMILES  </P> <P> Oh, mercy! A grinning Bob Dylan kicked off an international tour at a New Haven  nightclub with old standards and cuts from his latest album.  </P> <P> "I never saw him smile before," said Joel Evans after watching Dylan's first  set Friday night at Toad's Place to promote his critically acclaimed album, "Oh  Mercy."  </P> <P> Dylan, 48, known for an extremely aloof stage presence, surprised the crowd  with broad grins and extended eye contact. Backed by a three-piece band, he  played such classics as "Rainy Day Women Nos. 12 and 35" and "One More Cup of  Coffee," as well as new material.  </P> <P> The New Haven show was one of only three Dylan will play in the United States  before dates in Brazil and Europe. The other U.S. shows are in State College,  Pa., and Princeton, N.J.  </P></p>

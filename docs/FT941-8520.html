			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Israeli Arabs to visit Damascus An unprecedented Syrian decision to allow a delegation of Israeli Arabs to visit Damascus was welcomed in Israel yesterday as a sign that relations might be about to undergo a transformation. The 30-strong delegation, led by Mr Abdul-Wahab Daroushe, an Israeli Knesset member, is expected to travel to Damascus in the next few days, ostensibly to extend condolences from Israeli Arabs to President Hafez Assad on the recent death of his son Basil. Israeli-Syrian peace talks resumed last week in Washington, but Israel has been calling on President Assad to invigorate the process by agreeing to a summit with Mr Rabin. President Assad is seeking the return of the Golan Heights from Israel as the price of peace - a price that most Israelis are unwilling to pay, particularly in the absence of more concrete evidence of a warmer long-term Syrian attitude to Israel. Arrangements for the visit, suggested by Mr Daroushe, were made by Mr Amr Moussa. Egypt's foreign minister. Earlier this week, Mr Mohammed Bassiouny, Egypt's ambassador in Israel, informed Mr Daroushe that the Syrians had given their approval. 'It is a positive signal which we welcome, though it has its limitations,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday. Privately, officials in the prime minister's office were more enthusiastic, one noting that this was the first time Assad had agreed to meet openly with Israelis. Israeli officials drew further encouragement from a message from Damascus that Syria remained committed to preventing rocket attacks on Israeli territory from South Lebanon. However at least two were fired into northern Israel on Wednesday.</p>

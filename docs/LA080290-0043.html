			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATLANTA ARCHBISHOP QUIT OVER RELATIONSHIP, CHURCH CONFIRMS  </P> <P> The resignation last month of Atlanta's Roman Catholic archbishop was prompted  by the discovery of his two-year relationship with a woman, his successor  confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, 56, who was the nation's highest ranking black  Roman Catholic, resigned July 10 for what he said were health reasons and the  need for "spiritual renewal, psychological therapy and medical supervision."  </P> <P> He had relinquished his duties in May because of severe stress and a near heart  attack.  </P> <P> But Atlanta television station WAGA reported Wednesday that Marino's  resignation followed the church's discovery of a relationship between the  archbishop and a lay minister, Vicki R. Long. Marino's temporary successor,  Bishop James P. Lyke, said the former archbishop gave permission Wednesday to  confirm the relationship after the television station's report.  </P> <P> Neither the television station nor Lyke said whether the relationship was  sexual in nature.  </P> <P> Lyke said that church officials were told in March that Marino was involved  with a woman. He defended the decision of the archdiocese to withhold the  details of Marino's resignation. He said Marino was the only one who could  "call the shots."  </P> <P> Father Peter Dora, Atlanta Archdiocese spokesman, said church officials would  not comment further until a news conference today.  </P> <P> In 1987, Long filed a $2.3-million paternity suit against a priest, Donal  Keohane of Columbus, alleging that he fathered her child. The church is paying  child support, but denies that Keohane is the father of child.  </P> <P> Long declined to comment about the allegations involving Marino.  </P> <P> The television station reported it had obtained photographs of Marino and Long  attending various functions together and a flight insurance policy for a trip  to Mexico taken by Marino. Long was listed as the archbishop's beneficiary on  the policy.  </P></p>

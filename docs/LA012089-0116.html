			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INAUGURAL EVENTS SHOW MINORITY SUPPORT OF GOP  </P> <P> Mario Castillo surveyed the members of his gala dinner table on Wednesday night  and grumbled, "I think I'm the only Democrat here."  </P> <P> So why was Castillo, a Washington-based lawyer, attending the Hispanic American  Inaugural Ball to celebrate the incoming Republican President? "I wanted to see  what the competition was doing," he said. "And they're doing damn well."  </P> <P> That praise was echoed by Republicans and Democrats at the half a dozen or so  events this week hosted by minority groups as part of the week's inaugural  festivities. Besides the galas, blacks, Latinos, Asian-Americans and  Native-American inaugural committees and special-interest groups have planned  prayer breakfasts, luncheons, receptions and awards presentations.  </P> <P> Heralding the new Administration and President George Bush is just one of the  priorities at the events, where networking also is an important chore.  Democrats, independents and even nonpolitical types are attending the inaugural  events, checking out the competition as well as making those  once-every-four-years contacts.  </P> <P> "I was wondering why we lost the election," Castillo said as he picked up a  program for the Hispanic ball and flipped through the pages. "Now I know. Look  at these names! They're organizing! The (GOP) went after the upwardly mobile  Hispanics."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acceptable Language  </P> <P> Castillo, former staff chief for the House Agriculture Committee, wasn't even  offended by Bush's campaign reference to his half-Latino grandchildren as the  "little brown ones." Castillo said he felt Latinos hadn't perceived that remark  as racist.  </P> <P> "That's a term of endearment," he said. "My mother used to call me 'the little  black one' because I was darker than my brothers and sisters. What Bush did was  reach out to the Hispanics."  </P> <P> Castillo said he was worried about the Democratic Party's future. "And I'm not  even a politician," he said. "My father's a Democrat and he voted for Bush. I  don't know," he added with a shrug. "These people are in for the long run. But  we have four years."  </P> <P> As mariachis played on stage in the ballroom of the Washington Hilton on  Wednesday night, Los Angeles businessman David Lizarraga made his way through  the crowd of 1,500, shaking hands and talking with friends. This Democrat also  had praise for the new Administration.  </P> <P> "Bush has appointed two Hispanic cabinet members and that has to be recognized  and applauded," Lizarraga said, referring to Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos  and Interior Secretary-designate Manuel Lujan, both of whom were at the gala,  also attended by the President's son, Jeb Bush, and his wife, Columba.  </P> <P> Of George Bush, Lizarraga said: "He's my President now, and he's going to be a  do-er President. . . . He's really embracing people all over the country, and  the fact is, he attracted a great percentage of the Democratic vote."  </P> <P> Although blacks and Latinos overwhelmingly voted for Michael Dukakis in the  last election, some minority group members in the Republican Party are  convinced that Democrats will see their party lose its luster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Family Values  </P> <P> "I think (they) are going to see that with the Bush Administration, Democrats  don't have anything to offer," said Willie Durazo, president of a service  corporation in San Diego. "The (GOP ideology) is a lot closer to our culture,  in terms of family, religion, community and taking care of our own."  </P> <P> Ninfa Laurenzo, a Houston restaurateur, added: "I think we have all come of age  and we have to make a choice. I believe in free enterprise -- I'm a  businesswoman."  </P> <P> Across town, where the Asian Pacific American Presidential Inaugural Ball was  under way, 1,000 or so guests dined on traditional buffet food and danced to  big band music at the Willard-Intercontinental Hotel.  </P> <P> "I think this is a good function for people to network," said Robert Hsueh, a  Dallas lawyer. "And not just on a domestic level, but international, as well.  There are foreign business delegations and dignitaries here, people from the  Republic of China, Korea, Thailand."  </P> <P> The ball offered a rare chance for guests to mingle, chat and polish contacts,  said Hsueh, who added: "This is a nonpartisan event. There is no strong  political tone."  </P> <P> But the issue of cabinet appointments was a "touchy" one, noted Hsueh, a member  of the Asian American Outreach Committee appointed by Bush to scout for  qualified applicants to serve in the new Administration.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to see he has appointed an outreach committee," Hsueh said of the  President. And though there have been no Asian-American appointments yet by the  new Administration, he said he remains "hopeful. It's not that we don't have  qualified applicants."  </P> <P> At the ballroom entrance, Jeanne Lin, 24, was at the ticket reservation table  looking over receipts, hoping to make it into the party before it was over.  </P> <P> Lin -- a law school student from Potomac, Md., and a member of the Federation  of Young Asian American Republicans -- said her interest in politics was  sparked by her parents. But she noted: "There are not a lot of Asian-Americans,  especially women, involved in politics. Maybe my generation will change that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working Your Way Up  </P> <P> Lin found it easy to see the GOP'S attraction for Asian-Americans. "There are  many similarities with the Asian ideology," she said. "In my opinion, those who  come over as immigrants work very hard to earn money and work their way up. And  my image of the Republican Party is that you make your way up in society, and  work very hard."  </P> <P> The American Indian Inaugural Committee holds its ball tonight at the  Washington Plaza Hotel, promising traditional dances as well as a  Country-Western band for 1,000 guests.  </P> <P> The gala's purpose, said Mitchell Bush, president of the American Indian  Society, is to "Celebrate the continuing relationship of the American Indian  with the United States. . . . It's also an opportunity for tribal leaders to  meet, and for lesser-known tribes to make themselves known."  </P> <P> Suzan Shown Harjo remains "cautiously optimistic" about the new Administration.  </P> <P> Harjo, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, a  lobbying group, added, "Certainly the new President is smart and  issue-oriented. For Indian issues, I think that will bode well because we will  have a better opportunity to have our issues be given serious consideration."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prayer Breakfast  </P> <P> The week's inaugural events began Monday with an ecumenical prayer breakfast in  celebration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. That event was hosted  by the American Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural Afro-American Committee.  The committee also hosted a business awards luncheon and awards dinner. (Among  the honorees at the latter event was Myrlie Evers, Los Angeles City Board of  Public Works commissioner.)  </P> <P> Thaddeus Garrett Jr. is co-chairman of that group, which also sponsors of an  awards luncheon and dinner this week.  </P> <P> "I think the prayer breakfast symbolized Bush's intention to be president of  all the people," said Garrett, president of a Washington-based economic trade  development consulting firm.  </P> <P> Why are some of his Democrat friends attending the events? "I think they  recognize first that we won the election, and second they are responding to  Bush's open door."  </P> <P> Garrett is thrilled with Bush's appointments of blacks to Cabinet and other  posts. "That's not being done under a Democrat," he said. "Actions speak louder  than words, and you can't help but receive that as George Bush meaning  business."  </P></p>

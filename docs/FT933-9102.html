			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Brazil under pressure to curb mounting inflation THE inexorable rise in Brazil's monthly inflation, expected to top 33 per cent this month, has led to growing demands for drastic action to tackle the problem, even a new 'shock plan' of economic measures. Prices of food have been rising particularly quickly and, in an apparent sign of desperation, the government yesterday reinstated Sunab, the prices watchdog body previously associated with enforcing price freezes. The government has promised the International Monetary Fund that it will reduce monthly inflation to 25 per cent by December, but companies have revised predictions upwards for this year to 1,900 per cent, Brazil's highest ever. Although Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's new finance minister, keeps smiling, the problems are proving far more intractable than expected. Last week, for the first time, he admitted he would need to take further measures against inflation beyond the promised clean-up of public finances. The financial markets reacted so violently that Mr Cardoso was forced to go on television to quash rumours of his impending departure. This Saturday he will address the nation, apparently to reaffirm that no shock plan is being prepared. Nonetheless, the clamour for shock measures, such as a price freeze, is growing. Mr Tasso Jereissatti, president of the Social Democratic party, accused the politicians, businessmen and workers making such calls of 'a lack of solidarity' with the government's long-term strategy of fiscal adjustment. 'In the 12 weeks since Mr Cardoso took office we have gone from people being scared of a shock to people demanding it,' he said. Mr Cardoso's stated priority of balancing government accounts is in trouble. Despite making Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) in cuts, the government's most optimistic figures for next year's budget put the operational deficit at a record Dollars 31.5bn. A new cheque tax, which was supposed to bring in Dollars 600m a month, is being contested in court, state governments are proving reluctant to repay their debts to the centre, and the cost of the federal payroll has jumped from Dollars 14bn to Dollars 18bn. The privatisation programme has almost come to a halt and President Itamar Franco now says he will not allow the sales of big companies such as Vale do Rio Doce and Petrobras. To Mr Cardoso's dismay, congress approved a new wage policy requiring monthly real wage adjustments, though this would be highly inflationary. Mr Franco vetoed the measure, offering a compromise which would still cost the government an extra Dollars 2bn this year, but he has yet to obtain congressional approval for this. On the positive side, the Central Bank has managed to convert 20 per cent of domestic debt from 28-day into 130-day securities and tax revenues have increased Dollars 500m a month, thanks partly to a change in legislation forcing companies to pay at source tax on financial profits. The motor industry has just announced its best month ever. But there seems little other reason for optimism. Spending pressures will increase enormously as campaigning gets under way for next year's congressional and presidential elections. It has not escaped anyone's notice that Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine finance minister and author of that country's successful anti-inflation dollarisation plan, will be paying a visit next month.</p>

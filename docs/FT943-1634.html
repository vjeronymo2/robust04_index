			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Ministers determined to sell Post Office stake Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday underlined their determination to press ahead with partial privatisation of the Post Office. At an informal meeting of the cabinet's committee on industrial, commercial and consumer affairs, the ministers voiced their support for a majority sale of the Royal Mail. They are understood to enjoy the support of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, but Mr John Major, the prime minister, is still wary about the potential political cost of a decision that Labour says will damage rural post offices. A final decision will be deferred until the conclusion of the consultation period at the end of this month. The meeting came as Mr Richard Dykes, managing director of Post Office Counters, said yesterday that investment in advanced technology in village post offices should put an end to rumours that partial privatisation would lead to closures. The Post Office said bids would close today for the first stages of a Pounds 100m plan to automate the UK's 20,000 post offices. The project, announced in May, will place a computer terminal on each post office counter, making it simpler to pay benefits. The smallest rural post office will then have access to information and services such as international cash transfer and travel insurance. The system should make social security fraud more difficult.</p>

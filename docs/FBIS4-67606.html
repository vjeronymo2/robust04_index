			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Sofia, January 27 (BTA) -- Today the Council of  Ministers approved a bill amending and supplementing the Public  Health Act under which the owners of medical care establishments  would not be allowed to work for state or municipal medical care  establishments at the same time. It is envisaged to grant the  medical care establishments independent juristic persons status  which, according to Minister of Health Tancho Gugalov, will make  it possible for them to negotiate the required funds with the  municipalities. The fines for not complying with the standards  of sanitation and hygiene would be increased, varying from 1,000  to 1.5 million leva. The Public Health Act operating now was  adopted in 1973.

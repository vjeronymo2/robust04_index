But they want to be represented at the talks by their leader  Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest since shortly  after her National League for Democracy's land-slide election  victory in 1989.    But A Burmese student source said the statement was issued  following the F88's brainstorm meeting from March 18 to 21 at a  border area opposite Mae Hong Son province. However, leaders of  dissident ethnic minority groups, including Gen Bo Mya of the  Karen National Union, did not take part in the meeting.    But The F88 comprises the All Burmese Students Democratic  Front, the Government in Exile and monks taking refuge in Karen  National Union's zones.

But Suu Kyi has demanded the junta step down and hand over  power.    But She has also said the judicial system should be free of  intimidation or coercion, the military should be under  government control and should not be allowed to disrupt the  constitutional process once it is in place.    But The F88 statement the F88 statement denounced the  ceasefire agreement between ethnic minorities and the State Law  and Order Restoration Committee (Slorc) as not bringing a  political solution. [sentence as published]    But The group said ethnic minorities were forced into  ceasefire negotiations by Burma's neighbours add Asean.    But They also accused China of helping the junta maintain  its  grip on powers by providing the junta with political, economic  and military support.    But The statement also blasted the military junta's failure  to tackle the country's economic woes and accused the junta of  working solely for vested interest groups and its own survival  in power.    But "After all, the country is still plagued with economic  recession, inflation and high prices," it said.    But The F88 statement came a day after the National  Convention to draft a new constitution was convened in Rangoon.  The convention was initiated a year ago. The military junta  says the promulgation of a new constitution is conditional to  its handing over to a civilian government.    But The opening day of the plenary session on Wednesday was  confined to papers put up by the minorities' representative  syndicate, a group which represents the country's ethnic groups.    But Among 14 representatives of minority groups to speak  during the session, a representative from Chin State, U Kan Yin,  demanded Burma be declared a federal state.    But He said state power should come from the people and  ethnic minorities should receive equal treatment to the Burmans,  the country's majority.    But Gyaw Pan Tha of Arakan state demanded self  administration  for those ethnic minorities who have no states or divisions of  their own. These included the Naga, Pa-O, Palaung, Kokan,  Alkar, Kayar and Wa minorities.    But The Kokangs, Was, and Pa-Os, who live in Shan State  bordering China, and the Nagas in the Sagaing Division bordering  India, were among the groups which claimed they met criteria for  self administration.    But The convention is intended to spark "national  reconciliation" among Burma's various races and create a  power-sharing role for the military which has been in power for  the last five years.    But The convention has already adopted 104 "fundamental  principles," including provisions entitling ethnic minorities to  their own language, literature and culture and to  "self-administered areas, zones and divisions", if their numbers  are judged to be adequate.</p>

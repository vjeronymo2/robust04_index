			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Brazilian minister resigns PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil, battling to stay in power amid a worsening corruption scandal, has been dealt a heavy blow by the resignation of one of his most senior ministers, writes Christina Lamb in Braslia. Mr Jose Goldemberg, education minister, is the first cabinet member to quit since the political crisis erupted in May with a series of corruption allegations against the president. The minister resigned on Monday night, provoking much speculation that other ministers might follow suit. Citing 'political and personal reasons' for quitting, Mr Goldemberg, a former university rector, accused the government of greater concern for its own survival than for the Brazilian people, and of lack of commitment to education. Mr Collor has managed to hold on to his economic team, for now, by agreeing to maintain his austerity policy. Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister, said he had agreed merely to re-allocate some government resources to social programmes, such as housing projects.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Trust Aberdeen Trust, the investment and unit trust management company, reported profits of Pounds 981,000 pre-tax for the six months to March 31. The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 7.15m (Pounds 5.59m), compared with profits last time of Pounds 1.04m and was struck after reorganisation costs totalling Pounds 600,000, including a compensation payment of Pounds 150,000 to a former director for loss of office. The costs masked a sharp improvement at the operating level - profits moved ahead from Pounds 1.19m to Pounds 2.07m - reflecting strong growth in fund management and currency benefits. Interest charges, however, jumped from Pounds 221,000 to Pounds 523,000 as a result of the transaction last September with Century Life. Earnings per share dipped to 0.81p (0.97p) and the interim dividend is halved to 0.5p; a final of 1p is forecast, however, which would maintain the total at 1.5p.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney says rights issue 80% subscribed Euro Disney, the French theme park and resorts operator, said last night its rights issue to raise FFr5.95bn (Dollars 1.11bn) was 80 per cent subscribed by the public and its parent company, Walt Disney of the US, AP-DJ reports from Paris. 'Given the current market conditions and the timing of the rights issue, the company is pleased with the level of subscription and the confidence expressed by its shareholders,' Euro Disney said in a brief statement. In one of the biggest capital raising operations seen on the Paris bourse, Euro Disney created almost 600m new shares at FFr10 each. The issue allowed existing shareholders - including Walt Disney, which has 49 per cent - to subscribe to seven new shares for every two held. The operation resulted, however, in a huge dilution of the previously existing 170m shares and cut Euro Disney's market share price to one-third of its pre-rights level. A syndicate of creditor banks led by Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Indosuez and state-controlled Caisse des Depots &amp; Consignations is underwriting the issue and presumably would take up the remaining 20 per cent. However, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz, a nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, agreed in June to act as a 'back-up underwriter' to the rights issue by buying unsubscribed shares. At that time, Euro Disney had said that Prince Al-Waleed would acquire up to a 24 per cent stake in the company. Euro Disney last night declined to say what stake the Saudi prince would hold at this point.</p>

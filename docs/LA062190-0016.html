			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON CANADA;  </P> <P> LAST GASP OF AMICABLE FEDERALISM;  </P> <P> IF THE QUEBEC ISSUE IS NOT SOLVED, THERE IS LITTLE HOPE FOR STEMMING VIOLENT  ETHNIC CONFLICTS IN THE LESS-DEVELOPED WORLD.  </P> <P> As the prime minister who pressed successfully for the enactment of the  Canadian Constitution Act of 1982 -- which eschewed "distinct society" status  for Quebec (subsequently granted by the Meech Lake Accord of 1987 and which now  threatens to Balkanize Canada) in favor of a federalist solution -- I think  there is universal value in the Canadian experience for all states grappling  with the reemergence of ethnic-based nationalism.  </P> <P> If 6 million Canadians of French origin cannot manage to share their national  sovereignty with 20 million Canadians of British and other origins, there is  very little hope for far less privileged regions of the world.  </P> <P> Throughout history, when a state has taken an exclusive and intolerant idea  such as religion or ethnicity as its cornerstone, this idea has more often than  not been the mainspring of violence and war. In days gone by, religion had to  be displaced as the basis of the state before frightful religious wars came to  an end. And there will be little hope of putting an end to wars between nations  until, in some similar fashion, the "nation" in ethnic terms ceases to be the  basis of a state.  </P> <P> A state that defines its function essentially in terms of ethnic or religious  attributes inevitably becomes chauvinistic and intolerant. Nationalists,  whether of the left or right, are politically reactionary because they are led  to define the common good as a function of an ethnic group or religious ideal  rather than in terms of "all the people" regardless of individual  characteristics. This is why a nationalistic government is by nature  intolerant, discriminatory and, when all is said and done, totalitarian.  </P> <P> As Lord Acton wrote in as early as 1862, the nation as an ideal unit founded on  race "overrules the rights and wishes of its inhabitants, absorbing their  divergent interests in a fictitious unity; sacrifices their inclinations and  duties to the higher claim of nationality, and crushes all natural rights and  all established liberties for the purpose of vindicating itself. Whenever a  single definite object is made the supreme end of the State, the State becomes  for the time being inevitably absolute."  </P> <P> Thus, a truly democratic government -- whether provincial or federal -- cannot  be "nationalist" because it must pursue the good of all its citizens regardless  of sex, color, race, religious belief or ethnic origin. Democratic government  stands for good citizenship, never nationalism.  </P> <P> This is not to say that the state must disregard cultural or linguistic values.  Among the many values that a political society must protect and develop, these  have high priority. It is therefore entirely desirable that a state ensure,  through its constitution and legislation, the protection of such values. It is  inevitable that its policies will serve the interests of ethnic groups and  especially of the majority group in proportion to its numbers. But this will  happen as a natural consequence of the equality of all its citizens, not as a  special privilege -- such as "a distinct society" -- of the largest group in a  given territory.  </P> <P> I entered federal politics in Canada precisely for the purpose of putting these  principles into practice. I believed strongly then, as I do now, that  federalism by definition is a superior form of government, because it is more  pluralist than monolithic and therefore respects diversity among people and  groups. In general, freedom has a firmer foundation under federalism than in  any kind of unitary nation-state.  </P> <P> This is especially true in Canada, where the die is firmly cast. There are two  main ethnic and linguistic groups. Each is too strong and too deeply rooted in  the past, too firmly bound to a mother culture, to be able to engulf the other.  </P> <P> I have always believed that if these two groups could collaborate at the hub of  a truly pluralistic state, Canada could become the envied seat of a form of  federalism that could become a brilliant prototype for the molding of  tomorrow's polyethnic civilization, a better model even than the American  melting pot. Rather than forging a new alloy, the Canadian model would preserve  the characteristics of each group in a mosaic of cultural coexistence.  </P> <P> The Constitution Act of 1982 declared equal economic opportunity under which  "the government of Canada and the provincial governments undertake to promote  equal opportunities for the well-being of all Canadians." Furthermore, the act  embraced the principle of equality of French and English in all domains of  federal jurisdiction, and guaranteed both Francophones and Anglophones the  right to education in their own language anywhere in Canada.  </P> <P> The essential principles so relevant to the current upheaval are embraced by  the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In the grand tradition of the 1789  Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and the 1791 Bill of Rights of  the United States, the Canadian Charter implicitly established the primacy of  the individual over the state and all government institutions, and in so doing,  recognized that all sovereignty resides in the people.  </P> <P> In this respect, the Canadian Charter was a new beginning for the Canadian  nation. It sought to strengthen the country's unity by basing the sovereignty  of the Canadian people on a set of values common to all, and on the notion of  equality among all Canadians.  </P> <P> The spirit and substance of the Canadian Charter is clear: to protect the  individual against not only the tyranny of the state, but also any other  tyranny to which the individual may be subjected by virtue of his belonging to  a minority group.  </P> <P> Having reviewed these principles, it should be manifestly clear how the notion  of Quebec as a "distinct society" (wherein individual rights are subordinated  to collective rights) threatens to undermine the very foundation of a liberal  state.  </P> <P> Canada's model federalist solution to Quebec nationalism once heralded a hope  for a mankind facing the rapid integration of a polyethnic and interdependent  world. Now I fear the Balkanization of Canada may presage a return to premodern  conflicts once thought to have passed into history.  </P> <P> If the 19th Century is what awaits us at the opening of the 21st, it behooves  us to listen once again to Lord Acton, one of the great thinkers of the 19th  Century, who described with extraordinarily prophetic insight the errors of  nationalism that were to soak the 20th Century with so much blood and acrimony:  </P> <P> "A great democracy must either sacrifice self-government to unity or preserve  it by federalism. . . . The coexistence of several nations under the same State  is a test, as well as the best security of its freedom. It is also one of the  chief instruments of civilization.  </P> <P> "The combination of different nations in one State is as necessary a condition  of civilized life as the combination of men in society. Where political and  national boundaries coincide, society ceases to advance, and nations relapse  into a condition corresponding to that of men who renounce intercourse with  their fellow men.  </P> <P> A state which is incompetent to satisfy different races condemns itself; a  State which labors to neutralize, to absorb, or to expel them is destitute of  the chief basis of self-government. The theory of nationality, then, is a  retrograde step in history."  </P></p>

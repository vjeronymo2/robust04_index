			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Some nursing homes will have to strengthen their health care services and meet  other higher standards of care to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid  reimbursement under new regulations. They will also have to give residents more  rights, including the right to refuse treatment and to manage their own money.  The final rules were drafted in response to a law enacted by Congress in 1987  and reflect responses to proposed regulations published in October, 1987. The  final regulations will apply to nearly 15,000 long-term care facilities.  </P></p>

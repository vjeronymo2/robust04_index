			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gain on index-linked selling THE OVERNIGHT rise on Wall Street and higher bond prices lifted share prices initially, but index-linked selling in the afternoon sent the Nikkei average down, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 31.07 lower at 21,333.70 after hitting the day's high of 21,376.69 in the morning and low of 20,940.07 in the afternoon. Volume rose to 220m shares from 200m as some individual investors bought pharmaceutical and food stocks. Overall rises still led declines by 479 to 451, with 190 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished a slight 1.64 up at 1,553.65, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.06 firmer at 1,186.69. Traders said that in spite of the retreat by share prices, sentiment remained firm. 'The market had a lot working against it, but showed stability,' commented Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Sentiment was unaffected by a further batch of negative earnings reports from companies, the continuing investigation of a political bribery scandal and reports that the Ministry of Finance is investigating the practice whereby brokerage houses reshuffle clients' investment losses. Traders said that technically the Nikkei was oversold: it is 20.9 per cent below its five-year moving average, the lowest level since 1965 when the average stood 23.7 per cent below the five-year line. A call by Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the leading Liberal Democratic Party, for a cut in the discount rate gave some optimism to the market. In a speech given to the Takeshita faction of the LDP, he hinted that if Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, did not cut rates soon, the government had the power to fire him. Companies which had announced new developments in Aids-related drugs or potential cures for cancer attracted short-term traders. Mochida Pharmaceutical, the most active issue of the day, surged Y290 to Y2,920 and Nippon Mining, which was reported to have developed an anti-Aids drug with Japanese and US researchers, forged ahead Y31 to Y490. Orix, the leasing company, fell Y130 to Y2,380 on foreign selling. Investors were discouraged by an estimated 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the current year to March. Brokerage houses remained weak on concern about the official investigation into the practice of helping some clients' accounts by selling off loss-carrying investments to other investors. Daiwa Securities fell Y21 to Y930 and Nomura Securities lost Y10 to Y1,480. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 134.84 to 22,969.59 in volume of 68.7m shares. Roundup HONG KONG closed at its second consecutive record high, but elsewhere on the Pacific Rim sentiment was mixed. HONG KONG took confidence from better than expected results from the Australian division of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking, lending weight to forecasts that the bank was showing signs of recovery. The Hang Seng index climbed 100.42 or 2.1 per cent to 4,895.13 in turnover of HKDollars 3.7bn, against HKDollars 2.8bn. HSBC Holdings, parent company of the bank, was the most active stock and finished HKDollars 2.50 higher at HKDollars 42.25. SEOUL ended three days of declines as the composite index closed 2.94 firmer at 624.36 in turnover of Won262.9bn. TAIWAN climbed sharply in early trading but turned back later, the weighted index closing a net 67.72 or 1.4 per cent up at 5,019.22 after turnover of TDollars 37.5bn. MANILA lacked specific direction and the composite index gained 7.63 at 1,201.11 in turnover of 174m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon as profits were taken and the composite index closed down 2.50 at 600.66 in volume of 42.7m shares. Berjaya Leisure rose 14 cents to MDollars 2.16 after announcing plans to buy two island resort firms. SINGAPORE lost ground in quiet trade, the Straits Times Industrial index falling 12.51 to 1,471.91 in turnover of SDollars 117.7m. BANGKOK dropped to its lowest level since last August, the SET index ending 19.79 or 2.5 per cent off at 780.18. Bangkok Land lost Bt13 to Bt189 in turnover of Bt1.19bn, the largest fall since its listing on February 5. Bangkok Bank shed Bt4 to Bt704 in active trade. AUSTRALIA was unmoved by the government's economic statement but fell on profit-taking. The All Ordinaries index finished down 14.9 at 1,623.2 in turnover of ADollars 280m. Brambles Industries, the transport group, slipped 40 cents to ADollars 16.80 after announcing a 13 per cent fall in interim profits, while Comalco, the aluminium producer, shed 3 cents to ADollars 3.87 on reporting an 85 per cent drop in annual net profits. NEW ZEALAND closed easier in moderate volume: the NZSE-40 index dipped 5.76 to 1,495.11. Air New Zealand declined 5 cents to NZDollars 1.77 on news of further deregulation in air routes between Australia and New Zealand.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has  demanded that Japan fulfill its commitment to increase the  number of dealers in foreign cars, an issue which was regarded  as pending in the bilateral economic framework talks.  Commenting on this, a negotiator for the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] criticized the demand as  follows: 1) The Kantor demand goes against the Japan-U.S.  accord to "rule out target figures"; and 2) each auto dealer is  supposed to be free to make the decision whether or not to deal  in foreign-made models, and the government must not intervene in  their business affairs.    The MITI negotiator noted his concern over Kantor's remark,  saying: "Even if the framework talks are resumed, the two  nations may fall into the same dilemma."    The Japanese Government agrees on using the number of  dealers  in foreign cars as one of several "objective criteria" to  evaluate the openness of the Japanese auto market. However,  Japan says the criteria must be used to review present  circumstances and past records, and Kantor's demand for "future  commitment" is nothing but a demand for a numerical target.    In the bilateral accord on the resumption of the framework  talks, a commitment on auto sales was drawn up on the same lines  as one on the mobile phone market.    The MITI negotiator, however, said: "While the government  does have control over access to the mobile phone market, auto  sales is a liberal industrial field run by the business sector.  The government exercises very different authority in each  field."    The United States has been demanding that Japan honor its  commitment to increase the number of dealers in foreign cars.  Japanese negotiators feel Kantor's remarks indicated the United  States has no intention of changing its negotiation policies  even after the latest accord.    Some quarters in the government are voicing frustration with  the bilateral accord on the resumption of framework talks,  saying: "The accord was made hastily. Consequently it is  inadequate and may be open to misinterpretation by the United  States."</p>

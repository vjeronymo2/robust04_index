			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE IS SCIENCE, AND FAITH IS FAITH;  </P> <P> EVOLUTION: ATTEMPTS TO DRESS UP BIBLICAL CREATIONISM AS "CREATION SCIENCE" DO  NOT CIRCUMVENT A BASIC PRINCIPLE.  </P> <P> People across America who care about the quality of our children's education  are waiting to see how California resolves the "Great Scopes Monkey  Controversy" of 1989.  </P> <P> By early November, the state Board of Education will decide on new science  textbook guidelines, amid a mounting clamor from religious-right  fundamentalists still intent on forcing the inclusion of biblical creationist  beliefs into science teaching. The board's public hearings on Wednesday  represent the anti-evolution forces' major opportunity to twist the outcome in  their favor.  </P> <P> The creationists are threatening one of America's most cherished values -- our  shared belief that, whatever our private religious faith, the public schools  should not be used to promote sectarian religious doctrine. Transparent  attempts to dress up biblical creationism as "creation science" and parade it  as a "rival scientific theory" to evolution do not circumvent this basic  principle. Science is science, and faith is faith -- a crucial distinction that  has been repeatedly underscored by the courts. Blurring this line would ill  serve our children and our Constitution.  </P> <P> Yet extremist groups are on the march across America to do just that, using  such tactics in other states as promoting legislation and influencing school  board races. Leading the charge is a group calling itself the Citizens for  Excellence in Education, the activist arm of the right-wing National Assn. of  Christian Educators based in Costa Mesa. The group, along with the California  Traditional Values Coalition, has spearheaded the California challenge.  </P> <P> If the anti-evolution campaign wins even a partial victory in California, the  reverberations will be felt around the nation. California and Texas dominate  the textbook market, together accounting for more than 20% of total national  sales. Books developed for use in California and Texas schools are often sold  without modifications to the rest of the nation. Quite simply, the outcome of  California's creationism controversy will help setthe standards for America's  science instruction well into the next decade.  </P> <P> Thus far, California's education leadership has held firm. But the pressure is  mounting. Last January, when the Board of Education drew a clear line between  science instruction and religious teaching, the Traditional Values Coalition  labeled their verdict a "gag order."  </P> <P> When the science committee of the California Curriculum Commission reaffirmed  this decision in July, fundamentalists stepped up their rhetoric. "If it's war  they want, it's war they're going to get," warned the Rev. Louis Sheldon,  chairman of the coalition. Robert Simonds, president of Citizens for Excellence  in Education, threatened that "all hell's going to break loose" if the  creationists don't get their way this fall.  </P> <P> When the curriculum commission finally adopted a pro-evolution science  framework at the end of September, the creationists lashed out again. With  backward logic, Sheldon claimed that unless "credible competing views" are  included in science teaching, "textbooks will present evolution dogmatically."  It would certainly be news to Charles Darwin and legions of biologists who have  tested this theory for more than 100 years that evolution is dogma.  </P> <P> Alarmingly, the board has recently been sending signals that it may be backing  away from its pro-evolution stance. A letter from the board to the curriculum  commission faulted that panel's evolution discussion as "too defensive."  </P> <P> Educators and mainstream religious leaders have been speaking up strongly in  defense of evolution. Seven major educational and science organizations  recently sent a joint letter urging the board to accept the pro-evolution  guidelines. The Rev. Bruce Lundberg, a Lutheran bishop's associate from  Sacramento, testified in earlier hearings that he believes "most of mainline  Christendom" accepts evolution as the explanation of life's origins. "I . . .  considered this to be a subject that was closed a long time ago," Lundberg  remarked.  </P> <P> The Board of Education can finally close the subject at a hearing on Wednesday  and in its vote Nov. 9. Members should endorse the excellent guidelines before  them. Then schools in California -- and across the nation -- can get on with  the job of imparting scientific knowledge that the next generation must have if  our nation is to remain competitive.  </P></p>

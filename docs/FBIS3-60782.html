			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Dec (EFE) -- More than 200 houses  in Soleil neighborhood were burned today by members of the  extreme right-wing "Front for Haiti's Advancement and Progress  (FRAPH)" in an incident that produced at least several dead and  injured.    FRAPH members, accompanied by soldiers in uniform, sought to  "avenge" the murder of businessman Issa Paul, treasurer of their  organization in Soleil. His burned body was found this morning.  FRAPH members burned the houses of people they believe could be  linked to Paul's murder. Although it is presumed that there are  several dead as a result of the FRAPH attack, Haitian radio only  confirmed two. Representatives of FRAPH, an organization that  became public when the return of constitutional President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide was being negotiated, even captured  citizens. The soldiers in uniform did not intervene and  appeared to be protecting FRAPH members, the radio reported.    FRAPH is made up of armed civilians, mostly former members  of  the Tonton Macoutes (paramilitary police) that existed during  the Duvalier administration.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Manon - Covent Garden Manon is the role for which a ballerina might kill. The girl's sexual charm, her innocent viciousness and kittenish eagerness to have her worldly cake and eat it, and the luscious rewards of duets and solos, are as alluring for the dancer as the diamonds with which Monsieur GM buys Manon. But an underlying strength of the part in Kenneth MacMillan's realisation is that the character exists in closest physical and emotional rapport with des Grieux, with Lescaut, and with GM Manon is a show-piece for its men as for its heroine, and for the dramatic resource of an entire company, and it is a continuing assertion of the Royal Ballet's integrity as an ensemble that the drama should still - after 18 years and 121 performances - have such urgency in the theatre. Memorable interpretations in the past have stressed the varied appetites - for money, for sensual gratification, for security - that unite Manon and her brother with the hapless des Grieux, and with GM So it proved again on Wednesday night when Viviana Durante and Irek Mukhemedov were the lovers, and Stephen Jefferies and Derek Rencher appeared as Lescaut and GM We saw, of course, a quartet of superb theatre artists, playing at their peak. Durante's Manon now has even greater sexual allure: the girl's awakening to the rewards her beauty will bring her is immediate, teasingly alert. An added dimension has been given to this portrait by the rapport that has evolved during the past season in partnership between Durante and Mukhamedov. He is not only a wonderfully secure and sympathetic cavalier in the mechanics of double-work, but his dramatic intelligence gives savour to every least action. Their pas de deux throughout the evening were absolutely attuned; they dared everything in emotional and physical response, and we ecstatically believed. 'All for love' is their cry, and the tensions between their passion and des Grieux' decency, the irresistible pull of Manon's temperament and beauty, fuelled a magnificent joint interpretation. Both artists also savour the choreography, delight in its nuances, and it is especially rewarding to watch Mukhamedov exploring dances made for the very different gifts of Anthony Dowell, and yet finding in them new power, and eloquence. Cast against type, Mukhamedov's vast talent proves that there need be no 'type' in casting. We might suppose that neither Stephen Jefferies nor Derek Rencher would now surprise us in roles which they wear with absolute assurance. But Jefferies' Lescaut seems darker, more calculating, and more than ever a motive force of the tale, and Rencher's portrayal of GM more suffused with lust. Grand interpretations, beautifully judged. From the company no less authoritative playing, with Fiona Chadwick most happily seen as Lescaut's mistress, enduring the hazards of the drunken pas de deux with determined grace, as if unflustered at the prospect of being dropped on her head.</p>

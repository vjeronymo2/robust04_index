			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSHIONING THE CRUNCH IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY;  </P> <P> MANUFACTURING: A BACKLOG IN COMMERCIAL AIRLINE ORDERS MAY HELP OFFSET DECLINES  IN DEFENSE WORK. BUT PAYROLLS AND PROFITS ARE EXPECTED TO SHRINK.  </P> <P> The aerospace industry will lose an estimated 27,000 jobs nationally and suffer  a 13% decline in profits in 1990 but will post record sales on the strength of  commercial aircraft production, according to a report by the Aerospace  Industries Assn.  </P> <P> The report indicates for the first time the magnitude by which commercial work  will help cushion anticipated declines in defense work at least in the near  term. The trade association projected that sales of commercial transport  aircraft will jump 68% to $23.5 billion in 1990.  </P> <P> Prospects for major reductions in defense orders, stemming from easing tensions  in Europe, have rocked the industry in recent weeks. Officials are still  attempting to understand which companies will be affected and how steeply the  defense budget will drop.  </P> <P> So far, analysts agree that no catastrophic blow to the industry is in sight  for two or three years, but a painful consolidation will take place during the  1990s to eliminate excess capacity. The extent of the downsizing will depend on  decisions over the next several years.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the industry is enjoying a historic boom in commercial work.  The backlog of firm orders for airliners, not including options and other  conditional agreements, reached $82 billion in 1989 -- an amount equal to an  entire year of Pentagon procurement. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the two U.S.  producers, have committed all of their production capacity through the early  1990s to fill existing orders and have some orders booked past the turn of the  century.  </P> <P> Don Fuqua, president of the Washington-based trade group, said in an interview  that the strong commercial outlook should help the industry absorb declining  military orders at least for the next several years. But he was cautious about  the longer-term outlook, predicting that defense spending would decline  throughout the 1990s, not just in the first half as many industry optimists are  saying.  </P> <P> "I do not minimize the impact on our industry of the defense spending cuts we  know are coming," he said in a speech Wednesday. "We are braced for heavy  weather, particularly among those . . . companies most deeply committed to  defense work."  </P> <P> He added that the group expects "a moderate decline in real, inflation-adjusted  sales volume."  </P> <P> Total aerospace industry sales are expect to increase 5.6% during the year to a  record $120.6 billion, and an even larger 14% gain is projected for 1990, the  report said. Gains in commercial aircraft and a smaller increase in spacecraft  production are expected to fully offset declines in missiles and military  aircraft.  </P> <P> Aerospace industry employment is now 1.32 million Americans, virtually  unchanged from last year. The civilian aircraft industry, which includes  subcontractors, has added 35,000 jobs during the year and the military aircraft  industry lost 14,000 jobs. Similarly, missile contractors were down 12,000 jobs  and a category of leftover products was down 11,000 jobs.  </P> <P> By occupation, the ranks of production workers grew by 8,000 jobs while  scientists and engineers were net losers of 6,000 jobs in 1989. Next year, both  groups will shrink.  </P> <P> It may seem contradictory that sales will continue to increase and employment  decrease. The reason is that the work force at commercial companies have  already been built up, but increases in deliveries of aircraft have not yet  occurred. For example, McDonnell Douglas plans to boost deliveries and sales of  its MD-80 series of aircraft by one-third over the next several years with its  existing work forces.  </P> <P> Boeing has plans to increase the production rates of every one of its  commercial aircraft lines. Its sales also were depressed this year by a lengthy  strike at its Seattle plants that curtailed deliveries.  </P> <P> Fuqua cited recent surveys that show a potential need for 8,500 new airliners  over the next 15 years, an astronomical number that would boost production far  higher than levels in the 1980s. The projection is based on a doubling of world  aircraft traffic.  </P> <P> The association, which has long complained that the Pentagon has provided for  inadequate profits in weapons contracts, noted that the aerospace industry  posted profit margins on sales of just 3.7% in 1989, "lower than similar ratios  for all U.S. manufacturing industries."  </P></p>

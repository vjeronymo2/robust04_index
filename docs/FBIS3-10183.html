			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada announced the  Popular Participation Bill to the public yesterday evening over  radio and television. This bill returns power to municipal  governments. Financial resources will be reallocated following  a new population distribution criterion.    The bill charges municipalities with the management of  health  care and education, while the central government will retain  overall responsibility for these two areas.    The bill will be submitted to Congress in the next few hours  and come into force one month after its promulgation.    Although it had been announced that a financial bill was to  be submitted to Congress yesterday, Sanchez de Lozada reported  that he will not do so until 24 February.    Some 50 people, including members of the press and citizens  selected at random by a public opinion poll company, went to  Government House to inquire about the subject.    Presenting the bill, Sanchez de Lozada stated that it is one  of the most important steps since the 1952 revolution.    He said: "This is not a panacea for all our problems, but it  is a significant step toward a true participatory democracy."    The government's initiative does away with old projects on  administrative decentralization and seeks to favor regions  proportional to their populations.    The bill intends to incorporate indigenous, peasant, and  urban communities into the country's political and economic life  by acknowledging their legal status.    It establishes grassroots organizations -- made up of  directly elected provincial leaders -- to appoint  representatives to the so-called "Overseeing Committees," which  will supervise the work done by municipalities.    Their main responsibility will be to prevent more than 10  percent of resources appropriated for municipalities being spent  on current expenditures and to allocate the remaining 90 percent  for public investments.    The popular participation bill has an important economic  component. It is based on a new income distribution system.    It provides, for example, a modification to the  revenue-sharing scheme: 20 percent of funds will be appropriated  for municipal governments (up to now it was 10 percent) and 5  percent for universities. The 10 percent that was allotted to  development corporations has been eliminated. Municipalities  will thus have real control of regional funds.    Once the new law is enacted, municipalities will have local  governments to control a section of a province -- based on the  German system of political organization.    The centerpiece of the president's proposal is the VAT  [value-added tax] on hydrocarbons, which directly affects La Paz  Department.    He announced that taxes -- especially the VAT on  hydrocarbons  -- will no longer benefit the locality in which the company is  headquartered, but will be apportioned according to the new  population criteria.    La Paz Department's share of the VAT collection on  hydrocarbons is one of the most important resources to finance  its development.    The president also announced the establishment of a  $20-million compensatory fund for "poor" departments, which will  be disbursed by the National Treasury.    With regard to education and health care, grassroots  organizations will monitor officials' work, but it is clearly  established that the government will not shirk its  responsibility for providing this services. Therefore, while  each grassroots organization will be in charge of the  maintenance of hospitals, the central government will pay the  salaries of teachers and physicians.    The president added that the country's smallest villages  will  have more resources at their disposal. He failed to say how big  cities will fare as they will allegedly have to give up part of  their resources to finance the development of poorer villages.    "The main focal point -- La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz  de la Sierra -- will no longer monopolize everything," he said.    Despite all this explanation and because he failed to  jointly  present the financial bill, it is still not known how much money  will be allocated to the regions for division between provinces  and districts.</p>

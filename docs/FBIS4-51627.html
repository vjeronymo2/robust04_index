			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Pusan] </F>   [Text] The No. 2 Songgwang-ho, a trawler from Pusan--which  was fishing at the East China Sea, 220 miles southwest off Cheju  Island's Mosulpo--and 11 of its crewmen, including 44-year-old  Captain Sin Hyon-pok, were captured by a Chinese patrol boat at  around 1200 [0300 GMT] on 29 April.    Also at the same time on 29 April, the No. 27 Taehung-ho, a  120-tonne class trawler from Pusan--which was carrying out  repair work at sea 175 miles southwest off Cheju Island's  Mosulpo-- drifted toward the Chinese territorial waters because  of the undercurrent. Thus, this trawler and 11 of its crewmen,  including 41-year-old Captain Tak Hung-yang, were also  intercepted by the Chinese patrol boat.    Fishermen of the No. 1 Songgwang ship, who were fishing near  the seized No. 2 Songgwang ship, said that when they followed  the No. 2 Songgwang ship after seeing that it was being detained  by the Chinese patrol boat, which appeared suddenly, the Chinese  patrol boat cut the ropes connecting the tugboat and apprehended  the crewmen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government held its regular monthly meeting on  18-19 May to discuss reports on its socioeconomic performance in  the first six months, to outline measures to execute its work in  the last six months to present to the fifth session of the Ninth  National Assembly, and to decide on other important issues.  Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai chaired the meeting.    Tran Xuan Ta, vice chairman of the State Planning Commission  [SPC], on behalf of the SPC chairman, presented a report on the  execution of socioeconomic planning in the first six months.  Finance Minister Ho Te read a report on the implementation of  the state budget in the first six months. Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam reported on diplomatic activities in the recent  months.    Cabinet members discussed and agreed on the government  report, which is going to be presented to the National Assembly  in the upcoming session. The minister in charge of the  Government Organization and Personnel Commission [GOPC] also  reported planning for training and restraining of management  cadres and government officials. The cabinet agreed to charge  the GOPC and other responsible organs to perfect further the  planning before resubmitting it to the government in the coming  period. The meeting also offered views and passed a regulation  for the protection of consumers's rights and a regulation on  authors' copyright protection, which are going to be submitted  to the National Assembly Standing Committee in its upcoming  meeting.    Speaking at the concluding session of the meeting, Deputy  Prime Minister Phan Van Khai reminded cabinet members that  despite the fact that our socioeconomic situation has improved  continuously and has stabilized in all fields since the  beginning of this year, many problems relating to the  government's direct leadership and management have emerged.  That requires government leadership and management which must  be responsive and appropriate so national development can be  further improved in the coming months. The deputy prime  minister also stressed some measures to continue price  stabilization, to control inflation, to increase budget revenue,  to fight waste, to practice thrift, to ensure less spending from  5 to 7 percent as outlined in the National Assembly Resolution,  and to guarantee that the production development rate will reach  the initial planning target in order to maintain the stable  development rate for the entire year of 1994.</p>

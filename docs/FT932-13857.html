			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading INCREASED talk of recovery and the positive monthly CBI distributive trends survey led to a squeeze in stock index futures, sending the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index sharply ahead, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June contract was struck at 2,844, just below the previous night's close, and it found buyers from the outset which sent it advancing to 2,855 by midday, ignoring the worse than expected PSBR figures. The lunchtime period was marked by a bout of sideways trading and light profit-taking, and the poor opening on Wall Street made no significant impact. A squeeze developed in the last hour of trading, pulling the underlying cash market higher, and June finished at the day's best level of 2,873, up 28 from the prev-ious close and around 11 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Volume improved to 7,172 lots. The traded options also saw an improvement in turnover, with a total of 27,267 contracts traded. The FT-SE 100 option was particularly busy, trading 13,730 lots, and the Euro FT-SE option traded 2,714. Among the stock options, Tesco was the most active with a total 1,136 dealt and the August 200 calls the busiest series. It was followed by Asda at 1,006 lots and Barclays at 709. Also active were GEC and GKN.</p>

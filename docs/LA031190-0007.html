			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE BY FRANCES AND JOSEPH GIES  (HARPER &amp; ROW: $22.95; 257 PP.)  </P> <P> In this latest installment of the Gies' study of medieval life (their previous  books include "Life in a Medieval Castle" and "Life in a Medieval City"), the  couple focuses on the English village of Elton. Using histories, material from  archives and recent excavations at the town 70 miles outside of London, they  piece together an account of daily life as it was experienced by a 13th-Century  peasant.  </P> <P> Their extremely detailed research takes up in turn food, clothing, farm tools,  marriage customs, prayer, games -- in short, all conceivable threads in the  fabric of village life. One stereotype the authors seek to explode for the lay  reader is that an agricultural society is simple. An extremely complex system  of social obligations and legal entanglements held every man, woman and child  in its web, from lord to the lowest serf.  </P> <P> The simple and logical organization of the material -- together with the lively  illustrations taken from manuscript illumination, woodcuts, tapestry -- makes  "Life in a Medieval Village" a good general introduction to the history of this  period; unfortunately, the Gies' style is a little too dry to recommend to  teen-agers, who would be an ideal audience.  </P></p>

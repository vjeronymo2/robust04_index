			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Relations  Minister Roberto Robaina today applauded Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria's recent election to the post of OAS secretary  general.    Robaina participated in a meeting held as part of the First  International Conference on High Performance (CIAR) that began  in Havana on 28 March and which is scheduled to end tomorrow.    Upon concluding the presentation of a paper on the  importance  of Cuban sports delegations and other international political  issues, Colombian delegate Alex Villa asked Robaina his opinion  about President Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general.    Robaina emphasized that "Gaviria's election is quite  stimulating because, in the past, that organization has been  used as an instrument by some, and the Colombian president can  help keep it from being manipulated."    The head of Cuban diplomacy described Gaviria as a wise and  capable politician and very interested in Latin American  integration, which could prompt the OAS to become an advocate  for the continent's poorest sectors.    The foreign minister indicated that Cuba finds nothing  inappropriate about returning to the OAS, but emphasized that it  is necessary to wait for an invitation because the island was  expelled and therefore has no reason to knock on any doors.    Robaina also noted the Colombian president's political  courage in being the primary advocate of reestablishing  diplomatic relations between Colombia and Cuba, which is a "sign  of the winds of Latin American integration that are blowing in  these times."    Referring to reports of an alleged Colombian guerrilla  summit  in Havana, Robaina said some ill-intentioned person had  attempted to sabotage relations between the countries, but truth  fortunately prevailed and time has proven us right.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, April 7 (KPL) -- Australian Prime  Minister Paul Keating, yesterday morning handed over to Lao  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon the border control building on  the Lao side of the friendship bridge.    Mr. Vang Lattanavong, Lao ambassador to Australia and Mr.  Michael Mann, Australian ambassador to Laos were among high  ranking officials from both sides at the solemn hand-over  ceremony.    In his speech, Prime Minister Paul Keating said that  speaking  on behalf of the Australian Government and people, he was  pleased to hand over the border control building to the Lao  Government and people. He referred to the bridge as a door  opening up to the development in the country and the adjacent  facilities were regarded as the key of the development door.  The building houses immigration, customs, police, banks and  postal offices. He said that the border control building and  the Mekong bridge itself could best serve to testify, in the  concrete term, the fruitful Australian-Lao cooperation and  friendship. Mr. Paul Keating congratulated both Australian and  Lao technicians and workers whose high sense of responsibility  fullfilled the construction targets in terms of time and budget.  Australian prime minister touched upon the significance of the  Australian-Lao agreement for the promotion and protection of  investment which would help establish confidence for potential  Australian investors.    Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon of Laos in his return  address, speaking on behalf of the Lao people, said that the  facilities were built with Australian grant. Apart from the  Mekong bridge, the border control building, the gifts of the  Australian Government and people to Laos, would facilitate the  work of the Lao personnel.    Mr. Khamtai Siphandon expressed thanks once again to the  Australian side for its generosity and good intention. He said  that the Australian aid projects for Laos were highly  appreciated. They were the symbol for the ever increasing  traditional relations of friendship the two countries had  enjoyed. The Lao prime minister attached great importance to  the Australian aid which had instrumentally helped building the  country's economic infrastructure and helped free Laos from a  state of economic difficulties.    After delivering their speeches, both prime ministers  officially lifted the veil off the building foundation plate.    Mr. Paul Keating and his delegation left Laos on board of a  special plane for an official visit to the Kingdom of Thailand.  The Australian prime minister paid a two-day official visit to  the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] on April 5 and 6.</p>

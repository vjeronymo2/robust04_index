As he said, Russia "had indeed advanced such an initiative,  basing on some of Estonia's promises, and stipulated certain  conditions." "None of them have been met by the Estonian side,  and therefore the issue of final dates for the withdrawal of  troops remains open," the diplomat said.    Nevertheless, he noted, the Russian delegation is going to  join the next round of Russian-Estonian talks, which opens in  Tallinn on Tuesday, "in a constructive mood, and in the hope of  reaching mutually-acceptable solutions to all the key issues."    Udaltsov confirmed that Russia continues to think it  necessary to prepare for signing a basic treaty on troop  withdrawal "in a package" with an agreement on social guarantees  for Russian military retirees living in Estonia.    According to the diplomat, between Russia and Estonia "there  are virtually no unresolved problems as regards the basic  treaty." However, Estonia's stand on a number of fundamental  issues concerning the destiny of military retirees is  unacceptable to Russia. We hope that Tallinn will advance some  new proposals to help resolve the situation," Udaltsov said.</p>

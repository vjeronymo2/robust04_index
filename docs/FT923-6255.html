			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dissidents seek to oust Simpsons board A GROUP of disaffected shareholders in Simpsons of Cornhill, owners of the famous City eating house, yesterday announced plans to oust the board at an extraordinary meeting. The dissidents, led by Mr Robert Klapp - former chairman of Select Appointments - want to take control of the company amid claims that its existing directors have missed investment opportunities in the restaurant trade. Moves to replace the Nottingham-based management team were announced ahead of a separate EGM tomorrow where shareholders will vote on resolutions calling for the appointment of two directors from the dissident group. Mr Klapp's group claims the board at Simpsons, which also owns the Jamaica Inn and the Dell'Ugo and Palio restaurants, is out of touch with tough trading conditions in the London catering trade. The dissidents hope to force a second EGM following recent share transactions which could leave them short of the majority stake necessary to force through their resolutions. Up to 40 per cent of the shares are thought to be controlled by the rebel group, but it is unclear whether they can rely on a 10 per cent stake purchased last week by Mountjoy, an offshore company registered in the Turk and Caicos Islands. Mr Paul Reece, managing director of Simpsons, yesterday claimed that Mr Klapp had sold 50 per cent of his shares to Mountjoy, diluting the dissidents' chances of success. 'A second EGM would be a waste of the company's time,' he added. 'These people have no experience of our industry.' The dissident group, however, said: 'We are hopeful of further support from recent share buyers who are not currently on the share register. 'We will be writing to all shareholders in the next few days to let them know of our plans.'</p>

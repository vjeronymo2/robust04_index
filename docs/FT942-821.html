			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Moslems press Bosnia offensive: Serbs mark fateful anniversary The Serbs will today mark one of the most fateful anniversaries in their region's history, amid ominous signs that its future is again being decided on the battlefield and not around the negotiating table. The forces of Bosnia's Moslem-led government, who have gained ground in recent fighting, were engaged yesterday in fierce artillery duels with Serb fighters in the north of the republic. A British soldier was killed in an exchange of fire with Serb troops on Sunday night near the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, the United Nations said yesterday. He was the sixth Briton to die in the on-going conflict. The contact group of US, Russian and west European negotiators is expected to announce a high-level meeting by next week at which the warring parties in Bosnia will be pressed to accept a partition formula. Both sides have in recent days pledged to fight on, in spite of the ceasefire which came into force on June 10 and initially held quite well. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the new peace efforts were doomed because 'Serb soldiers are the only ones who draw maps on Bosnian territory'. His remarks may have been directed at a domestic audience on the eve of today's twin anniversary of the battle of Kosovo, when the Serbs were subdued by the Turks in 1389, and the 1914 assassination in Sarajevo which triggered the first world war. In recent interviews, General Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnian army, has said his army is entering the 'liberation phase of the armed struggle'. Commander Eric Chaperon, a UN spokesman, yesterday reported artillery duels of up to 15 rounds a minute, suggesting that the fighting was unusually intense. According to unconfirmed local media reports, some 6,000 Serb villagers have fled their stronghold in the Mount Ozren area. Croatian radio said 12 Serb settlements had been captured. The latest fighting is to the south of the Serb land corridor in the Sava River valley, a strip of land that is seen by all sides as crucial to the outcome of the war. The Serbs have vowed to defend the route because it links Belgrade to Serb-held parts of Bosnia and Croatia. Bosnian Moslem leaders believe they can capture several towns in the north which were mostly Moslem before the war. Croatia, too, hopes that by severing the corridor they would gain the upper hand against Serb forces who have carved out their own state covering a third of Croatian territory. Lord David Owen, the European Union mediator, said yesterday he was anxious to see talks restarted soon between the Croatian government and the Croatian Serbs.</p>

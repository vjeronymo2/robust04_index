			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Right wingers converged on two towns today to  highlight their demands for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland].  These reports from Rene Heine in Newcastle and Andries van Zyl  in Bloemfontein.    [Heine] Newcastle was transformed into Boer country today.  Farmers, residents, and supporters of the Volksfront [National  Front] gathered in the center of the town. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Rene Heine is still in Newcastle. Rene, what's  the latest?    [Heine] I'm standing here at a packed farmers' hall outside  Newcastle where thousands of Afrikaner Volksfront supporters  have gathered. Gen. Tienie Groenewald has just addressed the  crowd and told them to prepare for mobilization. He said a new  government will take over 80 percent of the Afrikaners' jobs.  He said this was the ANC's [African National Congress]  so-called affirmative action. His constant reference to a  volkstaat for northern Natal was met by loud applause and  cheering from the crowd. CP [Conservative Party] leader Dr.  Ferdi Hartzenberg will in minutes address the crowd.</p>

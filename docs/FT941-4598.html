			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Microvitec ends year Pounds 1.6m in the black Microvitec, the USM-quoted computing services company, consolidated its return to the black in the first half and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m for the year to end-December. The result was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 49.9m to Pounds 35.2m, of which Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 19.6m) came from discontinued operations. The turnround from last year's Pounds 2.1m pre-tax loss was helped by the sale of the distribution business in January 1993, leading to a considerable reduction in group borrowings. Mr James Bailey, executive chairman, said gearing had fallen from 87 per cent at the end of 1992 to 48 per cent by the middle of 1993, and this level had been maintained for the rest of the year. This led to a reduction in the net interest charge from Pounds 837,000 to Pounds 288,000. Earnings per share emerged at 2.1p against previous losses of 3.4p. Mr Bailey said the current year had started well, and the order book was strong. In addition, the strategic alliance with Acorn was likely to produce annualised sales of Pounds 6m, he said. A capital restructuring of the company is to be proposed at the AGM to enable the directors to consider dividend payments in future years, Mr Bailey added.</p>

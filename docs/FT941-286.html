			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Markets Report: All eyes on Italy Dealers kept a wary eye on Italy yesterday as markets sought to assess the implications of the election victory of the right wing Freedom Alliance, writes Philip Gawith. Trade was subdued following the earlier rise in the currency based on exit polls. After appreciating by more than L10 on Monday to L978.4 against the D-Mark, the Italian currency had a quiet day and finished marginally firmer at L977.9. That one of the political groupings achieved a victory was regarded as positive, but concern remains about whether the Alliance can form a stable government. Elsewhere in Europe, tighter money market conditions induced a measure of pessimism about the scope for a cut in the German repo rate today. The D-Mark finished slightly firmer in London against the French franc, at FFr3.424 from FFr3.422. It was weaker against the Spanish peseta, closing at Pta82.08 from Pta82.15. Sterling, meanwhile, fell to its lowest levels this year. The trade weighted index finished at 79.8 from 80.2. The UK currency was hit by the government's climbdown over voting rights in the European Union. It closed in London at DM2.4889 from DM2.5035. It was also lower against the weaker dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.4927 from Dollars 1.4966. With Italy apparently set to have a Berlusconi government, the question now occupying markets is whether it will be a sustainable one. The Forza Italia leader will have to settle differences between his two squabbling allies - the separatist Northern league and the neo-fascist National Alliance. Although there is broad agreement among analysts that the lira is undervalued and the economic outlook good, stable government is seen as a prerequisite for optimism. A period of uncertainty, however, lies ahead as the victors attempt to form a government before parliament reconvenes on April 15. Mr Stephen Yorke, chief European analyst at Chase Manhattan, is pessimistic about the outlook. He says the result is 'what everyone feared. No clear-cut winner who can govern alone over the medium term, but rather a populist whose ability to govern within a coalition will be in direct proportion to the havoc he wreaks on Italy's budget'. The Chase analyst predicts that the lira could fall to L1,000 against the D-Mark by April 15 and said it is difficult to be positive after that. He believes the only way the coalition will be kept together is by offering 'fiscal sweeties' to the South, and tax cuts to the North. 'The budget will be hit at both ends,' he said. Other are less downbeat. Lehman Brothers, for example, sees the lira finishing the year at L920. Sterling's weakness can be traced to a host of factors, including interest rate uncertainty, tax increases casting doubt on the sustainability of economic recovery, and poor trade figures. A further factor which has reasserted itself is political risk. The compromise over EU voting procedures appears to have further weakened the authority of Prime Minister John Major. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, commented: 'There is growing concern that both wings of the Tory party are calling into question John Major's leadership qualities.' There is little expectation of a near term rate cut emerging from today's monthly monetary meeting between UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The futures market continues to provide a very bearish view on interest rates. The June short sterling contract fell 7 basis points to 94.55. The contract has dropped 35 basis points in the last three weeks. Over the same period the December future has lost 70 points to 93.96, implying base rates of above 6 per cent at the year-end. The December 1995 contract is discounting an 8 per cent base rate. Many analysts believe the market is too pessimistic and predict that subdued inflation will allow a further rate cut. In the discount market the Bank of England provided Pounds 915m of assistance after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 900m. Tight end-of-month conditions caused German call money rates to jump from 5.70/5.75 per cent to 6.25/6.75 per cent as banks were forced to borrow at the Lombard window. This dampened hopes for any substantial fall in the repo rate at today's weekly tender. Banks are likely to have been more cautious in their bidding for fear the Bundesbank would not allot them the necessary amount to meet their month-end requirements. The dollar was weaker again, finishing at DM1.6675 from DM1.6728. It also ended lower against the yen, at Y103.600 from Y104.620. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.6727 and Y103.125. Analysts said yen strength was the result of capital repatriation accompanying the fiscal year-end. Further evidence of government opposition to numerical trade targets also renewed fears that the US government would try to talk up the Japanese currency.</p>

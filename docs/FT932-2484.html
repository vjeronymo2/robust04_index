			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: Booker's snap Observer would hate to sound a sour note about Booker's brand new chief executive, Charles Bowen. But has anyone spotted the superficial similarities between Booker's new ceo and Tate &amp; Lyle's recently departed head honcho, Stephen Brown? Brown didn't even last a year in the job. One thing both companies obviously have in common is Jonathan Taylor, now chairman of Booker and a non-executive director of the sugar and sweeteners group since 1988. Another is that both operations are in the agribusiness, a third is that each appointee is coming from Canada. Finally, even the names of the ceo's are only one letter different. But that is where the similarities stop. For a start, Brown was on a luxury three-year rolling contract, while Bowen has a fixed term. Bowen comes from a food industry background but he has also run lots of diverse businesses which is what Booker is all about. Brown, by contrast, was imported from Alcan, a highly focused company making aluminium. Further, it would be hard to find two more dissimilar chairmen than the laid-back Taylor and the interfering Neil Shaw.</p>

Cities Refuse Expensive Goods"]    [Text] The domestic food market has already reacted to the  recent increase in import tariffs. In fact, there is no demand  at the moment for the supply of food that is now much dearer and  no one is in a hurry to conclude contracts on new terms.    At the Moscow government food resources department I was  shown tenders for the supply of food from a number of Russian  regions. The suppliers instantly assessed the situation that  arose after the Russian Government introduced higher import  tariffs and they immediately jacked up the prices of the  products they supply. Above all we are talking about livestock  products. For instance, Smolensk is prepared to supply the  capital with 100 tonnes of butter at 3,700 rubles [R] per  kilogram, and then another 50 tonnes, but this time at R4,200;  Vologda named more or less the same prices, while Voronezh  raised butter prices to R5,000.    The asking price of poultry has shot even higher -- 30  percent above the average world level. And this depite the fact  that unlike imported chickens, which have been drawn and wrapped  in cellophane, our suppliers can only provide partly drawn  chickens, which will not keep for long.    IZVESTIYA's own correspondents report that you find a  similar  situation in other Russian regions, with suppliers asking  similar prices. But just as in Moscow, purchasing agents  everywhere are in no hurry to buy food at those prices.  Conclusion of contracts has been suspended everywhere. We can  see why.    In the first place, as the city authorities told our  correspondents, at these prices the structure of supply and  demand is bound to change, since the population's ability to pay  is limited, so there have to be major adjustments in purchasing  levels. Second, there are substantial stocks of food everywhere  -- in inflationary conditions purchasing agents try to make  these stocks as secure as possible, so now there is no need to  rush into new contracts. Finally, everyone is very confident  that the president will cancel or at any rate amend the decree  -- its adverse consequences for Russian consumers are too  obvious.</p>

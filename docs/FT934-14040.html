			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Court imposes Pounds 172m damages: Samuel Montagu to appeal against award to B&amp;C creditors SAMUEL MONTAGU, the merchant bank, was ordered yesterday to pay damages of Pounds 172m to the creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the collapsed financial services group, after one of the lengthiest and most complex pieces of litigation in City history. Quadrex, a Delaware corporation controlled by Mr Gary Klesch, which employed Samuel Montagu as its advisers, was also ordered to pay damages of Pounds 10m to B&amp;C. Samuel Montagu could be ordered to pay a further Pounds 8m in December plus legal costs of about Pounds 10m arising from the litigation which began more than five years ago. Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled in the commercial court yesterday on the size of the damages to be paid to the creditors of B&amp;C, which entered administration in June 1990. He had ruled in May 1991 that both Quadrex and Samuel Montagu were liable to pay damages to B&amp;C. Samuel Montagu, a subsidiary of Midland Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), said: 'We were surprised at the liability judgment and we are very surprised at the quantum. We will be appealing. We believe we are being pursued as the deep pocket.' The bank had put into court Pounds 15m, without admitting liability, which it had thought would enable a fair settlement. HSBC, the parent bank, had made Pounds 80m provision to cover the cost of paying the damages. Yesterday it disclosed that this was to be increased by an additional Pounds 95m provision in this year's accounts. The dispute arose over B&amp;C's 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings. This relied on an agreement that Quadrex would then buy Mercantile's wholesale broking division. However, after the bid, Quadrex did not have the money to make the purchase, which led to B&amp;C making a damages claim for breach of contract. B&amp;C also sued Samuel Montagu for negligent misstatement over assurances given to B&amp;C by its then managing director and current deputy chairman, Mr Ian McIntosh. The judge ruled that Mr McIntosh knowingly and negligently took a risk in assuring B&amp;C that Quadrex had the funds to make the purchase when the money was not in fact available. Mr Peter Phillips, of accountants Buchler Phillips, working on behalf of the B&amp;C administrators in the trial, said the award would represent 11p-16p in the pound for B&amp;C Holdings creditors. Creditors are unlikely to be paid until after appeals are heard on liability and the size of the damages, scheduled to begin in January 1995. Mr Oliver Greene, a managing director of Chase Manhattan Investment Bank, one of B&amp;C's creditors said: 'This is a sensible result. The creditors should feel reasonably happy with this charge.'</p>

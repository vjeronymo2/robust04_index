			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / People: Fresh wings for Pegasus PEGASUS GROUP, the USM-listed accounting software specialist, has installed Jonathan Hubbard-Ford as the new chief executive in succession to Derek Moon. Hubbard-Ford, 49, who comes from information technology consultants Butler Cox, where he had been group finance director, says a high priority will be to 'look very carefully at the product range and strategy'. One area he highlights where Pegasus has struggled is in open systems products. He will also hope to improve distribution channels. Before returning to the UK in 1985, Hubbard-Ford had spent 11 years in Hong Kong with Hutchison Whampoa, latterly as chief operating officer. Meanwhile, the new boss claims to be philosophical about the bid speculation that has periodically surrounded Pegasus. 'If you operate a public company you are constantly aware you will be looked over' he says, adding that he is 'fully prepared' if anyone should display interest. Moon, 62, is now non-executive chairman.</p>

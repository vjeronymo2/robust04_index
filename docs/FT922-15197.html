			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Western aid to fill trade gap for Russia THE Western aid to Russia unveiled yesterday is intended to fill the critical balance of payments gap faced by Russia after the collapse of its external trade, just as it is embarking on a drastic reform programme. Broad details were spelt out yesterday in Bonn and Washington, on behalf of the Group of Seven (G7) western industrialised states, in an open effort to strengthen support for President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in Germany's finance ministry and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief adviser for the forthcoming world economic summit in Munich, said yesterday the Dollars 18bn (Pounds 10.4bn) assumption for this year included Dollars 4bn drawn directly from the International Monetary Fund. This represents 100 per cent of the Russian quota of 3 per cent, agreed by existing IMF members on Tuesday. The other former Soviet republics will get a further 1.75 per cent. On top of the Dollars 4bn would be up to Dollars 1.5bn from the World Bank in the current year, and more cash available from the Bank for European Reconstruction and Development. Export credit guarantees, and food credits from the western countries, would push the total up to around Dollars 13bn, and contributions from the Scandinavian countries should bring it up to Dollars 18bn, Mr Kohler said. The entire package depends on agreement between the Russian government and the IMF on an adjustment programme, which could be finalised in May, with first credit tranches coming as soon as June - before the Munich summit in July. World Bank credits should also be available in June or July, Mr Kohler said. The secondary stabilisation fund for the rouble would also be directly linked to the implementation of the IMF adjustment programme, and only a global sum of Dollars 6bn has been agreed. Finance could be provided partly by the G7 member states, and partly by the fund, with a supervisory committee to ensure that the strict conditions - above all that the money should not be used to fund consumer goods imports - are upheld. Mr Kohler, speaking on the express instructions of Mr Kohl, welcomed the US involvement in the support programme as 'late but gratifying'. He said that it represented a fair burden-sharing for Germany, which had been carrying by far the largest share of aid and credit for the former Soviet Union. The only new money from Germany would be whatever it has to contribute to currency stabilisation. Its main contribution to the Dollars 18bn comes from DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in export credit guarantees promised this year. The immediate package concerns Russia alone. However, Mr Kohler said agreement had been reached in the G7 on a framework for co-operation with Russia and the other former Soviet republics. Precise details remain to be finalised. Mr Kohler said that other republics would have to undergo exactly the same negotiating process with the IMF in order to qualify for similar treatment. There would be no exceptions, and he stressed repeatedly that agreement on an IMF adjustment programme was an 'absolute precondition' for large-scale western assistance. On the other hand, he insisted that the framework agreed represented 'the basis of a reliable aid programme', which would fill the payments gap faced by Russia in the immediate future, and was intended to strengthen the hand of Mr Yeltsin and his government to push through their programme. As soon as Russian membership of the IMF was agreed - by the end of April - he said the fund and the Russian government would conduct an immediate and comprehensive 'economic stock-taking'. That would form the basis of a comprehensive adjustment programme to be finalised in May. He said the Russian government's economic programme had already been submitted, and the initial judgment of the fund was positive.</p>

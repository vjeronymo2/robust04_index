			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: PETTY LAUGHS LAST ON 'FULL MOON FEVER';  </P> <P> ON HIS OWN, THE WILBURY DELIVERS SAD STORIES, RIDICULOUS DETAIL;  </P> <P> TOM PETTY "FULL MOON FEVER." MCA ***  </P> <P> Here it is, folks: "The Traveling Wilburys, Volume Two." (a.k.a. Tom Petty's  first so-called solo album, sans the full-time support of his Heartbreakers.)  It's not so much the cast -- though Jeff Lynne carries a quite audible presence  as co-producer, and both George Harrison and the late Roy Orbison show up among  the support crew -- as the attitude.  </P> <P> Petty contributed the jokiest material to the Wilburys' already wit-riddled  platter, and "Full Moon Fever" is similarly, subtly light of lyric. Not to  imply that Petty has turned class clown on us; only to reinforce that here he  carries on the Travelers' trenchant penchant for telling a sad story with  ridiculously trivial bits of detail.  </P> <P> The ironic, bittersweet opening track, "Free Fallin'," is a most telling tale  as Petty doth protest too much about how he doesn't miss the sweet young thing  he deserted back in Reseda. "All the vampires walkin' through the Valley / Move  west down Ventura Boulevard," he sings, and as he gets to that last phrase, a  lush Lynne chorale of voices comes in to intone the name of that street of  dreams, as if reinforcing an essential detail in a mythic country-Western song.  </P> <P> The rest of this free-form collection is nearly as nifty, from the first  single, "I Won't Back Down" (similar to the Heartbreakers' halting, synth-heavy  "You Got Lucky"), to the knock-off version of the Byrds' "I'll Feel a Whole Lot  Better," to the closing "Zombie Zoo" (a tribute to pale-faced trendiness).  You'll find far less experimentation here than on, say, "Southern Accents," but  Petty didn't make this album to break ground. He just wants to kick up a little  dirt. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

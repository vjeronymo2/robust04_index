			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Ford to cut night shifts: Escort production reduced - Lancia marque withdrawn Ford is to suspend night-shift operations throughout January at its Halewood plant on Merseyside. The company faces sharply lower demand in Continental car markets. The plant, which makes the Escort, has already been badly hit by the Continental downturn and has been on a three-day week since November 25. Its 4,700 hourly-paid workers will resume five-day working when they return after the Christmas break on January 5, but suspending the night shift will reduce daily output from 1,000 cars to about 600. This means lost production of about 6,500 cars for the whole of January. Employees fear the night shift may not be restored until the end of next year's first quarter, and Ford is doing little to allay these fears. Night-shift staff will be redeployed to other duties, such as training and mainten-ance. Most of Ford's other manufacturing plants in the UK have also been affected by the market slump, and are taking extended Christmas breaks. Halewood's workforce has also been told by Mr John Fleming, its plant manager, that projected productivity improvements over the next four to five years can be expected to lead to a further 1,400 job cuts in assembly and body manufacturing. However, he said the job shedding process would continue to be on the basis of voluntary redundancy. Productivity improvements have already seen the Halewood workforce falling steadily. About 1,400 have been lost in the past two years alone. Last year the plant - excluding gearbox manufacturing, which employs 1,200 - produced 160,000 cars with a workforce of just under 5,000. Ford managers point to rival plants such as the Toyota facility at Burnaston, Derbyshire, as illustrating the need for continuing productivity rises. Toyota plans to assemble 200,000 cars a year at Burnaston with a workforce of 3,000. Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU engineering and electrical workers' union, said yesterday he was 'obviously concerned' at the Halewood move. 'The government is saying we are coming out of recession, but this does not square with the reality on the ground,' he said. The company stressed that any redundancies would be voluntary. 'This is a pro-jection based on demands for efficiency. It does not take into account other factors which may come along,' it said.</p>

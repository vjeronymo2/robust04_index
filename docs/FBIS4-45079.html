			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Towards Better Ties"] </F>   [Text] With a tangible shift beginning to become  discernible in Indo-US relations, it is time the two countries  took it as a starting point to iron out differences that had  soured mutual relations in the past. The immediate manifestation  of the face-off was the US action in letting more than a year go  by without sending an envoy to New Delhi. To many in India this  appeared to be a deliberate downgrading of the world's largest  democracy to second class status. Then there were other issues  where US took an uncompromising stand. The combined effect was  the strengthening of the belief that the South Asia policy of  the US tended to tilt in favour of Pakistan vis-a-vis India. The  latest thaw, as seen in the changed nuance of the US policy on  Kashmir, both in tone and content, is a welcome development from  the Indian point of view. Apart from this, there are indications  of serious efforts on the part of White House to put relations  with India on a sound footing. This is evident from the move to  send a scholar and expert on India, possibly Ainsley T. Embree  -- known for his vast knowledge of India, its history and  culture -- as special adviser to ambassador-designate Frank  Wisner. Embree is expected to help the US Administration  understand the compulsions and constraints that shape Indian  policies.    While the sensitivity being shown by the Clinton  Administration needs to be appreciated, it is also necessary for  India to resist any arm-twisting tactic on the part of the super  power when it comes to nuclear non-proliferation and other  issues. At one stage there were fears that the US would settle  for nothing short of an unconditional surrender on the question  of NPT (Non-proliferation Treaty). That stage is now over and  the US has begun to show a better awareness of the reasons for  India's reservations. The latest US moves point to an implied  respect for India and its democratic institutions. This can be  treated as the tangible fruit of the end of cold war in Indo-US  relations. Other prickly problems should not be beyond  resolution once the two sides hold meaningful dialogues.</p>

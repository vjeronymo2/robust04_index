			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: A lifetime in opera - Andrew Clark talks to outspoken Czech conductor Bohumil Gregor It is a matter of national pride: Bohumil Gregor, doyen of Czech opera conductors, finds fault with Elijah Moshinsky's staging of The Bartered Bride, which he is to conduct in Geneva over the next two weeks. 'Maybe I'm too old,' says Gregor, 68, who first conducted Smetana's opera in Prague in the late 1940s, 'but Mr Moshinsky doesn't understand Smetana. Stage directors today don't seem to care what the composer is saying. The works are being misused. Smetana knew more about drama than Mr Moshinsky will ever know.' Fortunately, Moshinsky is not present to hear Gregor's criticism. The production - first performed by English National Opera in the mid-1980s - has been restaged for Geneva by ENO staff producer David Ritch, who has made discreet changes to suit Gregor's taste. Gregor signed his contract without knowing that the setting had been updated. He says Moshinsky took extreme liberties with the text, and that the costumes are more Russian than Czech. With that thunderblast out of the way, Gregor settles down to reflect on a lifetime in opera. He began his career in 1945 playing double bass in the orchestra of the Grand Theatre of the Fifth of May, the avant-garde Prague company which launched the careers of numerous Czech artists in the postwar era. Gregor made his conducting debut in 1947 with Madama Butterfly, and quickly picked up a core repertory of Italian, French and Czech operas. He was surrounded by singers and conductors who were the living embodiment of Czech operatic tradition. Many had been engaged by leading contemporaries of Janacek, and were able to pass on unique insights. 'There was no formal instruction, but you could learn a lot if you had the ears - just sitting in the canteen while they discussed how they had sung this or that. The tradition was alive in the building  - for me it was like mother's milk.' After gaining further experience in Brno and Ostrava, Gregor returned to Prague in 1962 with a reputation as a Janacek specialist. He conducted From the House of the Dead during the National Theatre's ground-breaking trip to the Edinburgh Festival in 1964. Guest contracts in Stockholm, Hamburg and San Francisco quickly followed. He also began a 20-year association with the Netherlands Opera. His pioneering Janacek recordings on Supraphon date from this period. British musicians on the continent who have worked with Gregor draw comparisons between his approach to Janacek and Reginald Goodall's to Wagner: they speak of the same undertow of feeling, developed through long study, patient coaching of singers and a stubborn insistence on proper rehearsal conditions. But Gregor says instinct has always played the most important part. 'If you just have the score, you're lost. In performance it never turns out quite as written, because Janacek does not make clear the differences in tempo. He'll use one general marking for fast or slow, leaving you to work out the tempo relationships and make certain decisions for yourself. You have to use your knowledge of his style to work out how it should sound. He used this nonsense word scasovka (cas = time) - you won't find it in the dictionary. But if you break the word up, it has something to do with 'the connection of two times' - it's quite clear he was talking about tempi. It's part of the oddity of Janacek.' Gregor says there is no fundamental difference in the way he conducts Janacek, Smetana or Dvorak. 'They all drew on the same material - the melody of language. Words provided the inspiration for music. Janacek was the first to articulate it, but Smetana used it without realising. Listen to Kecal singing about money in The Bartered Bride, or the way Dvorak puts the stress on certain words in The Devil and Kate: it's exactly how you would speak it. You also find the roots of Martinu's polyrhythmic style in Smetana's dances. That kind of rhythmic subtlety is in our national musical character.' Out of favour at home, Gregor and his wife Blanka spent most of the 1970s and 1980s abroad. Only after the 1989 Velvet Revolution did he discover that the National Theatre's former Communist boss, Premysl Koci, had saved him from denunciation. 'He wrote in my official file that I was to be left alone because I was unbalanced and a little crazy  - it was like something out of Kafka] He could be a very unpleasant man, but in his heart he loved the theatre and tried to help the people who worked there.' Over the past five years Gregor has done what he can to shore up the National Theatre's artistic credibility. He bemoans the lack of money and managerial skills, and says that by playing works like Yevgeny Onegin and Romeo et Juliette in the original language, the company is losing its traditional Czech audience. He has agreed to conduct new productions of Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen and Smetana's The Two Widows - on condition that they are a true collaboration between conductor and stage director. 'I will make the choice. If I'm not satisfied, I won't say 'you have to change it'. I simply won't conduct.' The Bartered Bride is performed at the Grand Theatre, Geneva, on November 7, 10, 12, 15, 18 and 21.</p>

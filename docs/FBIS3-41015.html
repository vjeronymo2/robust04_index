What Lies  in Store for Baykonur?"]    [Text] The mass media of many countries readily publish  materials on the fate of Baykonur Cosmodrome. The business,  scientific, and political world is concerned about the problem  of preserving this unique creation of human hands.    "Farewell, Baykonur," "The Destruction of Baykonur Is the  Tragedy of the Century," "Nightmare at the Cosmodrome" -- this  is a far from complete list of the headlines in Russian and  foreign newspapers and magazines.    But what is the true state of affairs? In an attempt to  answer this question, representatives of the U.S. firm of Anser  [name as transliterated] -- Messrs. R. Dalby and B. Alexander --  visited Baykonur last year. After spending less than two days  at the cosmodrome and viewing the launch and technical complexes  of the Soyuz, Proton, and Energiya carrier rockets (30 minutes  at each complex), the guests happily set off home. Not even a  high-class specialist is able to assess the technical condition  of very complex systems in such a short space of time, apart  from forming an impression of their outward appearance. But the  U.S. experts drew hasty conclusions without a moment's  hesitation: "The breakup of the USSR has not affected  Baykonur's potential." In their haste the gentlemen from across  the ocean did not attach any significance to the following  "trifle": Of the 40 major organizations involved in  implementing space programs in past years, just over 10 are left  today. The test cosmodrome now functions only thanks to  military specialists carrying out their official duty in bleak  climatic conditions and in the humiliating position of an  indeterminate legal status. The potential of the military  contingent, which is fatigued as a result of everyday troubles,  is not infinite, however. Meanwhile, the U.S. experts maintain  that the tragic situation in which the servicemen find  themselves has been "greatly and deliberately" exaggerated.  This is allegedly being done for the sole purpose of  "squeezing" more money out of the government.    But why did the Americans need to "put a gloss" on the  situation? It is no secret that a worldwide struggle is being  waged for a place in the "space Klondyke." And anything goes in  this struggle, as the saying goes. Baykonur really is in need  of serious assistance to maintain impeccable technical  readiness. One or two glitches in carrying out international  programs, and it would mean the end of the world reputation of  the unique complex. Is this not the version that the gentlemen  from Anser had in mind?    P. Berlin, another U.S. expert, is still more subtly cunning  when he concludes: "The risk in contracts for commercial  launches appears insignificant." In short, the cosmodrome is in  full order, with the exception that there is "no comfort" at  Leninsk. Not that this will hamper commercial launches in any  way. And yet Mr. Berlin must know that it is only possible to  win the competition for a commercial satellite launch by giving  the client solid service, including a high-class hotel, "car  keys," excellent roads to the launch site, and so on. Leninsk  is not ready for this today. Additional capital investments are  also needed, otherwise Russia will quit the space market  empty-handed.    More than 20 delegations from the United States, France,  Germany, India, Turkey, and other countries have visited the  cosmodrome recently. Guests arrive at the invitation and under  the patronage of Russian firms such as the "Energiya" Science  and Production Association, the M.V. Khrunichev Association, the  Space Research Institute, the Russian Space Agency, and the  National Aerospace Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The  delegations are different, but they are all united by one thing:  Not once has anyone deemed it necessary to notify the  cosmodrome's command of their visit.    On the other hand, both the Kazakhstani press and Russian  newspapers keep "chewing" over an old story with a persistence  worthy of better application -- the cosmodrome's servicemen want  to create a military space base on the republic's territory.  The local newspaper altogether accuses us of wishing to  "militarize space."    The most popular "refrain" in numerous local press  statements  is the assertion that the Republic of Kazakhstan is the  cosmodrome's master. Askar Nurmanov, a specialist of the  Kazakhstani Aerospace Agency, declared: "We unexpectedly found  ourselves the possessors of such a structure and were not ready  to exploit it." I will comment that considerable funds, in  addition to high-class specialists (whom Kazakhstan does not  have today), are needed for the normal "exploitation" of the  cosmodrome. According to last year's estimates, 38 billion  rubles are needed annually.    Until this year, however, this sum was distributed between  Russia and Kazakhstan in the following proportion: Russia paid  94 percent, and Kazakhstan just 6 percent. Since Baykonur is  located on Kazakhstani soil, this implied that the rest was  covered by leasing the land allocated to the cosmodrome and the  landing zone.    As far as this is legitimate, let the economists and  financiers -- in short, those whose job it is -- resolve  matters. To date a whole package of documents regulating many  questions has already been adopted. There is the creation of an  open-type joint-stock company at the cosmodrome. The granting  of privileges to all specialists who come to us to work.  Finally, a memorandum has been signed which attempts to  regulate the interests of all the sides involved in fulfilling  space programs.    Unfortunately, as practice has shown, many documents do not  entirely remove the tension. But the main point is that efforts  are being made to this end.    We are prepared to meet journalists and experts, specialists  and dilettantes, to show and tell them everything the way it is.  Our only request is one which Mikhail Bulgakov expressed  exhaustively on addressing young litterateurs: "Write what you  see, and do not write what you do not see!"

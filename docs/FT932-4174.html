			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eaglet offer to raise Pounds 30m EAGLET Investment Trust is being launched via an offer for subscription which hopes to raise up to Pounds 30m. The new trust, which will invest in smaller companies with a market capitalisation of under Pounds 50m, is issuing up to 30m shares, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Management will be undertaken by CW Asset Management, a subsidiary of Capital Ventures, best known for its activities in the Business Expansion Scheme market. Mr Peter Webb, who previously ran the Thornton Smaller Companies unit trust, owns 25 per cent of CW Asset and will be running the trust. The aim will be to outperform the Extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding investment trusts). If the net asset value outperforms the index by 2 per cent a year, then CW will receive 5 per cent of the excess, subject to a ceiling of 0.7 per cent of net assets. The basic management fee will be 1 per cent of gross assets per year. Smaller company shares have rebounded since the pound's departure from the ERM in September, having suffered badly during the recession. Minimum subscription level for the offer, which will close on July 2, is Pounds 500.</p>

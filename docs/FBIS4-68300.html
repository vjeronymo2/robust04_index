			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kirill Petrov: "Talks in Bishkek Started"; </F> "Accompanied by Battles in Nagorno-Karabakh"]    [Text] We have already gotten used to the fact that the  news from the Karabakh conflict zone is contradictory. The  present spring campaign is no exception.    According to the press service of the Defense Ministry of  Azerbaijan, Armenian armed formations are attacking in the  Tertery and Agdam axes using artillery and armor. The same  source asserts that the Armenians lost 50 soldiers and one tank  in the offensive.    But the press service of the NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]  Army staff reports essentially the opposite: The Azerbaijan Army  is trying to push an advance in the northeastern sector of the  front, but Karabakh subunits are holding up its attack. Both  sides are suffering losses.    One thing is clear: The front line is hardly changing. The  May burst of activity in the Karabakh front was no more than the  backdrop to the next talks, which began on May 4 in Bishkek, for  a peaceful settlement of the Karabakh problem. Participating in  them, according to the RIA, are a Russian delegation headed by  the chairman of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly  of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] and Chairman of  the Federation Council, Vladimir Shumeyko, and delegations from  Kirghizia and the Aland Islands (Finland).    Vladimir Shumeyko pointed out the impermissibility of  military actions between CIS countries and called on all  politicians and military of the Commonwealth, upon whom the  solution to the problem depends, to join the peace initiatives.    The Azerbaijan side considers the actions of Armenia on the  territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to be military aggression and  demands their immediate cessation. Speaking on May 4, the deputy  chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan, Afiyandin Jalilov  stated that as a result of combat actions more than 20%  of the  territory of Azerbaijan was occupied by Armenian armed  formations, more than a million people had become refugees, more  than 4 thousand persons were hostages, and around 700 populated  areas lay in ruins. "In the long-standing conflict that has  proliferated into war, both peoples are suffering, the Azeris  and the Armenians," stressed Jalilov. He stated that he expects  the signing of an immediate cease-fire agreement from the  Bishkek meeting. The head of the Armenian delegation, Chairman  of the Supreme Soviet Babken Ararktsyan stated that Armenia  welcomes any peace initiatives directed toward cessation of the  conflict, but is against fruitless declarations that do not take  the real interests of the sides into account.    Representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh decided to air their  opinions behind closed doors.    I believe it to be symptomatic that it was on May 4 that the  President of Azerbaijan, Gaydar Aliyev, affixed his signature to  the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program in Brussels.    Something else is symptomatic as well. By all appearances, a  noisy trial is coming to a head in Baku. The former Defense  Minister of Azerbaijan Rakhim Gaziyev is accused of surrendering  Sochi in May of 1992. According to the Procurator General of the  Republic, Ali Omarov, Gaziyev will be charged under three  articles of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan and may be  imprisoned for 6 to 8 years. Remember that at one time  ex-president Ayaz Mutalibov was accused of losing Khodzhala.    The fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh appears to have faded into  the background, while both in Baku and in Yerevan they are much  more interested in the political games surrounding it.</p>

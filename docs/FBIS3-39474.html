Our  soldiers are certainly not backing out but, on behalf of all of  them, Admiral Angelo Mariani, chief of general staff, said:  "All we want is for the Navy to be given the means to fulfill  its task properly. We are concerned -- but, frankly, we are  more than just concerned -- that our men's commitment and  professionalism will not be enough if in the meantime the right  choices are not made in terms of investment and equipment."    According to a report on the state of the Army, in 1993 the  defense budget amounted to 25.56 trillion lire [L]. The Navy  absorbed L3.458 trillion, which represents 19 percent of overall  expenditure. Forecasts for 1994 confirm the budget is  shrinking. The assumed availability of L26.167 trillion for  defense means a 2.4 percent increase in monetary terms, but this  amounts to a reduction in real terms. Allocations for the Navy  should be in the region of L3.513 trillion, representing an  increase of 1.6 percent in monetary terms, which is not even  enough to offset predicted inflation levels.    Operations in the Adriatic Sea in connection with war in the  former Yugoslavia have represented the most important commitment  in strategic, political, and organizational terms. The Navy  took part in these missions right from the start, committing  ships and aircraft, and two of its admirals were in command of  the two allied naval task forces that were initially deployed.    Effective control of the makeup and destination of cargo  ships began in November 1992, following the UN decision to  strengthen the measures aimed at enforcing the embargo. The  Navy was involved in the "Sharp Guard" operation, for which it  continuously provided three to four naval units and two to three  aircraft for patroling purposes.    As far as Albania is concerned, in 1993 the Navy was engaged  in continuous control operations to prevent any illegal mass  migration into Italy. Furthermore, in 1993 another 180 minor  missions were carried out, amounting to as many days out at sea.</p>

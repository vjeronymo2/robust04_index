Kiseleva, and Ye.P. </F> Doroshenko, Antiplague Scientific Research Institute, Russian  Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight, Rostov-na-Donu]    [Abstract] The microbicidal effect of macrophages is  primarily due to the functioning of lysosomes, and many  researchers consider an elevated lysosome content and  intensified secretion of lysosomal enzymes signs of macrophage  activation. The participation of lysosomal enzymes in the  intracellular killing process depends not only on their  synthesis, however, but also on processes ensuring their contact  with absorbed microorganisms, which is to say on the fusion of  lysosomes with phagosomes. Evidence exists that fusion of  lysosomes with phagosomes does not always guarantee  intracellular killing. In particular, the reports regarding the  relationship of the plague microbe Yersinia pestis  with lysosomes have been contradictory. Consequently, a study  was conducted to examine the effect of a vaccine strain of  Yersinia pestis on the fusion of lysosomes with  phagosomes in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Nonpedigree  guinea pigs weighing 250 to 300 g each were immunized either  subcutaneously or aerogenically with a vaccine strain of  Yersinia pestis (10 guinea pigs were immunized in  each case). Peritoneal and alveolar macrophages of the immunized  animals were studied on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after immunization  to determine their lysosome content and the fusion of the  lysosomes with phagosomes. The experiments established that the  frequency of fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes in the alveolar  macrophages was only half that in the peritoneal macrophages.  Subcutaneous immunization stimulated the fusion of lysosomes and  phagosomes in the peritoneal macrophages but not in the alveolar  macrophages, whereas aerogenic vaccination stimulated the fusion  of lysosomes with phagosomes in both types of macrophages. A  correlation between the macrophages' ability to kill  Yersinia pestis and the frequency of fusion of  lysosomes with phagosomes was established. It was hypothesized  that during endocytosis of plague microbe in unvaccinated guinea  pigs, there occurs a suppression of the fusion of lysosomes with  phagosomes that is much more pronounced in the case of alveolar  macrophages than in the case of peritoneal macrophages.

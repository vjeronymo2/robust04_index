			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN! SEEKS UNITY  </P> <P> Regarding Tom Gorman's story on school shortages ("Students, Students  Everywhere and Nary a Place to Sit," Sept. 5): Amen, amen and amen again --  there are not enough schools available for all the new homes being built in San  Diego. Builders march merrily over hill and dale, constructing houses  cheek-by-jowl, selling them for astronomical sums, and leaving behind shortages  not only of schools, but of libraries, parks and other public amenities, not to  mention increases in traffic.  </P> <P> Enter Prevent Los Angelization Now!, a group (formerly known as Citizens for  Limited Growth) which is sponsoring an initiative to ensure that new  development pays for itself. PLAN! stands for more than merely growth  management. One of our aims is to a focus the efforts of many disparate groups  who see the deterioration of their neighborhoods, the raping of the  environment, and the lack of concern for current residents when growth impinges  upon their quality of life. Unpaid-for development costs current residents not  only peace and contentment, but money.  </P> <P> However, any such ordinance requires understanding by all San Diegans. It needs  to be discussed, argued, modified and accepted by a majority if it is to  achieve its goals. PLAN! wishes to join with other community organizations in a  grass-roots effort to solve these problems and others. Our phone number is  299-PLAN.  </P> <P> CATHERINE A. STROHLEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: BES schemes go back to college OXBRIDGE colleges are the current theme of Business Expansion Scheme launches with Oxford dominating this week and Cambridge to come next week, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. On Tuesday, Hodgson Martin launched The Residences at Oxford Companies to buy existing student accommodation from Exeter, St Edmund Hall, St Hugh's, St Peter's and Wadham colleges. The colleges are promising to buy back the accommodation after five years at 118p for every 100p invested. The returns equate to an annual return of 13.7 per cent compound for a higher rate taxpayer and 9.2 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer. The scheme is backed with gilts. Oriel Cash Backed, sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, is is a restructured version of Oriel residences, an early exit scheme which was caught out by the Budget changes. It is offering a contracted exit of 121p after five years for every 100p invested to buy residential property for the college. The returns to a higher rate taxpayer would be 14 per cent per annum, 9.6 per cent for lower rate, and are supported by cash deposits. Best BES Advice comment on the schemes is positive. It says of Oriel Cash Backed, 'a combination of a high return and the cash backing arrangements with Oriel provide for an attractive investment.' It also recommends the The Residences at Oxford issue as 'a secure cash backed deal with a competitive return.' Capital Ventures will announce a cash-back contracted exit scheme next week involving three Cambridge colleges - Churchill, Pembroke and Trinity Hall. It says it will repay 117p for every 100p invested.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY READY TO TAKE CONTROL, BHUTTO CHARGES  </P> <P> In a strongly worded attack, Benazir Bhutto charged Wednesday that powerful  army generals had forced her ouster as prime minister, and she warned that the  army will "take over" within a few weeks, ending Pakistan's brief experiment  with democracy.  </P> <P> "The military is running the show," Bhutto told reporters here two days after  President Ghulam Ishaq Khan abruptly dismissed her 20-month-old government,  dissolved the National Assembly and declared a state of emergency.  </P> <P> "The caretaker government is temporary," Bhutto said at a news conference.  "Within a few weeks, the army will take over."  </P> <P> Military and government officials denied the charges and insisted that general  elections will be held Oct. 24.  </P> <P> But government officials said Bhutto, her mother, her husband and about 30  close aides and officials would be barred from leaving the country pending  possible criminal charges.  </P> <P> The state of emergency gives the government wide-ranging powers of detention,  and some of Bhutto's supporters reportedly went into hiding to avoid arrest.  </P> <P> Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, an opposition leader who was named interim prime  minister, indicated that special courts may be created to investigate  persistent allegations of corruption leveled against key Bhutto supporters and  members of her family and Cabinet.  </P> <P> Bhutto's aides said the investigations may be used to prevent the 37-year-old  Harvard- and Oxford-educated former leader and her Pakistan People's Party from  taking part in the October elections.  </P> <P> Critics said Bhutto, while personally honest, turned a blind eye to corruption  and nepotism. Her husband, businessman Asif Ali Zardari, was widely known as  "Mr. 10%" for alleged profiteering from government contracts. She also  appointed her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, as a senior Cabinet minister.  </P> <P> Although Bhutto offered no proof, she said the army had threatened to impose  martial law if she were not fired.  </P> <P> "An illegal, undemocratic and unconstitutional step against me has been taken  under pressure of military intelligence," she said.  </P> <P> While in office, Bhutto tried to smooth over differences with the army and its  powerful chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg.  </P> <P> She gave the army a broad say in foreign policy decisions particularly  regarding Afghanistan.  </P> <P> She said Wednesday, however, that "major differences" developed with Gen. Beg  in May, apparently over the army's demands to crack down on urban violence in  Sind province, her home and political power base.  </P> <P> Bhutto said she will not give the army "any pretext to postpone the elections,"  but added her belief that the army would interfere if it appeared that her  party might win.  </P></p>

At the request  of attorney Julio Castro, he disqualified himself to continue  hearing the case and transferred the dossier to the Federal  Court, which now must appoint a new judge.    Literas' unexpected change of mind put an end to the hopes  of  the Italian court officials who had arrived in Buenos Aires to  investigate the case of the missing people and hear the  questioning to be conducted by the Argentine federal courts.  This was the mission of Rome's Judge Antonio Capiello and  attorney Antonio Marini, who arrived in Argentina on 14 February  after the Italian courts had sent the Argentine ones a rogatory  letter, to which Judge Literas -- head of Federal Court No. 10  -- had initially agreed.    On 16 February, a few minutes before the court hearing was  to  begin and the first witnesses summoned by the court had arrived  (among them Peronist leader Dante Gullo), the judge told the  Italian officials that the hearing had been suspended.    The judge's unexpected decision is threatening to become an  international scandal. Rumors spread on 16 February stated that  the Italian court officials were planning to hold a news  conference on 17 February because they had been told that the  court's unexpected decision was more the result of political  pressure on Judge Literas' court than of difficulties arising  during the lawsuit.    Meanwhile, the first protests against the Argentine court  decision began in Rome. Sandro Sessa, head of the League for the  Rights of Peoples, said that in Italy the lawsuit against the  accused military "will not stop just because it had been  suspended in Buenos Aires."    On 14 February, Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, chief  of the Joint Staff, sent Defense Minister Oscar Camilion a  report conveying to the government the Argentine Armed Forces'  "uneasiness and concern" over the presence of Italian court  officials in Argentine courts.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 19 April, a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  leader commented on the appointment of chief cabinet secretary,  a focal point in the selection of members of the "new  administration of Tsutomu Hata." He indicated his basic  intention to appoint a Shinseito member as chief cabinet  secretary, saying: "The relationship between chief cabinet  secretary (and prime minister) is like being bound by a common  fate. We hope that a person who is on friendly terms with the  new prime minister will be named as chief cabinet secretary."  In concrete terms, it is believed that he made the remarks  while keeping in mind Hajime Funada, former director general of  the Economic Planning Agency, and other Shinseito members. In  this connection, a Komeito leader said on the same day: "It is  appropriate to appoint a Shinseito member as the chief cabinet  secretary." He indicated that if the number of cabinet posts  occupied by Shinseito members increases, it is better to adjust  the allocation of cabinet posts rather than that of the chief  cabinet secretary. A Democratic Socialist Party leader agreed  with them.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: T Clarke ahead to Pounds 424,000 T Clarke, the south London-based electrical contractor, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 423,679 for the six months to June 30 - a year-on-year increase of 54 per cent. The jump from last time's Pounds 274,464 was achieved despite turnover reduced to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 32.2m) and a disappointing showing from the conduit and accessories distribution side. Directors said that competition in its traditional markets remained fierce but stressed that the company was not prepared to secure work at 'sub-economic prices'. Earnings per share were 2.049p (1.265p). The interim dividend is 1.26p.</p>

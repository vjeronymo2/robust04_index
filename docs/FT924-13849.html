			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Last ditch effort on pregnancy directive A LAST-DITCH attempt to save the European Community directive protecting the jobs and incomes of pregnant working women will be made today at the informal EC social affairs council in Chepstow, Wales. The directive would be the first in the social field to lapse since 1985 if agreement is not reached before October 19. Although some countries with good provision for pregnant workers are not concerned about a lapse, the UK, currently President of the EC, is keen to push through a deal. A possible compromise is likely to centre on an addendum to the directive which would make some commitment to improving the benefits for pregnant workers within a specified period. That might persuade Italy, the dissident country, to fall back into line. The original proposal was to ensure women the right to return to work and give them 14 weeks on full pay. UK pressure saw the proposal scaled down to 14 weeks on the equivalent of statutory sick pay. The terms were then improved to 16 weeks on 80 per cent of salary. Member states except Italy wanted to stick to the original sick pay proposal, but to do this they had to reject unanimously the improved package. Italy then broke ranks, arguing it was not worth having.</p>

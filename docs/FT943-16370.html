			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (5): Gemport blazes a trail - Industrialists are calling for more infrastructure projects in the region As you enter Turkey's first privately run port, the potholes on the roads suddenly disappear. Even the noxious orange fumes from the nearby state-run fertiliser plant seem part of another world. For Gemlik Port and Warehousing Administration - or Gemport - with its modern infrastructure, smartly painted loading bays and contract labour force, is a good example of the efficiency gains to be made where private sector initiative takes over in an area traditionally monopolised by the state. Privately owned by Mr Mohamar Agim, a local textile manufacturer, the port is managed and run by Capt Ziya Alkan, a former head of the state-run ports authority, who was pulled out of retirement to do the job. Gemport in many ways typifies the developments now sweeping through the Marmara region, as private sector developers who have a direct stake in seeing the area sustain its impressive growth rate take the initiative. For the local authorities, deprived of funds, are no longer able to meet the needs of local industry. Tofas, the Fiat car subsidiary in Bursa, has installed its own water treatment plant and may now invest in its own dual-fired power unit to ensure supplies to its factory. The Sabanci group's Kordsa tyre cord facility at Izmit is looking at a similar proposal. Drive to the area from Istanbul and the challenges are not hard to see. The journey to Bursa takes at least 2 1/2 hours on badly maintained roads, choked with heavy goods traffic, and includes a 45-minute ferry crossing. The journey to Izmit is less onerous, making use of the Ankara motorway. However the real problems are apparent when you arrive in the city, a place of subterranean gloom, with petrochemical factories belching forth, and a paper pulp plant right in the heart of the town centre. 'All the pollution you can imagine: we have it here,' says Mr Yuksel Baser, head of the Izmit chamber of commerce. 'Fifty years ago, if we had a new factory everyone was celebrating. Today we would be happy to see some of the business move away to an industrial zone where you can control it.' For the Marmara is a regional trading hub, a choke point on the main axis between Turkey and Europe, intersected by the principal supply arteries, such as the gas pipeline from Russia, the trans-European highway and the shipping routes from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union. The Gemport facility is now Turkey's fourth largest container handler - after Hydarpasa in Istanbul, Izmir and Mersin, Turkey's main transit port - and handles a variety of cargo from steel and steel scrap to cars and timber and coal. Gemport is in direct competition with the state-run ports at Bandirma and Izmit to supply the fast-growing industrial area around Bursa, home to the Turkish textile and car industries. Currently, activity in the complex is running at reduced levels because of the economic downturn affecting Turkey. Last year, bananas from Ecuador were one of Gemport's main import items. Today the number of banana boats has dropped dramatically as the economic crisis bites. Last year the quayside was also crowded with imported cars, as Turkey's consumer boom boosted the imports of European and Asian autos. Today the only item which is visible is the black coal and a vast tangled nest of tropical timbers. The coal, Capt Alkan explains, is a high quality South African product which the Bursa municipality is using to fuel industrial and residential housing. Even coal could soon be a thing of the past as the region, like many others in Turkey, converts to gas, supplied by the pipeline which is now linking Turkey with fields in Russia. The general economic slowdown, particularly the drop in the volume of imports resulting from the economic squeeze, will certainly affect the tonnages that Gemport and other ports handle in 1994. Many of the local industries, however, hope to boost their exports this year. At the nearby Tofas car plant - a joint venture between Fiat and the local Koc Holding - Mr Jan Nahum, the general manager, proudly points to the crates of CKDs (completely knocked down car assembly kits) all ready and packaged for delivery to Egypt, and other destinations via the Gemlik terminal. Much will, of course, depend on an early resolution of the crisis, but many local industrialists believe top priority should be given to infrastructure projects in the Marmara region. The projects include: A new gas terminal at Tekirdag, taking liquefied natural gas from Sonatrach, the Algerian state-run company, commissioned by Botas, the state-run pipeline company last month. The next spur of the inter-city gas pipeline which is already supplying Bursa is also being constructed by Botas. A Dollars 700m water supply and dam project at Izmit, in which Gama, one of Turkey's best known contractors, is linked with Thames Water in a project part-financed by Japanese funds. It is one of two deals which Gama hopes to clinch by using the Build Operate and Transfer method of private financing, in which a private developer runs the plant for a concession period, taking financial and other risks before eventually handing it over to the state or government utility. A dual-fired gas power station which Gama hopes to construct with the UK engineering group Enron, at Marmaraeregli, near Tekirdag, is the other project. This has been masterminded by the John Wing Group, one of the world's leading private power developers. A crossing of Izmit Bay from Gebze to Orhanghazi is planned. A design project was awarded in December to Canada's Delcan group and the local Dap consultants. The bridge would have a 3.5km span and incorporate a large 2-3km viaducts on each side. Bursa city municipality has a number of projects, including a water supply and sewerage contract under a Dollars 117m loan from the World Bank. The first phase of the city's gas conversion project is under way with around 90,000 homes or almost half the city's population to be linked up by the end of 1994. British Gas and other contractors await the municipality's decision to tender for the second phase. The city authorities announced in early June the cancellation of the planned Metro project, which was estimated to have cost around Dollars 400m, after warnings from the Treasury in Ankara to limit new foreign borrowings. There is even talk of a bridge to span the Dardanelles near Cannakale in a bid to divert some of the traffic now transiting Turkey for destinations in the Middle East and which currently creates such congestion around the Istanbul peninsula.</p>

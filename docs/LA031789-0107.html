			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DON'T WANT TO LOOK BAD,' EXPERT SAYS;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS SAID TO DENY SKINHEADS AS PROBLEM  </P> <P> Orange County school officials still deny their campuses are plagued by growing  skinhead activity despite a report issued last year indicating there are at  least 100 skinheads locally who are loosely organized in about six gangs,  experts told 250 educators at a symposium Thursday.  </P> <P> "There's a reluctance; school board members and others don't want to look bad,"  said Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations  Commission.  </P> <P> "I think schools have a paranoia of being labeled as a gang school, a drug  school. . . . But when you identify the problem, you're dealing with that  problem and that's good," he said.  </P> <P> The commission, along with the Anti-Defamation League and the Orange County  Department of Education, sponsored the 3-hour symposium to help school  officials identify skinheads and to discuss what role educators can play in  stopping the phenomenon that they classify as a form of gang activity.  </P> <P> Experts who spoke at the symposium in Costa Mesa said the number of skinheads  is difficult to determine. But the Anti-Defamation League, in a report released  in October, says there are about 50 skinheads in Orange County "who preach  violence against blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals." The report  says there is an equal or greater number of the "non-racist variety" of  skinheads.  </P> <P> "Not all youths with shaved heads or closely cropped hair are neo-Nazis.  Indeed, there are young people who call themselves 'skinheads' who are  anti-racist, some of whom have actually been targeted for violence by neo-Nazi  skinheads," the report says.  </P> <P> In Orange County, skinheads have been involved in a number of violent incidents  against ethnic minorities and other groups. Last month, for example, three  skinheads were suspected of stabbing and robbing a student at Loara High School  in Anaheim, police said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, three young neo-Nazi skinheads from Huntington Beach  received the maximum penalty in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in Laguna  Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cross Burning  </P> <P> Neo-Nazi or skinhead youths were suspected of burning a cross on the lawn of a  black family in Westminster last July 28 because of white supremacist graffiti  found on neighborhood walls. A neighbor, Gary A. Skillman, 24, of Westminster,  was convicted Jan. 4 of violating federal civil rights laws in the incident.  </P> <P> Betsy Rosenthal, western states counsel for the ADL, said that based on police  reports and telephone calls to her organization, the ADL believes that  membership in skinhead organizations continues to grow nationwide as well as in  Orange County. Many incidents of violence by skinheads go unreported, she said.  </P> <P> "We've gotten some complaints in Orange County and Los Angeles from parents who  say their kids have been accosted by skinheads," Rosenthal said.  </P> <P> Mike Fleager, a county probation officer who has become a specialist in dealing  with white hate gangs, said Orange County's growing and changing population is  a big factor in their numbers.  </P> <P> "The physical environment of Orange County is changing," he said. "For many  people, the situation is, 'I'm not able to move out of an undesirable  neighborhood because I can't afford a house in a desirable neighborhood.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shaved Heads  </P> <P> Fleager said skinheads are often discernible by their shaved heads or short  hair; tattoos, sometimes of swastikas; military flight jackets; pants rolled  above boots, usually combat boots, and suspenders.  </P> <P> Skinheads come from all socioeconomic groups, the educators were told, but one  common denominator is that their parents had poor parenting skills. Skinheads  have initiation activities that involve beating up new members, and they war  with non-racist skinheads and minority gangs.  </P> <P> They possess weapons and might be involved in offenses such as armed robbery,  assaults and drugs, Fleager said.  </P> <P> Gus Frias, manager of the County Department of Education's Operation Safe  Schools, said the only way to combat the skinhead problem and gangs in general  is to form partnerships between school officials, including teachers and even  head custodians, parents and law enforcement personnel. Unity will make it  easier to find solutions to a problem that most schools would rather deny  exists, he said.  </P> <P> "You have to bring together a team so you can take the punches collectively,"  Frias said. Ten Orange County school districts have formed such partnerships,  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gang Image  </P> <P> The problem is broader than just stopping ongoing violence, he said. Educators  and others who work with youths must try to find out why some are "seduced" by  the image of belonging to gangs.  </P> <P> Some educators said they worry that students identify with gangs because they  need to belong to something.  </P> <P> Curt Mellem, a campus supervisor at Buena Park High School, said skinhead  activity "does exist here. It is here."  </P> <P> He said some students at his school sport special rings, boots or jackets that  identify them as skinheads.  </P> <P> Other youths imitate the dress and some behavior of gangs but may not be gang  members.  </P> <P> Youths must be made to understand the long-term consequences to them and their  families of associating with gangs, Frias said.  </P> <P> "Gangs are a group of persons that come together and engage in illegal  activity," he said. "Our stand is that there are no good gangs, and we have to  teach them the consequences of that label.  </P> <P> "When is a gang member never a gang member? Never, not until his death."  </P></p>

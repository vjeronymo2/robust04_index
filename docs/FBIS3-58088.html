[Text] The new minister of health pledges that she  will defend the universality of health care.    Ottawa--For Diane Marleau, the new federal minister of  health, there can be no discussion of it: Public funds may well  become scarce, but the sacred principle of universal health care  will not be touched.    As long as the Sudbury deputy is at the helm, tickets  [portion of the cost of treatment paid by the insured] of  whatever nature will be unacceptable at the Ministry of Health.  "Whether they be called `ticket orienteur' or `ticket  moderateur,' in the final analysis the ticket is a tax on  illness, and I want no part of it," she snaps without the  slightest hesitation, putting an end to the sentence somewhat  abruptly, with a slight smile that seems to say: "Next question?"    The next question is the most difficult one, namely, the one  that the provincial and federal governments have faced for many  years now. It is the question of how to reduce the cost of  health care while adhering to the principle of universality.    This time, the minister's response is more lengthy, less  clear-cut. She begins by responding: "We must set our priorities  and do the best we can with the dollars we have." A 50-year-old  Franco-Ontarian, she comes to the Ministry with the experience  of one who, with a degree in business administration, has raised  three children, made a career of municipal politics, headed an  accounting office, and managed a restaurant, among other things.    Explaining that her strategy will consist first and foremost  of rooting out abuses, the minister continues, "We must address  the abuses. It is clear that there are abuses. Is charging going  to eliminate the abuses? I do not think it will.... If diligent  effort is devoted to eliminating abuses, the means of doing so  can be found," she says. She speaks of instilling a greater  sense of "responsibility," of awareness of the costs of health  care, in the users and the operators of the system.    Do you really think that approach would suffice, that it  would work?    "Nothing ventured, nothing gained," replies the minister.    Yes, but isn't that likely to be difficult?    "It is always difficult, but it is worth the effort.... It  is  surprising what can be done with a little cooperation."    According to the minister, dialogue and an effort to reach  agreement are the keys to the solution. In its electoral  platform, its famous red book, the Liberal Party acknowledged  the gravity of the problem of financing health care and proposed  the convoking of a national forum on the issue, to be presided  by Prime Minister Jean Chretien himself, to bring all the  operators of the system together in an effort to find agreed  solutions. Mrs. Marleau says she would like this forum to be  held this spring.  <H5>  Freezes? Reductions? </H5>   For detailed responses on the possibility of a freeze on  transfer payments to the provinces, for details on ways of  reducing the costs of services without reducing the list of  services that are to be provided, for details on the strictness  with which Ottawa intends to enforce the health-care law, we  shall have to take a rain check. Mrs. Marleau has not even  decided yet how she is going to respond to Quebecois Minister  Marc-Yvan Cote's proposal to bill patients for certain home care  services. She is awaiting a proposal in writing.    It may be that the response to these questions will rather  come from the minister of finance, who, since the restructuring  of the government, is responsible for everything concerning  transfer payments to the provinces. Or perhaps it will come from  Minister Marcel Masse, who is responsible for federal-provincial  relations and who recently stated that spending on health care  must be reduced by 20 percent, although he later retracted this  statement.    In short, Mrs. Marleau will not be the only one to concern  herself with this thorny problem of health-care costs, but, as  the minister responsible for enforcing the Canadian law on  health care, it is nevertheless she who will have to shoulder  the task of steering the profound and painful restructurings  looming on the horizon.    Gaston Levac, general director of Sudbury's Laurentian  Hospital, who knew Mrs. Marleau when she was a member of the  institution's board of directors, believes she has the  "knowledge and the ability" needed to find solutions.    "But that alone is not necessarily sufficient. I wonder  whether Mrs. Marleau will have the necessary force of character  to make the tough decisions that will have to be made and to  deal with the opposition that is going to develop. Because the  social changes being talked about are going to be very difficult  to implement."  <H5>  A Poor Childhood </H5>   A native of Kirkland Lake, Diane Marleau has spent most of  her life in Sudbury, in what is known as northern Ontario but  what is really the north of inhabited Ontario.    She comes from a single-parent family of three children, her  father having deserted the family household when she was very  young. Mrs. Marleau does not remember her father. Her mother,  who was a schoolteacher, had to work hard and long hours to make  ends meet. "I grew up in poverty, considerable poverty. At that  time, it was not easy for a woman left alone with three  children. They were not paid the same wages as men. It was  barely half as much, I believe," says the minister.    When asked if it is these difficult experiences that have  made her a feminist, Mrs. Marleau bridles. She evidently does  not like the term "feminist." "I don't like to be categorized.  Actually, I am a very traditional woman. I have been married to  the same man for 30 years," she snaps.    Her friend and adviser, Vince di Norcia, a professor of  philosophy and former Neo-Democrat, however, thinks she is  precisely "a true feminist, those women who take their place  through action."    Diane Marleau was elected for the first time on the federal  scene in 1988, but her political career goes back to 1980 when  she was elected to Sudbury's municipal council. And her very  first experience in politics goes back to the election of Judy  Erola--former Liberal minister--in the Nickel Belt county, in  that same year.    Mrs. Erola had asked Mrs. Marleau's husband, Paul Marleau,  an  accountant--today, "semi-retired"--to be her official agent. Mr.  Marleau replied in the affirmative, adding that, in any case,  Diane would be doing the work. Anita Thompson, a former  journalist and long-time friend of Mrs. Marleau's family,  recounts that Judy Erola lost no time in telling him that, if  that was the case, she was quite capable of asking Diane  directly to be her official agent.  <H5>  The City Without Debt </H5>   A few months later, Mrs. Marleau made her own entry into the  world of politics, on the municipal scene, after three years  spent at home caring for her youngest child, Stephane, who is  now 16 and lives in Sudbury with her father.    The minister says the idea was suggested to her by the  municipal councillor of her district, who had decided to retire.  Mrs. Marleau met him in the street and told him that she was not  particularly impressed by the names of his would-be successors  at the time.    "At that point," she recalls, "he said to me: `Then, why  don't you run for the job?'"    Mrs. Marleau was elected to the municipal council, then  appointed to Sudbury's regional council.    "I helped her write her first speech to the business  community. Since then, she calls me her mentor. It is a very  nice compliment," says Mrs. Thompson. "Diane was very tense,  very nervous, at the time. But she learned. She is by no means  like that today."    In 1985, Mrs. Marleau ran for mayor against Peter Wong and  lost. This fact is not found in the official biography provided  by the party. Nor does she herself care to talk about it.    Regarding her years in municipal politics, everyone  remembers  mainly one thing: Mrs. Marleau was one of the principal  advocates of an austere antideficit policy that finally enabled  the city to pay off all its debts. "She was truly one of the  most committed throughout that debate," recalls Peter Wong, who  holds this "hard worker," his one-time rival, in very high  esteem.  <H5>  Is Mother Going to Ottawa? </H5>   After her defeat for mayor, Mrs. Marleau became an  administrator at Collins, Barrow-Maheu, Noiseux, a Sudbury  accounting office. In 1988, the Liberal Party pressed her to run  as a candidate for office in Sudbury County, a county that has  always been Liberal, except for a brief period around the end of  the 1960's when the Neo-Democrats won a by-election.    Mrs. Marleau says laughingly that she was caught at her own  game. She had often complained about the fact that the party  never gave counties that are sure bets to women. When they  offered her the candidacy, they went out of their way to remind  her of this. So, she decided to run and won in the autumn of  1988. She does not in the least regret having made that  decision, but says that it was very painful to her to have to  leave her family behind in Sudbury, especially her "baby."  Today, Mrs. Marleau still lives in Sudbury, and she returns  every weekend. She spends the rest of the week in Ottawa with  her oldest daughter, Brigitte.    In the opposition she has played many roles, including that  of substitute critic for Mines and for Government Operations.  She was also a member, and subsequently vice chairman, of the  Standing Committee for Finance, president of the Ontario Caucus,  deputy whip, etc.    In November, Jean Chretien appointed a loyal deputy, but a  member of the party's scratch team, as his administration's  minister of health. A woman "who, being in the opposition, has  not had occasion to make political enemies," says Mr. Levac, but  who now finds herself having to deal with 10 provinces, a  universal health-care system that is in deep financial crisis  and one of the Liberal Administration's most difficult  ministries to pilot.</p>

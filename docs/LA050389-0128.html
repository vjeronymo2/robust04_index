			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEWAGE SPILL SHUTS BEACH FROM VENICE TO EL SEGUNDO  </P> <P> A sewage spill near the San Diego Freeway prompted Los Angeles County health  officials Tuesday to close almost four miles of beaches between Venice and  Imperial Highway at El Segundo as a precautionary measure in the event polluted  water reached the ocean through flood control channels.  </P> <P> About 100,000 gallons of sewage escaped Monday night from an Inglewood pumping  station into the Centinela concrete channel, but sandbagging efforts kept all  but about 1,000 gallons from leaking into Ballona Creek and flowing to the  ocean, health officials said.  </P> <P> County health technicians were analyzing the bacteria count along the beaches  and said that a decision to reopen the popular swimming areas could be made as  soon as today.  </P> <P> "We were really fortunate we were able to get almost all of it," said John  Redner, the county's sewer superintendent, who oversaw sandbagging operations  in Centinela Creek.  </P> <P> The sewage reached the channel just a few minutes after six county workers had  piled 800 50-pound bags at the channel's edge at about 10:15 p.m., he said. The  sewage flowed from the nearby Vesta Street sewer pumping station in Inglewood,  which was knocked out of commission at 6:22 p.m. by an electrical power  failure.  </P> <P> "The water surged and we could smell it," Redner said.  </P> <P> Responsibility for closing the beaches on Tuesday -- a sunny, warm day -- fell  to county health official Jack Petralia, who said he was warned about the spill  at 9:30 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warning Signs  </P> <P> Because the spill appeared to be relatively minor, Petralia said he was  "tempted" not to take any action. But at 8 a.m. Tuesday, as a "precautionary  measure," he called the county Department of Beaches and Harbors and ordered  that agency to instruct lifeguards to post yellow sandwich-board signs on the  beach. They read: "Beach Closed: Avoid Water Contact."  </P> <P> Some local residents were angry Tuesday morning that it had taken more than 10  hours for Petralia to make his decision.  </P> <P> "Why wasn't the beach closed early this morning before people started swimming  in the water?" asked Venice resident Vince Desmond, 48, who said he swims at  the beach every morning.  </P> <P> Petralia, who directs the county Department of Health Services' environmental  protection bureau, said that given experience with leaks, sewage takes far  longer than 10 hours for the fouled water to reach the ocean.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Take Days  </P> <P> "It could be days," he said, before the approximately 1,000 gallons of sewage  that escaped reaches the ocean.  </P> <P> By the time an alarm alerted officials to the spill Monday night, a portion of  the county sewer system had already backed up and sewage was gushing out of  manhole covers just north of where La Cienega crosses the San Diego Freeway,  about 40 feet from the pumping plant. From that point, the sewage flowed into  Centinela Creek.  </P> <P> Ironically, Avila said, the Vesta Street plant is one of six county sewage  pumping plants scheduled to receive emergency power equipment that would have  prevented a spill like the one that occurred Monday night. But delivery of that  equipment is still two months away, he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Louis Sahagun contributed to this story.  </P></p>

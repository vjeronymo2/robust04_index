			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Shaking off some dire conditions - Prudential Changes in the US weather and the prospects for the regulatory climate in the UK will both have an impact on tomorrow's results announcement from Prudential, the financial services and life insurance company. The biggest turnround is expected from Mercantile &amp; General, the reinsurance subsidiary, which in 1992 incurred a loss on its non-life operations of Pounds 143m - described as 'dire' by Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential's chief executive. In 1992, two North American hurricanes alone produced losses of Pounds 56m. More recent US disasters, such as the Californian earthquake and the flooding, have not affected the insurance industry so badly. Further growth is expected from the UK life and pensions side - Prudential is the UK's largest life insurer - but the longer-term prospects for the life sector are under something of a cloud. The need to compensate people who were badly advised to transfer out of an occupational pension scheme is worrying for the market while the impact remains unquantified. Further uncertainty is added by the combination of a new regulator and the prospect of new products and charging structures in the light of compulsory commission disclosure. The range of analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profits go from Pounds 510m to Pounds 570m compared with Pounds 406m in 1992 - more than double the 1991 figure. The consensus on the dividend is for a 10 per cent increase. Among other less central issues also likely to come up is the direction of Jackson National, one of the largest US life insurance companies, which was acquired by Prudential in 1986. There may also be questions about some aspects of Prudential's fund management, following the loss of some management contracts for pension funds, such as that of British Rail.</p>

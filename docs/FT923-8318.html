			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US orange juice prices plunge to contract lows IN THE second day of a major sell-off, orange juice futures fell yesterday to life-of-contract lows on the New York Cotton Exchange. Prices are plummeting following reports that the Brazilian harvest is larger and has begun sooner than expected. The Florida crop is also reported to be up significantly. By mid-morning, the spot month, the September contract, had dropped 2.05 cents to 106.25 cents a lb, but the farther out contracts were all flirting seriously with the 5 cent permissible daily limit on price movements. Analysts said that the near term fundamentals in the market were all bearish, but chart-minded traders were also joining in the sell-off. Commodity funds jumped into sell on Monday driving all contracts but the spot month to limit falls. The September spot month contract nearly reached its 10 cent limit with a fall of 8.25 cents to 108.30 cents a lb. According to Ms Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman, Brazilian supplies this 1992-1993 crop year will exceed the 273.5m boxes that were forecast earlier. Florida's crop is also expected to increase to at least 175m boxes, up 25 per cent from last year's 139.8m. If the October crop report by the US Department of Agriculture confirms the trade's perceptions about the higher Florida output, some analysts say that prices for frozen concentrated orange juice futures could plunge to just 75 cents a lb. However, the next level of support for prices is expected to come at 99 cents a lb. At that level frozen concentrated orange juice would be at a six year low.</p>

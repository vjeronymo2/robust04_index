			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRAUMA CENTER CLOSURE PLAN SENDS OUT SHOCK WAVES  </P> <P> Huntington Memorial Hospital may have difficulty treating additional patients  that could flow in as a result of the closing of a trauma center at St. Joseph  Medical Center in Burbank, officials of the Pasadena facility said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County health officials said Huntington is the closest hospital to  St. Joseph in the county's emergency services network and likely would absorb  patients from St. Joseph. St. Joseph announced Monday that it will shut down  its trauma center because of substantial financial losses.  </P> <P> "We don't know what's going to happen yet, but we're at capacity right now,"  said Maggie McPhillips, a Huntington spokeswoman. "We have really got our hands  full. We're going to have to see what the county is proposing before we know  what's going on."  </P> <P> McPhillips said patients in Burbank and in a large section of the northeast San  Fernando Valley served by St. Joseph may be too far away to be treated quickly  and effectively at Huntington.  </P> <P> McPhillips added that the hospital is treating between 50 to 60 trauma patients  a month. St. Joseph serves an average of 55 trauma patients a month.  </P> <P> St. Joseph officials have scheduled a news conference today to discuss the  facility's withdrawal from the county's troubled emergency services network.  St. Joseph has not officially notified the county that it intends to close the  center. By law, it must give the county 60 days notice.  </P> <P> Virginia Price Hastings, chief of paramedics and trauma hospitals for Los  Angeles County, said each hospital's trauma care unit serves a zone. If  Huntington is unable to absorb patients from St. Joseph's area, the patients  would be taken to the nearest emergency room or hospital outside the network  that offers trauma care.  </P> <P> For instance, patients would be taken to Burbank Community Hospital or other  24-hour emergency rooms, she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Next Closest Hospital'  </P> <P> "When a center pulls out of the network, we have to look at the next closest  hospital," Hastings said. "We hope we can prevent a domino effect, but there  will be a significant fallout because the area won't have the services of a  trauma center any longer."  </P> <P> Besides Huntington, the closest trauma centers to St. Joseph in the emergency  network are Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills and Northridge Hospital  Medical Center.  </P> <P> Prompted by the expected withdrawal, the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors voted Tuesday to submit a plan by St. Joseph officials to the  county Department of Health Services to revise criteria for participation by  hospitals in the trauma network.  </P> <P> That change would include having physicians on call. The county requires a  hospital in the emergency services network to have a neurosurgeon and other  trauma-care specialists on duty 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> Department of Health Services officials were asked to study the plan and report  back within 30 days.  </P> <P> Daniel H. Fahey, St. Joseph's senior associate administrator, said the hospital  would continue to provide some trauma and emergency care when the trauma center  shuts down.  </P> <P> In a letter to employees in February, Fahey said the hospital's financial  losses resulted from "grossly inadequate reimbursement by the county" for the  hospital's participation in the trauma network. The hospital lost $1.5 million  annually over the last five years on the program, officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Sailhan] </F>   [Excerpts] Paris, June 24 (AFP) -- Advance units of French  combat troops began setting up a field hospital in southwestern  Rwanda on Friday [24 June] as a first step in their contested  intervention in the central African nation's murderous ethnic  war.    A crack 60-strong unit that arrived at Cyangugu, across the  border from Zaire, on Thursday, was on Friday assessing the  humanitarian needs of the civilian population of the region, the  army's Information Department said here.    A giant Russian-built Antonov 22 transport plane left France  on Friday with 80 tonnes of medical equipment and medicines.  The plane was bound either for Bangui, Central African  Republic, or Libreville, Gabon, a military spokesman said.    The equipment would then be transferred to France's two  staging areas in eastern Zaire at Goma and Bukavu. A second  Antonov carrying a similar 80-tonne cargo was scheduled to leave  Lyon, central France, for Africa later on Friday.    Meanwhile a UN spokesman reported in the capital, Kigali,  that rebel and army gunners pounded Kigali overnight and  sporadic fighting continued Friday as UN forces prepared to  evacuate hundreds of displaced people from the airport, a United  Nations spokesman said.    "The fighting was very intense last night," said UN military  spokesman Jean-Guy Plante, contacted by telephone from Nairobi.  "There was a lot of heavy mortar and machinegun fire."    Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their  offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the  capital Kigali, apparently fearing that the French troops may  forestall an all-out victory by the rebels, who control about  two-thirds of the small central African country.    In Paris, the military said the 60 troops sent on the  UN-mandated mercy mission spent their first night in Cyangugu  "without incident" and were "welcomed" by local people. [passage  omitted]    The 50-bed field hospital will have an operating theatre and  12 doctors forming two full medical teams. [passage omitted]    The French expeditionary force, which will have a full  strength of 2,500, is to set up safe areas for minority Tutsi  people who are stranded inside territory held by forces of the  majority Hutu government. [passage omitted]    In Nairobi, the STANDARD newspaper, which is owned by the  Lonrho multinational, said Friday the French operation was "pure  neo-colonialism" aimed at strengthening French influence in the  regime.    Plante said UN commander General Romeo Dallaire planned to  meet Rwandan Army chief of staff General Augustin Bizimungu  later Friday to discuss the French intervention and the future  UN role in Rwanda.    The UN has fewer than 500 soldiers in Rwanda, but plans to  boost the force to several thousand. [passage omitted]    Plante said UN troops in Kigali planned to escort about 800  displaced people under UN guard at the airport to a camp at the  King Faisal hospital where thousands of civilians are sheltering.</p>

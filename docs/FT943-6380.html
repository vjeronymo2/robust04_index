			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Israel breaks pattern with 1.5% interest rate rise Israel's central bank yesterday departed from its longstanding policy of minor interest-rate rises by jacking up rates by as much as 1.5 percentage points to 14 per cent, in an effort to halt a surge in inflation. The Bank of Israel move, which takes effect on Thursday, was immediately matched by a 1.5 percentage points increase in prime rates at Israel's commercial banks. The central bank had previously sought to slow price rises with a series of seven minor interest rate increases in the past nine months, to no avail. Inflation, which the government had predicted would settle at around 8 per cent for 1994, is now running above 14 per cent. The Bank of Israel's governor, Prof Ya'acov Frenkel, described yesterday's move as 'a pre-emptive strike' to ensure it did not spiral out of control. 'Our goal is to return inflation to single figures,' he said, 'as in the industrialised world.' Key factors in the inflation surge include: the continuing rise in house prices - soaring by 20 per cent in some areas despite government efforts to free more land for building; a number of relatively high public sector wage settlements; and rising prices in the protected local fruit and vegetable markets. Prof Frenkel indicated yesterday that he would have liked to order a sharp interest rate rise some months ago, but had refrained because of concerns that Israel's economic growth would be harmed and unemployment rates lifted. Now, though, he said, there was a national consensus that the fight against inflation should be made a priority. Indeed, apart from inflation - which rings particular alarm bells in Israel given the triple figure inflation blight of a decade ago - the economy is performing impressively. Annual growth is running at more than 6 per cent, and jobless totals have been coming down: figures released last week by the Central Bureau of Statistics showed unemployment down to 7.8 per cent in the second quarter of the year, from 8.2 per cent in the January-March quarter. In a reflection of that robust overall economic performance, the Tel Aviv stock market yesterday shrugged off the interest rate news, its general share index closing the day up 3.26 per cent at 179.94. Similarly, last week the market dipped only briefly following the government's announcement that it would be introducing a capital gains tax at the exchange, taking 10 per cent of real profits. 'The one-two punch of a new tax and a large interest rate hike could, ordinarily, have been expected to bring the market down,' said one analyst. 'But the sense is that the market is pleased to see the government taking the battle against inflation seriously.'</p>

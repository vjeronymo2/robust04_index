			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISTRAUGHT ALTERNATE NAMED TO STALKER JURY;  </P> <P> JUDGE WILL RULE ON REQUEST TO POLL PANEL ON ABILITY TO GO ON AFTER MURDER OF  ONE MEMBER  </P> <P> Amid extraordinary courtroom drama Tuesday, a weeping and emotionally  distraught woman alternate was randomly picked to replace a murdered juror in  the Night Stalker case.  </P> <P> But the woman's selection to fill the seat vacated by the weekend slaying of  Phyllis Y. Singletary did not dispel the possibility of a mistrial in the  serial murder case.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan said he would rule this  morning on a defense request to ask each of the remaining 12 jurors and seven  alternates whether they can overcome the "terrible tragedy" and continue  deliberating the fate of defendant Richard Ramirez, who could be sentenced to  death if convicted.  </P> <P> "I will determine at that time if you can resume deliberations," Tynan told the  jurors and alternates as many of them wept openly.  </P> <P> "I think you can," the judge added. "I don't mean to be callous, but we have  business to do."  </P> <P> Singletary, 30, an employee in the billing department of Pacific Bell, was  found Monday afternoon lying face down in her Carson apartment. She had been  shot twice in the chest.  </P> <P> The suspected murderer, James C. Melton, 51, Singletary's live-in boyfriend,  killed himself with a bullet to the head Tuesday morning as authorities closed  in on him at a Carson motel. A note he left behind said the murder-suicide  stemmed from a domestic dispute, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Outside court Tuesday, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Phil Halpin said  he opposed any questioning of jurors, saying that Tynan should direct the jury  to resume deliberations anew today.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure that's necessary, or a good idea," Halpin told reporters.  </P> <P> The prosecutor also warned that any questioning of jurors and alternates may  have the unintended effect of eliciting undue desires on their part to be  excused.  </P> <P> "The circumstances of (Singletary's) death, while apparently a homicide, have  nothing to do with our task here," he said. "It appeared to be a domestic  problem. Hopefully the jury will be able to distinguish between those issues."  </P> <P> Still, if fewer than 12 of the 19 jurors and alternates say they are able to  continue, then a mistrial might be inevitable, lawyers on both sides conceded.  </P> <P> "That's an issue we're going to have to deal with," Halpin said.  </P> <P> In court Tuesday, the new juror -- obviously distraught over Singletary's death  -- seemed immobilized and racked by convulsion as court clerk Josephine  Williams called her name, after drawing it randomly from a gray metal box.  </P> <P> The woman was unable to rise and take her new place in the jury box and Tynan  urged her to remain seated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tells of Shooting Deaths  </P> <P> During the six-month jury selection process that preceded the actual trial, the  new panelist told the court that two of her brothers-in-law had been shot to  death in Los Angeles, although she gave few details. One was killed during a  robbery. The other's body was found near Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> The new juror also said she had been burglarized twice, in 1987 and 1988.  "Everything" was taken, she said.  </P> <P> At the time, neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys objected to her serving  on the jury. Also still on the panel of alternates is a rape victim.  </P> <P> News of Singletary's murder clearly shattered numerous jurors and alternates,  many of whom arrived at the courthouse with grim expressions.  </P> <P> And just before court convened, an alternate screamed and wept hysterically in  the hallway outside the courtroom upon learning of the juror's death,  apparently from a fellow alternate. She was escorted by jury colleagues into a  nearby restroom.  </P> <P> Assembled moments later in court, several other jurors and alternates also  sobbed as a subdued Tynan officially broke the news, his voice cracking at  times.  </P> <P> "Your friend and fellow juror has been shot," Tynan said, haltingly, his own  eyes misting. "I think there is a tear in the eyes of a lot of us.  </P> <P> "But that has nothing to do with this case," the judge continued. "It is simply  irrelevant to this case . . . and does not add or diminish to the evidence of  whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty or innocent."  </P> <P> After the brief morning session, Tynan sent jurors home out of "decency," and  ordered them back this morning.  </P> <P> "I know your grief is profound," the judge said. "Your grief must remain  private."  </P> <P> Tynan said he would also grant the panelists a day off to attend funeral  services for Singletary.  </P> <P> "I feel very sorry for all of you, and especially sorry for Ms. Singletary,"  Tynan said. "God bless all of you."  </P> <P> Outside court, Daniel V. Hernandez, the chief lawyer for Ramirez, said he may  ask for a mistrial today, a move that Halpin said he would oppose.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calls for a Steady Hand  </P> <P> "What is needed now, above all, is a steady hand," Halpin said. "The murder of  this lady has nothing to do with the task of this jury. The case must not go  down the drain. I'm here to see that it does not.  </P> <P> "There are many things that can cause a mistrial," the prosecutor said in a  message that seemed intended for Tynan. "This should not be one of them. The  parties involved must think about it. They must not take bad advice and we must  do it not only within the law but with some reasonable intelligence.  </P> <P> "I'm sure this does not help the jurors psychologically," he continued. "But  the death and the circumstances of her death have to be separated. I don't  doubt that the other jurors and she became friendly over this period of time."  </P> <P> Should the attorneys be allowed to question the panelists today, said Ray G.  Clark, Ramirez's second lawyer, "I would ask them individually about their  relationship (to Singletary), what bonding has taken place and whether or not  they feel they are able to proceed."  </P> <P> The lawyer added: "It's an emotional thing that's gotten to all of us, not just  the jury. And I'd like to hear from them. . . . This is unprecedented so far as  I know, where one of the jurors fell victim to the same sort of acts that many  of the victims in the main case did."  </P> <P> Clark said Ramirez did not comment to him about Singletary's murder, adding:  "He's like the rest of us. Nobody is happy about this. This is a very sad  thing. He's a human being, too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Condition of Juror Noted  </P> <P> Hernandez pointed out the inability of the newly chosen juror to take her new  seat after being called.  </P> <P> "That should have been a signal to the judge and to everyone there that this  person is very affected emotionally, that there are certainly some potential  problems with the jury at this point that require further inquiries, more  investigations by the judge and the lawyers to determine exactly what is going  on in their minds and in their hearts so we can determine whether they can  continue to deliberate and to guarantee Mr. Ramirez a fair trial," the defense  lawyer said.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants a mistrial," Hernandez told reporters. "It's a very good jury. We  love this jury. But if there are grounds that have to be researched and looked  at that merit a mistrial -- because their objectivity has been destroyed -- we  have an obligation and a responsibility to bring forth that motion."  </P> <P> Speaking of the jurors, Hernandez added:  </P> <P> "Now we have a situation where they have all experienced something very similar  to the crimes that Mr. Ramirez has been charged with -- the murder of a friend  . . . gunshots . . . beating. Very similar to some of the crimes that were  described by testimony. I think there are some very serious reservations here  as to whether they can remain objective."  </P> <P> Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, is a charged with 13 murders and  30 other felonies in a terrifying spree of residential burglaries throughout  Los Angeles County, mostly in the spring and summer of 1985.  </P> <P> TEST FOR SYSTEM -- Legal experts and psychologists say slaying poses an extreme  test of the American judicial system.

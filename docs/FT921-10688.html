			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Often doing better in the long run as investors - but how often? Sir, Anthony Harris's contribution ('Beware of an absence of hindsight', February 3) raises an interesting investment opportunity. If the long run is assumed to be a series of short runs, then 'active' or short-term investors outperform all the time. Furthermore, the superbly profitable short-termists must be winning at the expense of someone, presumably the lazy fundamentalists, who, Mr Harris claims to the contrary, often do better in the long run. What we are not told is, how often? Nor can we ignore the importance of transaction costs. In the real world these will always work against the short-termists while increasing the performance of the lazy fundamentalists. If all this is too confusing, remember - we are all dead in the long run. Mark Benstead, 47 Sidney Road, St Margarets, Twickenham</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at day's high in futures-related rally SHARE prices closed moderately higher after a futures-related rally, but overall activity remained dull ahead of today's public holiday and the US presidential election, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 85.96 ahead at the day's peak of 16,853.36, rising for the first time in four consecutive trading days. The index fell to the day's low of 16,616.75 in the morning session on arbitrage unwinding but subsequently rose on index-linked buying by investment trusts. Volume dropped to 140m shares from 203m, although a UK broker was active in the morning. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei index, declines led advances by 573 to 353, with 157 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 1.53 to 1,280.44 but, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.62 to 1,029.84. Arbitrageurs and investment trusts were notable participants, small-lot trading by dealers accounting for activity in speculative theme stocks. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, fell Y30 to Y1,400 on profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products, another Aids-related stock, slipped Y4 to Y922. However, dealers picked up Sumitomo Chemical, which firmed Y6 to Y475 on the Interferon theme. Nippon Housing Loan, the largest housing loan company, weakened Y21 to Y212. Companies in this sector are currently restructuring due to a rise in bad real estate loans. Market participants had hoped that the land buying organisation being set up by the banks would help the sector, but plans outlined last week failed to mention the purchase of land held as housing loan company collateral. Airline issues were depressed by last week's poor results. Japan Airlines fell Y20 to Y564. The company made a Y4.4bn pre-tax loss for the six months to September due to falling business demand for international travel and low growth in tourist travel. Condominium builders lost ground on prospects of poor sales and increasing inventories, Towa Real Estate Development dropping Y35 to Y343 and Daikyo, the leading condominium developer, retreating Y37 to Y678. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 51.54 to 18,349.79 in volume of 5.7m shares. Construction and pharmaceutical issues receded on profit-taking. Roundup The US presidential election caused some nervousness during a generally active day's trading in the Pacific Basin. Manila was closed for the All Souls Day holiday. KUALA LUMPUR rose further on strong buying of special situation and index-linked stocks, with the composite index closing 7.75 stronger at a new high of 649.06, in volume of 205.7m shares after Friday's record 237.6m. Brokers said buying was inspired by a favourable 1993 Malaysian budget unveiled last Friday, but profit-taking was evident as retail investors unloaded some of their positions after last week's rally. SINGAPORE closed more than 2 per cent higher on strong across-the-board buying led by institutional investors. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 30.54, or 2.2 per cent, higher at 1,417.54 in volume of 133.6m shares against Friday's 133.3m. DBS Foreign rose 70 cents to SDollars 12.50, while SIA Foreign and Singapore Press Foreign rose 60 cents each to SDollars 15.60 and SDollars 14.40 respectively. HONG KONG ended firmer after light trading, but with steep initial advances having been trimmed by profit-taking. The Hang Seng index gained a net 40.48 at 6,231.17 after an intraday peak of 6,277.22. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.57bn from HKDollars 4.17bn. Blue chip heavyweights such as HSBC Holdings again led the market higher, with the bank appreciating HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 63.50. Second-liners with exposure to China also outperformed, Tung Wing Steel climbing 43 cents to HKDollars 3.32 and Far East Aluminium adding 22 cents at HKDollars 1.65. BANGKOK recorded its highest close in almost 27 months, as small and medium-sized banks, finance and securities houses and building materials companies gained strongly. The SET index rose 9.88, or 1.1 per cent, to 950.23, the highest since August 8, 1990. Turnover was an active Bt14.97bn. SEOUL advanced for the seventh consecutive session, although profit-taking put a dent in the rise. The composite index added 6.39 at 621.97 on a turnover of Won678.6bn, compared to Saturday's half-day Won539.74bn. The heavily weighted Kepco went limit-up, gaining Won800 at Won19,200. TAIWAN extended opening losses to close broadly lower. The weighted index shed 72.22, or 2 per cent, to 3,559.51 in thin turnover of TDollars 7.65bn, after Friday's TDollars 7.23bn. The market was closed on Saturday for a holiday. AUSTRALIA closed sharply weaker, worried by a fall in local building approvals and the continued weakness in the local dollar. The All Ordinaries index lost 15.6 to 1,410.2 after an opening rally evaporated on news of a 1.2 per cent fall in building approvals in September. Turnover was ADollars 180.4m. BHP lost the ground it picked up last week and fell 26 cents to a 19-month low of ADollars 10.82. News Corp continued its record-setting rise, advancing 20 cents to ADollars 26.10 ahead of its quarterly results. NEW ZEALAND closed marginally higher in light trading. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 5.2 to 1,372.01 in turnover of NZDollars 14m. Lion Nathan remained under pressure, falling another 10 cents to NZDollars 3.70, on profit worries. The brewer is due to report its annual results tomorrow. JAKARTA's bank shares surged on the first day they were allowed to be bought by foreigners, raising hopes of a general revival of the market. But the composite index dipped 1.375 to 306.202. Bank Bali and Bank Internasional Indonesia rose Rp25 and Rp165 to Rp3,275 and Rp3,225 respectively.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Kuwaiti PM to open files on Iraqi invasion KUWAIT'S most actively fought election campaign closed this weekend with Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, promising to 'open the files' on the government's conduct leading up to the Iraqi invasion in August 1990 while lending his support for extending the vote to women. Sheikh Saad's attempt to address some demands by Kuwait's opposition groups came in a television and radio broadcast on Saturday night in which he also denied claims that the government was seeking to weaken the country's constitution. His remarks were the first public response to government critics from any member of the ruling al-Sabah family in the campaign. Kuwait's 81,400 eligible voters go to the polls this morning to elect a 50-seat National Assembly, the first full parliament since the emir suspended the last in 1986. The assembly has limited powers to initiate and veto legislation and can summon, and in some cases sack, ministers. Responding to repeated calls at rallies throughout the campaign, Sheikh Saad said: 'We will not stand against going into the file of August 2 1990, in the light of persistent demands to open this file.' Opposition groups, and many independent candidates, have argued that the government should be called to account for what they regard as government complacency before the Iraqi invasion and for the apparent unpreparedness of the Kuwaiti armed forces. Sheikh Saad also said he favoured extending the vote to Kuwait's women, 52 per cent of the population, who have led an unprecedented campaign to win the franchise. But he said that this and other opposition demands to lower the voting age to 18 and enfranchise naturalised Kuwaitis should be left to the next parliament. Despite widespread opposition allegations that the government has directly financed some of the 278 candidates, a self-appointed election watchdog yesterday said the election campaign had been substantially free and fair.</p>

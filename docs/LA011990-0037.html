			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BILL CUNLIFFE MAKES L.A. DEBUT AT BON APPETIT  </P> <P> You can add Bill Cunliffe's name to the young jazz artists to watch in the  '90s.  </P> <P> Mixing driving and intense yet ragged-at-the-edges originals with an occasional  New Age/contemporary concoction, the pianist -- recent winner of third annual  Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition in Washington -- made  plenty of music during his Los Angeles debut Tuesday at Bon Appetit in  Westwood.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old Cunliffe, who just moved to the Southland from Cincinnati,  worked with a trio (David Carpenter on six-string electric bass and drummer  Joel Taylor) that was augmented at times by saxophonist Bob Sheppard. The  players gamely tackled the leader's modern mainstream-ish pieces, which were  rhythmically complex and technically demanding. And while the renditions were  overbearing at times, they were never devoid of musical spark.  </P> <P> An aggressive, dexterous craftsman who reveals such influences as McCoy Tyner,  Bill Evans and Chick Corea, Cunliffe waded in passionately on "Traps," where  his edgy, muscular statements commanded the listener's attention. He also  created heat on "Attack of the Mad Boppers," a fast tune marked by fiery lines  that still rang melodiously. The pianist displayed a refreshing calmer side on  "The Gift," where he started soothingly and gradually built to a bigger sound.  </P> <P> On a medley of requisite Monk tunes, Cunliffe retained the late master's  authenticity while investing the tunes with his own personality. In Cunliffe's  hands, " 'Round Midnight" glowed and "Evidence," based on the standard "Just  You, Just Me," crackled.  </P> <P> Sheppard, one of Los Angeles' top sideman, was in his usual spirited form,  delivering inventive, fervent alto solos on "Joyous Dance" and "Mad Boppers."  Carpenter contributed good bass lines and a number of well-constructed, fluidly  offered solos and Taylor, though his kit sound came off a bit muddy, provided  perky, tight time.  </P> <P> To present a balanced performance, Cunliffe needs to back off occasionally,  lessen his intensity and give his audience some breathing room. Achieving that,  this invigorating musician's future would appear to be full of nothing but  promise. ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

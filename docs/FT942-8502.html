			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Question and answer Sinn Fein The British government says, in the Downing Street Declaration, 'that they will uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland'. What is the British government's precise definition of 'a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland' and how would this be measured in practical terms? Government The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland would be determined by a numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly and explicitly organised for this purpose. Provision for such a poll is made in section 1 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.</p>

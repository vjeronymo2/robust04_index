			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurocopy continues recovery Eurocopy, the office equipment distributor, continued its recovery with pre-tax profits up 34 per cent to Pounds 1.64m in the half year to March 31. This followed a jump of 54 per cent to Pounds 2.6m for 1992-93. The shares closed 3p higher at 68p yesterday. Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said that machine sales remained level but there was a small growth in copy volume. Triangle Systems, acquired in January, made a small contribution. Turnover dipped to Pounds 13.2m reflecting the disposal of the furniture division. Earnings per share rose from 1.68p to 2.27p and the interim dividend is 0.6p (0.5p).</p>

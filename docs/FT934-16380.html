			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on BAT THE downward slide in tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries continued yesterday after Hoare Govett and SG Warburg joined the list of houses that has recently downgraded profit expectations at the group. Active selling of the stock brought volume of 9.4m by the close as the shares ended 5 off at 456p, having touched 450p earlier in the day. Hoare Govett was said to have moved its current year forecast from Pounds 1.86bn to Pounds 1.80bn citing pressure on the US domestic tobacco market and in international exports for the move. Researchers at Warburg are believed now to be expecting current year profits of Pounds 1.8bn against a previous estimate of Pounds 1.828bn. The group reported profits of Pounds 1.65bn last year. Shares in BAT fell sharply at the end of last week after UK analysts on a visit to the group's US insurance operations came away with a less than rosy picture of near term trading.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: Down the Main Street of American song Many singers cross the Atlantic to Europe these days, but not so many songs. Europeans refer to 'Lieder' and 'melodies', but have no convenient term by which to describe a tradition of American song-writing that embraces everything from homespun ballads to the star-spangled musical hits of Broadway. On Tuesday the Wigmore Hall offered the curtain-raiser for its series 'Discover American Song'. Over the next six weeks American singers will roam down the Main Street of song history in the US. There is no music by Stephen Foster listed, so nobody will be singing of Jeanie with the light brown hair, but the main composers are there, not just Copland and Barber, but also Gershwin and Porter. A work called Sunday at MacDonalds has intriguingly been left until the end. With the influence of airs and ballads, jazz and blues, the song tradition in America is remarkably diverse. For the purpose of this series the crux of the matter is the contrast between the 'serious' song-writers who aspired to a European kind of art-song and the 'popular' composers from the world of mass entertainment. Most interesting are those who managed to be both. How clever of Barbara Bonney to send us away humming a tune by perhaps the most versatile crossover American of them all - Bernstein, whose 'Tonight' she sang with touching understatement for her final encore. It was the right idea to include a medley of Richard Rodgers, though the songs seem starved of air in the stilted atmosphere of the recital-hall. Bonney was artful, intimate, when they really ask for a strong blast of honest Broadway vigour. Most of the music in the first half will have been unfamiliar here. Six Elizabethan Songs by Argento proved to be well-made, not Tudor pastiche, more like less-than-memorable Britten. The last is Ben Johnson's 'Hymn', also used by Britten in his Serenade, and is quite different, spacious and reverential. A group by turn-of-the-century Griffes included one marvellously rich, late romantic song, 'The Rose of the Night', which whets the appetite for more. In the second half Bonney turned to the relatively well-known cycle I Hate Music] by Bernstein, which she made characterful without being brash. Her sweet, silvery soprano can sound unvarying over the course of an evening's solo recital, but not when she sings with as much insight as she did in Barber's Hermit Songs. This was the sort of performance that puts a work on the musical map, not least because Warren Jones found more in the piano part than any other accompanist I have heard. Do not be hesitant. There is a lot of American song worth the discovery. Further recitals in the series March 2, 4, 6, 15, 25 and 29</p>

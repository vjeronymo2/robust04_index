			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: Business ticking along just nicely at SMH - The rapid progress still being made by the top Swiss watchmaker If you believe in companies living through cycles, then you could wonder if SMH, the Swiss watch group that developed the phenomenally successful Swatch, is at or nearing its peak. Some telltale signs of hubris were in evidence at this week's annual press conference at the group's Longines subsidiary in the Jura mountains. On tables at the entrance to the conference room were copies of a study by an investment research organisation describing SMH as the best-managed large company in Switzerland. Nicolas Hayek, the expansive chairman, revealed that 50 securities companies in the UK, Germany and Switzerland had published studies of the group, and he estimated that the finance director and his team were now spending 30 per cent of their time fielding queries from investment analysts. To judge by the Swiss and international media, Mr Hayek himself spends a good deal of his time in interviews as well. He has also become more visible lately in support of worthy causes. He participated in the preparatory meetings at the United Nations for the Earth Summit in March and launched a summit commemorative model Swatch. By now, the SMH-Hayek success story is a familiar one. The Swiss watch industry was laid low in the late 1970s by Japanese companies that were quicker to capitalise on quartz and digital technologies. Between 1974 and 1983, exports of Swiss watches and movements crashed from 91.1m pieces to 42.8m. In 1982, leading Swiss banks asked Mr Hayek, a Zurich engineering consultant, to attempt a merger and rescue of two of the largest companies. Mr Hayek startled them by saying he would attack the Japanese head-on and try to recapture the mass market through heavy investments in automated manufacturing, product development and marketing. Retreating to niches, he declared, was pointless. The rest is history. In less than 10 years, SMH has gone from the edge of bankruptcy to becoming a highly profitable, financially powerful world beater. Group net profits have risen substantially every year since 1985, jumping 31 per cent last year to SFr252m (Dollars 177.4m). No precise forecast was given for the current year, but Mr Hayek said he was hoping for another record result and was 'full of euphoria' based on progress so far. Sales to the end of May were up 40 per cent. He also announced triumphantly that SMH would this year surpass Citizen of Japan to become the world's largest producer of watches and movements. Mr Hayek, who vaguely resembles the Hollywood actor and director Danny De Vito, has inevitably become something of a guru on consumer product marketing in general and beating Japanese competitors in particular. His main observation is that many consumer products induce an 'emotional' response. The purchaser has a more complex relationship with them than with, say, bread or a desk. To be successful, these products must not just have an image, they must deliver a message. Mr Hayek was pleased to report on the success of the group's diversifications into wrist-watch pagers and personal telephones. His biggest project, in co-operation with Volkswagen, is to develop an environmentally friendly car. Mr Hayek refused to reveal details of the car, which has attracted much speculation, but said it was 'very beautiful' and he hoped to launch it in 1996. Does this all add up to hubris? It would be dangerous to come to that conclusion. For one thing, SMH is Swiss, and Swiss companies are known for retaining their discipline for longer periods than many Anglo-Saxon ones. For another, Mr Hayek seems to know the dangers ahead, as he emphasised yesterday. 'The seeds of failure lie in success itself. We must be energetic and tireless, and every day fight against the beginnings of arrogance towards our customers. We must also be energetic and tireless against any tendency to become presumptuous, to rest on our laurels or fall back into old habits. This would be deadly for the enterprise.'</p>

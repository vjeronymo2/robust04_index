			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Major set for showdown with rebels: PM urges his rightwing critics to stop the squabbling MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday admitted that rightwing critics of his leadership were undermining the government's authority. Mr Major's startlingly frank call for party unity, to allow the government to function normally, confirmed that the future of his leadership would be the dominant theme of the autumn party conference season. It sets the scene for a showdown with the rightwing rebels at next month's party conference which will be a crucial test of Mr Major's leadership. Speaking in Tokyo, where he is on a four-day official visit, Mr Major left no doubt that his patience with the rebels had run out: 'It is time to cut out this stupid internecine squabbling and get on with the job the country elected us to do. That is their job, as well as mine.' Mr Major's decision to tackle his critics confirms that their persistent sniping is beginning to wear him down, despite official attempts to belittle them. Mr Major warned the rebels that the leadership controversy had to end to allow his government to work properly: 'When decisions need to be taken, and those decisions are in the interests of the British people, then I have the right to ask for the support of parliament, particularly the support of my party. That is what I intend to do.' Mr Major plans a showdown with the right at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool which he believes he will win easily. He said: 'The Conservative party in the country is sick and tired of these distractions, and I think they will show that at the conference.' The television interviews were intended as the first shot in a battle for control of the Conservative party which Mr Major began planning during his holiday in Portugal last month. Mr Major's call for unity was backed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who dismissed as 'silly' and 'irrelevant' speculation that Mr Major faces a leadership challenge in November. Mr Clarke, regarded as the clear frontrunner in any battle for the succession, poured scorn on the idea that he had been jostling for position with Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. The chancellor said that Mr Major had the unanimous backing of the cabinet and the firm support of the 'vast majority' of Conservative MPs. In typically robust form, Mr Clarke admitted on BBC Radio that the government remained in the 'dreadful hole' he had first alluded to in early summer. He warned again that he could not rule out further tax increases in his November Budget. Mr Clarke also refused to contemplate scrapping or scaling back the government's intention to impose value added tax on domestic fuel despite a weekend Mori opinion survey showing a backlash against the tax among party activists. He said any change to the VAT plan would smack of 'weak government'. Mr Major offered an olive branch to his critics this morning in a speech which dwelt on his vision for Europe - a main irritant in his battle with the right. Using language calculated to appeal to Euro-sceptic disciples of Lady Thatcher, former prime minister, he said the European Community must 'take account of the national identity, old cultures and proudly held traditions of Europe's members'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The town of Jericho and its environs were turned  over to Palestinian control approximately 30 minutes ago. Major  General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central Command, shook  the head of General Hajj 'Isma'il, the commander of the  Palestinian al-Aqsa Brigade, wished him success in his mission,  and offered the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] cooperation. Maj.  Gen. Biran said that the IDF troops had implemented the  withdrawal with full success.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 462 Palestinian  policemen have entered Jericho with approximately another 1,000  expected to arrive later. Local residents enthusiastically  welcomed the Palestinian policemen and flew PLO flags from their  cars.    Maj. Gen. Biran signed an order banning Israeli citizens  from  entering the Palestinian autonomous areas over the coming days.  The decree went into effect as soon as the Palestinian police  assumed responsibility for the area. An IDF spokesman asserted  that the major general signed the order due to security  considerations. The entrance of Israelis into the Jericho area  will only be permitted after security conditions there make this  possible.    Yesterday, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Chief of Staff  Ehud Baraq held up the entry of Palestinian policemen from  Jordan and Rafah for many hours after the PLO failed to meet the  conditions of the agreement and did not transfer a list with the  names of the members of the Palestinian authority to Israel.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that this was  a condition stipulated by the agreement signed by the PLO and  Israel and Yasir 'Arafat promised to send the list by last  Wednesday [11 May]. However, Israel was only given a partial  list of 15 names out of the 24 members of the Palestinian  authority late last night. Only then were the policemen  permitted to cross the border checkpoints.</p>

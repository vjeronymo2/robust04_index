			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Concern over Gateway as Isosceles refinances SHAREHOLDERS of Isosceles, the buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food retailing group, will meet today to approve the company's refinancing agreement tied up with its banks in August. Holders of 95 per cent of the shares have already undertaken to vote in favour of the resolutions. However, there are concerns that even after this refinancing, the second since the Pounds 2.1bn bid for Gateway was completed in 1989, goes through, the group's finances may require further restructuring. The group's problems stem from its inability to make asset sales to reduce the debt, which stood at Pounds 1.26bn at the April 25 financial year end, and from a marked worsening of trading conditions since the original buy-out. Isosceles is still trying to sell its Herman's Sporting Goods chain of shops in the US and Wellworth food retailing business in Northern Ireland. Negotiations are believed to be at an advanced stage for the sale of Wellworth, expected to recoup more than Pounds 125m. The company maintains that trading, while tough, is no worse than anticipated when talks with bankers began in the spring, and that its new stores - such as Food Giant, Somerfield and SoLo - are showing sales increases. The latest refinancing involves deferral of Pounds 48m of interest on the mezzanine debt, new facilities of Pounds 64m once the Pounds 48m limit has been reached, conversion of preference shares into ordinary shares and the issue to mezzanine lenders of options to buy up to 20 per cent of the group's ordinary shares at 1p each.</p>

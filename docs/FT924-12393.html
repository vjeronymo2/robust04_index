			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Brokers admit paying clients for losses JAPAN'S brokers have confessed to providing another Y10bn (Pounds 47m) in compensation to favoured customers for securities investment losses, and drawn praise from the Ministry of Finance for their apparent determination to stop reimbursing their clients. A survey of 47 larger securities houses by the Japan Securities Dealers' Association found that 10 brokers, mostly middle-sized firms, had provided compensation of Y100m or more over the past three fiscal years after demands from clients. The Big Four brokers, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities, told the JSDA that they had not provided reimbursements other than their share of the Y225bn in compensation already reported to the finance ministry. Last year, leading Japanese brokers admitted to compensating a long list of corporate customers for trading losses in the wake of the Tokyo stock market crash, and the JSDA survey is part of the attempt to restore public confidence in the industry. The finance ministry welcomed the results of the survey and said the industry appears to have learned from the mistakes of the past. The ministry, itself criticised last year for lax control over the brokers, said that it would maintain an extra close watch on their activities for at least the next three years.</p>

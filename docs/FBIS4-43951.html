			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] According to Swedish political  observers, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] predominance in the  polls -- currently over 50 percent to 21.8 for the Moderates --  can either be an advantage for the government or an  insurmountable lead. Quoted in an article by Mats Knutson in  SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 3 June, Peter Esaiasson of the Central  Statistical Bureau points out that no party in history has ever  overcome such a deficit. His colleague Soren Holmberg believes,  however, that the lead might be an advantage for the government,  enabling it to campaign as the de facto opposition, "something  that is always easier in a campaign." He believes that the  Social Democrats would also have an easier time mobilizing their  own supporters if they had a slightly smaller lead. Holmberg  claims that the government's reelection chances will be better  if the Christian Democrats clear the hurdle needed for  parliamentary representation but the Left Party and the Green  Party do not; all are hovering around the 4-percent cutoff.  "Then the margins between the government [Moderates, Liberals,  Center, and Christian Democrats] and the Social Democrats will  be only a few percentage points."</p>

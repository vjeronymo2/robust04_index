			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON Lambastes U.S. Moves Against Disarmament" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  comments on the feverish promotion of a program of the  development of a sophisticated missile by the United States to  spot and destroy missiles of the DPRK "which are hidden  underground."    The development of the new ultra-modern missile which is  being hastened under the cloak of "nuclear non-proliferation" is  a criminal act against nuclear disarmament, a renewed military  operation against the independent third-world countries and a  deliberate act for battening the U.S. war industrial monopolies,  the analyst notes, and continues:    The present U.S. administration declared that the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is the "keynote of its  state diplomacy." The United States, however, continues  accelerating the modernisation of its nuclear weapons and, worse  still, turns a blind eye to the development of nuclear weapons  by its allies and some satellites, while casting suspicion and  putting a bridle on the peaceful nuclear activities of the  countries which go against the grain with it.    The Pentagon seeks the aim of crushing the DPRK with  strength  in developing a new missile and in inveigling the allies into  the execution of its strategy while setting afloat the rumour of  "nuclear threat."    The United States is drawing its allies including Japan into  the execution of its aggressive strategy.    The Korean people strongly oppose the U.S. moves to gain  nuclear monopoly and build up arms and stifle anti-imperialist,  independent countries including the DPRK under the cloak of  "nuclear non-proliferation".    The United States must not cry for the non-proliferation of  nuclear weapons only in words, but carry it into practice.    It must, first of all, stop its wrong attempt to isolate and  stifle the DPRK engaged in peaceful nuclear activities under the  pretext of the latter's fictitious "nuclear threat" and withdraw  its nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea. And it must  stop applying a double standard and cut back and, furthermore,  completely scrap the existing nuclear weapons.</p>

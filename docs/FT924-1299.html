			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Arthur Andersen paves way for Japanese merger ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the worldwide accountancy firm, announced in Tokyo yesterday an affiliation agreement with Asahi Shinwa, Japan's second-largest auditors, in a move that paves the way for a full merger of the two firms next year. Asahi will immediately begin to share fees and receive referrals of work from Andersen's international network and from its Japanese audit firm, Inoue Saito Eiwa. Mr Richard Measelle, managing partner of Andersen, said he hoped the agreement would led to a merger of the two firms as early as the middle of 1993. The new firm would be called Asahi Shinwa. Asahi had until now been affiliated with Ernst &amp; Young. Direct links with this firm, including several joint ventures, will be terminated. The merger is unusual because Andersen is the only truly global accountancy network and has tended to grow organically rather than through acquisitions. In 1985 it merged with SGV, a large Asian accountancy practice based in the Philippines. Mr Measelle said agreement on the final terms of a merger was still under discussion, and was subject to approval from Japanese regulators. He said it would not amount to the firm buying out Asahi. Andersen's total fee income in Japan for the 12 months to August 31 last year was Dollars 115m. That includes income from Andersen Consulting and its separate tax firm, which will be included in the merger. Asahi's 1991 audit income was Y15.2bn (Dollars 122m), according to the International Accounting Databook. It employs about 1,700 staff and audits about 50 of the leading Japanese 1000 companies including NTT, Sumitomo Bank, Daiwa Securities and Mazda Motor.</p>

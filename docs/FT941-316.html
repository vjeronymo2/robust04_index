			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Tax credit helps Shell Australia Shell Australia, part of the Anglo-Dutch oil company and currently in the throes of spinning off the bulk of its metals interests, yesterday announced after-tax profits of ADollars 266m, (USDollars 189m) up from ADollars 181.2m in 1992, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. However, the improvement was due to a ADollars 88.3m income tax credit, and pre-tax operating profits slipped from ADollars 296.7m to ADollars 267.4m. Most sectors showed an improved performance, with the core upstream oil and natural gas division making ADollars 184.2m after tax but before allocation of financing costs, compared with ADollars 140m a year ago.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Kohl makes public appeal for wage restraint CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl, facing the twin threats of nationwide strikes and a fractious coalition government, yesterday issued an urgent May Day appeal for western German workers to restrain their wage demands in the interests of German unity. At the same time he read the riot act to his coalition partners, demanding that they bury their public squabbling and get on with the task of government. In a television interview last night, he flatly rejected suggestions that his coalition government might fall, but also sharply criticised the minority Free Democrats (FDP) for their indecisiveness over the succession to Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as foreign minister. He discounted any suggestion that he might form a new 'grand coalition' with the opposition Social Democrats, and expressed confidence that the three coalition partners would fight the next election side-by-side. His intervention comes after days of apparent political drift in Bonn, allowing his opponents to accuse him of inaction and weak leadership. It coincided with a slight easing of the strike action by public sector workers in a tactical move to prevent excessive disruption of the May Day national holiday today. However, engineering workers stepped up their campaign of strikes, calling out more than 220,000 workers in support of a separate pay claim. Mr Kohl's message amounted to a direct plea to workers in the public services, the railways and the engineering industry to abandon their demands for big pay rises in the interests of the unemployed in eastern Germany. 'Solidarity is not only demanded when it is a question of making demands and fighting for them, as in wage negotiations and job conflicts,' he said. 'There is also a solidarity of workers with the jobless. . . . In the present situation in Germany, solidarity of workers in the west with the workers in the east is also required.' Meanwhile, there was some good news for the government. On the economic front, there was confirmation that west German inflation was easing. The provisional rate in April was around 4.5 per cent, down from 4.8 per cent in March, the Federal Statistics Office said. On the political front, there was also a slight lifting of the storm clouds over the coalition, although the fundamental differences within the government have not been resolved. A full-scale parliamentary debate on the question of controlling the flood of asylum-seekers into the country suggested that the government and the opposition Social Democrats may yet be able to agree on a common solution to the problem, which has caused a defection of voters to extreme right-wing parties. Mr Kohl's appeal to the workers came after almost a week of escalating strike action by the public service workers, which has caused widespread havoc in public transport, left a huge backlog of letters and parcels, and has left mounds of uncollected rubbish in shopping centres and private homes. The public sector unions are demanding a pay increase of 9.5 per cent, but Mr Kohl and the government are adamant that anything more than 5 per cent is out of the question, given the current budget deficit to finance unification, and above all to subsidise jobs in the east German economy.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold directly by the Chinese exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire and were found to be eligible for a separate rate, we calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions for containerization, loading, port handling expenses and foreign inland freight valued in a surrogate country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise for the three exporters. The factors used to produce pencils include materials, labor, and energy. We made adjustments to materials costs for the resale of scrap materials, where applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production, we selected, where possible, the PAPI value which was: (1) An average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party, or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the pencil factories, and between factories, where appropriate. In those cases where a respondent failed to provide any information on transportation distances and modes, we applied, as best information available, the most expensive distance/modes combination ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the longest truck rates) that was available from the surrogate information we had selected. For two modes of transportation (man-drawn carts, inland water transport), we were unable to obtain PAPI or cable information in time for this preliminary determination. To value these two modes of transportation, we assumed that these forms competed effectively with an alternate form of transportation over similar distances and used the applicable rates for the alternate form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value the raw materials and packing materials, we used PAPI. Our sources included: Indian Import Statistics for 1989, 1991 and 1992; and Indonesian Import Statistics for 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value wood slats, we used the Asian market price for jelutong wood in the sawn form during the POI as reported in the Market News Service Report for Tropical Timber and Timber Products dated November 1993. To value wood logs, we used Indian import statistics for a group of woods in rough form which included jelutong wood. The record in this proceeding shows that jelutong wood is used in pencil production and is similar to lindenwood, the input used by the PRC producers. For ferrules we used Indian import statistics for a basket aluminum category and for paint we used the import statistics category identified by respondents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

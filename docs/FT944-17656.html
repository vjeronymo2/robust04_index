			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Psy Ops war waged in Haiti: An operation meant to please Washington as well as the locals In military jargon, Psy Ops stands for Psychological Operations, actions designed to mislead the enemy or influence the climate of opinion in conflict zones. While they might be the key to a particular mission, Psy Op agents usually work independently. Yet as the US lays the ground for the imminent return to Haiti of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, its occupation of the country seems to be one big Psy Op. What it suggests is that the US believes getting Mr Aristide back in power is a question of changing minds more than changing conditions. Every movement of US troops has a 'target audience in addition to a military target', says one Psy Op planner. When troops raided the headquarters of Fraph, the paramilitary organisation loyal to the coup leaders, soldiers led about 30 of those captured on a slow parade through central Port-au-Prince and let Aristide supporters tear up the office. The idea, said the planner, was to demonstrate to Fraph and the American people that the US could take charge whenever it wanted and that it had the capital's vengeful mobs on its side. The Central Intelligence Agency in Washington last night denied reports that it had helped set up Fraph in 1991. President Bill Clinton is no longer chided for having 17,000 troops in Haiti doing nothing. And the lack of serious confrontation with Fraph, which still has an estimated 200,000 members with 30,000 weapons at large, leaves him less exposed to criticisms that the US is becoming bogged down in a Somalia-like mission. Another big hit in Haiti, and on CNN, are searches of homes where it is suspected anti-Aristide forces have stored weapons. On one of these raids a contingent of 10 US soldiers found two pistols and three rifles in a storage shed, enough to arrest the man guarding the flimsy structure. After they left, the shack was reduced to rubble by jubilant Haitians. A Sergeant MacPhearson later told an assembled crowd: 'We promise to keep raiding them if you promise to keep destroying them.' Still, these raids have netted less than 300 weapons, and US military spokesman Colonel Barry Willey admitted that faulty intelligence means 'we don't know until we get there whether we've gone on a wild goose chase'. Military commanders also know that politicians in Washington can make or break this mission, so they have become a 'target' as well. When senators came down on a whirlwind fact-finding tour, Bradley armoured cars uncharacteristically left the US base, some with orders to roll by just as the visitors were to begin their press conference, to give the impression of the US being firmly in charge. Also meant for consumption in Washington, according to a Special Forces media liaison officer, are the television shots of Haitians cheering the US forces. Television crews are given priority with military units that are likely to encounter positive crowds, thus giving Mr Clinton some 'breathing room' as Congress debates whether to impose a date for troop withdrawal. US actions, psychological or not, are certainly building momentum for the return of Mr Aristide. Fraph, the police and the army are lying low and Aristide supporters, feeling protected by the Americans, are growing more confident by the day. But whether these shows of force are creating the conditions for Mr Aristide to rule is another question. Mr Roosevelt Poteau, owner of a computer supply and repair shop, is eagerly awaiting the end of the economic embargo that Mr Aristide will bring with him, yet is wary that 'US forces are leaving our president too much hard work for him to do by himself'.</p>

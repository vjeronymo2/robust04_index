			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Cayman Islands to send back Cubans The Cayman Islands will repatriate most of the 395 Cuban refugees in the British colony and will not accept any more, said Mr Michael Gore, the colony's governor. This follows the US rejection of a proposal from the Islands' administration that the Cubans be transferred to refugee centres in either Panama or the US naval station at Guantanamo Bay in south-eastern Cuba. Mr Gore said the Caymanian administration had no alternative but to repatriate the Cubans 'classified as economic migrants. . . as the US was unwilling to accept Cuban migrants from Cayman'. The move highlights Washington's difficulties in persuading Caribbean and Latin American nations to help house the growing numbers of refugees. The first of 10,000 Cuban refugees due to be airlifted from Guantanamo to Panama were moved earlier this week, but Panama's government is only allowing the refugees to be housed for six months as a humanitarian gesture. The US coast guard remained busy in the Florida Straits yesterday rescuing more than 600 Cubans by mid-morning, bringing to 7,217 the number of Cubans rescued in the first six days of September. Meanwhile, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, head of the Cuban delegation negotiating with the US over the flow of Cuban boat people, was returning to Havana for consultations, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday. The Cayman Islands are 120 miles south of Cuba and small numbers of refugees have been arriving over the past two years. The flow increased recently, with 56 arriving last weekend, bringing the number since August 10 to 286. Most are kept in a special camp and others are in the prison. The Islands' administration said last week this year's refugee budget had been exhausted.</p>

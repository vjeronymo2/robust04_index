			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Signs of recovery in north-west A SLOW but fragile economic recovery appears to be building in north-west England and north Wales, according to the latest quarterly surveys by the regional chambers of commerce and industry in Manchester and Liverpool. After faltering last summer, domestic orders between October and December resumed an upward trend which began in 1991. Business confidence has also improved, and a few companies have revived investment plans. But redundancies are forecast nevertheless. Both chambers report buoyant export markets, with the Liverpool chamber's service-sector members responding faster than manufacturers to the devaluation of sterling in September. Manchester chamber's manufacturers, however, reported strong export sales.</p>

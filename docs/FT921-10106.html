			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pena sues GWR for unspecified sum Mr Dan Pena, former chairman of Great Western Resources, is suing his former employer, and individual directors of the troubled oil and gas company, for an unspecified sum. Mr Pena is claiming entitlement to certain termination payments. However, GWR strongly maintains that any such payments would be immaterial after taking account of loans outstanding to Mr Pena totalling Pounds 1.4m. GWR is also involved in a dispute with South Carolina Public Service Authority over long-standing coal contracts.</p>

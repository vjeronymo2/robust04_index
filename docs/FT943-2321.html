			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / People: Finance moves Kenneth Inglis, the new broom at the top of Fleming Investment Management, has chosen the marketing team for his first sweep. Patrick Johns, the gentlemanly ex-Army director of marketing, has decided to consider other career opportunities, Fleming said yesterday. Fleming's core business, running UK 'balanced' pension assets, has been struggling in recent years, mostly as a result of some unfortunate asset allocation decisions in 1992 and in the late 1980s. Thus, marketing Fleming in its core market would have been a hard sell for anyone. However. Inglis, recruited away from Allied Dunbar where he racked up an impressive set of investment returns over many years, has decided that a different approach to marketing is needed. Inglis, who has praised Johns' marketing skills highly, plans to visit Fleming's top 40 or 50 clients himself, and personally explain the firm's investment strategy. 'We need to have investment professionals talking directly to clients,' he says. Presumably, that requires having investment professionals running the marketing team.</p>

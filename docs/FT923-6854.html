			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Running out of steam in Baglan Bay: Local reaction to fears about the future of BP's plastics plant in south Wales BRITISH Petroleum's Baglan Bay plant is on the Swansea side of Port Talbot in south Wales, linked to the town and its surrounding industrial estates by a chain of roundabouts. An untidy-looking complex built in the 1960s, the steam from its cooling towers floats out over the sands of Aberavon beach, a few hundred yards away. At the far end of the beach lies British Steel's Port Talbot works, which has lost two thirds of its workforce since the early 1980s. Workers at BP are worried that their numbers might be cut just as drastically. There are about 900 staff left at the plant after 130 job losses last year - making BP Port Talbot's second-largest employer after British Steel. Large numbers of contractors are also employed at the site, varying from 500 to more than 1,000 at any one time. Staff and regular contractors at Baglan Bay are drawn from a wide area - from Bridgend further east, to Llanelli in the west. Specialised contractors can come from as far afield as the north-east of England and Germany. The impact of cuts or closure would be felt most strongly in Port Talbot itself, but the knock-on effects would spread as far as the employees are scattered, sending ripples through the whole Swansea Bay area. The centre of Port Talbot shows little in the way of affluence. The high street is sprinkled with 'To Let' signs and boarded-up shops. The businesses doing best seem to be discount stores selling cheap clothing and household goods. British Steel has shed almost 8,000 jobs at Port Talbot since it launched a restructuring and investment programme at the works in 1980. About 4,000 staff are left. It is only recently that unemployment in Port Talbot has fallen to near the national average, after a decade of being well above it. Closure of all or part of the BP plant would be a big setback to the process of rebuilding the local economy. Unemployment in the Port Talbot and Neath area was 9.3 per cent last month, slightly lower than Swansea with 9.9 per cent. There are pockets of much higher unemployment in the valleys north of the town. Announcements of new jobs are something to be celebrated. The biggest story in the local paper one evening this week was the recruitment of 40 sewing machinists by Morris Cohen, an established local supplier of lingerie to Marks and Spencer. Advertisements in the Jobcentre tend to be for care jobs, cleaners and sales representatives. The Swansea Bay Partnership, a collaboration between local authorities, the Welsh Development Agency and private businesses in the region, has been encouraging companies to move to the area. In the mid-1980s Port Talbot succeeded in attracting businesses to industrial parks around the town, including several Japanese companies and others involved in high-technology and biotechnology. Port Talbot has good transport links, with the M4 running by the town, an InterCity rail line and the deep-water port at Swansea. Recently, however, its attractions have been outshone by developments further east at Cardiff Docks and Newport. Job creation has slowed during the past two or three years as the recession has made companies postpone decisions on whether to take up sites around the town, and the new Japanese factories producing televisions and video recorders have been hit by low consumer spending. Public feeling in Port Talbot after the redundancies last year was that the BP plant was economically viable and that the company was committed to the area. BP has recently been developing a higher profile in the community, particularly on environmental issues. It has supplied a plastic recycling skip for the town and become involved with badger protection groups in Baglan village. But changes in world markets for BP products, and in the company's priorities, could mean local confidence is misplaced. BP's workforce is becoming uneasy. 'There is a lot of conjecture,' says Mr Jeff Morgan, TGWU general workers' union branch secretary at Baglan Bay. Morale has been particularly low since an article in European Chemical News quoting Mr Bryan Sanderson, head of BP Chemicals, describing Baglan Bay as 'marginal'. Mr Morgan says communication between management and workers is not as good since the union lost its negotiating rights earlier this year. He sees the most likely rationalisation as the closure of all production facilities except that for styrenes - one of the types of plastics produced at Baglan Bay - and the power plant. This produces electricity from steam given off as a by-product of plastics production and sells it to the national grid. That scenario would involve the loss of three quarters of Baglan Bay jobs. 'It would be very, very tragic, not only for the direct workforce, but also for the area where we employ local labour,' Mr Morgan says. Mr Noel Crowley, deputy leader of Port Talbot Borough Council, agrees. 'The effect on the town would be devastating,' he says. 'The effect that would have on all the local businesses throughout the community that supply them; it would be absolutely awful.'</p>

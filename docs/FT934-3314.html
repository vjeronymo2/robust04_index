			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Life insurance Assessing the fall-out from the personal pensions fiasco is no easy matter. But the extent of poor sales practice now uncovered by the SIB must nudge the potential for compensation claims considerably higher. Companies which sell mainly with-profits policies have some protection even if guilty of malpractice, since the life fund should carry most of the cost.

Big sellers of unit-linked policies such as Abbey Life and Allied Dunbar would be more exposed, but only if their salesmen have been guilty of giving bad advice.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: Voters fed Bolshevik slogan of bread and peace 'Bread, peace and land' is the 1917 slogan that won the Bolsheviks a 74-year hold on power. Today, it is being echoed in the contest for the new parliament, to be elected on December 12. For bread, read standard of living  -bread prices now reflect the cost of production, as do most foods and commodities. And real incomes, which rose by 10 per cent from January to September this year compared with last, have stagnated since. The number of people with incomes below the subsistence minimum, or upper poverty line, hovers around 45 per cent - down on last year's peak of 64 per cent, but still very high. And the gap is widening between the rich - being the 20 per cent of the population who receive 43 per cent of total income - and the poor - the 20 per cent who receive 7 per cent of income. As a result, the 'feelgood' factor is slender, and the ordinary voter has a constant and consuming interest in the cost of living. It is a tribute to the relative success of policies of the last two years that few groups are overtly calling for restoration of subsidies. Instead, they are focusing on the need for a rise in state pensions and wages, student stipends, and sickness and invalidity benefit. One political group - the Dignity and Charity bloc - is devoted solely to the interests of pensioners and invalids. All Others nod towards the alleviation of their poverty. If peace is widely defined to include personal security (with the Bolsheviks it was an end to the war) then it, too, is an important election issue. Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic party called it 'the first issue in our campaign' in his election broadcast on Tuesday evening, while the candidates of the the far-right Liberal Democrats say that 'we will restore order - by peaceful means, of course'. The growing gap in incomes - with the conspicuously rich, Mercedes-driving class now visible in most cities - is fuelling calls for a crackdown on corruption and organised crime as much as on the soaring rise in general crime. Real war also features - as candidates, especially the Communists, conjure up ethnic struggles in the Caucasus and Central Asia to hammer home their point that the collapse of the Soviet Union, provoked by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and leading members of his current government, has been a disaster for Russia in lost prestige as much as in lost production. Fearful that patriotism may become the sole preserve of the far right and left, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the liberally-inclined foreign minister who is standing in Murmansk, has been taking a hard line in recent weeks - threatening Armenia with intervention if it does not apologise for an attack on a Russian diplomat and Ukraine with sanctions if it does not return its nuclear missiles to Russia. Land features in all the blocs' rhetoric and programmes. A presidential decree allowing the free purchase and sale of land was signed last month and all parties have had to take a position on it. The majority supports it with reservations. Even the Communists and the Agrarians, the twin defenders of socialist ownership, feel impelled to say that they are not against the free possession of land, just its purchase and sale. On the issue of the privatisation of enterprises, the reform consensus also appears to have won the day. No party flatly advocates a return to state ownership, although the Communists and Agrarians, with the Liberal Democrats and the Dignity and Charity group, clearly favour the state. The pull of electoral politics is presently towards the centre: the neo-fascists (Liberal Democrats) and the Communists emphasise their peaceful intent; while the radical liberals (Russia's Choice) play up their patriotism. Parties and electorates are new to each other in the new Russia: but for the moment, they can both say that we are all centrists now.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The warring forces in Afghanistan continued  attacking one another's positions with mortar and long-range  weaponry today, leaving 37 people killed or injured. Let me  draw your attention to our correspondent's report:    The rival groups in Afghanistan engaged in fighting in Kabul  and its environs today, bringing one another's positions under  rocket and heavy weaponry fire. In the course of the fighting  the forces allied to Borhanoddin Rabbani, the Afghan president,  subjected the positions of Hekmatyar's forces and the bases of  the forces of General Dostam to severe shelling. The forces  opposed to Rabbani, for their part, subjected parts of the  northwest of the capital of Afghanistan to rocket attacks.    According to a spokesman affiliated to the Afghan president,  seven people were killed and more than 30 injured as a result of  the opposition's rocket attacks and shelling. Government  sources also reported air attacks by forces affiliated to the  Afghan president on the positions held by General Dostam's  forces on the Bala Hesar hill and its environs, and they claimed  that they had captured some fortifications in that area; the  opposition has rejected this claim.    Meanwhile, reports from Herat, in western Afghanistan, state  that aircraft under the command of General Dostam subjected the  region to heavy bombardment. General Mohammad Zahir Azimi,  spokesman for southwestern Afghanistan, said that during this  attack, residential parts of Herat were attacked, leaving 10  people dead and about 110 injured.    These clashes are occuring at a time when Rabbani's term as  president is due to end in two days' time.</p>

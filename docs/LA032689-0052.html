			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FAMILY HOME SITS ON AN UNFAIR TAX BASE  </P> <P> California's property tax counterrevolution should have occurred one day during  the last four or five years. That day was when a majority of homeowners woke up  to realize that they constituted a class of citizens paying higher property  taxes than everyone else. Everyone else belonged to the privileged shrinking  minority able to reap the full advantage of Proposition 13 merely by not  moving.  </P> <P> Up to now, barely a shot has been fired, let alone a counterrevolution. The  major threat to the state's Proposition 13 property tax law is a legal one, and  at this moment, still relatively remote. But there is considerable anxiety  about what might happen to the property tax system should an anti-Proposition  13 case make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court -- and succeed -- as did a  recent, similar West Virginia lawsuit. For many people, the prospect of  certainty -- even unpleasant certainty -- is preferable to chaos.  </P> <P> While a federal constitutional test of Proposition 13 is not just around the  corner, the threat of legal challenge causes stirrings among two groups of  people. First are those officials who have believed all along that something  must be done to eliminate, or at least reduce, the inequity between two classes  of taxpayers in California. They dared not try because of swift and sure  political retribution for anyone tinkering with Proposition 13. Second are  those who think California must be ready to preserve some property tax limits  in case the law is overturned in court.  </P> <P> There never has been any lack of complaint about the inequities of the system  created by the proposition passed in the June, 1978, election. Anyone who  bought a home in California after adoption of Article XIIIA of the state  Constitution has some sort of horror story about the disparity between his tax  bill and a neighbor's. The newcomer to the block could find a property tax bill  five or more times that of a neighbor's, even if the houses were identical and  worth the same on the open market.  </P> <P> Everyone pays the same tax rate, 1% of assessed value. The difference is that  the low-tax neighbor has stayed in the same house since 1978; thus, the home's  assessed value remains unchanged except for a 2% annual increase applied to  everyone. The stay-putters now are in the minority, their numbers down to  barely 40% in Los Angeles County and even lower in other fast-developing areas  throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> The home buyer triggers a reassessment through purchase. The sale price  automatically becomes the new assessment. Under Proposition 13, property in  California is reassessed only when it changes ownership or undergoes  substantial reconstruction. In more than two-thirds of the other 49 states,  property tax assessments are reviewed every one to five years, to keep current  with actual home values. But the premise of Proposition 13 is that houses  should be taxed primarily on their worth at the time of purchase -- and not on  the paper value created by rampant housing inflation.  </P> <P> The problem for those who would like to foment revolution is that once the home  buyer remains at the same address for a year or so, he or she is susceptible to  becoming a convert. The tax on a house bought for $200,000 the first year will  be $2,000, all other things being equal. The tax the next year will be no more  than $2,040. The longer the owner stays put, the greater the benefits relative  to those who bought later.  </P> <P> Still, there are two distinct classes of homeowners in California based on an  arbitrary declaration of law. Even if Proposition 13 survives court challenges,  that is poor public policy. One of the major tenets of a "good" tax is that it  be applied fairly. The inequity of Proposition 13 is compounded in growing  areas where local governments impose fees on developers to pay for streets,  schools and other facilities. The fees, lumped into the new house sale price,  average about $12,000. They constitute an indirect tax to help make up for the  loss of property tax revenue.  </P> <P> Another argument for change is the widespread perception that businesses have  benefitted disproportionately from Proposition 13. This theory maintains that  businesses change ownership less often than homes and therefore remain at the  lower tax level. State tax officials, however, claim turnover is just about the  same in residential and commercial property. In Los Angeles County, 40.4% of  all homes have not been reassessed since Proposition 13, compared with 43.2% of  all commercial property.  </P> <P> But one state study indicated that in the first five years after Proposition  13, businesses realized two-thirds of the property tax relief. In San  Francisco, the assessor's office says that 1,900 business properties out of the  city's total 163,000 parcels accounted for more than $11 billion in assessments  -- more than one-third the total. While in pure numbers, commercial property  may be turning over about as fast as homes, many large businesses benefited  more in dollar volume because they accounted for a greater portion of the tax  base. .  </P> <P> One proposed change is to create a split roll with residences on one assessment  list and commercial property on another. More revenues could be raised by  assessing businesses at a higher rate. Fifteen states have such a system.  </P> <P> This plan (once on the same ballot as Proposition 13 in a rival package  proposed by the Legislature) would not by itself eliminate the disparity  between groups of homeowners. While stay-putters now are in a minority, it  would be politically impossible at this point to close the gap by raising their  taxes significantly and/or cutting the taxes of later home purchasers. Any  change in Proposition 13 requires approval at a statewide election.  </P> <P> To reduce all property taxes to the 1975 level (Proposition 13 rolled back  assessments to that base year) would be prohibitively costly. Property taxes  still raise more than $12 billion a year in California, most of it supporting  city and county government. One suggestion is to increase the current  homeowner's tax exemption for newer homeowners. The existing senior citizens'  property tax relief program could be expanded to protect older Californians  living on fixed incomes. Lost revenue would have to be replaced from some other  tax source.  </P> <P> Another method would be to allow assessments of stay-putters' homes to grow at  a slightly-faster rate than the present maximum 2%, but to keep them capped at  a reasonable level. This would protect taxpayers from surprise escalations of  the sort that touched off the property tax rebellion of the late 1960s and  early 1970s. The equity gap would be closed over the years.  </P> <P> Fairness and common sense dictate that some attempt be made to equalize the tax  load between new home buyers in California and those who have been content to  remain in the same houses since 1978 -- including those whose professions do  not require them, or entice them, to move.  </P> <P> For all its faults, Proposition 13 has been immensely popular because it brings  stability and certainty to the property tax system. Any reform must protect  seniors and others who can least afford to keep up with soaring property taxes.  Politically, the reformers will have to convince a majority of California  voters that the proposed changes will give them a better deal. That will be a  tough sell.  </P></p>

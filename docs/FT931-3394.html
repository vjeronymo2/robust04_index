			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar storms to three-year highs WORLD SUGAR prices, already moving ahead on successive reductions in the Thai crop estimate, surged to the highest level for nearly three years yesterday on news that the storms sweeping up the eastern seaboard of the US had hit Cuba. In New York the May raw sugar contract was up 0.95 at 11.50 cents a lb in late trading, having touched a peak of 11.83 cents earlier. In London the August white sugar contract closed at Dollars 297.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13 on the day. However, analysts in London were cautious over the damage to Cuba's crop, which was already expected to be well down on last year's 7m tonnes. Some are talking of 5m tonnes and under, but there is no hard evidence on which to base a judgment. Talk of damage to sugar mills and dock facilities in Cuba added further fuel to the flames. 'The Cubans have a vested interest in allowing people to think it's terrible, ' said Mr Chris Pack, analyst at Czarnikow. 'But it can't have done any good to have a tremendous storm at the start of the season.' Last week the Thai government revised its production estimate down to 3.51m tonnes - the lowest level for five years. At the beginning of the season production was expected to reach a record 5m tonnes, but drought has damaged the crop.</p>

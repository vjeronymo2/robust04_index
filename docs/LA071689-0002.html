			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Are two of the prerequisites for participation in the game show "Win, Lose or  Draw" that one should be devoid of all drawing ability and possess absolutely  no knowledge of the geography of the world? On a recent show, the performance  of a young female rock star was nothing short of pathetic. On the whole, I find  the show an embarrassment as the celebrities' and contestants' deficiencies are  revealed before thousands of viewers. What schools have these people attended?  </P> <P> J. M.

Here is evidence:  Troops of the 7th Brigade headquartered in Villavicencio seized  an FAL assault rifle, the regulation weapon of the Venezuelan  military, from the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia].    The guerrillas repainted the rifle to hide its origin, but  under the paint an inscription can still be read: Venezuelan  Armed Forces.    There are 80 other rifles like this one in Villavicencio,  not  counting the ones seized in other areas of the country.    Venezuelan Military Staff members will arrive in Bucaramanga  on 18 January to request the return of a large number of  Venezuelan weapons seized from several guerrilla fronts.    The official Venezuelan explanation continues to be that the  weapons were stolen from border garrisons.    The Colombian and Venezuelan defense ministers will meet on  19 January here at the 5th Brigade headquarters in Bucaramanga  to study the issue of Venezuelan weapons in the hands of  Colombian guerrillas.    In dealing blows to the Colombian guerrillas over the last  few months, authorities have found Venezuelan assault rifles,  mortars, ammunition, and submachine guns, all of which bear the  coat of arms and insignia of the Venezuelan Armed Forces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has arrived  in Israel for a brief two-day visit. Speaking at the airport  upon his arrival last night, Hurd said he hopes to hear about  the ongoing peace process, but he did not bring with him any new  proposals. Dani Gur-Arye reports:    [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  flew from Beirut to Ben-Gurion Airport last night for his first  visit to Israel in three years. He was greeted by Deputy  Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who said Israel is eager to brief  Britain on the latest developments in the peace process.    Secretary Hurd said relations between Israel and Britain had  been strengthened over the last three years. He said the Middle  East peace process had gained a certain momentum, and there was  no going back on what had been achieved.    Hurd was asked if he is bringing to Israel proposals to help  get the talks with the Palestinians back on track.    [Hurd] I don't wish to suppose or lead you to suppose that I  have in my suitcase some bright ideas on these subjects. No,  that is not our role; that is not our role. If from time to  time we can facilitate....[pauses] I've just had a fascinating  dinner in Beirut with the three Lebanese presidents [as heard],  and I will discuss that aspect also tomorrow. Maybe from time  to time one can facilitate understanding, but I wouldn't put it  higher than that. On the economic side, of course we are very  interested in how the Israel-PLO agreement develops and how it  broadens out. So that side certainly, but I wouldn't certainly  cast myself in any kind of role of intermediary.    [Gur-Arye] Hurd also said he hopes to discuss other issues  with the Israeli leaders, including Israel's trade policy with  the EC. The British foreign secretary is scheduled to meet with  Prime Minister Rabin today. He said he would also meet with  family members of Israel's MIA's. [end recording]</p>

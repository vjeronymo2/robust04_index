			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (13): Fraud may cost Dollars 4bn a year - Computer security: new moves are under way to beat the 'hackers' IT is impossible to fully estimate how much computer-based fraud costs businesses every year, partly because not all frauds are discovered immediately, and partly because many companies fear the loss of credibility from publicly revealing that they have been a target. Some guesses, however, put it as high a Dollars 4bn a year. Fraud, particularly as data communication traffic increases, is just one reason why companies and institutions need to pay keen attention to the security of their computer systems. The other important reason is the proliferation of the computer virus. The research company, Input, has estimated that the revenues of electronic data interchange (EDI) service companies, in Europe alone, will jump from Dollars 134m last year, to Dollars 660m by 1997. This is just the cost for carrying EDI traffic - such as purchase orders, invoices and, perhaps most important of all, payment transfers. The value of these will probably total the majority of business transacted between EC-member countries. This represents a significant target for anyone with the skills to gain access to the systems, and many so-called 'hackers' have both the skills and resources to carry out the work, sometimes with surprising ease. One class of system that has shown vulnerability over recent times is the local area network (LAN), the now widely used method for linking desktop personal computers to one or more central file servers where corporate data is stored. Novell, whose NetWare system is used by about 70 per cent of the PC LAN market, has been an obvious target for hackers. Dutch academics at Leiden University discovered what has been quaintly called the 'mechanism for intrusion,' a program which would keep throwing packets of access code at the system till the right code was found. This could be used either locally, on one of the PCs connected to the system, or remotely via a phone and modem. A hacker could then access all the files on the system without the need for password protection, meaning that valuable corporate data was at risk of theft or modification. Once the mechanism was discovered, Novell set to work to develop a solution. Its first step was to develop a 'check stop' utility, which checks to see if wrong code packets are being tried and then stops all access from that PC or remote access gateway. It has subsequently developed more complex fixes which utilise more rigorous authentication checks and encryption of the access protocol data. A second phase in the development will also encrypt data as it moves around the network. The biggest problem here is that increasing the levels of security available also tends to slow systems down. Some estimates suggest NetWare can be up to 40 per cent slower using the encryption techniques. One obvious step that can be taken to control intra-company hackers is to increase the level and complexity of network monitoring. This is a capability offered by systems such as the Computer Misuse Detection System from SIAC (UK). Developed for Unix systems, this sets out to monitor the activity on a corporate network, checking both for deviations from the expected activity, and activity that steps outside the set of 'rules' defined by the company for network traffic. In this way, the systems administrators can be warned of improper network activity, and in particular attempts at access to data by users with the wrong security level, as they are attempting it. It then becomes possible to monitor what they are doing and stop them if necessary. Solutions such as these point to the best ways of protecting against the hacker. Live monitoring of a network makes it possible to spot irregular and possibly illegal activity as it is happening, while encrypting the data on the network makes it more difficult for the hacker to generate any value for the information accessed, if they manage to break through. The penalty from a company's point of view, is an inevitable reduction in overall system performance. This may not be overly significant, but should be taken into consideration when specifying the system in the first place. Operations can also be slowed by staff adhering fully to all system management procedures but this can be important, particularly when it comes to the other prime security problem, attacks by viruses. THE fundamental principle here is that the vast majority of viruses can be trapped and removed from a system when detected. Regular scanning of the entire system is, therefore, an essential pre-requisite of maintaining the integrity of a company's valuable applications and data. Virus scanners such as those from S&amp;S International in the UK and McAfee in the US are regularly updated with the tools necessary to spot and remove the latest viruses, with many of their clients sending them the latest discoveries. It is a big business for them. McAfee recently went public on the US stock market and, despite being a company of only 30 employees, raised over Dollars 48m. Many viruses cause no real problems to system users bar annoyance. Others, such as the famous Michelangelo virus of last year, carry a 'payload' that can be extremely destructive - and users run the risk of losing all their business data, or at least the data created since the last system back-up was carried out. With the increasing use of communications such as electronic mail and EDI systems, the number of ways in which a virus can infect a company's system has risen dramatically. If an infected file is sent to another system, it carries the virus within it. Once in a new system, it is free to spread and infect other files. This is why regular scanning is important. Many viruses need an action to trigger them, often the process of loading the infected file. Others - and so far these have normally been the more destructive ones - are triggered by an external event such as a date change. As with the Michelangelo virus, regular scanning can catch the virus and eradicate it before it has been triggered.</p>

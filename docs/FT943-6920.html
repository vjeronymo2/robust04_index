			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Fresh bout of pipeline politics fuels scepticism - A Dollars 7bn gas shipment deal The signing in Tehran earlier this week of a Dollars 7bn deal to ship natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey is the latest example of the 'pipeline politics' being played out in the region. Tehran radio reported on Wednesday that President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran and President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan dug a symbolic hole for the proposed 4,000km pipeline at a site south of the Iranian capital. The plan calls for a gas pipeline with an initial annual capacity of 15bn cubic metres to enter Iran east of the Caspian Sea, pass through the cities of Shahrud and Semnan and bend south of Tehran towards Tabriz and the Turkish border. 'This is one of the biggest energy transfer projects in the world,' according to Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister. It would take six to eight years to build, with the Iranian section alone costing Dollars 3.5bn. Tehran Radio quoted Mr Aqazadeh as saying that half of that sum would be provided by Iran. Western analysts say the presence at the ceremony of officials from Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan lent a degree of credibility to the proposal, one of many which have been put forward in recent months to link western markets with the large energy reserves of central Asia. But many remain sceptical that two countries with such serious economic problems will be able to arrange the international finance that would be needed for such a massive project. They also note that Turkey, Russia and Iran are all jockeying for political and economic influence in central Asia, and that all have advanced competing pipeline proposals. 'It seems more real now than a year ago,' said Mr Laurent Ruseckas, an analyst at the Boston-based Cambridge Energy Research Associates. But he noted that this week's ceremony was long on symbolism and short on details of any cash commitments. 'The meeting benefited everyone politically without costing them anything,' he added. The Russians have a stranglehold over oil and gas export routes from the former Soviet Union, a position they do not want to lose. But nor do they want to take the blame for blocking the construction of alternative routes from now independent former Soviet republics, according to Mr Ruseckas. Turkey, which currently buys gas from Russia, has in the past favoured a pipeline linking it to Turkmenistan via Azerbaijan. President Niyazov signed a deal with Turkey and a consortium led by Enron, the US engineering group, to consider the best route for a pipeline. But the deal, signed in November 1992 during a summit of Turkic states in Ankara, has come to nothing. The accord envisaged a feasibility study of six possible routes, including proposals to take the gas under the Caspian Sea from Turkmenistan's Sovyetabad fields to Azerbaijan. The main alternative was through Iran to Turkey, where it would link with Turkey's own gas network to Europe. The consortium included the local Gama group and Botas, Turkey's state pipeline company. However, the deal, along with much of the enthusiasm felt by the Turks towards business opportunities in central Asia, has since evaporated. One of the consortium partners said yesterday the negotiations with the Turkmens had long since been called off. The geography of the route agreed this week is such that it 'does make sense in a perfect world,' said Mr Ruseckas. Finding an alternative to its present export arrangement is a priority for Turkmenistan, which last year accounted for about 3 per cent of the total world gas production. Under the old Soviet system the country's gas went mainly to Ukraine, Georgia and Azerbaijan, which since the break-up of the Soviet Union have made only irregular payments. Debts owed to Turkmenistan are thought to be about Dollars 1.4bn. Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly and large-scale exporter to western Europe, makes an annual hard currency payment to Turkmenistan for gas which enters the general Gazprom system. But Russia's desire to expand greatly its own exports to western Europe means that it is unlikely to accept bigger volumes from Turkmenistan that could undercut its own export potential. Tehran Radio said a number of meetings were due to be held over the next few months to deal in detail with difficult issues such as pipeline tariffs. But it may be some years before another hole is dug.</p>

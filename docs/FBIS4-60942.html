			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks on ways of settling the Karabakh conflict  between the Karabakh leaders and the CSCE's Minsk group, led by  Swedish diplomat Matias Mosberg, ended in Stepanakert on  Saturday.    The Karabakh Foreign Ministry's press service informed  Interfax that the main accent was put on mechanisms of excluding  combat operations. To quote a representative of the press  service, the delegation members stated that they would be able  to place their observers three days after the conclusion of a  long-term cease-fire agreement between the conflicting parties.    The negotiating parties also agreed not to adopt documents  unconfirmed by real mechanisms of ruling out combat operations,  and emphasized the importance of dovetailing the peace efforts  of the CSCE and Russia. They also noted that certain steps had  been made in this direction.    On the same day, CSCE military experts and the Karabakh  commanders discussed military-technical problems pertaining to  the location of observers in the zone of combat operations.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Arts: Sleeping Beauty - Theatre A good pantomine, like a good Christmas dinner, is a tricky thing to pull off. First you have your list of ingredients: good dame, hissable baddie, plenty of slapstick, running gags, a songsheet, a chase sequence, a fight, songs, plenty of glitter, a sprinkling of topicality, a pinch of blue (optional) and a pinch of camp (not optional), and those little plums that have to pop out - 'he's behind you', 'oh yes you will'. Then you must mix your ingredients well, in the certain knowledge that if one thing is missing, it will be the one thing that everybody notices. Even then, when everything is compiled, it might not work out: a little overcooked, a little undercooked, and the whole thing misfires. The Theatre Royal, Stratford East usually serves up an excellent panto. Sad to relate, then, that The Sleeping Beauty, this year's offering, seems rather underdone. Most of the ingredients are there, and David Cregan's script treads that difficult line between providing a proper story for the children and working in the traditional pantomine elements. The audience participation is beautifully managed in Philip Hedley's production; there is some nice topicality - the King and Queen are 1990s parents ('but what will people say if I don't bring her up myself,' wails the Queen, as a nanny is hired for the baby Beauty) - and the show is governed by an enjoyable dame in the shape of Michael Bertenshaw as a stout, stern, hatchet-faced nursemaid. But the struggle between good and evil is underplayed: the trio of fairy godmothers is not very funny and the evil fairy appears too seldom to get the hissing up to full steam. The characterisation is a bit vague: the Queen and the King are both silly ninnies, while the Archbishop and Crispin, Princess Rose's little playmate, have no characters at all to speak of. The songs are rather wishy-washy - with the exception of 'Don't Be Brave', an excellent little number rubbishing fairytale heroics - and there are a couple of scenes that should have been left off the list of ingredients altogether: a dream sequence and an overlong preamble for the second act. Take those away, add a bit more spice, slapstick and sheer sillyness, and the show might reach its comic potential. We all know where the proof of the pudding lies, of course, and, to be fair, the children in the audience enjoyed it. But I departed feeling rather undernourished; frustrating, since this is a theatre that you so often leave fascinated, with your sides aching from over-indulgence. At Theatre Royal, Stratford East to January 28 (081-534-0310).</p>

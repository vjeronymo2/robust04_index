			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Uphill steps towards consensus: An initiative to encourage compromise over the political future of Ulster TENTATIVE steps in search of a settlement in Northern Ireland were taken this week, not in the stately setting of Stormont or Dublin Castle, but in a rundown Belfast arts centre across the road from an office block that was bombed last year. An independent commission of inquiry chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international human rights lawyer, and made up of academics and former civil servants ranging from Mr Eamonn Gallagher, a former EC commissioner, to Lady Faulkner, the widow of the last Stormont prime minister, has held public hearings of a broad section of local opinion. The commission, funded by charities including the Joseph Rowntree Trust, is the idea of Initiative '92, a non-political group led by Mr Robin Wilson, a local journalist, and Professor Simon Lee, a law professor at Queen's University, Belfast. It arose out of frustration over the continuing absence of an agreement between the political parties and the persistent campaign of terrorist violence. Mr Wilson says it 'offers the best chance for an opening in the political logjam here'. Its aim is to encourage a climate of debate and tolerance while focusing people's minds on possible compromises. By early summer it intends to have distilled the mass of written and oral evidence it has received into proposals which might win popular acceptance. Unionist party leaders have accused the commission of setting out to undermine the political process, and have boycotted it. One leading Unionist called it an 'exercise by an upper-middle-class group of people who have played no active part in politics'. But Unionist councillors and other representatives of the Protestant community have taken part, and its apparent desire to make a constructive contribution has secured at least moral support for its endeavours from both London and Dublin. 'We are trying to bypass the otherwise insuperable barrier of waiting for a voluntary inter-party agreement. Proposals from the commission could catch the popular mind and provide something for the government to run with,' says Mr Wilson. The commission has got off to an encouraging start. Yesterday Lady Faulkner  -who seven years ago was a member of the BBC board of governors which blocked the screening of a documentary on terrorism - sat patiently listening to Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, which is banned from talks with the government. Lady Faulkner said before hearing Mr McLaughlin: 'If we are to produce something forward-looking, we can't have axes to grind. I feel that what we are seeing is a more realistic approach to the situation from both Protestant and Catholic communities than existed before.' Mr McLaughlin was only one of hundreds of individuals and organisations participating in the commission's proceedings. Some demonstrated a degree of tolerance which would have been unthinkable during the worst years of the troubles. Thus on Monday a Presbyterian moderator stood side-by-side with a community worker from the nationalist Falls Road area of Belfast whose son had been murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries and stated: 'We must work with models of co-operation and not of domination or assimilation.' Earlier Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, the former head of the Northern Ireland civil service, said he had detected less 'exclusiveness' among ordinary people. 'I think the situation is ripe to move forward.' Beyond good intentions, the commission faces an uphill struggle to draw up an agenda which might be of use to the politicians. The commissioners say the submissions display widespread disillusionment and apathy, while providing little sense of what alternative forms of government and constitutional changes may be needed. Where the submissions have been more illuminating is in identifying specific 'second-tier' policy measures which might create a better climate for future talks to succeed. There appears to be consensus in both communities on issues such as the need for a bill of rights, better integrated housing and education and more outside investment. Ms Marie Fitzduff, director of the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council, says the consensus reflects growing practical co-operation across the religious divide at grassroots level. And yet, as the 'revenge' shooting of a Catholic woman in Belfast this week showed, it will take more than the commission's efforts to appease the men of violence.</p>

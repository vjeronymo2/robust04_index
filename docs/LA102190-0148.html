			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURORS ACQUIT 2 LIVE CREW IN OBSCENITY CASE  </P> <P> Without a serious disagreement among them, six jurors took only about two hours  Saturday to eat lunch and then find three members of the rap group 2 Live Crew  not guilty of violating obscenity laws in a nightclub concert performance.  </P> <P> The verdict caused an eruption of cheers from fans of the Miami-based singers  who packed the courtroom, and dealt a defeat to local Sheriff Nick Navarro's  efforts to prosecute the group, whose best-selling album had been declared  obscene by a federal court judge only four days before the concert.  </P> <P> "Our first and strongest impression was that this is political," said juror  Helena Bailie, 76, a retired sociology professor. "They were thumbing their  noses back (at Broward County and Navarro)."  </P> <P> At issue was a June 10 concert at a Hollywood, Fla., nightclub during which the  group performed four songs from the album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." The  songs contain crude and graphic sexual language.  </P> <P> Had they been convicted, 2 Live Crew leader Luther (Luke) Campbell and group  members Mark Ross and Christopher Wongwon could have each faced penalties of up  to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> Campbell jumped to his feet, raised his right arm and smiled when the verdicts  were read. "We did overcome," he said later.  </P> <P> Asked if the jury found the words offensive, Beverly Resnick, 65, said: "We  found many things humorous. We looked at this as a comedy."  </P> <P> The case was being closely watched as a test of 1st Amendment rights,  especially by the music industry and performers.  </P> <P> Bruce Rogow, attorney for Campbell, said: "The message here is that the state  ought to spend its money on real criminal matters. This was a farce. It was fun  for me, trying this for Luther. But, from the state's point of view it's  unconscionable."  </P> <P> Assistant State Atty. Pedro Dijols said that although "we would like to have  won, our lives are going to continue."  </P> <P> He admitted that the state's evidence against the group, two microcassette  recordings of a concert made by undercover vice squad detectives in the Club  Futura, were of poor quality, and that the detectives who attempted to  interpret the tapes for the jury often seemed "stage struck -- they were not  relaxed."  </P> <P> In fact, the noisy tapes of the concert, on which the lyrics and shouts of both  the performers and the audience are heard, were often unintelligible.  </P> <P> What was immediately clear to jurors, however, was that the concert was not  obscene, said David Garsow, 24, one of two men on the jury. "Everyday people  use those words," he said. "Maybe people ought to take a look at the obscenity  law."  </P> <P> Juror Susan Van Hemert, 42, a guidance counselor in the local public school  system, commented on 2 Live Crew's music: "It's certainly not something I want  to see in the malls, or out in the open. But in a 21-year-old club, sure." She  added she did not find the lyrics offensive to women, since "I took the whole  thing as comedy."  </P> <P> Campbell's attorney, Rogow, said that although 1st Amendment issues were  central to his defense, several weeks ago he was unsuccessful in defending a  local record store owner against charges of obscenity in selling the "Nasty"  album. He added that "none of these cases are groundbreaking. That's the  futility of these cases. None of this sets any precedent."  </P> <P> Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the  organization that represents the nation's major record companies, said the  verdict offers small comfort to the music industry.  </P> <P> "Winning this particular case will do little to derail those trying to reap  political benefit off the current anti-free-expression atmosphere," Berman said  by telephone from his Washington office. "We're all glad 2 Live Crew won, but  no one in the business has any illusions that the war is over. We have to keep  fighting."  </P> <P> Carl Freed, executive director of the North American Concert Promoters Assn.,  applauded the verdict as a victory for free speech.  </P> <P> "The decision eases some of the tensions for promoters who produce live  concerts by controversial acts," Freed said in a phone interview from New York.  "Even if we, as concert promoters, do not approve of the material Mr. Campbell  performs, we believe the government has no business deciding what adults can or  cannot listen to."  </P> <P> Jack Thompson, the Coral Gables, Fla., anti-obscenity crusader who initiated  the national campaign against 2 Live Crew's "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album  last January, blamed weak prosecution for the trial's outcome.  </P> <P> "This verdict in no way diminishes the fact that Luther Campbell is guilty of  distributing more than 2 million obscene albums and deserves to go to jail,"  Thompson said Saturday night. "All this ruling does is send a message to law  enforcement agencies around the country that they must secure better evidence  and build stronger cases if they truly want to make a dent in stopping  obscenity."  </P> <P> Leanne Katz, executive director of the New York-based National Coalition  Against Censorship, cautioned against celebration.  </P> <P> "This verdict only serves to prove that no speaker, artist or retailer can have  any idea in advance what will or will not be considered obscene," Katz said by  phone from New York. "Luther Campbell's rights are every American's rights.  Throughout history censorship has always had one serious side effect: more  censorship."  </P> <P> In his closing argument Saturday, Dijols told the jury: "Rap music is not on  trial. Rap music is a viable form of entertainment. Some of us like rap music.  I like rap music.  </P> <P> "But these three men know exactly what they were doing that night. How can you  say it's not offensive when you hear things like this?"  </P> <P> As he and fellow prosecutor Leslie Robson have throughout the trial, Dijols  then repeated the lyrics to several songs from the album that contain frequent  references to explicit anal and oral sex.  </P> <P> "It's common sense, ladies and gentlemen," said Dijols. "It's openly  offensive."  </P> <P> For the defense, Rogow told the jury: "The 1st Amendment does protect speech,  even nasty speech. Of all the things in this world, sex is the thing all of us  do. But if you don't say it (talk about it) in quite the right way, the state  says you're in big trouble."  </P> <P> Throughout the trial Rogow has argued that the black rap group was being  prosecuted for both racial and political reasons. During the concert Campbell  led the audience in call-and-response curses directed at Sheriff Navarro as  well as Florida Gov. Bob Martinez.  </P> <P> In order to have convicted the three rappers, the state was required to prove  that the performance appealed to prurient interests, was offensive to the  average Broward County resident and lacked serious artistic literary or  political value.  </P> <P> Since the concert included speech directed at Navarro and Martinez, Rogow said:  "This concert was about as political a concert as one could find."  </P> <P> Earlier in the week the defense presented a professor of literature and a music  critic who testified that 2 Live Crew's lyrics, however explicit, were serious  contributions to the world of art. The state contended the songs are, in the  words of Dijols "just plain simple nasty talk -- that's all it was."  </P> <P> "This performance does not represent black culture," said Dijols, who is black.  "It was three men trying to exploit sexual conduct to make a buck."  </P> <P> Staff writer Chuck Philips in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  </P></p>

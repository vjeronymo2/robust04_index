			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MISSING GIRL SPOTTED IN NORTHERN FLORIDA  </P> <P> A segment about the disappearance of 7-year-old Leticia Hernandez on a national  broadcast of "America's Most Wanted" has resulted in a confirmed sighting of  the little girl with her two abductors, police reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> But, because the sighting occurred two days before the Feb. 4 broadcast, the  witness, a gas station attendant, took no action at the time -- another  frustrating twist in a case that has had investigators looking all across the  nation.  </P> <P> The latest sighting of the Oceanside girl was on Feb. 2 at a service station in  Panama City, Fla., off State Highway 98 and was confirmed Monday by FBI agents,  said Bob George, spokesman for the Oceanside Police Department. In addition, he  said, investigators still are checking out several other sightings in the  Panama City area that also were called in as a result of the TV broadcast.  </P> <P> "Everything fits right down the line," George said of the descriptions given by  the gas station attendant. He said that the car also matched one seen at  previous sightings -- a mid-size, faded maroon Buick with a tan interior. The  car is believed to be a 1975 Buick Skylark. Based on the previous sightings,  the license plates may be KK960, KK966 or KR966, or a combination of those  numbers and letters.  </P> <P> The little girl the attendant saw was missing her two front teeth, like  Leticia, George said, but her hair was braided into two pigtails instead of  one, he said. She was wearing a T-shirt with a design printed on the front. He  did not know what kind of design.  </P> <P> Seven-year-old Leticia has been missing from her family's Bush Street apartment  since Dec. 16.  </P> <P> "I don't know what to think," said her mother, also named Leticia Hernandez, of  the latest sighting.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it's her. It's very strange that people see her, and see her,  and see her, and no one stops them," she said. "Some of them (the sightings)  must be false alarms."  </P> <P> But in this case, police said, the man did not realize who the little girl or  the adults were until he saw the television segment two days later.  </P> <P> Since her disappearance, Leticia has been seen mostly at highway rest stops in  California, near the Arizona-New Mexico border and in Texas. The last two  reported sightings were in a shopping center in Mobile, Ala., on Jan. 19 and at  a convenience store in Durango, Colo., on Jan. 23.  </P> <P> The Colorado sighting was the only one that failed to fit into a pattern of  eastward travel through the southern United States. But Bill Krunglevich,  spokesman for the Oceanside Police Department, said police are not discounting  the validity of the Colorado sighting.  </P> <P> "Based on the information we had at the time, we have nothing to dispute, (the  Durango sighting)," he said.  </P> <P> "We could conjecture that they drove from Colorado to Florida. . . . It's not  an astronomical distance," he said. "What they've been doing hasn't made any  sense. They've been dropping in and out of sight since she disappeared."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, after law enforcement work was moved for the most part to the  Colorado area, the efforts now are being concentrated in the northern Florida  and southern Georgia area, Krunglevich said.  </P> <P> "We are still behind the people by about two weeks," he said. "We're hoping to  get fresher leads."  </P> <P> Leticia has been seen with a white man who is between 30 and 35 years old. He  is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs about 230 pounds. He is clean-shaven,  with shoulder-length blond hair that is thinning at the top. The woman is also  white, and may be in her mid-30s. She is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs  about 130 pounds. Her hair is bleached blond and collar-length.  </P> <P> Leticia has brown eyes and brown hair. She is about 4 feet tall and weighs  about 60 pounds.  </P></p>

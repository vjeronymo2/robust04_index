			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Saipem stages first-half profit recovery to L6.2bn SAIPEM, the listed engineering and pipe-laying subsidiary of Italy's state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, has staged a turnround in the first half. Net earnings were L6.2bn (Dollars 4.9m) after minority interests, against losses of L85bn in the same period last year. The improvement marked a gradual recovery from the crisis in the world's off-shore and plant building industry which started in the mid-1980s, said Mr Giovanni dell'Orto, chairman. He predicted Saipem would remain in profit at the end of the year, but indicated it was too soon for dividend payments to be resumed. 'In the first phase, profits should be used to cover past losses', he said. Saimpem's sales have risen almost 22 per cent to L856bn in the six months to July. New orders, particularly for off-shore rigs, have also surged, with the total reaching L1,176bn by end-June, against L938bn at the same time last year. By end-September, Saipem's order backlog reached a record L3,050bn, boosted by the recent contract to develop the South Pars field in Iran, worth almost L1,000bn to the company. Group debt, which remained stable at around L207bn at mid-year compared with last December, had fallen to around L165bn by the end of last month. Italcable, the listed international telecommunications company which is part of Italy's STET state-owned holding company, raised profits before tax and extraordinary items by 5.3 per cent to L143.6bn in the first half of this year, from L136.3bn in the same period in 1991. The increase comes in spite of continuing cuts in tariffs for international calls - Italy's are among Europe's highest. While call traffic jumped by around 25 per cent, group sales rose by just 6.2 per cent to L362bn in the first half from L341bn. Merloni, the Italian white goods group which manufactures under the Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes names, raised interim pre-tax profits by almost 37 per cent to L7bn from L5.1bn in the first half.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: 60p flotation price gives SEC market value of Pounds 9.1m A price of 60p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Securitised Endowment Contracts valuing the trader in second hand with-profits insurance policies at Pounds 9.1m. The capitalisation falls short of the Pounds 10m-plus the company had originally indicated, reflecting a cut to the price earlier envisaged following flat results from Policy Portfolio, SEC's main quoted competitor. None of the three founder directors is selling shares and they will hold 59.4 per cent of the issued share capital after the float. One of them, Mr Bernard Klug, the executive director with responsibility for corporate planning and development, was formerly non-executive director of Honorbilt, which went into administrative receivership in 1990. Dealings in the shares on the USM begin on December 21 following a placing, completed yesterday, of 5.7m shares. Broker to the placing is Williams de Broe, who also underwrote the deal. The flotation price is 10 times SEC's earnings per share for the year ended September 30 (adjusted for a one-off pension contribution). The notional gross dividend yield for the year is 7.3 per cent and the flotation will raise Pounds 3.1m net of expenses. The funds will be used to repay bank debt of about Pounds 965,000 and to finance a substantially larger stock of assigned policies than SEC has to date been capable of holding.</p>

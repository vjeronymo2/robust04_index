			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain work registrants are exempted from E&amp;T participation by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies and are not required to participate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Food stamp recipients may also volunteer to participate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the E&amp;T program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii) require State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to provide payments or reimbursements to participants in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Food Stamp E&amp;T program for certain expenses that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably necessary and directly related to participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E&amp;T program. The Federal government matches half the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies spend to reimburse participants under 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.7(d)(1)(ii)(B) for the actual costs of transportation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other costs (excluding dependent care) that are determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency to be necessary and directly related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the E&amp;T program. Therefore, the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government will pay up to $12.50 of the $25 per month. State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies may supplement this amount, but without Federal matching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies must also provide payments or reimbursements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E&amp;T participants for dependent care expenditures of up to $160  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per dependent per month. The Federal government will pay up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $80 of the $160 per month. A reimbursement cannot be provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a dependent age 13 or older unless the dependent is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for himself or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herself or is under court supervision. The Federal government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not reimburse more than the actual cost of dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses up to $80 per dependent per month, regardless of how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many household members are participating in E&amp;T. Finally, an E&amp;T  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant is not entitled to the reimbursement for dependent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care expenditures if a member of the participant's food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household provides the dependent care services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to Dependent Care Reimbursements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 6(d) of the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Act to remove the $160 cap on dependent care reimbursements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to participants in the E&amp;T program. In place of the cap, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies must reimburse the actual costs of dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses up to a limit set by the State agency. Section 13922  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulates that the statewide limit set by the State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be less than the limit for the dependent care deduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 5(e) of the Act, that is, $200 per month for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent under age 2 and $175 per month for each other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent. In no event may the reimbursement exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable local market rate as determined by procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the JOBS Program. Thus, the State agency must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimburse actual costs for dependent care up to either the local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market rate or the statewide limit set by the State agency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever is lower. The Department will continue to match State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency expenditures for reimbursements at the 50 percent level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An example will help to explain the above provision. Assume that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State agency sets a statewide limit of $250, which is higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the dependent care deduction, on the amount of dependent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care costs it will reimburse. In City A, the local market rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is also $250. Thus, the State agency would reimburse a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participant in the E&amp;T program for actual costs up to $250. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> City B, the local market rate is $225. Even if the actual cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for dependent care is $250, the State agency will only reimburse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the participant for $225, the local market rate, as the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency cannot provide reimbursement payments which exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local market rate. In City C, the local market rate is $275.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State agency would reimburse the participant for $250, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide limit. In any of the scenarios above, if the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of dependent care was less than the statewide limit of $250,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State agency would only reimburse the actual cost of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hence, the State agency must pay the lowest of the actual cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent care, the local market rate, or the statewide limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State agency may supplement this amount, but without Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matching funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons determined by the State agency to have actual monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses that are reasonably necessary and directly related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the E&amp;T program which exceed the allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement amount (i.e., exceed the local market rate) will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be considered by the State agency to have good cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nonparticipation in an E&amp;T component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

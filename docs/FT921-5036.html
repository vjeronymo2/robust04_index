			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Companies face claims on assigned leases MANY COMPANIES will face rent bills for offices they abandoned long ago if they assigned their leases to businesses which later failed, according to Lambert Smith Hampton, the firm of chartered surveyors. It says landlords can claw back rents and costs at current prices from previous lessees, even though many years have elapsed since they assigned the lease. Mr Tom Marshall, who heads Lambert's Manchester operations, says companies in the south-east are in much greater danger because of the surge in rents in the latter half of the 1980s. Typical leases are for 25 years, and most landlords are institutions which base rents on assumptions of yield from nearly continuous tenancy. Mr Marshall cites a company which took a 25-year lease on 12,000 sq ft of offices in central London in 1974 at Pounds 12.50 per sq ft. It assigned this 10 years later to a profitable company which could afford a reviewed rent of Pounds 40, which rose to Pounds 62.50 in 1989. The assignee failed last year so the landlord, an insurance company, sent its rent demand to the original lessee, which was still liable. Lambert said the company could face costs of nearly Pounds 4m, involving two years of being stuck with the offices - with no prospect of letting in the recession and eventually having to let at half-price because the market has fallen. The issue may be complicated by many companies having changed most of their staff, moved several times, changed accountants or lawyers, or having merged or been taken over. Lambert Smith Hampton is starting a centralised storage and retrieval system for leases to identify rental and other liabilities in the event of the failure of the tenant. It points out that a consequence of more companies becoming aware of the problem could be that balance sheets might look less healthy because contingent liabilities would have to be declared and provided for.</p>

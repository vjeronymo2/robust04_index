			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Arrest warrants have been issued against four  alleged members of the Medellin Cartel, who were recently  detained by the National Guard. The arrest warrants were issued  against four alleged perpetrators of drug trafficking based on  Article 33 on the Basic Law on Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  and on Article 83 of the Penal Code. The arrest warrants were  issued via the 48th Court and the First Criminal District of the  Caracas Metropolitan Judicial District, which is headquartered  in Los Cortijo de Lourdes.    Reportedly, this particular branch of the Medellin Cartel is  using this nation as a bridge for drug trafficking to Europe and  North America. Colonel Jairo Casimiro Coronel Figueroa,  National Guard director of efforts against drug trafficking,  identified the detained suspects as Ruben Dario Pelais Munera,  German Perez Zapata, [name indistinct], and Luis Fernando  Martinez. Meanwhile, [words indistinct] Carlos San Vincens  Clavera were released. These last two had been detained for  questioning. It was also learned that these four individuals  will remain at the Judicial Detention Center in Las Flores,  Catia.</p>

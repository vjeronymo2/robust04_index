			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Japanese stores turn in sharp falls JAPAN's department stores saw profits fall sharply last year as business conditions turned sour following a period of rapid expansion that left companies saddled with high depreciation expenses. Supermarket chains none the less reported rising sales and profits as foodstuffs remained one of the few areas of consumer spending unaffected by the downturn in the economy. Mitsukoshi, Japan's largest department store group, said pre-tax profits fell by 43.1 per cent to Y10.99bn (Dollars 81.7m) in the year to the end of February. Sales rose by a sluggish 1.1 per cent to Y876.6bn as consumers reduced purchases of luxury items. Mitsukoshi blamed the profit decline on a rise in capital investment, and said that capital spending in the current fiscal year would be Y25bn below last year's Y68.3bn. After-tax earnings were down by 38.3 per cent to Y5.0bn, and the company said net earnings were expected to decline by another 25 per cent in the current year. Takashimaya said its pre-tax profits fell by 34.8 per cent to Y13.35bn, while sales rose by 9.8 per cent to Y839.8bn. Management costs and the cost of sales both rose, while financing costs increased. The company reported a 73.9 per cent plunge in after-tax profits to Y5.1bn and predicted that another difficult year lay ahead. Matsuzakaya said pre-tax profits fell by 30.2 per cent to Y10.02m in the year to the end of February, the first decline in eight years. Although sales rose by 7.6 per cent to Y501.96m, depreciation costs doubled to Y8.6bn. After-tax profits were off by 73.3 per cent to Y4,027m. Pre-tax profits at Daimaru were off by 39.4 per cent to Y6.07bn as a result of the higher cost of sales and rising interest payments. Sales were up marginally to Y608.3bn as clothing and art sales were hit. Net profits were boosted by an extraordinary gain of Y1.1bn in land sales, but were still down by 9.7 per cent to Y3.19bn. In the supermarket sector, Daiei, which boasts the largest sales, enjoyed a rise in pre-tax profits of 3.3 per cent to Y27.54bn. Sales rose by 10 per cent to Y2,025.9bn, boosted in part by Daiei's takeover of its affiliate in Hokkaido. After tax, profits rose from Y8.9bn to 9.3bn, and Daiei said profits would continue to rise this year, in part because of its recently established ties with Chujitsuya, a supermarket company active in the Tokyo area. Ito-Yokado, which controls the Seven-Eleven chain, reported a 9.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y97.1bn. Sales were up by 7.7 per cent to Y1,459.6bn. After-tax profits were up by 21.8 per cent to Y53.7bn.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Thames Water to lead Dollars 700m Turkish project A CONSORTIUM led by Thames Water has won one of the largest overseas water resources projects to be awarded to a UK water company since privatisation in 1989. Thames and its Turkish and Japanese partners are expected shortly to sign the implementation agreement for a Dollars 700m (Pounds 488m) construction project at Izmit, north-west of Istanbul. Under the build, operate and transfer (BOT) scheme, Thames will manage the water supply system for 15 years. Mr David Luffrum, group finance director, said the contract was 'ideal' for Thames, which has been building up its consultancy and contracting business under its subsidiary PWT Worldwide. 'It's the first BOT water project in Turkey and a one-off at this stage, but there could be further opportunities.' Several UK water companies have looked at overseas projects since privatisation, partly to earn non-regulated profits and develop businesses outside their core. Thames has already won several smaller projects in Europe, while North West Water is involved in consortia with design and management contracts in Malaysia and Australia. The Turkish project includes completion of the Yuvacik dam, where work was halted five years ago after cash shortages. The dam will be linked with two pumping stations and more than 100km of trunk mains. Most of the water supplied will be used in Izmit with the remainder being pumped to Istanbul. Construction will be undertaken by PWT, which has contracts worth about Dollars 290m, and two Turkish construction companies, Gama Endustri Tesisleri Imalat ve Montaj and Guris Insaat ve Muhendislik. The consortium shareholders include: Izmit Municipality (30 per cent), Thames (25 per cent), Gama and Guris (25 per cent), Mitsui and Sumitomo of Japan (10 per cent) and others (10 per cent). The consortium will provide about Dollars 115m in equity, with the remainder due from export credits and commercial banks. The project plan assumes operations will begin in 1997. Mr Luffrum said Thames started discussions with the Turkish side in 1990. 'It's higher risk and higher reward than the utility business, but it is what Thames is set up for,' he said.</p>

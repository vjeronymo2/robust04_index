			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ejup Ganic, vice chairman of the Federation </F> of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by S. Lovrenovic; place and date not  given: "The Federation Is `Stalingrad' for a Greater Serbia"]    [Text] It was difficult to reach Mr. Ejup Ganic after  his election, although he wanted to keep his promise and give an  interview for VECERNJI LIST, a promise he gave before the  election. He found the time for this interview after the session  of the general assembly and before the beginning of a new round  of Geneva negotiations.    [Lovrenovic] What are your first impressions as the vice  chairman of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are your  first tasks and duties?    [Ganic] There is a lot of work, but there is much enthusiasm  and cooperation, too. Our work is very responsible. I think  that we are at a turning point in history now. This is a  special moment, and we must not miss this chance.  <H5>  Cooperation With Zubak </H5>   [Lovrenovic] You have been elected together with Mr. Zubak.  What is the cooperation between the president and the vice  president immediately after the election like?    [Ganic] The cooperation is functioning quite normally. We  met in Sarajevo a month ago, but we could talk for only 10  minutes. Then we worked together during the Vienna negotiations  for three or four days. Our cooperation was very intense there.  We both participated in the talks that took place in France,  too. This is normal since we are both working on the same  tasks. I can say that our contacts have always been  professional, we have always reached agreement on things that  had to be agreed upon. We have similar methods of work, so that  I hope that we shall be able to achieve results in the interests  of both the Muslim and the Croatian population in the Federation  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, naturally, to the benefit of the  whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Lovrenovic] There were no problems with the election, but  have you perhaps noticed a certain resistance toward the  Federation?    [Ganic] There is a long and very steep path before us. It  will be difficult, but the agreement on the Federation is very  important, so that certain groups of people or individuals who  oppose it should be given no powers whatsoever to thwart this  historic process. I would like to repeat that the Federation is  "Stalingrad" for a greater Serbia.  <H5>  Serbian Annexation Policy Stopped </H5>   [Lovrenovic] Why do you think that this will be a turning  point in the relations with the Serbs?    [Ganic] This is a concept that will enable Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are internationally recognized, to  retain their borders. It will also stop the Serbian annexation  policy. This is something that has repeated itself every 20  years in the Balkans. Territories and properties have been  seized little by little, but we shall bring an end to this  policy. Apart from that, we would like to find a formula for a  new military balance. The Federation is opening new  possibilities for both Bosnia and Croatia. We are not  conspiring against anybody, this is only a healthy and logical  concept since both nations have a tendency toward the Western  type of democracy. They have their historical roots in this  area, they are close to the Western civilization character.    [Lovrenovic] Does this mean that you support a confederation  with Croatia? After you become the president of the Federation,  according to the rotation principle, will you try to bring this  concept into existence?    [Ganic] Bosnia has always supported a confederation with  Croatia. Croatia will more or less determine the scope of the  confederation agreement. It has the sea, we have electrical  energy, they have more food. There is compatibility between our  economies and communications. We have similar friends in the  world. There is much logic behind this. We are not doing  anything behind anybody's back. Our cooperation is the result  of democratic processes that are going on in Europe, or rather  of the integration of economic interests. We shall try to unite  our interests with the Croatian.    [Lovrenovic] There were rumors in Sarajevo during the  session of the assembly that the Washington agreements were  opposed by the ruling party, the SDA [Party of Democratic  Action], which is also your party.    [Ganic] There was no resistance to these agreements. People  just asked certain questions. The Federation is the best  possibility of saving Bosnia-Herzegovina as an entity. We hope  to see its revival in every part of our territory. We do not  want to change its borders and we want to reduce those Serbs who  are not loyal to the limits they are entitled to. In other  words there were only questions about what, how, where, how  much, who supported it etc., but there was no resistance. Our  party [SDA] is not homogeneous, there are groups and individuals  who always ask questions and have contradictory opinions.  <H5>  Rotation Every Six Months </H5>   [Lovrenovic] Some time ago the SDA proposed that Mr.  Izetbegovic should be the president of the Federation, but this  proposal was withdrawn later on and you were subsequently  proposed for that function. Is this true?    [Ganic] The SDA Executive Committee made that proposal  without having consulted Mr. Izetbegovic. In the negotiations  with Croatia we discussed all issues, though. Borders, cantons,  the government, as well as the functions of the president and  the vice president. During the negotiations Mr. Izetbegovic  himself proposed making the concession to the Croatian people to  appoint a Croatian national as first president of the  Federation, although we have a larger population. The proposal  that I should run for the position of vice chairman came later  on. Mr. Izetbegovic made these proposals because is the party  leader. Apart from that, by appointing me vice president of the  Federation, he distributed the burden of responsibility to two  persons.    Later on we agreed on the six-month rotation principle. The  most important thing, however, is that the Parliament, the  government, the president and the vice chairman cooperate. I  think that this is a good solution. The fact that the first  Federation president is Croatian is important, too.    [Lovrenovic] Will you automatically become president in six  months, or...?    [Ganic] According to the Vienna agreement there should  automatically be a change after six months. I am not insisting  on my election to the position of the president of the  Federation. It is more important that we complete everything we  started in these six months, the elections and peace  negotiations; then we can elect a new president, too.  <H5>  Izetbegovic's Deputy </H5>   [Lovrenovic] Are you a member of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] I had, more or less, the function of Mr.  Izetbegovic's deputy during his journeys. It will be a useful  experience for the work as the Federation vice president. I  would like to point out that the Federation is a special task.  We have to organize the life in its Muslim part. Our most  important task is to make official authorities more efficient  and to establish traffic communications and economic relations.  Apart from that, we have to finally close the ditches between  the Croatian Defense Council and the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We should enable our people to return to their homes. The  Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina represents the internationally  recognized state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I do not see any  problems here.    [Lovrenovic] Is it not difficult to accept two presidencies,  two parliaments, and two governments?    [Ganic] These are not two states, though. The whole state  belongs to us, only certain parts of it are occupied. The task  of the Parliament, the president and the vice president will be  to make the Federation function. In the process of personnel  structure and diplomatic network development it will be  important that the Federation starts functioning as soon as  possible. We must send those people into the diplomatic service  who will be able to make the biggest contribution to the  development of our Federation. The more powerful the Federation  is, the more powerful will be our capacity to defend ourselves.  I think that we shall have to agree on the distribution of  ambassadors' posts.  <H5>  Appointment of Ambassadors </H5>   [Lovrenovic] Can you give me an example of who will be  appointed ambassador to Great Britain and France? Will you and  Mr. Zubak appoint these people, or the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] As long as we are in a state of war, the state has  to be represented by the Presidency, but Mr. Zubak and I shall  make proposals about who should be appointed ambassador.    [Lovrenovic] Does this mean that the foreign policy will  remain within the scope of work of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] Yes, but this is because the Presidency is an  internationally recognized subject. Mr. Zubak and I shall  certainly have to agree on where a representative of the  Croatian people will be posted.    [Lovrenovic] This means that the Federation is not a legal  subject according to international law and that it cannot have  diplomatic and consular representatives.    [Ganic] It is not a legal subject according to international  law. Neither does it have its representatives. Its  representatives are the representatives of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is an internationally recognized state.    [Lovrenovic] You do not believe in a new Yugoslav state, but  you have invited the Serbs to stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Does  this mean that you believe in their coexistence in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] Yes. We have invited them to stay so that they can  learn to respect human rights.  <H5>  Will the Serbs Stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina? </H5>   [Lovrenovic] Do you really think they will stay in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] We shall not allow the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina  to change. We shall not interfere with the Serbian policy in  those regions where they have a majority, but we shall oppose a  greater Serbia. We shall oppose the annexation of our  territory, too. They cannot create a greater Serbia unless they  seize the territory in which the Muslims and the Croats are the  major population.    [Lovrenovic] You invited the Serbs to join the federation  before the election....    [Ganic] I would like to point out that I have never done  anything against Serbia. I have always had fair relations  toward the Serbs and have helped those Serbs who have supported  Bosnia. From the session of the parliament during the election I  sent a political message to the Serbs.    [Lovrenovic] Do you believe that the Federation will soon  start functioning in the full meaning of that word?    [Ganic] I do, otherwise I would not have started working on  that project. I usually refuse projects that cannot be  implemented since I am very analytical. I make my decisions  based on my personal attitude and relevant political  circumstances, I never get involved in matters that have no  chance.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  No "Common Apartment" </H5>   [Lovrenovic] Will "the mixed cantons," that were agreed on  in Vienna, make the Federation stronger, or will they become a  "powder keg?"    [Ganic] I think they will make the Federation stronger.  There is no reason why they should become a "powder keg."    [Lovrenovic] Will they not be like a "common apartment?"    [Ganic] There is no "common apartment" here. We shall have  common roads, rivers, electric power plants, but our estates  will be divided.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  I Was the First To Go to Ravno </H5>   [Lovrenovic] You have given several interviews so far, one  of which -- the one published in GLOBUS -- was interpreted as  anti-Croatian.    [Ganic] Some papers are full of fantasy. You should follow  my attitudes, my publications, my statements for CNN and other  television stations. You should forget compiled interviews I  have never given to anybody.    [Lovrenovic] Have you given an interview to Mr. Brljevic  from GLOBUS?    [Ganic] I gave him an interview some time ago, but he made  several interviews later on, without having interviewed me. He  made compilations and invented things. GLOBUS tends to invent  certain things. I am a serious politician, though. I have  presented my political attitudes in the 60 articles I have  published so far, so that it can be proved that I have been  making a consistent policy toward the Croatian people since the  very beginning. I hope that you can remember that I was the  first one to go to Ravno. I have visited the whole of  Herzegovina and said what was good and what was bad there. I  have been very consistent. The interview in GLOBUS was a cheap  campaign against me without argument.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Sandzak Is a Part of Bosnia </H5>   [Lovrenovic] You were reproached for having declared  yourself a Yugoslav before, alluding to your birthplace.    [Ganic] Everybody is born somewhere. Apart from that,  Sandzak is a part of Bosnia. The first amputation made at the  Berlin Congress harmed Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the Muslims  remained there. I am a Muslim to the same extent as someone who  was born in Sarajevo. My birthplace is completely irrelevant in  this context. On the other hand, I have to say that the Muslims  were very loyal to the former Yugoslavia. We even tried to save  that state, but since Milosevic wanted to create a greater  Serbia, our love disappeared. I had a pro-Yugoslav orientation  during the time Yugoslavia existed, I supported a democratic  Yugoslavia, like many other Muslims, but I could not support a  "Serboslavia." What is more, I opposed that kind of Yugoslavia.  I was the first to write articles about the intentions of the  Yugoslav People's Army, which caused political discussions.    [Lovrenovic] Would you support a democratic Yugoslavia today  -- an option offered by certain Western circles?    [Ganic] I do not think that Serbia could adapt to it. The  change was too big. Even the opposition in Serbia uses  nationalism as the only political platform. I think that it is  an illusion to speak about a new Yugoslavia.</p>

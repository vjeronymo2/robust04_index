			<p>BFN     [Text] Bernard Sansaricq, president of the branch of the  Senate controlled by the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion,  has called on Haitian authorities to guarantee the safety of  foreign nationals living on Haitian territory to avoid any  pretext for military intervention by the international  community. Sansaricq has asserted that the Senate will take all  necessary measures to manage the situation.    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Sansaricq] Personally, I  guarantee the international community that the Senate of the  Republic will do its best to protect the safety and lives  [pauses] so no attacks are perpetrated against foreigners in  Haiti because what they want to show is that we are a band of  wild people who cannot lead our country.    [Unidentified journalist] So you think that the  international  community has put economic diplomatic pressure on us, but that  the threat of military intervention is not certain, contrary to  what is being said?    [Sansaricq] There is no reason to invade Haiti because we  are  a peaceful country. If President Clinton takes upon himself the  responsibility for putting a half-crazy man back in power -- a  pro-Libyan, pro-Castroist, a man who could have established  democracy in Haiti but did not -- I think President Clinton will  regret it because he will have many problems, not in Haiti, but  in the United States, with his own people, 65 percent of whom  tell him no, do not enter Haiti.    We will do our best to manage the situation. If the  intervention comes, we can do nothing about that. We will manage  it the way it comes. We can do nothing about it, but we always  [pauses] we would not like our country to be invaded. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (5): School that is not in anyone's pocket - Profile, Ashridge Management College AT MANY British business schools it would have been an insult until recently to suggest the institution was 'close to the market', or that the academics had 'dirty hands' because they involved themselves closely with 'real world' issues. Not so at Ashridge. 'We think it's great; we are in the business of getting our hands dirty,' says Mr Peter Beddowes, Dean of Ashridge Management College. Indeed, Ashridge has long prided itself on being both relevant and accessible to business, rather than irrelevant and remote. Mr Michael Osbaldeston, chief executive of the management development centre and business school based at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, explains: 'We are driven by learning objectives rather than education objectives.' Accordingly, Ashridge has always tailored both its courses and other activities to business requirements. It was among the first business schools to recognise the need to become more customer-focused and to ensure that executive programmes matched business needs, something many of its competitors are now imitating. 'It is extremely important that we recognise there is a market we serve, and also that we anticipate market requirements,' says Mr Osbaldeston. Nevertheless, he accepts that it is important to maintain a balance, and to avoid the danger of becoming simply a commercial training organisation. So far, Ashridge appears to have succeeded in striking the right balance. It is one of the most highly regarded business schools in the UK, particularly for its teaching, and is also becoming well-known overseas. In maintaining the balance between academic and market considerations, Ashridge is fortunate in a number of ways. As an educational trust, set up by an act of parliament, it is independent and does not have to answer to a parental organisation like many business schools attached to universities. And as Mr Osbaldeston proudly points out, it is also financially independent. 'We are able to run ourselves as a business, and we can say no, we are not in anyone's pocket,' he says. Mr Osbaldeston talks about being in partnership with the companies which are its primary clients. He sees partnerships as an alternative to the traditional client/supplier relationship. This concept of a partnership between Ashridge and its clients has other important benefits. It helps bind the clients to Ashridge and enables it actively to market the full range of its services while also providing much of the raw material for research projects. Both Mr Osbaldeston and his predecessor, Mr Philip Sadler who retired two years ago, have followed a strategy at Ashridge of offering a steadily broadening range of services, including consulting and research as well as training, to the business school's clients, in response to market requirements. In the early years in the 1960s Ashridge mainly offered open courses for managers which were marketed domestically and to the old Commonwealth nations, particularly those in south-east Asia. But in the 1970s Ashridge offered tailor-made management training programmes for companies, courses 'set up by industry to serve industry and not by academics,' says Mr Osbaldeston. By the late 1970s and early 1980s it had grown to a position of dominance in this field and tailor-made training programmes for companies now make up about 40 per cent of its total course offerings. Following a Europe-wide survey to identify specific and future management development trends, Ashridge undertook a comprehensive overhaul of its short courses which are now divided into seven multi-disciplinary themes to reflect business realities rather than traditional subject categories. 'Managers wanted to be active participants in the courses rather than just recipients,' says Mr Beddowes. At the same time, companies were demanding more value for money from executive education. Mr Beddowes says: 'Managers attending our redesigned open programmes will find that within the broad structure, there is enough flexibility for them to shape the programme to their particular learning needs. 'This approach enables them to benefit from the interaction with peers from other companies, and at the same time pursue a path of learning that fulfils their personal requirements.' However in recognition that some clients require a qualification, Ashridge introduced its own one-year Masters of Business Administration programme in 1987 - a qualification which is validated by City University and is aimed squarely at providing those with management experience, and in particular management 'high fliers', with accelerated leadership development. The MBA programme is small - there will be 30 people on it next year - and very expensive. For this reason, almost all the students are sponsored by their employers. As part of the course, the students undertake a 'live' strategic project on behalf of their employer or an adopted 'host company,' again ensuring that the MBA course does not become remote or irrelevant. Last year Ashridge published a survey of its MBA alumni entitled rather extravagantly: 'Exploding the MBA Myth,' which showed that graduates of its year-long MBA course, launched in 1988, were highly satisfied with their qualification. Ashridge is currently considering whether to offer a part-time MBA programme. Since the early 1980s, Ashridge has also sought to present itself as an organisation that offers more than just the standard open or tailored one or four-week training course or MBA programme. Today Ashridge's activities include: Ashridge Management College. Established in 1959, this offers what Ashridge is best known for, the short duration courses, both external and internal, and the MBA programme. Altogether Ashridge runs more than 5,000 courses a year. Ashridge Consulting Group. Formed in 1985 in response to market pressure for advice, ACG is a profit-making organisation with Pounds 1.75m income last year. Ashridge Strategic Management Centre is a London-based applied research and consulting group established in 1987 and run by Mr Michael Goold and Mr Andrew Campbell, formerly of the London Business School. Ashridge Management Research Group. This used to be the research division of the college and was hived-off two years ago as a separate entity. It conducts research projects and surveys for companies, governmental bodies and work commissioned by the management college. The Independent Assessment and Research Centre. This London-based unit was acquired three years ago and is a specialist in psychometric testing. It offers courses for human resources managers and provides occupational psychology consulting services. The sixth and most recent addition to this 'portfolio' of services is the Ashridge International Institute for Organisational Change (IOC) which is being established in France. Ms Ariane Berthoin Antal became the institute's first director at the start of this month. Aside from emphasising Ashridge's commitment to internationalisation, the IOC is seen by Mr Osbaldeston as a 'experimental centre' which will conduct research into all human aspects of implementing change across national boundaries. It will also hold workshops and conferences on change management as well as providing consultancy services in this field to companies. If it is successful, Mr Osbaldeston says it could become 'a model for how a management centre of the future might operate.' Through these units Mr Osbaldeston is attempting to position Ashridge as a multi-disciplinary organisation able to meet the needs of companies for management training, research and consultancy services. He believes the future lies in a more integrated approach towards management and organisational development. One example of this approach is a post-course consultancy service that Ashridge offers to help managers implement what they have learned. Participants on the college's Leadership Development programme leave with a confidential tape recording of their final assessment to which they can later refer and, 12 months after completing the programme, they receive a questionnaire to review their progress. 'We pride ourselves on our ability to meet market needs, and we redesign our programmes to take account of the growing demand for courses which develop understanding, skills and competences,' says Mr Beddowes.</p>

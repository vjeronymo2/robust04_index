			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Haikuan (6392 3189 1401): "Transforming </F> State Banks Into Commercial Banks"]    [Text] True to the spirit of the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC  National Congress, the goal of future financial reform in China  is to establish a financial system that can operate smoothly in  a socialist market economy. In such a financial system, every  financial institution is internally driven to succeed, to  reform, and to forge ahead. Externally, financial institutions  are under enormous competitive pressure from other institutions  to go forward. There is also a macroeconomic regulatory and  control mechanism that both serves as an effective restraint and  spurs microeconomic activities.    To achieve the above-stated goal as soon as possible, we  must  decide carefully what to do in hopes of making a breakthrough.  The 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee has done just  that for us and it is to further regularize the functions and  systems of the central bank, establish a policy-oriented bank,  and gradually transform existing large state banks into  commercial banks after turning over the policy-based business to  the policy-oriented bank. The core issue here is the  commercialization of large state banks. It is a major part of  the deepening of financial reform in China in the days ahead.  <H5>  What Are Commercial Banks? </H5>   A commercial bank is a financial enterprise that buys and  sells the right to use funds like a commodity, pursues profit as  its principal objective, exercises decision-making authority in  its operations, is accountable for its profits and losses,  assumes risk on its own, and has a self-discipline mechanism.    It is the thrust of reform to turn all financial  institutions  in China into commercial financial institutions as defined  above, with the exception of the central bank and  policy-oriented banks. As a matter of fact, so far large and  small shareholding banks, urban and rural credit societies, and  small and medium-sized state banks such as Zhongxin Industrial  Bank and Guangdai Bank have basically become this kind of  financial institutions. Even large state banks have begun the  transition to commercialization and are expected to complete the  process in the next few years. Meanwhile, the commercial  financial institutions mentioned above will evolve into typical  or representative commercial financial institutions. New urban  and rural cooperative banks and other financial institutions  will be set up. Foreign-funded financial institutions are also  slated for a period of rapid growth. By then China's financial  system will basically have everything a modern banking system  ought to have.    Compared to the existing large state banks, the typical  commercial bank has the following features:    1) Buys and sells financial services and the right to use  credit funds like a commodity.    In the past the government treated large state banks as the  implementors of policies and managers of the economy. How much  money the banks should lend and to whom were both decided by the  government. After these banks became commercial banks, both the  financial services they can provide and the right to use funds  became commodities. Will a bank provide services and lend money  to a particular enterprise? How much? Questions like these will  now be answered by the bank and the enterprise themselves  through discussion. When the business of making policy-mandated  loans is turned over to the policy-oriented bank, commercial  banks will be absolved of the responsibility of supplying  enterprises with working capital. No longer will they be held  accountable for the difficulties faced by mismanaged and  unprofitable enterprises whose products do not sell well after  their application for a loan is turned down. In most cases the  government also will stop directly ordering a commercial bank to  extend credit to a certain enterprise. It would no longer be  proper for the government to continue using simple  administrative tools to control their business activities.  Instead it should adopt policies to create an environment  conducive to banks doing business based on their own  self-interests.    2) Profit enhancement as one of the principal operational  objectives    All enterprises must make a profit. In a socialist market  economy, the enterprise which does not make a profit cannot  survive for long. As a financial enterprise, a commercial bank  must have a well-defined profit objective and must organize and  mobilize all its employees to work hard to achieve that  objective. The profit motive is the engine that drives all its  operations. Whether or not an enterprise truly regards the  numerical profit objective as its primary operational goal  essentially distinguishes a state commercial bank from its  predecessor, a large state bank.    Will a commercial bank do any less social good if it looks  upon profit or economic return as its principal operational  goal? The answer is that not only will it not do less social  good, but it may on the contrary generate more social benefits.  A bank realizes its social good through its business activities.  The purpose of allowing a bank to assess its own bottom line is  precisely to enable it to put its business on a sounder footing.  When a commercial bank becomes more successful in its business,  when idle funds in society are put to full use, when the bank is  able to lend more loans with the projected economic return and  provide more financial services for the economy, then the  economic benefits to society and hence to the entire nation will  automatically be even greater.    When large state banks go commercial, they become state  commercial banks. As state commercial banks, they should no  doubt comply with national laws and policies in an exemplary  manner, particularly those in the field of finance. They must  look at the bottom line without, however, being preoccupied with  profit-making exclusively. The problem now is that the profit  motive of these banks is not strong enough. We need to further  liberate our thinking and take measures to intensify it.    3) Linking workers' earnings to the bank's financial  performance    After a large state bank is transformed into a commercial  bank, its employees' earnings should be linked to its  performance. If the bank is well-managed and its profit goes up,  so should the incomes of its employees correspondingly. If the  bank is mismanaged and its profit drops, perhaps even replaced  by a loss, the earnings of its workers should likewise decrease.  This is an important way to fully energize a commercial bank, a  measure essential to making the bank internally driven and  externally pressured and turning it into a truly modern  financial enterprise. However, how a bank's bottom line is  linked to workers' incomes is something that needs to be  examined carefully. In the future, after the banks' profit  becomes average profit, we should take a leaf from the book of  the typical large enterprise and work out a commercial bank wage  and incentive system closely linked to a bank's margin of  profit. That way the earnings of a bank's employees will be even  more in line with its profitability.    4) Adopting a new internal management system    Large state banks and commercial banks are two different  kinds of banks with different operating mechanisms. Naturally  their management systems are also different. After a large state  bank is transformed into a commercial bank, the first order of  business is to craft a management system that meets the needs of  a commercial bank. Such a system should include an operations  management system, a financial management, and a personnel  management system, etc. A personnel management system, for  instance, should comprise a strict employee performance  evaluation system complete with rewards and penalties in order  to put a total end to the phenomenon of good workers and bad  workers being treated in the same way. The bank president should  be granted the power to hire and fire employees. The "iron rice  bowl" should be smashed in the course of time.  <H5>  Business Operations Of Commercial Banks </H5>   The operations of a commercial bank can be summed up in a  traditional way as "deposit, lend, and remit." Deposit means  accepting deposits, lend means making loans, and remitting means  sending remittances, or, as they put it loosely, "account  transfer and settlement."    Deposits. Under state regulations, a commercial bank derives  its funds from the capital invested by its owner. It is also  entitled to take a predetermined percentage of the funds in its  account transfer and settlement line of business in accordance  with the principle of "accept payment first, make payment  later." Yet another source of funds is deposits. While there is  a numerical ceiling to the first two sources of funds, deposits  have enormous potential for growth. As long as a bank is making  all the right moves and works hard, deposits can keep growing  strongly. Thus deposits often represent the principal source of  funds for a commercial bank. Take Zhongxin Industrial Bank, for  instance. In 1992 its liabilities and net assets amounted to  33,587,740,000 yuan, including 19,858,550,000 yuan, or 59.1  percent, in deposits.    How much money a commercial bank lends and hence the overall  scale of its operations is determined by the sources of its  funds. For this reason a commercial bank typically takes  deposits most seriously. Commercial banks offer the same kinds  of deposits plans and methods that large state banks have  offered for years. As competition heats up, however, they will  come up with an endless range of innovative practices and  programs and keep improving their services. Interest rates too  will become more flexible and elastic within the limits set by  the state.    If they meet the requirements, commercial banks can also  raise funds by issuing bonds. Issuing bonds in essence resembles  taking deposits, which is why it is mentioned as part deposits  here.    Making loans. Lending is the principal way in which a  commercial bank puts funds to use and the primary source of its  profits. Let us again look at the situation in Zhongxin  Industrial Bank in late 1992. Its credit balance stood at  19,395,380,000 yuan, 57.8 percent of the total amount of funds  applied. Since commercial banks assume risk themselves and are  accountable for their own profits and losses, they normally  select whom they lend money to most stringently, limiting their  borrowers to those enterprises whose products are popular and  relatively profitable and which are well managed. Pre-lending  investigations and post-lending supervision are also major  priorities for a commercial bank. Among the various kinds of  loans, the proportion of unsecured loans has been dropping while  that of secured loans and discounting of bills has gone up. Each  and every single loan comes with a specified time limit; it must  be paid off by the due date.    The amount of lending by a commercial bank is no longer  determined by the national credit plan or other administrative  tools. However, the bank must practice assets to liabilities  ratio management and submit to the restraint of fund sources so  as to ensure that it is fully able to pay its depositors. In  other words, whatever the circumstances, whenever a depositor  demands to withdraw a sum of money, the bank must have the money  on hand to make such a payment.    Commercial banks are required to purchase a set amount of  treasury bonds, but whether they should be allowed to buy  enterprise bonds and shares has yet to be considered. Countries  like the United States do not permit commercial banks to  purchase shares and bonds as a form of investment, while just  the opposite is true in Germany and Switzerland. Most people in  China are opposed to commercial banks purchasing enterprise  bonds and shares. Under the "Decision of the State Council  Concerning Financial Reform," "state commercial banks shall not  invest in non-financial enterprises." In my opinion, commercial  banks as a rule should not be allowed to purchase enterprise  bonds and shares for fear of over-extending the use of funds and  causing a credit crisis and to prevent the stock market and bond  market from undermining bank credit. However, in the course of  converting state enterprises into modern enterprises, we should  allow a portion of the old bad debts to be converted into shares  to be held by the loan-originating bank.    Account transfer and settlement. This is what a commercial  bank does when loans are paid off, labor fees paid, and other  sums transferred in society. Since account settlement and  transfer involves various banks, uniform methods of settlement  must be established by the central bank. By going into the  account transfer and settlement business, a bank can collect a  service charge or take a cut of the sum settled, on the one  hand, and attract customers to open an account with it, thus  boosting its deposits, on the other. (Before a bank would do  transfer and settlement for you, you must deposit a sum of money  there.) For this reason, account transfer and settlement is a  fiercely competitive part of a bank's business. Competition  helps shorten the settlement process, improve customer services,  and accelerate economic development.    The central bank must do a good job in public inter-bank  lending and note settlement. Commercial banks should be  authorized to handle inter-bank account settlement within their  own system on their own. Nevertheless, account settlement  between different banking systems and between the branches of  banks that are either unwilling or unable to set up a banking  system should go through the public banking group organized by  the central bank. Note settlement too should be processed by the  central bank or by a bank designated by the central bank.    Account transfer and settlement by a commercial bank will be  more service-oriented and freer from administrative supervision  compared with similar services offered by the large state bank  of the past. The bank can only do what the two parties--the  payer and the payee--agree upon. The payer and the payee, on the  other hand, will each play a stronger role in disciplining  itself and monitoring the other party. Say an enterprise asks a  bank to collect a sum of money. If the other enterprise refuses  to pay, all the bank can do is to return the commission. It will  then be up to the two enterprises to arrive at an agreement  through discussion.    Banks should be allowed to overlap one another's scope of  business. That way enterprises can choose banks and vice versa,  thus achieving genuine competition in the field of banking. When  that comes to pass, enterprises which make popular marketable  products and are well managed and profitable can borrow on  favorable terms, enabling them to develop even faster. In  contrast, enterprises whose products fail to move on the market  and which are poorly managed and are barely profitable or even  downright unprofitable are either denied credit or forced to  borrow on harsher terms, This will prompt them to move quickly  to turn themselves around.  <H5>  Difficulties in Bank Commercialization </H5>   Although the course of changing large state banks into  commercial banks is now set, a number of sticking points remain.  It will be some time before the conversion process is fully  complete. Among the major problems are:    1) It is difficult to find a substitute for banks as the  sole  source of enterprise working capital any time soon.    For years state enterprises relied solely on bank loans as  the source of their working capital. Bank loans account for 80  percent of the working capital of all state enterprises in the  nation. At the moment one-third of state enterprises are losing  money openly while another one-third are doing so under the  surface. They are bad credit risks. If commercial banks decide  whether or not to extend credit strictly in accordance with the  principles of commercial banking, a large proportion of  enterprises will not qualify and should be denied new loans,  even told to pay off old loans. But if that really happens,  these enterprises will have to go out of business. This is not  just an economic issue, but also a major political issue. Nobody  says this is what banks should do and it is not something the  banks themselves dare to do.    2) We have yet to figure out what to do about the bad debt  inherited from the past.    Of the current loans of the several leading state banks, not  a few are essentially uncollectible. They include bad debt the  material base for which is no longer existent; they are still on  the books only because the accounts have not been audited and  losses reported. Others represent the minimum amount of funds  necessary for the survival of an enterprise. The money should  have come from the enterprise's capital, but since the capital  was not there, bank loans were resorted to as a substitute. As  long as the enterprise continues to exist, there is simply no  way the money involved can be freed up. That is to say, there is  little hope the loan will be repaid.    How much do these essentially unrepayable loans amount to?  There is no precise number, but some people have estimated them  at 40 percent of the value of all loans at least. They  constitute a burden on the banks as well as the enterprises. The  debtor state enterprises not only have the obligation of paying  off the loans, but they are also required to pay interest.  Saddled with such a burden, how can they enter the market and  compete with private enterprises, individual enterprises, and  foreign-funded enterprises that are practically debt-free? For  large state banks, being stuck with so many uncollectible loans,  including some which are about to be written off, naturally also  constitutes a burden. As long as this problem remains unsolved,  large state banks will be unable to enter the market unburdened,  ready to compete with other financial institutions on a level  playing field.  <H5>  Measures to Spur Bank Commercialization </H5>   The transformation of large state banks into commercial  banks  is a pivotal measure in China's drive to deepen financial  reform. Since the course is set, we should embark on the process  steadily and firmly.    1) Unify ideological understanding    True to the spirit of the "Decision," it is now our set  policy to deepen reform, energize banking, and establish a new  financial system suited to the needs of a socialist market  economy. However, as long as large state banks are not converted  into commercial banks with despatch and their operating  mechanism overhauled thoroughly, the banking industry will  remain dormant and a new financial system will have a hard time  coming into existence. Should large state banks continue to  operate by the old mechanism, they will suffer setbacks and  perhaps even a gradual decline in their competition with other  financial institutions, losing their original commanding place  in the banking industry. This is a crucial issue with  implications for the continued leadership of state financial  institutions in the entire banking industry. Thus it is not a  question of whether large state banks are willing to go  commercial. Rather they must do so as soon as possible. The last  thing the central bank and all large state banks should do is to  hesitate and waver. Instead they must be determined to take  effective measures to effect this transformation over time.    2) Work hard to expedite the materialization of a modern  enterprise system.    Banking is a comprehensive sector whose every activity is  closely related to the enterprise. Banking reform must proceed  in tandem with enterprise reform, a point thoroughly  demonstrated by the two difficulties described above. Clearly,  if we fail to set up a modern enterprise system and continue the  operating mechanism of the product economy, the numerous  money-losing enterprises will not be able to turn themselves  around. Nor can we let them go bankrupt simply because there are  so many of them. The only thing they can do is to survive on  bank loans. Under the circumstances, it will be impossible to  cut back on new loans, not to mention collect old ones. How then  can we even begin to talk about transforming state banks into  commercial banks? On the other hand, we cannot just sit here and  wait for the materialization of a modern enterprise system  before moving to commercialize large state banks. Whenever  possible, we should start taking small steps in such areas as  credit and account settlement to build up a momentum for  creating a modern enterprise system. When the latter process  picks up steam, in turn driving the transformation of banks, we  can then quicken the pace of bank transformation.    3) Accelerate the creation of an operating mechanism for  commercial banks.    Waste no time in ending from bottom to top some of the  institutions and practices formed in the era of the product  economy and gradually develop a new set of systems such as a  personnel management system, a fund or business system, and a  financial system, suited to the operations of commercial banks.  Creating these systems is tantamount to deepening financial  reform. We must liberate our thinking and have the courage to  emulate some of the practices of banks in the West. Actually  that is what we have been doing and the results have been quite  satisfactory. We should go further on that front in the future.    4) Take feasible measures to solve the problem of bad debt.    Considering every practical circumstance, we may take the  following actions to wrestle with the banks' bad debt problem.    a) If the debtor enterprise has decided to turn itself into  a  shareholding state enterprise, the debt may be reconstituted as  the bank's investment in the enterprise, in effect turning the  IOU into shares. The bank will then cease to be a creditor.  Instead it becomes a shareholder and takes part in managing and  supervising the enterprise.    b) Some enterprises do not meet the requirements for the  transformation into shareholding enterprises for the moment but  may do so in the future. In this case, we may convert the loan  into transferable bonds, that is, turning it into enterprise  bonds first and, later, shares when the enterprise adopts the  shareholding system.    c) There are some enterprises which cannot be converted into  shareholding enterprises. In this case, the loan in question may  be converted into low-interest long-term enterprise bonds that  may be paid off in stages. Each year the enterprise is required  to set aside a portion of its retained profit to pay off a part  of the loan. Other methods may also be used to raise funds to  repay the loan.    d) In case the debtor is no longer around or nobody can be  found who can be held responsible for repaying the loan, it  should be reported in its full value and written off outright.  That way enterprises would be free to enter the market  unburdened. Large state banks too can be converted into  commercial banks sooner.</p>

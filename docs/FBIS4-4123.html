			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS)--In order to ease the tense  state of the rice supply to residents in Beijing, the municipal  grain administration has decided to put 10 million kilograms of  rice onto the market in the capital.    It is reported that the main reasons for the rice shortage  in  the city are first, most of the grain shops there have been  leased out and they are being used for selling other commodities  while those with grain storage are refusing to sell grain to  urban dwellers. Second, the fair markets there are either short  of a rice supply or the prices of rice in such markets are too  high or their quality is too low. In addition, some rice shops  are running at a loss because the rice they sell is shipped from  their original places of production resulting in the rice retail  price being much higher than the price limitation set by the  state with the highest price set at RMB 1.7 [renminbi] per  kilogram.    The municipal grain bureau has allocated 10 million  kilograms  of rice to the state-run grain shops with the highest price set  at RMB 1.6 per kilogram.</p>

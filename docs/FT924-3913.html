			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Warm reception for Royal Insurance Pounds 76m convertible ROYAL Insurance of the UK tapped the international capital markets yesterday as part of its continuing efforts to strengthen its balance sheet. The size of its 15-year convertible subordinated convertible bond issue was governed by existing shareholders' pre-emption rights, though it was increased to Pounds 76m from Pounds 70m in response to demand. The coupon was set at 7 1/4 per cent, at the lower end of the indicated range, and the conversion premium at 20.8 per cent, at the higher end of the range. Proceeds will be used primarily to repay existing debt. The exercise forms part of the strategic plan pursued by Mr Richard Gamble, group chief executive, since he took over at the start of this year, to restructure debt and smooth its maturity profile, reducing an over-reliance on short-term borrowings. Previous moves have focused on restructuring businesses to release cash. Debt at the lossmaking group stood at Pounds 426m at the end of September this year, down from Pounds 752m a year earlier, said Mr Gamble. Gearing has dropped from more than 50 per cent to 29 per cent. The company opted for a convertible structure rather than take the undated preference share route followed by Commercial Union and General Accident. Preference share coupons are higher than those payable on a convertible, and the coupons are effectively increased further if tax on UK profits is not sufficient to meet a company's Advance Corporation Tax liability. The Royal will continue to look at other ways of strengthening its balance sheet by improving the structure and maturity profile of its debt, said Mr Gamble. Elsewhere, the Paris-based Council of Europe, a regular borrower on the international markets, made its second appearance in Swiss francs in recent weeks. Its SFr150m, 10-year, 6 per cent issue was acknowledged as being priced very aggressively, but bankers pointed out that borrowers can take advantage of year-end liquidity in Switzerland to launch issues on tighter terms than might otherwise be acceptable. Broadly speaking, the issue was well received, although bankers said investors would prefer five-year paper from top quality names. Unlike most supranational agencies, the Council of Europe does not have a triple-A rating, but it benefited from a shortage of product and continued expectation of lower interest rates. Bankers are forecasting that the next triple-A rated issue will have a coupon of below 6 per cent. The Province of Ontario's SFr300m, 10-year issue marks the first time it has tapped the Swiss market in its own name, said lead manager Credit Suisse. Proceeds were swapped into floating rate US dollars. BANCO Exterior de Espana filed a registration statement with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission for Dollars 150m of non-cumulative perpetual preference shares at Dollars 25 a share. Banco Exterior will offer the shares through Extecapital Ltd, a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. Merrill Lynch is lead manager.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shim'on Schiffer and Nahum Barne'a] </F>   [Excerpt] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers  believe it is time to create a crisis in the negotiations with  'Arafat in order to make it clear that Israel does not intend to  implement any more compromises in the talks with him.    It has been learned that in internal consultations with  Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq commented on  the need for "creating a wall to block 'Arafat, an impregnable  iron wall wrapped in cotton."    The chief of staff, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, Head  of IDF Intelligence Uri Sagi and other senior defense  establishment personnel have leveled sharp criticism at the way  in which negotiations with the PLO are being conducted and  maintain that Israel's positions are being undermined.    At the same time it is necessary to emphasize that the top  IDF echelon is not opposed to the agreement with the PLO.    This morning the prime minister will consult with the chief  of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the head of IDF  intelligence, and senior security officials on the negotiations  with the PLO. Next Monday [7 February], after the foreign  minister's return from abroad, Rabin will hold an extensive  consultations in anticipation of Shim'on Peres' departure for  Cairo to meet with Yasir 'Arafat.    It has been learned that in the internal discussions, Peres  derided "the almost obsessive occupation" with details by the  defense establishment. Peres said that a year from now nobody  will remember the details that the IDF is demanding to include  in the agreement with the PLO.    Contrary to Peres, the top IDF echelon believes the  agreement  with the PLO must include as many details as possible in order  to ensure the success of the agreement in the field. The  position expressed to the prime minister by the IDF echelon was  as follows: "The stage of constructive ambiguity and brilliant  formulations is over. We have reached the implementation stage.  It is impossible to settle for principles while skimping on  details. The day after the agreement is implemented we will  have to give platoon commanders and Palestinian policemen  accurate instructions to follow. We are dealing here with  thousands of people, and the Israeli public must also be  informed." [passage omitted]</p>

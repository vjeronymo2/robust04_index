			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Total in Algerian gas field deal TOTAL, THE French state-controlled oil group, has signed a FFr3bn (Dollars 512m) agreement with Sonatrach, Algeria's state oil company, for the development of the Hamra gas field, writes George Graham in Paris. The French group will provide financing and technological assistance for the development of the field, expected to start production in 1994. In return, Total will have access to Hamra's entire output of condensates and liquefied petroleum gas - an estimated 150m to 200m barrels petroleum equivalent - for a period of 14 to 17 years. The deal shows the continued willingness of big Western companies to invest in Algeria, despite the political uncertainty that has been hanging over the country's future since the rise of the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front. Total also agreed yesterday to renew for a further five years its joint venture with Sonatrach for the operation of the Mereksen oil field, which currently produces around 600,000 tonnes of oil a year. It also signed two exploration contracts covering 6,458 square kilometres at Djebel Bottena and Hamra Southeast.</p>

The DS main board said Sunday evening [9 January] it  would take concrete decisions only if a national unity  government was being formed. The results achieved at the early  parliamentary elections in Serbia were also discussed and the  list of deputies to the parliament adopted.    The election campaign was conducted by Zoran Djindjic, the  president of the DS Executive Committee and head of all DS  lists. The DS main board discussed the confidence to the  party's president, Dragoljub Micunovic, but the vote was put off  until January 15, due to a lack of quorum. The vote on  confidence to the president of the DS was demanded by 52  municipal committees, out of a total of 90.    At early parliamentary elections, the DS increased the  number  of seats compared to last year's parliamentary elections, when  it won only 7 seats. This year it won 29 seats, to become the  fourth strongest party in the 250-seat parliament.    The SPS won most seats -- 123, but it was below the absolute  majority line.</p>

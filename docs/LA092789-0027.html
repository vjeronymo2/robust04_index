			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: THESE CUB FANS HAVE SAID IT ALL ALONG: YOU GOTTA BELIZE  </P> <P> It's not exactly a cargo cult, but William Branigan of the Washington Post  reports that residents of the Central American country of Belize are going  bonkers for the Chicago Cubs:  </P> <P> "Through a quirk of geography and satellite technology, Belize has more Cub  fans per capita than any place outside greater Chicago, residents say.  </P> <P> "It started in 1981, when local businessman Arthur Hoare introduced television  to Belize (population 180,000), the only English-speaking country in Central  America. Many Belizeans already had television sets by then, but used them to  watch rented videotapes. The enterprising Hoare capitalized on the ready market  by launching Channel 9, which captured Chicago's WGN station on a satellite  dish and relayed it to local viewers."  </P> <P> Then aren't the broadcasts pirated?  </P> <P> "U.S. broadcasters consider the Belize market so small that trying to stop the  operations would not be worth the trouble."  </P> <P> According to Branigan, Belizeans take the view that, as one resident put it,  "Out of the sky we get sunshine, we get rain and we get TV signals. Whatever  drops out of the sky is an act of God."  </P> <P> Crying wolf: Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, once known for his quick wit, has  developed a new image -- that of a hand-wringing poor-mouth.  </P> <P> After his top-ranked Irish had defeated Michigan State Saturday, Holtz moaned  about Notre Dame's next opponent, Purdue. It was his understanding, Holtz said,  that the Boilermakers had beaten Notre Dame whenever the Irish were reigning  national champions. Sorry, Lou, no sympathy.  </P> <P> KMPC radio's Jim Healy, based on research by sports expert Dwain Esper,  informed his audience Monday night that in nine seasons after Notre Dame  championships, Purdue has won three times, the Irish have won three and three  times the teams didn't play.  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Sept. 27, 1936, what future Dodger manager played in his only  major league game?  </P> <P> Strictly business: The Boston Red Sox unceremoniously made it clear Monday that  former stars Jim Rice, 36, and Bob Stanley, 34, won't be in Red Sox uniforms  next year. Both are in final years of long-term contracts that included club  options for 1990. Rice earns $2.34 million for this season, Stanley $1 million.  </P> <P> Asked what the Red Sox plan to do with the money they save on the contracts,  General Manager Lou Gorman told Steve Buckley of the Hartford Courant: "A lot  of it will go to Mr. Esasky, if we can sign him."  </P> <P> First baseman Nick Esasky will become a free agent at the end of the season.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Walter Alston, as a late-inning substitute at first base for  Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals. Alston made one error in two chances  and struck out in his only time at bat.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, on the possibility of the  club's winning the National League East title while playing in Montreal:  'There's something un-American about clinching a pennant in a foreign country."

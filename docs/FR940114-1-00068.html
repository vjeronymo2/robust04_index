GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219&hyph;9 to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (End of Provision) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

The subcontracting plan will be negotiated concurrently with price and any required technical and management proposals, unless the offeror submits a previously-approved commercial products plan. Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. It is the General Services Administration's (GSA's) expectation that an offeror's subcontracting plan will reflect a commitment to assuring that small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns are provided the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the resulting contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, in addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219&hyph;9(d), the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the contract. The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in any previous contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally, the offeror shall demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's objectives, GSA's expectations, and actions necessary to meet these goals and expectations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations with the respect to the program and has included all the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219&hyph;9; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from agencies administering national and local preference programs and other advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Review, when applicable, the offeror's description of its strategies, historical performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Failure to submit to subcontracting plan and/or correct deficiencies in the plan within the time specified by the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (End of Provision) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9.

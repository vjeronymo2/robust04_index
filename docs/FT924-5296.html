			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / At a loss for a speedy solution: Japan's banking crisis threatens economic growth at home and abroad The sharp falls in pre-tax profits announced yesterday by Japan's large banks are just the latest sign that the country's banking sector is facing its worst crisis since the second world war. The collapse of the speculative bubble of the 1980s has left them burdened with bad debts, a legacy which has potentially far-reaching consequences for Japan and the international economy. At the end of September the top 21 Japanese banks had loans on which no interest had been paid for more than six months, worth Y12,300bn (Pounds 65bn), or about 3 per cent of their outstanding loans. According to the Finance Ministry, about Y4,000bn of these loans do not have any collateral. This amounts to an unrecoverable loss which could soak up about 18 months of operating profits at the top 21 banks. Their uncommitted loan loss reserves are worth only Y2,875bn. Covering the loss by digging into their capital would reduce their equity by about 19 per cent. The banks and the regulatory authorities are taking a distinctively Japanese approach to solving this debt crisis. Market forces will play only a limited role in restoring equilibrium. There is little prospect that weak institutions will be allowed to go to the wall or be taken over. Instead, the Japanese are working in the grey zone between the market and state intervention by adopting a gradualist and collective approach. At present, the government is offering the banks only limited, covert support. There are no plans for a bail-out modelled on the US government's rescue of the savings and loan industry. Instead, the entire banking system is taking the strain. Weaker banks will be kept afloat through a web of relations with stronger banks which will support them with cheap loans. But what are the chances that the Japanese authorities can prevent a long drawn-out crisis which undermines Japan's economic performance? The banks' bad debts are a direct result of the collapse of the property market after the end of Japan's 'bubble' economy of low interest rates and financial deregulation, which created a climate for rampant speculation in the late 1980s. At its peak rate of growth in late 1987, commercial bank lending to the real estate sector grew by 32.7 per cent, to Y33,565bn in March 1988. In 1988 land prices in the Tokyo area rose by 57 per cent. By spring 1989 the Bank of Japan, which had become alarmed by the rise in asset prices, began to push up the discount rate (which determines short-term interest rates) from 2.75 per cent in April 1989 to 6.25 per cent 15 months later. The authorities also put a cap on real estate lending. The property market went into a tail-spin. Prices in some central areas of Tokyo are 60 per cent off their peak, leaving many borrowers with collateral worth less than their loans. Residential land prices may still have a long way to fall; prices dropped about 20 per cent in the main cities in the year to September. An unprecedented glut of office space will overhang the commercial market for several years. This means the banks' final bill will be far larger than the outstanding unbacked Y4,000bn of bad debts estimated by the Finance Ministry for this September. Privately, Tokyo bankers acknowledge that bad loans at the 21 top banks could total Y55,000bn, equivalent to about 12 per cent of gross domestic product, over the next five years. Even a conservative estimate for unrecoverable loans of Y10,000bn is about equal to the top 21's forecast operating profits for the next three years. This figure almost certainly understates the problem, however. The top 21 banks are the tip of a very large financial pyramid. Beneath them are about 132 large and smaller regional banks, which do not operate nationally, and 455 very small, local shinkin banks. At the base is a dense network of 22,000 non-banking lenders, which do not take in deposits. According to Mr David Snoddy, banking analyst at Jardine Fleming, the securities house, the regional banks could face a loss of Y1,600bn or about 21 per cent of their equity. What matters is whether the top 21 banks and the strongest regional banks will have the resources to deal with their own problems as well as help their weaker affiliates. Japanese banks all have large holdings of securities, which they could sell to raise capital. The plunge in the Tokyo stock market means the value of the banks' large unrealised gains on securities holdings has fallen from a peak of Y60,604bn in September 1989 to about Y18,385bn this March. That is still more than enough to cover their losses, but if they tried to realise these gains share prices could decline further, thus depleting the banks' capital. This would increase pressure on the banks to restrict lending by pushing their capital below the standards set by the Bank of International Settlements. From next March they are required to hold capital worth 8 per cent of the value of their risk assets. Any strategy that the banks might consider to meet their losses faces constraints. For instance, issuing more shares is not an option while the Tokyo stock market is in the doldrums. So the banks hope to stretch out their losses, at least until the late 1990s, paying for them piecemeal each year, partly from profits, partly from stock reserves and, in time perhaps, from their shareholders' equity. Despite the mutual ties between banks, a crisis at a large bank cannot be ruled out as long as the stock market is depressed and real estate prices continue to fall. A large bank failure would destabilise the entire system because it could unravel the patchwork of cross-lending which binds the banks together. That threat is taken seriously by the authorities. They are keeping a close watch on the long-term credit banks set up to lend to industry but which have become heavily exposed to real estate lending. They are also watching several trust banks, which operate both banking and trust-fund investment businesses. Nevertheless bankers are adamant that a failure can be averted. Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, puts it: 'Our banks do not go bust.' Crises at weaker institutions are expected, however. Mr Akira Nambara, executive director of the Bank of Japan, has predicted mergers and rescues among smaller institutions. Several weaker regional banks are already undergoing restructuring. The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, says it has instructed large banks to take an interest in the health of their non-banking lending affiliates. Bluntly, the banks are being told to stop the affiliates going bust. Distress lending from large banks to non-banking institutions at very low rates of interest rose by about 194 per cent in the year to August. Even if a collapse can be averted, a prolonged crisis would have far-reaching consequences. Small businesses, which account for 56 per cent of employment, are already complaining of a credit crunch. Large companies have cash reserves to fall back on, but many are reconsidering ambitious investment strategies which were based on access to low-cost capital. As a result, the domestic picture could be grim: the banks' weakness could stifle growth in the Japanese economy for several years. Extrapolating from calculations by Mr Yushio Suzuki, the Bank of Japan's former executive director, the money supply needs to expand by about 6 per cent a year for gross national product to grow at the government's target of 3.5 per cent a year. That seems unlikely with bank lending rising by only 0.7 per cent in the six months to September and with an unprecedented contraction in the money supply in August and September. Money supply growth remains weak, despite a series of discount rate cuts since July last year as the Bank of Japan has tried to stimulate the economy and offer support to the banking industry. The economy looks set to grow more slowly in the 1990s than at any time since the 1950s. The international consequences could also be profound because of the pivotal role that Japanese banks now play in the world economy. Japanese banks have already retreated from international lending to reduce their assets and meet the BIS capital adequacy standards. Companies which found it relatively easy to borrow from Japanese banks - from US steel mills to Olympia &amp; York, the developer of the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands - now find it more difficult to borrow money, a constraint which is likely to remain tight so long as Japanese banks' domestic difficulties persist. When loans are made available, they are also likely to be more expensive than in the 1980s. When Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, came to Tokyo last month, he delivered a grim warning that asset deflation - which is undermining the profitability and lending ability of banks in the US, UK, Australia and Scandinavia as well as Japan - was a malaise which would take a long time to cure. He also stressed that world economic growth would be sluggish until the 1980s' debts were paid off. So unless the Japanese government intervenes, Japan's debt problems are likely to hinder both the domestic and the world economy for some time. As yet the government has been unwilling and unable to commit large sums of money to bail out the banks, and thereby help them into a position to start lending again when the economy picks up. This is largely because there would be an outcry from a public which has little sympathy for bank executives who are widely regarded as overpaid and underworked. All the government has so far been willing to offer the banks is tax credits to allow the banks to write off their losses against profits. The banks have set up an agency to buy the land they used as collateral for some of their bad loans, thus allowing them to calculate their losses at realistic land prices. But this agency will be funded by the banks and have no public money. On the other hand, the government has been willing to use public funds to buy land to stabilise land prices. The authorities face a dilemma. An injection of public funds into the banks' land-buying agency may be essential to speed up the writing off of bad debts and thus limit the wider economic damage of a protracted crisis. But that may only be politically possible once there is a sudden bank failure of large proportions. Unless and until this happens, the banks will have to fend for themselves.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Money Markets: Easter tactics begin EASTER was on everyone's minds yesterday as the players began the traditional strategic dealing before the four-day weekend. The most distinctive feature was a lack of action in the money markets in the early morning, despite a forecast Pounds 1.05bn shortage. Some analysts suggested that the resounding silence could have been due to a watch and wait syndrome. 'They all sat back and waited to see what everyone else was going to do. Therefore nothing was offered,' said Mr Nick Parsons of CIBC. The two days before Easter are among the most important days of the money market year. This is when discount houses and clearing banks begin to try to manipulate the overnight rates ahead of the long weekend. For example, yesterday players held back paper, Mr Parsons suggests, thus forcing up overnight rates. Today they will have more to offer and be able to eliminate the shortage early in the morning. This will bring overnight rates tumbling at just the point when players are seeking to fund their sterling books. Since today is the last trading day for four days, the books derive cheaper rates for longer periods. Events in the market would appear to have supported this view. The Bank of England did not take up offers in the early round, if any were made, forcing the overnight rate as high as 11 1/2 per cent at one stage. However, just before lunch, the Bank eliminated the shortage in one fell swoop with a chunky Pounds 664m repo due on May 6 at 10 7/16 per cent, and a Pounds 386m band one bank bill purchase at 10 3/8 per cent. Overnight rates tumbled immediately to 9 1/2 per cent. Further out, money rates moved very little. The key three-month interbank rate eased slightly from 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent to 10 3/8 - 5/16 per cent. One year money was steady at 10 1/4 - 1/8 per cent. On the futures market, the June short sterling contract ended eight points higher at 89.88, implying an interest rate of 10.12 per cent in the medium term. In Germany, call rates were a shade easier following the Bundesbank's DM300m injection, edging back from 9.60/70 to 9.60/65. In the US, the Federal Reserve added liquidity to the system as funds were trading at 4 1/8 per cent. The presumed target is 3 3/4 per cent, while the average yesterday was 3.68 per cent.</p>

The Houston-based airline owned by Texas Air Corp. announced last  month that its popular Max Saver tickets purchased after May 26 would increase  by as much as $80. "We withdrew that (plan) today," said John Nelson,  Continental's executive vice president for marketing. "We can't afford to be  noncompetitive in our prices."  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to call in new rail negotiators Sir, Following 12 days of strikes during the past 10 weeks it seems incomprehensible that Railtrack management and senior union officials cannot agree on a formula to end the dispute. In the meantime, on strike days, business in central London is having to tolerate even greater traffic congestion than normal and to cope with staffing levels that are reduced anyway because of the holiday season. As we are beginning to emerge from long-term recession the last thing the business community or its customers need is the aggravation of intermittent congestion, disruption and dislocation when using the road and rail systems. What is lacking at present is good sound leadership. Therefore may I suggest that as those leading the negotiations appear to have run out of ideas, they give way to more inspired people from their management teams to bring this deplorable state of affairs to an end. Peter Boizot, Westminster Chamber of Commerce, 177 Regent St, London W1R 8DJ</p>

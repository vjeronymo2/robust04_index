			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S BARELY ROOM FOR SPORTS IN SPORTS SECTIONS THESE DAYS  </P> <P> Not since Bowie Kuhn, the eunuch prince of pomposity, protected baseball from  the villainous likes of Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle has there been such a  champion of the absurd as Bart Giamatti. Does it bother me that Pete Rose  possibly bet on his own team? Not half as much as having a commissioner who  writes letters of recommendation to judges on behalf of the seamy, self-serving  elements of illegal gambling.  </P> <P> TERRENCE S.

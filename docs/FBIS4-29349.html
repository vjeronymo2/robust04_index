			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The United Nations will not  be able to revise its charter before 1996 to allow Japan to  become a permanent member of its security council, former  Japanese ambassador to the UN Yoshio Hatano predicted Thursday  [16 June].    Hatano also said in a speech that a midterm report on UN  reform by a working committee, due this fall, will not detail an  increase in the number of UN Security Council members. He said  it would be impossible for the 184-nation working panel to  produce an agreement.</p>

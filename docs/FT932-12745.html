			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Mayor of St Petersburg a 'tireless' campaigner Sir, Commenting on the mood of St Petersburg citizens ('Referendum fails to inspire St Petersburg', April 24) and the reputation of the city leadership, your reporter commented that, on the eve of the referendum, Mayor Anatoly Sobchak was 'enjoying himself in London at the annual meeting of the EBRD'. We hope that Mr Sobchak enjoyed his hectic day and a half in London. But I can say that, in almost six hours which Mr Sobchak spent in our company (in private sessions with more than 40 international business and other leaders), he was tireless in putting the case for helping his city and engaging in partnership projects. These included youth enterprise and training, building rehabilitation and assisting the city's unique yet impoverished cultural institutions. Those who met him were left in no doubt as to his boldness and commitment in leading St Petersburg through the unprecedented social and economic challenges it faces. Robert Davies, chief executive, The Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum, 3 Cleveland Place, London SW1Y 6JJ</p>

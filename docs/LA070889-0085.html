			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: CREDIT REPAIR CLINICS COULD CLEAN YOU OUT  </P> <P> Credit repair clinics, or "credit doctors," are flourishing. But while they  promise to clean up your credit problems, in many cases they only clean out  your pocketbook. By preying on the ignorance of debt-troubled consumers, the  clinics defraud them of millions of dollars, government investigators say.  </P> <P> Fortunately, unscrupulous operators can be easy to spot. And anything they  claim that they can legitimately do, you can do on your own at little or no  cost.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who use these clinics are really unaware of the law and  believe there is something mysterious these companies can do for them," says  Herschel Elkins, a California senior assistant attorney general.  </P> <P> Credit clinics have thrived largely because of consumers' growing use and  overuse of credit, resulting in rising personal bankruptcies and credit card  delinquencies.  </P> <P> For debt-ridden consumers, the clinics' pitch sounds tempting. Often through  newspaper advertisements, the clinics claim that they can eliminate your credit  problems by removing adverse information, such as records of late payments or  collection actions, from your files. Such information is contained in records  maintained by such credit bureaus as TRW Credit Data, Transunion or CBI. TRW,  for example, maintains files on about 143 million consumers, with information  provided by lenders.  </P> <P> The law requires that accurately reported information may remain in your credit  file for seven years, or 10 years if you declare personal bankruptcy. But  credit bureaus are required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to investigate  and respond to consumer disputes about such information within a reasonable  time. The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. agency charged with enforcing the  act, deems 30 days from receipt of a dispute as a reasonable response time.  </P> <P> Credit clinics seek to exploit this loophole by overwhelming bureaus with so  many challenges of adverse information that the bureaus won't be able to verify  the data within the 30-day limit. Thus, the clinics hope, the adverse  information will be removed.  </P> <P> But if the credit information is correct, it cannot be removed legitimately. If  eliminated, it is likely to be reinstated when the lender files new reports  with credit bureaus.  </P> <P> The law also allows credit bureaus to refuse to investigate frivolous disputes.  TRW has even gone further, refusing to respond to third-party inquiries and  dealing only with consumers directly, spokeswoman Susan Murdy says.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, credit clinics charge as much as $1,000 for their services -- and  often get it. But some don't perform promised services or do just a minimal  amount of work. Others have gone belly up, leaving customers without refunds.  </P> <P> Credit clinics also charge exorbitant fees for services you can easily perform  yourself for little or no cost. For example, some clinics charge hundreds of  dollars to provide you with a copy of your credit report and a sample  application for a secured credit card -- the type that requires a bank account  or other assets as collateral. But you can get both for free or for a nominal  charge.  </P> <P> Federal legislation has been proposed to crack down on abuses. Among other  things, the legislation would require that clinics advise you of your rights  before signing a contract, fully disclose their services and the cost and allow  you to cancel the contract.  </P> <P> California already has such a law. But it hasn't been enough to stop the abuses  because state and federal agencies say they don't have adequate staff to police  unscrupulous operators. "We could bring actions against 30 or 40 companies next  week if we had a large enough staff," Elkins says.  </P> <P> The FTC and the Attorney General's office have filed civil suits and obtained  restraining orders against some of the largest and worst offenders, charging  that they could not guarantee credit repair as touted. For example, in what may  be one of the largest settlements of such a case, a California firm, Action  Credit Systems, agreed earlier this year to refund $1.2 million to customers to  settle an FTC complaint.  </P> <P> The state Attorney General's office also forced a California man to quit  holding seminars in which he charged each person $90 for information on how to  repair credit records. The agency plans to increase actions against other  abusive practices in the next two months, Elkins says.  </P> <P> But stronger enforcement and tougher laws alone are not enough. The real  solution will come when consumers become more informed. Here are some tips:  </P> <P> * Know your credit rights. If you act within 30 days of being denied credit,  federal law entitles you to review the credit report that the lender used in  making the decision, at no charge. Otherwise, the fee is typically $5 to $15.  </P> <P> Call the credit bureau first to find out the procedure. The two biggest credit  bureaus in the Los Angeles area are TRW and CBI. Others are listed in the phone  book.  </P> <P> If you challenge information in your file as inaccurate or fraudulent, credit  bureaus must investigate and delete information that cannot be verified. If the  credit bureau deems the information correct and you disagree, you can submit a  brief statement, which becomes part of your file.  </P> <P> Three free booklets, "Building a Better Credit Record," "The Fair Credit  Reporting Act" and "Fix Your Own Credit Problems and Save Money," can be  obtained from the FTC, Room B-3, 6th and Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington,  D.C. 20580.  </P> <P> * Recognize credit repair rip-offs. Avoid services that claim they can clean up  your credit record or that are vague about the services they provide. Steer  clear of those offering to assist you in obtaining your credit report for a  fee. And avoid those promising to get you a credit card, regardless of your  credit history. In many cases they will provide you only with an application.  </P> <P> * Complain if you've been duped. In the Los Angeles area, write to the Attorney  General's Office, 3580 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90010. Also complain  to the Federal Trade Commission, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., Room 13209, Los Angeles,  Calif. 90024, or call its complaint line at (213) 209-7575 between 8:30 a.m.  and noon weekdays.  </P> <P> You also can sue in small claims court, suggests Ann Guler, an FTC public  information officer.  </P> <P> * Know how to get legitimate credit counseling. Reputable, low-cost help on  repaying your creditors, managing debt and setting up a budget is available.  One service is provided by Consumer Credit Counselors, a nonprofit organization  with 400 offices nationwide.  </P> <P> For referrals to the office nearest you, call (213) 386-7601 in Los Angeles  County, (714) 547-8281 in Orange County, (619) 224-2922 in San Diego County and  (714) 781-0114 in Riverside County. Elsewhere, call the National Foundation for  Consumer Credit in Silver Springs, Md., at (301) 589-5600.  </P> <P> * Know how to get a secured credit card on your own. Consumer Action, a San  Francisco consumer group, offers a free list of California institutions that  offer low-cost, secured cards directly to the public. Send a self-addressed,  stamped envelope to the organization at 116 New Montgomery St., Suite 223, San  Francisco, Calif. 94105.  </P> <P> The Bankcard Holders of America also provides lists of secured card issuers,  along with a pamphlet on credit clinics. Send $3 to the organization at 460  Spring Park Place, Suite 1000, Herndon, Va. 22070.  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot respond individually to letters.

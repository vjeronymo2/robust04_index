			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIEDLER BACKS BOLAND FOR LA FOLLETTE'S ASSEMBLY SEAT  </P> <P> Former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, in a move that may help pave the way for a political  comeback, said Thursday she is endorsing real estate broker Paula Boland to  succeed retiring Republican Assemblywoman Marian La Follette of Northridge.  </P> <P> Fiedler joins a list of prominent conservative Republican political figures in  the San Fernando Valley who are backing Boland against her chief opponent,  longtime La Follette aide Robert Wilcox.  </P> <P> Boland also has been endorsed by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley),  Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike  Antonovich.  </P> <P> Boland, Wilcox and three less well-known Republicans are competing for the GOP  nomination in the 38th Assembly District, which arcs across the northern San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Political observers have speculated about a possible comeback by Fiedler, who  gave up a Valley-based congressional seat to make her failed 1986 run for the  U.S. Senate. In an interview, Fiedler, 52, said she is interested in running  for Bernson's council post or Antonovich's supervisor seat, if either left  office voluntarily. If Boland wins the Assembly seat, she could provide Fiedler  with valuable assistance in a future campaign.  </P> <P> Fiedler pledged to "do everything I can" to help Boland raise money. Fiedler  said that, last month, she accompanied Boland to the state GOP convention in  Santa Clara, where Fiedler introduced Boland to various elected officials and  party activists.  </P> <P> "Paula is a longtime personal friend who I've had the privilege of working with  on a broad base of issues," Fiedler said. "She's been a strong supporter, and  she has an incredibly fine background."  </P> <P> Fiedler cited Boland's grass-roots involvement in local Republican political  campaigns, her efforts to promote tax-cutting Proposition 13, and her  involvement in anti-busing efforts and with local chambers of commerce.  </P> <P> She also mentioned Boland's efforts to promote construction of the Simi Valley  Freeway and her membership on the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation  Commission, which oversees efforts to expand existing cities or create new  ones.  </P> <P> "She knows how to get things done," Fiedler said. "She's going to knock the  socks off the Legislature when she gets up there." Fiedler added that Boland  brokered the sale of Fiedler's husband's house and the purchase of her  daughter's.  </P> <P> Fiedler vacated her congressional seat to run for the GOP Senate nomination in  1986. But her candidacy unraveled after she was indicted following charges by  state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), who also was seeking the nomination,  that she had offered him $100,000 to get out of the race. A judge subsequently  threw out the indictment.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Fiedler has remained active in state and local GOP politics. In  1988, she served as Southern California co-chairwoman of George Bush's  presidential campaign. This year, she is co-chairwoman of Angela (Bay)  Buchanan's campaign for the GOP nomination for state treasurer.  </P></p>

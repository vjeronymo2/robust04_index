			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): The fund managers - an eye to the future THE October 1987 stock market crash had the side effect of sorting out good fund managers from bad. Some fell by the wayside while others flourished. The managers described here are some of the most promising in Britain and were chosen on the grounds of reputation and performance. Most emphasised that good performance is often the result of collective wisdom, back-up from colleagues and a sensible asset allocation policy. But individual judgment and personality clearly is crucial. Quite a few of those interviewed here have left their training ground recently and it will be interesting to see if they can perform as well on their own. Nicola Horlick was one who thrived at Mercury Asset Management, which she joined in 1983. Initially, she ran balanced UK portfolios - large funds with widespread, fairly evenly-weighted holdings. In the mid-1980s, however, pension fund portfolios increasingly were managed by taking a core satellite of stocks, possibly indexed, as a base and leaving the rest of the portfolio as a more specialist section under 'active' management. Horlick, 31, helped to build up the specialist portfolio business. But as the operation became bigger, she was attracted by a fresh challenge at Morgan Grenfell, where she is again managing and marketing specialist portfolios. She prefers to run relatively highly-concentrated portfolios and says: 'If I have a fund of Pounds 100m, I would have about 40 stocks.' Wendy Mayall, of pension fund consultant Stamford Associates UK, says that Horlick has achieved investment returns in the top five per cent of managers in her field since the mid-1980s. Andrew Parry is the 29-year-old head of UK equities at Baring Asset Management. He is a maths graduate who became an actuarial trainee with Confederated Life before a brief spell in the international private client department of stockbroker Grieveson Grant. He then spent three years in the Swiss Bank Corporation's relatively small investment department before moving to Baring in 1988 as a UK pension fund manager and now has 15 managers reporting to him. Parry could well have succeeded in reversing Baring's disappointing performance late in the 1980s. Baring's equity returns last year were 21.2 per cent compared with an industry average of 19.9 per cent, according to Wood Mackenzie. Sarah Bates has responsibility for about Pounds 600m of corporate and local authority pension funds at Invesco MIM. Over the last financial year, two of her local authority UK equity pension funds ranked fifth and sixth out of 100. She was an analyst at stockbroker Simon &amp; Coates, but she did not enjoy the sales side and moved to National Provident Investment Managers to become a fund manager, before going to MIM in 1985. Bates studied for her MBA as a part-time student at the London Business School but retains a healthy scepticism about the qualification. She believes that 'the days of the old-fashioned fund manager who gets by with flair and luck are fading.' Richard Horlick - Nicola's 33-year-old cousin by marriage - works at Newton, the independent fund management outlet, where he oversees Pounds 200m in pension fund money out of the total Pounds 2bn under management in pension funds, unit trusts and personal equity plans. From the results available to December 1991, 25 of Newton's 31 funds made the top quartile. He joined Newton in 1983 after leaving Samuel Montagu's corporate finance department. And, clearly, he enjoys the relatively aggressive and high-risk approach at Newton. Mick Brewis, 27 and a Cambridge graduate, has established a reputation with Edinburgh fund manager Baillie Gifford, which manages Pounds 2bn in UK equities. His smaller companies unit trust leads its sector over two years, a fact he attributes to the firm's philosophy of buying only well-managed, successful companies. He prefers to be in Edinburgh because 'you can take a more objective view without being caught up by market fashions.' Kevin Rowe, 30, has a different approach; he uses quantitative computer techniques to assess risks and returns. As a founder member of Buchanan Partners, a small, independent outlet set up two years ago, he also helped to establish Credit Suisse First Boston's proprietary trading department. Investors subscribe to Buchanan's funds, which are arbitraged on markets in Europe and the Far East. The annual return on Buchanan's equity investments last year was 40 per cent. Rowe, a Canadian, graduated from Toronto and took a master's degree in finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Stephen Whittaker operates from a base in Henley, Oxfordshire, where he manages three UK unit trusts - Growth, PEP Growth and Income and Offshore UK Growth - at Perpetual, another independent fund management group. UK Growth ranks 12th out of all UK unit trust growth funds over the past two years, according to Finstat. Whittaker is also in charge of the UK investment team. He joined Rowan, the in-house fund management operation of stockbrokers Rowe &amp; Pitman, in 1980. Five years later he went to Save &amp; Prosper unit trusts, where he moved away from the more general 'bread and butter' funds to specialist unit trusts. Michael Taylor, 31, is one of the most down-to-earth managers in the City and distrusts 'anything flashy.' He says: 'My basic approach is that the UK economy is in terminal decline, certainly in the manufacturing sector.' After a grounding at Guardian Royal Exchange, Taylor ran pension funds for four years at Hill Samuel, staying well into the top 15 per cent over the period and often in the top 10. Since moving to Royal Insurance Asset Management as head of equities last May, there has been a marked upturn in UK equity performance (although Taylor points out that this had started before he joined). He also manages Royal Life's main life and annuity business fund himself. The problem with fund management is that successful managers spend less time managing money and more on marketing. The trick is to do both. The next five years should show who has managed.</p>

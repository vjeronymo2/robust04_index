			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / All-seater soccer scheme modified THE government has backed down over its plan to make all soccer clubs in England and Wales install all-seater stadia by the turn of the century. Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary, whose department has responsibility for sport, said yesterday that clubs in the Second and Third divisions will be exempt from the policy to scrap terracing. Those were the clubs that were in the Third and Fourth divisions until the recent introduction of the Premier League. Clubs from the Premier League and the new First Division will still have to provide all-seater stadia by 1994, as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor's report after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. The Football League, which organises all clubs in England and Wales outside the Premier League, said the decision would considerably ease the financial burden on clubs. The league estimated that it would cost Second and Third division clubs Pounds 77m to implement the Taylor report. Mr Mellor warned Second and Third Division clubs not to see it as an 'easy option'. Terracing would have to meet high safety standards, he said. The Football League said it would encourage its members to 'work towards a greater amount of seating and an upgrading of terraced accommodation'. The government hinted at a change of heart at the beginning of June, when Mr Mellor - a Chelsea supporter, like the prime minister - announced that he was going to reconsider the all-seating requirements. Mr Tom Pendry, Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde and chairman of the all-party parliamentary football committee, described the announcement as 'a show of good sense and responsibility', but he called for greater flexibility on First Division clubs which attract crowds of less than 10,000. In Scotland, the decision that First and Second division clubs should be all-seated by the turn of the century is being reviewed. Scottish Premier League clubs will have to introduce all-seater stadia by 1994. Mr Peter Popper, a director at Higgs &amp; Hill, the construction company that specialises in sports stadia, said Mr Mellor's announcement would not significantly effect the construction industry. 'Because smaller clubs will not be building stadiums they could never afford, they may be encouraged to make more ground improvements than was previously the case,' he said. Many clubs in the Second and Third divisions are believed to have delayed efforts to introduce all-seater stadia in the hope that the government would abandon its plans.</p>

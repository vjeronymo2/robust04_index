			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 31 (CTK) -- The signing of the  Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement, the draft of which was  approved by the Slovak cabinet today, would open new prospects  in relations between the two countries, Slovak Interior Minister  Ladislav Pittner told CTK today. "The signature of the  readmission agreement will naturally also simplify the question  of opening further border crossings," Pittner said.    The draft agreement has been prepared in cooperation with  Hungary, but it would be necessary, unofficial Foreign Ministry  sources say, to discuss its wording with the new Hungarian  Government.    Pittner described the draft agreement as similar to  readmission agreements already concluded between Slovakia and  its other neighbors. The only exception is a provision  concerning the deadline for returning persons to Hungary,  according to which illegal refugees have to be returned in 48  hours.    Hungary has so far linked the signing of the  Hungarian-Slovak  readmission agreement with the opening of new border crossings  and a change of a similar Slovak-Romanian agreement, which does  not include a provision on returning refugees from third  countries. In contrast to this, the Slovak Government of  ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar made the opening of the border  crossings conditional on the signing of the agreement, rejecting  Hungary's proposal that only Hungarian citizens be returned.</p>

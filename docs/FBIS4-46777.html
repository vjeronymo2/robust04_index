			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Rodin: "It Is Better To Hurry at the Right </F> Time"]    [Text] Recently, during meetings with various foreign  guests, Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, has been fond  of repeating approximately the same phrase: The chamber has  already approved the framework of the 1994 budget (thereby,  according to him, consciously supporting unpopular government  measures) and in June it will have the second and the third  reading. It is quite possible that the latter will really  happen. However, the first is no more than a very strained  approval.    After the Duma voted for revenue, expenditure, and budget  deficit figures on 11 May, many commentators hastened to declare  that the chief thing was done. It should be noted that the Duma  itself gave reason for this, having put down, in violation of  its own regulation, in the decree (where revenues were  solidified in the amount of 124,477 billion rubles and  expenditures, 194,495.31 billion rubles, the deficit totaling  70,018.31 billion rubles) that the draft law "On the 1994  Federal Budget" was approved at the first reading. Mikhail  Zadornov, head of the Duma Budget Committee, confirmed the fact  of violation of the regulation concerning the budget process to  a correspondent of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. This violation lies in  the fact that at the first reading the following were not  approved: 1) distribution of revenues between the federal budget  and budgets of components of the Russian Federation; 2)  appropriations for sections of the federal budget in absolute  amounts and in percent of the federal budget expenditures; 3)  the list of defended items and upper limits of appropriations  for them in percent of the federal budget expenditures (see  Article 11 "Provisions Concerning the Procedure of Examination  and Adoption by the State Duma of the Federal Draft Law 'On the  1994 Federal Budget'" adopted on 23 March 1994).    Thus, there was no "first reading" (in general, this word  combination can be used only in quotation marks). At best only  one-half of it took place. Mr. Zadornov attributed such a  situation to the fact that the Budget Committee was totally  unprepared for the competent first reading on 11 May, because it  could not receive and examine amendments and proposals by Duma  committees concerning budget sections and items. It is obvious  that on 11 May it was impossible to examine them just by hearing  and, therefore, in the Duma decree all this work was postponed  to the second reading.    The Committee on the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances is  now preparing for it. It can be assumed that its members, as  well as understanding deputies burdened or not burdened by the  obligation to lobby for someone's benefit, with fear or,  conversely, with hope are waiting to hear and see how the bomb  planted by the impatient chairman of the Duma and by leaders of  most fractions will explode ("Yabloko," "Russia's Choice," "12  December," and IPRF [expansion not given] were against the  submission of the budget for the "first reading" on 11 May and  all of them, except the last, also voted).    The smartest advocates of an increase in military  expenditures, who lost on 11 May, set off the fuse of this bomb.  At the end of last week they held parliamentary hearings, at  which it was decided to again raise the question of an increase  in expenditures on the "national defense" section. An amount was  also mentioned: in the bracket of 15 to 18 trillion rubles and,  of course, its lower limit was the limit of a compromise for  these lobbyists. However, it was stated that the budget deficit  should remain as before. From where will money be taken?  Apparently, part of this amount can be covered by taking  advantage of the proposals by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the  Committee on Economic Policy, for an increase in revenues from  foreign economic activity, privatization, and consolidation of  the resources of extrabudgetary funds. Deputies will hardly  agree with the fact that, in reality, all this will give  approximately 30 trillion rubles and, in principle, revenues can  be increased by part of this amount. However, since the revenue  obtained will be spent on defense, the missing part will have to  be collected through the redistribution of money from other  sections.    And then it can explode. True, at first everyone will hear  only the bang of the detonator--at the very fateful meeting of  the Budget Committee, where before the second reading it will  have to decide which amendments for budget sections and,  moreover, items of these sections (sic!) to recommend for  adoption by the Duma and which to postpone. All fractions are  represented in the Budget Committee, that is, it has lobbyists  of every stripe and level. Such a meeting will not manage to  make any sensible decision on what should be given priority.  However, even if some lobby is poorly represented in the  committee, it can have stronger positions during the counting of  the total number of deputies. Thus, it is possible that the  committee, inevitably gets into a stalemate situation. Not being  able to decide what amendments it should submit for approval or  rejection by the Duma, it will decide to submit all of them come  what may. A stalemate may not happen in the committee.  Nevertheless, in one way or another, the chamber has the last  word. The bomb charged by the Duma's violation of its own  regulation will explode precisely at the Duma meeting devoted to  the budget.    Need one say that, according to the results of the voting in  the chamber, the amount for individual items can exceed the  limit on a specific section, while the total increased  appropriations for sections in no way will amount to the  approved limit of the budget deficit? The practice of the  Supreme Soviet shows that this precisely happens.    Can it be foreseen that some lobby will meet another halfway  and will let it have part of the appropriations? Thus, the Duma,  most likely, will have either to expand the deficit after  repeated votes and additions, resulting from them, of sums, or  even before their beginning to declare the so-called "first  reading" of 11 May a phenomenon of the type "the devil got into  you" and to practice witchcraft, but only on paper, adjusting  revenues to the amount of expenditures maximally suiting  everyone. At the same time, it will have to try not to greatly  increase the deficit in order not to anger Viktor Chernomyrdin  very much, who from its rostrum once told the Duma with disdain:  "You are not worth shooting."    In fact, how can anyone give up something to someone else  when the budget gives little to everyone? For example, it cannot  even be assumed that there will be a majority wishing to reduce  the expenditures on state support for national economic sectors  (42,364.7 billion rubles were allocated). The following are the  biggest items in this section: the coal sector (5.9 trillion);  the agro-industrial complex (11.9); state investments (18.2  trillion, of which 14 go for construction, architecture, and  urban development; 2.4, again for the agro-industrial complex;  the rest, for debts for capital construction and into the fund  for the revival of the merchant marine). Larger or smaller  appropriations also go for the reproduction of the mineral and  raw-material base (almost 2 trillion) and the protection of the  environment, natural resources, hydrometeorology, cartography,  and geodesy (a little more than 1 trillion). In principle,  dealing with this section, agrarians can fight with coal  industry workers for the norm of distribution of the fund for  financial support for key sectors (the former receive 58  percent, while the latter, 42 percent of this fund), but there  can be no clear victory in this fight if it takes place. Of  course, 14 trillion for construction and architecture is a  tidbit, but deputies from regions will hardly permit anyone to  take them away. In fact, it is impossible to significantly  redistribute expenditures in this section and all those offended  will have to convince colleague deputies that the amounts  allocated here and there should be changed.    Nevertheless, lovers of distribution have a small field of  activity in the section "foreign economic activity" (a little  over 21 trillion rubles), where it is possible to reduce the  amount of credits to foreign states (1.4 trillion). However,  they have nothing more to do here, because the lion's share of  this section (12.8 trillion) is devoted to an investment program  (including the agro-industrial complex and the public health  system) at the expense of foreign credits and, as practice  shows, the connection of any money with agrarians' needs is the  most reliable undertaking. It is difficult to imagine the Duma  voting for a reduction in expenditures on social and cultural  measures (12.4 trillion)--rather a reverse effect is  possible--or on basic research and assistance for scientific and  technical progress (only 4.2 trillion). The "national defense"  section (37 trillion 126 billion) has already been mentioned  above. A vote for its increase alarms the deputy's soul when the  increase occurs at the expense of other sections. Nevertheless,  the deputy understands that, apparently, this will have to be  done through an increase in the deficit or machination with  revenues.    The section, where only 837.2 billion rubles are allocated  for the realization of international treaties on the  liquidation, reduction, and limitation of arms, is too small to  nip off something from it. Most likely, only the fate of social  and cultural measures can befall the 12 trillion for  law-enforcement activity and securities bodies: Everyone will  try to increase them. Court and procuracy systems receive 1.3  trillion rubles and also do not have chances to become the  object of redistributors' longings.    It will be more complicated with sections IX and XIV: state  administration (3.8 trillion) and financial assistance for other  levels of authority (1.8 trillion). The fractions that voted on  11 May against the "first reading" have already announced  repeatedly the need to significantly reduce expenditures on  state administration, but a response to their angry appeals has  not been noted in the hearts of the majority of deputies.  Although, if the majority somehow manages to connect such big  money with something concerning the president, there is a chance  for the Duma's intervention in these (and, especially, the  second) sections. A total of 5.9 trillion rubles are also  allocated for the replenishment of state orders and resources;  1.8, for the prevention and liquidation of the consequences of  natural calamities and extraordinary events; 6.5, for the  support of the North. All these expenditures are more or less  indisputable.    Apparently, nor is it possible to touch the liquidation and  servicing of the state (domestic and foreign) debt (16.8  trillion rubles). If deputies have enough strength, in  principle, they will be able to calculate that less (7.7  trillion) is spent on the domestic debt than on the foreign debt  and they will be indignant. True, one can hope that deputies  will want to probe the last section--"other state expenditures"  in the amount of 8.9 trillion, of which only approximately 2.5  trillion are allocated for items.    The possibility of adjusting revenues in order to reduce the  deficit to a level acceptable to the government has already been  discussed above. Despite official assurances that, in principle,  the situation with the receipt of revenues is normal, this is  not quite so. This is evidenced by Acting Finance Minister  Sergey Dubinin's nod during the battles in the Budget Committee  on 11 May in response to the statement by one of its members  that it would be good if in 1994 revenues exceeded 60 trillion  rubles, that is, less than one-half of what has been planned.  This statement is based on the dynamics of collection of basic  components of the revenue part of the budget during the first  and the second quarter of this year. Discussing revenues, nor  should it be forgotten that the share of the value-added tax,  from which the fund for regional support is formed, by no means  satisfies the potential majority of the Duma and it demands an  increase in this share.    In general, going back to the degree of reality of budget  revenue and expenditures figures written on paper, it should be  noted that in our country in the last few years they have run  far away, but in different directions, and could be stopped only  through the direct nonfinancing of certain sectors.</p>

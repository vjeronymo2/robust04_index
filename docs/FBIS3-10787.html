The main  target is former quaestor Sen. Julio Larosiliere who is today  accused of embezzlement. According to Edner Jean, it is in fact  the new weapon being used in the battle between the senatorial  blocs. Let us listen to his report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] It is a cynical and macabre game  that is currently being played in the Senate of the Republic in  which any type of blow is allowed, featuring the bid for power  that took Bernard Sansaricq to the head of the Senate and Firmin  Jean-Louis' attempt to get his seat back. Since then, the  attacks and counterattacks have been launched from both camps.  On 8 March, when armed civilians showed up to support the office  of Sen. Sansaricq, the battle for power took a definitive new  turn: the dialectic of weapons.    Today this Indian-wrestling match appears to be a settling  of  scores between the two quaestors, Julio Larosiliere, who cut off  the means of subsistence to senators of the GARD [Action Group  For the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty] and Osny  Eugene, whose signing right is no longer recognized by the  Ministry of Finance.    Meanwhile, to occupy his time, the quaestor of the Sansaricq  office has involved himself in an investigation into the  management of Sen. Larosiliere. On 10 March, during a news  conference, Osny Eugene presented the first elements in this  process. His control of the accounting and management of the  Senate of the Republic will allegedly prove that Julio  Larosiliere practiced embezzlement of the quaestorship funds. It  should be noted that this is not Osny Eugene's first revelation  on this matter. Just to show that he will give no gifts to his  main opponent in this clan warfare, Osny is attacking Julio  through his previous positions.    [Eugene] Sen. Larosiliere says that we do not respect  the New York pact. I would like him to tell us whether he  respected the CEP [Permanent Electoral Council] Act that he  signed, the same CEP to which he appointed his cousin as  treasurer. I would like to ask him if he respected the act of  validation of power of the 18 January senators. Today, for  personal reasons, he no longer recognizes them. I would like him  to confirm that he respected his own signature before he asks us  today to respect ours. Now, if he recognizes that he did not  respect his signature, he must find the courage to come to the  session room, resolve the conflict that he has with us, and  agree that from now on we establish the rules of the game and  respect the same principles for all. It is not a matter of  questioning this office.    This office has been legally elected. This office has  not been acclaimed. They [not further identified] will come as  simple senators and defend their viewpoints and simply continue  with their mandate. They have no other choice.    I must tell you that I strongly wish that Sen.  Larosiliere would take the necessary steps for once because ever  since Sen. Larosilere has been quaestor, he has never submitted  a report on financial operations, nor on the institution's file,  since August 1991.    [Jean] Meanwhile, the most senior member, Sen. Franck  Leonard, who has acknowledged the antagonistic offices, attempts  to call the wise, quote, to reason, unquote.    [Leonard] I met with Jean-Louis' office, and I met with  Sansaricq's office. My words are words of wisdom. I am working  so brothers who are separated over some triviality, some  quarrel, can again speak to each other.    [Jean] What are your hopes, Senator?    [Leonard] My hope is that the country can move forward. I am  trying to reconcile everyone. [end recording]    [Jean] Here is a Haitian mediator in a Haitian crisis.  However, to carry out his mission, Sen. Leonard will need not  only determination, but nerves of steel. [end recording]</p>

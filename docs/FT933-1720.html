			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London coffee and cocoa futures were weaker in the afternoon as both bowed to pressure from New York, but traders remained confident that the overall trend remained upward. The December delivery COCOA price temporarily dipped below Pounds 900 a tonne, but held above support at Pounds 890/895 and ended the day Pounds 13 down at Pounds 904 a tonne. Traders said the corrective move was to be expected, with investment funds and speculators looking for an opportunity to take profits. November delivery robusta COFFEE sank to Dollars 1,255 a tonne at one point as it followed the New York trend. But follow-through selling failed to materialise and most of the fall was recovered. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices remained weak in the afternoon, having slumped on liquidation at midday, and some analysts were projecting a fall to the Dollars 1,100-Dollars 1,105-a-tonne area for three months metal. Final business was at Dollars 1,119 a tonne, down Dollars 10.50 from Monday. The NICKEL market initially extended recent declines, crashing to a 6 3/4 -year low of Dollars 4,200 for three months delivery before support developed around Dollars 4,210 a tonne.

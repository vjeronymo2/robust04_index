			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Summertime, and the market's not easy - So perhaps this is an appropriate moment to mark time, and reflect on the notional portfolio's well-being - and its one disaster / Equities: Building a portfolio SUMMER. . . The sun's intense light made the sea gleam as it lapped the fine, sandy coastline. The temperature was 28 degrees Celsius - or, as I prefer to think of it, 82 degrees Fahrenheit. One of the most popular beaches in Poole, Dorset, was crowded - yet I was the only customer in the ice-cream shop on the beach. A few years ago, in similar conditions, there would have been a long queue. This summer there are signs that many people are still suffering from the effects of the recession, and are being cautious with their discretionary expenditure. This does not augur well for retail sales in general, and makes me view the stock market with caution. In the same way that many people now appear to eat ice-creams at home, rather than on the beach, and buy them cheaply from supermarkets, so more people are looking around for bargains. Perhaps this partly explains why cheap manufactured goods from abroad continue to pour into the UK, helping to worsen this country's balance of payments deficit. A devaluation of the pound would have helped to promote exports and made imports more expensive. Sadly, even a realignment of currencies has not yet happened. Despite this, as can be seen from the table, the portfolio has performed quite well. The takeover of Taveners by Toms Fabrikker, a Danish chocolate and confectionery group, turned an investment of Pounds 2,450 into cash of Pounds 5,985. Pentland has benefited by wider recognition of its excellent management and the company's strong brand names, such as Speedo swimwear, Pony sports shoes, and its shareholding in Adidas (which it has since agreed to buy). The company's strong cash holding, following the disposal of its interest in the Reebok sports shoe company, has also helped to highlight its attractions. The portfolio's one disaster (so far) has been its investment in Gestetner. Although I mentioned that this was a 'risky' investment, I had hoped that the downside risk would be limited by the company's association with Ricoh, the Japanese office-equipment and camera manufacturer. In September last year, it was announced that Ricoh had acquired 24.2 per cent of Gestetner, paying 250p per share. I felt that, if Gestetner did not perform, then Ricoh would take appropriate action to protect the value of its investment. The portfolio, therefore, bought 1,500 Gestetner shares at 183p each in October. Soon after that purchase, Gestetner issued a profits warning and the shares fell to 108p. Gestetner's results for the year to October 31, 1991, proved to be down 57 per cent over the previous year. However, the company had shed 10 per cent of its workforce, reduced its gearing level considerably; and I still hoped that, in the long term, Gestetner's performance would improve. Sadly, this does not appear to have happened. The company's interim figures, announced on June 17, showed pre-tax profits plunging from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 8.2m. Although net debt was again reduced and distribution difficulties in Europe apparently resolved, the immediate trading prospects for the company do not look too bright, unless there is an upturn in the economies of many of the countries in which Gestetner trades. Although I had earlier set a 'stop loss' level of 90p for Gestetner, I decided to cut losses sooner and so sold the portfolio's Gestetner holding for 132p per share, immediately I read the company's interim results on the teletext services on BBC2 and Channel 4. Taking a five-year view, Gestetner may well be a good investment. But at present I prefer to play safe. There is a strong temptation to sell my investment in Pentland and keep cash throughout the summer. I feel the US stock market has reached ridiculous heights, looking at price-earnings ratios of American companies and future prospects. There are warning signs, too, in the UK. There are several companies with minimal real assets that creative accounting and sharp PR firms have helped to hype to record levels. Their bubbles are overdue for popping, although one suspects that some of their directors are hoping for takeover offers before then. And if sentiment towards the market generally takes a downturn, due to a stagnant economic situation, then even good shares will fall with the bad. However, the portfolio would retain its Pentland holding as the Olympic Games coverage of Speedo and Adidas sportswear ought to boost the company's sales. But it is prudent to set a level at which the shares will be sold, should the market suddenly take a turn for the worse or begin a gradual downward trend. Pentland would be sold if the shares fell to 105p and it looked as if a general market slide would make them fall further. The portfolio might then consider repurchasing Pentland at lower levels. In the spring Quarterly Review, when Fisons shares were 356p, I commented: 'The company has announced a stream of bad news this year, but has all the bad news been discovered and released - or is there more to come?' I mentioned that the portfolio would consider Fisons shares at around the 285p level, provided they looked as if they would not fall much further. On June 12, Fisons warned that its interim pre-tax profits would be less than half the Pounds 95.2m figure achieved in the first six months of 1991. City analysts were quoted as being 'stunned by the unexpected announcement' and Fisons shares plummeted by 100p in a day to end up at 245p. In the absence of a bid, it looked as if Fisons could fall still further, and so the portfolio did not acquire any Fisons shares. However, the company will be monitored in the hope of detecting signs of either its 'bottom price' or takeover activity, and the portfolio could possibly then acquire Fisons shares. Perhaps the 'bottom price' (if no bid emerges) might be around 175-185p; and even at that level the portfolio would only risk buying 1,000 shares. There are a number of 'special situations' which the portfolio will watch over the summer months - but it is unlikely to purchase anything, as the summer sun is likely to induce lethargy in the market; and in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the October crash of 1987, investors will no doubt be reminded yet again of the need for caution. Special situations should, I hope, still be there - at lower prices - in the winter. Currently, cash in the building society or bank, even with reduced interest rates, still has some attractions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        HOW THE POUNDS 10,000 PORTFOLIO STANDS AFTER NINE MONTHS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                Number      Purchase                  July 3      July 3 Company        of shares   price (p)  Cost (Pounds)  price (p)   value                                                                (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pentland           3,500          99          3,465        127   4,490*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARES SOLD:                                    Sales price:  Proceeds: Gestetner          1,500         183          2,745        132    1,980  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Existing cash**                                                   7,514 Cash from dealings                                                          1,980 New cash total                                                    9,870  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                                            14,360  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Pentland includes pounds 45 from 1.3125p dividend paid on June 30. ** Cash includes accrued interest in Britannia Building Society's Capital Trust account.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke Ladbroke's shares have taken a beating since the election. Yielding around 10 per cent - some 50 per cent above the sector average - investors may ask if the selling has gone too far. Judging by yesterday's interim results, it is too soon for a re-evaluation. Hotels and property remain dependent on the elusive economic recovery. Added to that, Ladbroke has over Pounds 1bn of net borrowings. Though gearing is only 35 per cent, that has to be seen in the context of Pounds 831m of intangible assets on the balance sheet and about Dollars 1bn of property which may face further provisions. At present the company intends to maintain this year's dividend. What remains unclear is the extent to which the company's cash flow will allow it to increase the payment in future.</p>

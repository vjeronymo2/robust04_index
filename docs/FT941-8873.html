			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Trifast up 15p on offer price In first day dealings, shares of Trifast, the Sussex-based industrial fastener group, closed at 215p - a 15p premium over the offer price. Some 7.87m shares were placed by James Capel raising Pounds 15.7m, of which Pounds 12.2m went to Mr Mike Timms and Mr Mike Roberts, the founders who retain a 40 per cent stake in the company. Trifast is expecting pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 2.55m for the year to March 31. That would compare with Pounds 1.98m for 1992-93. Mr Malcolm Diamond, managing director, said he was 'delighted' with the take-up of the shares. He added that the listing was another step in the development of Trifast, which was looking for expansion both organically and by acquisition in the UK and abroad.</p>

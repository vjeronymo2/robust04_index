			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F> Left secretary, by Alberto Leiss in Rome; date not given: "Now  What Is Needed Is a United Opposition" -- first paragraph is  L'UNITA introduction]    [Excerpts] Rome -- "For me having survived the fall of our  myth, a fall that we are not responsible for historically  speaking, is already an achievement. The Left must get down to  working at an ideal form of reconstruction that cannot be  achieved in just one day. And it must do this as in unity.  This was the profound inspiration of our turning point."  Achille Occhetto, two days after the elections that suddenly  made an absolute right-wing majority emerge in Italy, wants to  further analyze and reason over what has happened. We met the  leader after his long meeting with the party secretariat. The  meeting was a little special, and in a way historical. In  addition to the majority executives closest to the party  secretary, who participated in the meeting, such as Claudio  Petruccioli, or Fabio Mussi, as well as Massimo D'Alema,  Giuseppe Chiarante, and Walter Veltroni, there were even  representatives from the "old guard" such as Tortorella,  Reichlin, Macaluso. Occhetto seems to be quite satisfied with  the meeting. The rumors and hints that were circulating over  these past few days as to a possible crisis in his leadership  have been dismissed. A discussion that is destined to become  more detailed has been launched. A meeting of the political  coordination committee and the regional secretaries is scheduled  for today. "Their contribution will be important," says  Occhetto, "also because of the great differences in the election  results in the various parts of the country. However, we then  will have to use all our cultural resources to start searching  for a national reality that we must get to know again, in a  Gramsci-like way."    [Leiss] I feel that I cannot do without asking a question, a  radical one: If this victory of the Right, of this kind of  Right, is the outcome of a political phase that began in 1989,  with the turning point at the Bolognina [party meeting where  Occhetto launched the reorganization of the party structure], do  you not think that a fundamental error was made?    [Occhetto] I am convinced that, if we had not changed  immediately and radically, we would have lost even more, and we  would have started losing earlier. The change enabled us to  remain in the game, to achieve the success of the progressive  mayors in the towns: an inheritance that remains. This enabled  us to enter into a new phase of the republic with the strongest  organized party appealing to the masses. And, above all, of  having forged an alliance with various progressive and leftist  forces. We must now maintain and develop this unity. On the  Left, and also with all the forces of the center, that will  place themselves in opposition to the Right. [passage omitted]    [Leiss] Are [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [National  Alliance leader] Fini, and [League Secretary] Bossi better than  the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani]?    [Occhetto] It is better for all of us to try to emancipate  ourselves after the end of the great Christian Democratic  mother. It is better to leave the comfortable shelter of  consociations, and to fully and authentically commit ourselves  to assuming full responsibility for the government. Our turning  point means that we can carry out this role in all its  legitimacy and dismiss an insidious campaign designed in every  way to depict us as also being responsible for the old system.  [passage omitted]    [Leiss] Let us come to "what must be done." You insist on  the unity of the progressives. Today, however, Communist  Renewal has turned down the idea of forming a single  parliamentary group, and has advanced the proposal of a  permanent "consultation pact."    [Occhetto] We have been talking about constituting a single  parliamentary group ever since our first meetings during which  the progressive alliance was formed. Even at that time there  was some resistance and difficulty. I insist upon the need to  choose any form of organization that can facilitate this unitary  process. We can discuss things over. But we must not abandon  our objective. Rather I will say more: We must be fully aware  of the fact that we are operating in a new majority system.  There are no longer any right-wing or left-wing oppositions and  a center government. There is a right-wing government and an  opposition that must know how to link up all its components. I  am therefore insisting in my appeal to the Italian Popular  Party. We must all start working together now to build an  effective opposition and a democratic alternative to the  government.    [Leiss] But what are the organizational prospects for the  progressives and the Left? That of a single pluralistic  political force?    [Occhetto] We must go ahead realistically. In the meantime  we will try to form a single parliamentary group. If we do not  succeed in this objective, it is already difficult to think of a  single party as of now. Of course, this remains our fundamental  inspiration. The idea of a great democratic force of the Left,  and of the progressives, laymen, and Catholics, lay at the basis  of our turning point. And we are determined to keep this door  open. We hope that many will decide to cross this threshold,  leaving behind them any negative residues of a divided past and  any fears of the prevailing hegemony of the others.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Velichko and Gennadiy </F> Yezhov]    [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- "We are all for directing the  main financial streams flowing from abroad into Russia right  into the investment sphere", Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin announced on Monday, speaking at a meeting of the  Russian Government Consultative Council for Foreign Investments,  which he chairs.    Chernomyrdin commented on upcoming legislation which  regulates the functioning of and privileges for businesses with  foreign investment.    According to the premier, the draft laws include a series of  major changes in the tax code for foreign investors. It is  proposed to free enterprises with foreign capital from the  profit tax for five years after registration, to remove the  limitations on capital movement, and to give foreign investors  (meaning businesses 100 per cent funded by foreign capital) the  right to own land if they construct a new building or expand  production.    In addition, businesses with foreign capital will be able to  keep all the profit in foreign currency which they receive by  exporting goods they produce in Russia. The import of machines,  technological equipment, spare parts, raw materials, and  component parts for production uses will not be subject to taxes  or customs duties.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR ANDERSON AND ORIOLES, THERE'S NO LOOKING BACK  </P> <P> With so many bad vibes, not to mention numbers, emanating from the general  direction of 1988, Baltimore Orioles center fielder Brady Anderson prefers to  dwell on the here and now.  </P> <P> Here being Anaheim Stadium, now being a Monday night game against the Angels  that the Orioles entered leading the American League East by 1 1/2 games.  </P> <P> Yes, those Orioles, who redefined the term cellar-dweller last season by going  54-107, adding their personal mark by losing the first 21 games of 1988.  </P> <P> But the Orioles are on top and Brady Anderson has led them. Well, he's led off  for them. Anderson, who played his college ball at UC Irvine, is hitting .253  from the leadoff spot. He leads the team in runs (15) and stolen bases (10).  </P> <P> "You can't say he's the entire reason for our success, but he's certainly  played an important part," Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson said.  </P> <P> The Orioles are the youngest team in the major leagues, with an average age of  26 years, 1 month. Anderson is 25.  </P> <P> Coming into Monday's game, they had been outhit, .240 to .257, but had managed  to outscore opponents, 77 to 73.  </P> <P> This has meant they've had to manufacture a few runs, and Anderson has been a  captain of industry. Typical of his season was Anderson's second at-bat Monday  against Jim Abbott of the Angels.  </P> <P> Anderson walked to lead off the third -- he leads the team in that category  with 10. He then stole second and third to set a club record for most steals in  April with eight. That put him past the likes of Luis Aparicio and Paul Blair.  </P> <P> He then scored the Orioles' first run on Cal Ripkin's sacrifice, scoring  without luxury of a base hit in a game the Angels rallied to win, 3-2.  </P> <P> "I want to get on and make things happen," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Things were happening last season for Anderson. Unfortunately for him, they  were the kind of things that has Anderson stating, "I don't want to talk about  last season."  </P> <P> But which last season is he talking about?  </P> <P> The season with the Boston Red Sox? One that started with great promise -- he  was hitting .276 at the start -- but ended with him going zero for 20 at the  plate and from Boston to triple-A Pawtucket by June 4.  </P> <P> Is it the penance he paid in the minors, where he began zero for 13?  </P> <P> Or is it the 53 games he endured with the Orioles after Boston traded him and  pitcher Curt Schilling for pitcher Mike Boddicker? Anderson hit .197 with  Baltimore, striking out 40 times in 177 at-bats.  </P> <P> Anderson prefers that the past stay in the past, as do most of the Orioles who  seem a bit sensitive anytime 1988 is mentioned.  </P> <P> "I didn't say a thing to them about last season," Robinson said. "What good  would it do? For us to win, kids like Brady Anderson have to produce, that's  all. There's no point in looking back."  </P> <P> Forced to do so, Anderson says the difference in him as a player this year and  last are just a few minor adjustments.  </P> <P> He modified his stance and forced himself to become a more patient hitter.  </P> <P> "It's not the only reason, but it's a distraction," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Said Robinson: "For a young player like that, it helps to know every day  exactly where and what you're doing. That way you can focus on your job and not  worry about other things."  </P> <P> What's to worry? Brady Anderson is in center field and 1988 is behind him.  </P></p>

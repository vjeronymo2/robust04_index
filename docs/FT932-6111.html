			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Major and minor equality at Eton - Nigel Spivey discovers bright minds, happy faces, and not the faintest whiff of boiled cabbage I HAD primed myself to breeze into Eton College unawed and brashly meritocratic. After all, travelling to Eton from Cambridge is not a simple matter of changing venues for the same traditions. Cambridge has women, Cambridge wears grunge; and no one would now believe, on the face of it, that the same monarch founded both Eton and King's College, Cambridge. For King's is, of all Cambridge colleges, the spearhead of grunge and good causes and gender awareness. At King's, they try to be as unlike Eton as they can. And since I generally admire the ideals of the dons at King's, I motored towards Eton if not with a chip on my shoulder, then at least smugly determined to advertise the fact that you can get to Cambridge perfectly well with a pauper's education. At 7pm on a warm May evening, the playing fields of Eton were murmurous with as many as 1,000 well-heeled athletes. This was the sight which filled Thomas Gray, the unofficial Eton laureate, with melancholy. He watched the boys at play and saw only 1,000 innocents, bound unwittingly for all life's disasters and disappointments. Who tosses the googly? Who sends that frisbee shimmering over the greensward? Unlike the poet, though, I found myself not only engrossed briefly in a game of cricket where whites were worn and handshakes exchanged, but also gladdened generally by the youth, the variety and the number of these people on the playing fields. Happy shining faces. Promise and energy everywhere. True, the nearby unbeautiful town of Slough and the M4 are blotted utterly from one's consciousness here. It is a little paradise of wickets, walls and running streams, ringed by great old horse chestnuts. But, instinctively, one felt this to be the rightful place, and these the rightful pursuits, of adolescent boys on an early summer's evening. Money talks. And public schoolboys, too. Later that evening, I sat down to dinner with some of the masters and the boys; and while I blundered along with my inquiries ('What is the Wall Game all about?' and 'Can you play Fives with four?'), I became aware that with these boys, who were lower sixth (or whatever Eton calls it), there was no need to condescend. They had wit, they had charm. They strung together sentences without the yeah, right, kind of, sort of, er, basically inarticulacy which characterises most modern youth-speak. You would happily have had their company every night of the week. I was not sure whether to envy or pity those who had to keep these bright minds occupied in the classroom. Dinner was cooked by a member of the fair sex, who in Eton argot is known as a dame. I never saw her, but understood a dame to be some sort of matriarchal presence prevailing at each of the 25 constituent houses of the school. The house I visited seemed rather elegant: not bestrewn with bachelor mess, and not a whiff of old sports socks or boiled cabbage. More well-spoken Adonises knocked about on a croquet lawn outside. The absence of girls did not appear to have stunted their growth, or turned them into rude uncivil brutes. I gathered from the masters that Eton has no plans to admit women as pupils and, against my own expectations, I found myself applauding that resolve. This school is about schooling. Sex can come later. There is no need to relate details of the lecture I gave to one of the school societies. It is enough to say that no speaker could have wanted a better-informed or more sparkling audience. Again, I was struck by the confidence of these Etonians. And their manners: each one appeared to have mastered the art of being polite without aloofness, charming without unction. The dress code of the evening was smart by most standards, but casual according to Eton rubric. The full sartorial glory of the place was not revealed until the morning when I stepped out onto the High Street and fell in momentarily with what appeared to be the dawn end of a society ball. Then I registered that these jaunty hedonists had files and textbooks tucked under their arms. Bunter Major, Flashman Minor, Widmerpool Minimus - all rendered equals, of a sort, by their white tie and tails. The master who had been my host waved me off. He, too, was in white tie: a scholar dressed as nattily as any courtier. I had heard him rise at 6am to begin his marking and preparation for the day. And I had realised already that the elegance of manners at Eton presented a deceptively fogeyish front to a system of education based on straight hard work - a system committed fundamentally to producing mature and lively minds. In short, I drove off as an Old Etonian manque, a troubled meritocrat. So money can buy you good grace. So shortage of cash is not the necessary foundation of a well-built character. No wonder Eton oozes such confidence. There is no need to change, even when all around is changing. For Eton is, in the best sense of the phrase, an island of class in a classless society.</p>

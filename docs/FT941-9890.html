			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Palestinian self-rule accord 'ready in a month', says Rabin The US, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday welcomed the Cairo accords which secured a crucial security agreement on Palestinian self-rule, giving much needed momentum to the peace process after months of delay. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, called the partial agreement 'an important step forward', adding that he expected 'another month will be needed to complete the details of the agreement . . . I hope a month will be enough. It could take a little more'. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said the documents went a step beyond the peace agreement signed in Washington last September, although some gaps still needed to be filled in. In Washington, President Bill Clinton called the Cairo understandings 'another big milestone'. The set of principles and agreement included resolution of the two most sensitive security issues - control over the Egypt-Gaza and Jericho-Jordan border crossings and security arrangements for Jewish settlers in Gaza which would divide the strip into three zones. Officials said this meant exclusive Palestinian control in the largest zone, exclusive Israeli control in another zone around the Jewish settlements and joint patrols, under Israeli control, in a third, smaller zone. Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said there was an agreement in principle on the third major obstacle of the past three months - the size of the Jericho area - but that a final decision would be taken when Mr Arafat meets Mr Rabin. After marathon talks and a last-minute crisis which threatened to derail the negotiations, Mr Peres and Mr Arafat initialled the documents shortly before midnight. The agreements, negotiated according to one Israeli official 'paragraph by paragraph, line by line, word by word', broke a seemingly interminable deadlock over the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. 'All the problems that we had before us we solved either completely in details or in principles and some details were left over for later,' Mr Peres said. Hinting at the difficulties over finalising border issues, he added: 'It was not simple because what we called security the Palestinians called dignity.' Mr Arafat said the two sides still had some issues outstanding and he had agreed to work with Mr Peres to overcome the remaining problems. Further talks are expected to resume at delegation level next week in the Egyptian resort of Taba. The breakthrough will unblock suspended talks on economic relations and the transfer of civilian administration to Palestinian hands. Once the remaining issues have been resolved, the stage will be set for Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat formally to sign a comprehensive protocol leading to an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho, which was to have begun on December 13. Although last night's documents must be approved by the Israeli cabinet and the PLO executive committee, this is expected to be a formality.</p>

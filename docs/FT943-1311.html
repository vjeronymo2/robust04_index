			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A transfer too late I bought 2,000 shares in an investment trust and received 400 free warrants. I had intended to place 1,500 shares in my general Pep within the prescribed 42 days, and I understood that 300 warrants could also be put in. But my broker told me this was not possible because trading in the warrants had begun already. If shares resulting from an investment trust launch are offered as a 'unit' with warrants attached, then both the shares and the warrants may be transferred into a general Pep until the day before the warrants are traded separately. On or after that day, and up to and including the 42nd day since the date of allotment of the unit, only the shares may be transferred. Warrants may not be bought directly from the 'market' for a general or single company Pep. (Murray Johnstone).

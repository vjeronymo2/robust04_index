			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies (53): Hopes high for a soft landing - United States / George Graham assesses the road ahead for the economy Over the first half of this year, the US Federal Reserve has reversed a long trend of falling interest rates with five successive rate increases. During this period the US economy continued to grow at a pace that, while not on a par with the more robust booms of the past, was still undeniably healthy. Announcing its move on August 16, when it raised the discount rate from 3 1/2 to 4 per cent and the Federal funds rate from 4 1/4 to 4 3/4 per cent, the Fed said it was responding to 'evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilisation'. 'The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed added. There has been very little challenge to the Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy. After all, with growth running at an annualised rate of more than 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, it was hard to quarrel with Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, when he told Congress that 'there seemed no reasonable purpose in maintaining the demonstrably stimulative level of short-term interest rates held throughout 1993'. Indeed, some other Fed officials come close to saying that they made a mistake by lowering interest rates too much in 1992 and 1993. Assessing the need for further monetary tightening, however, is a more difficult calculation, and one that hinges on one's assessment of the US economy's future path. One scenario, espoused by some private sector economists, sees the development of a typical mature expansion, in which the economy continues to grow faster than its potential, leading to pressure on capacity and wages. This in turn would lead to faster inflation, a sharp increase in short-term interest rates and, eventually, a recession. Another version, adopted by the Clinton administration and probably by a majority of private sector economists, sees a softer landing. In this version of events, the economy is already running out of steam, so that growth will slow down and inflationary pressures diminish without any need for the Fed to raise interest rates further. Although the White House has carefully avoided criticising the Fed for its latest interest rate increases, some Democratic senators have not been so cautious, and have accused Mr Greenspan of killing off the expansion prematurely. Somewhere between the two scenarios is the Congressional Budget Office, which sees the economy outrunning its potential to a modest extent, triggering some further tightening by the Fed to head off inflation, but no crash landing. Translated into forecasts for growth and inflation in 1994 and 1995, the disagreement is not large. While the administration sees real gross domestic product growing at 3.0 per cent this year, CBO forecasts 3.6 per cent growth. Both expect 2.7 per cent growth in 1995. This is close to the range compiled by the Fed from information provided by the members of central board and the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks, whose 'central tendency' is real GDP growth of 3 to 3 1/4 per cent in 1994 and 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 per cent in 1995. Nor is there wide disagreement on consumer price inflation. The administration expects 2.9 per cent this year to CBO's 2.8 per cent, within the Fed's 'central tendency' of 2 3/4 to 3 per cent. Both predict 3.2 per cent inflation in 1995, again within the Fed's range of 2 3/4 to 3 1/2 per cent. The principal objection to this miraculously soft landing, with no spike in inflation and no sharp recession, is that it has never happened before. Although the Fed can claim to have taken pre-emptive action before inflation started to show up in the price indices, the strains on industrial capacity and on the labour market which caused it to act may not be easily forestalled. The industrial capacity utilisation rate is now running above 83 per cent, a level which in the past has signalled faster inflation in goods prices - although these make up only a little over 20 per cent of the consumer price index if food and energy, prices of which are not dictated by capacity use, are excluded. At the same time, job creation at a rate of 285,000 a month in the first half of the year has lowered the unemployment rate to 6.1 per cent. Most US economists and policy-makers regard this as being at least very close to the economy's natural rate, accounted for by structural problems rather than by the ups and downs of the business cycle. 'Some people think we've passed it, some people think we have a little way to go. Very few people think we're very far from it,' said Alan Blinder, vice-chairman of the Fed. Other Fed governors say they are comfortable with the notion of a rate of around 6.25 per cent. 'I wouldn't quarrel with someone who said 6.0, but 5 is low and 7 is high,' said one. That implies that unemployment in the US has already shrunk to the point where any further decline could trigger pressure on wages and a rise in inflation, and so justifies the Fed's recent decision to continue tightening interest rates. Some economists, however, say there may be more slack in the labour market than this analysis of the natural rate would suggest. They point to indicators such as the volume of new jobs advertised, which has risen much less than in previous expansions. One element which has not affected the US economy nearly as much as economists predicted a year ago is the Clinton administration's deficit reduction programme passed in the 1993 budget. Although the budget deficit has fallen beyond the White House's wildest dreams - CBO projects Dollars 202bn, or 3.0 per cent of GDP, in 1994 and Dollars 162bn, or 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1995 - this fiscal contraction did not hold growth down to any noticeable degree. The picture may be less promising for the future. In the absence of severe action to curb government spending, particularly on medical programmes such as Medicare, which provides health insurance to the elderly, CBO sees the deficit starting to climb again in 1996, to reach 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2004. 'There is no reason to assume that the trend will be reversed after 2004 unless policies are changed,' CBO warns.</p>

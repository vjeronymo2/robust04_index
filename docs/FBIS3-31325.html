The chairman of the organization, Rupert Neudeck,  said on Deutschlandfunk Radio today that the man in question is  a 32-year-old born in Sarajevo who has held German citizenship  for a number of years. According to this information he was  returning to the Dalmatian coast after carrying out relief work  in Tuzla when the Bosnian Serbs kidnapped him from a bus  carrying Norwegian doctors. According to available information  the man is in good shape.    The German Government is making efforts through diplomatic  channels to achieve his release.    Neudeck expressed the hope that the work of the aid  organizations in Bosnia-Herzegovina could continue despite the  NATO ultimatum to the Serbs. [passage omitted]</p>

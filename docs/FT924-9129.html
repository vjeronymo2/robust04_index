			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Alarm at Major's decision to stall treaty ratification BRITAIN'S EC partners reacted with growing alarm and dismay yesterday to Mr John Major's decision to delay ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Throughout European capitals, senior officials expressed fear that the British postponement would inject fresh uncertainty into the future of Maastricht, increasing the risk of sowing popular doubts about the treaty. However, in London, the government added further confusion to the UK's timetable by refusing to rule out ratification before a second Danish referendum. In Brussels, a senior EC official warned that the Community was close to disarray as a result of the breakdown of the Gatt world trade talks, the British delay on Maastricht and divisions between member states on how to resolve Danish requests for exemptions from the treaty. Morale in the European Commission sank further in the wake of Mr Ray MacSharry's resignation as one of the EC's two Gatt negotiators on the grounds that he was being undermined by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. Mr Major said on Thursday that the crucial third reading debate in the Commons was likely to come in May after a Danish plebiscite had been held. However, questioned closely about whether Britain would conclude work on its Maastricht bill if Denmark postponed its referendum until later in the year, the official yesterday refused to be drawn and said the inquiry was hypothetical. He said that Denmark was expected to hold its plebiscite in May and that the UK intended to complete ratification in the current parliamentary session which ends in a year. 'The prime minister has to be sure he uses the right tactics to get Maastricht ratified,' the official said - suggesting that Mr Major is anxious to mollify his continental critics while not pro voking fresh uproar from opponents of the treaty within the Conservative party. Most interpretations of the prime minister's remarks to the Commons on Thursday were that he was insisting Denmark's position was clear before the Commons voted. His actual words, however, were predicated on the assumption that the Danes did hold their ballot in May. Tory opponents of the treaty will be furious if there is any attempt to hold a third read-ing vote before a Danish poll. Several dissident MPs are known to have supported the government in the crucial debate on Wednesday on the understanding that the process will not be concluded before the Danes have decided about the treaty. The Foreign Office has been clearly dismayed by the concession Mr Major offered to Tory backbenchers who threatened to vote against the government on Wednesday. The move has embarrassed Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who will have to explain the apparent further delay and the reasons for it to next week's meeting of EC foreign affairs ministers. The political fissures spreading through the EC are making it much harder to reach agreements on several outstanding issues on the already crowded Edinburgh agenda, notably the Delors II package which provides for increased funding for the poorer southern European states. It is also likely to prompt Spain to seek a delay in the planned enlargement talks with Finland, Austria and Sweden, according to a senior EC official. These are important to the British presidency, but they are contingent on a Delors II package and ratification of Maastricht.

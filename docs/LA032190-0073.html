			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAZELWOOD TRIAL ENDS; FATE RESTS WITH JURORS;  </P> <P> OIL SPILL: THE ATTORNEYS GIVE CLOSING ARGUMENTS. THE KEY QUESTIONS: WAS THE  CAPTAIN DRUNK? WAS HE RECKLESS WHEN HE TURNED THE SHIP OVER TO A MATE?  </P> <P> An Alaska prosecutor told jurors Tuesday that the Exxon Valdez plowed into  Bligh Reef a year ago this week because its captain, Joseph Hazelwood, his  "mind clouded by alcohol," gambled with safety.  </P> <P> The result, said Brent Cole in closing arguments at Hazelwood's criminal trial,  was "a captain's worst nightmare" and a massive oil spill.  </P> <P> But defense attorneys, who acknowledged that Hazelwood had a few drinks before  sailing, challenged the alcohol impairment allegations as "absurd."  </P> <P> The critical mistakes that doomed the supertanker were made by others, said  Fairbanks attorney Dick Madson, who pointed to the performance of the helmsman  and third mate on watch when the accident occurred.  </P> <P> "Captain Hazelwood is not perfect . . . he made mistakes," Madson told jurors  in his summation. However, he said, Hazelwood's errors were not sufficient "to  brand him a criminal."  </P> <P> The closing arguments marked the end of more than seven weeks of trial.  </P> <P> Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony, criminal  mischief, and three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating a vessel  while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted, he could  receive 7 1/4 years in prison and $61,000 in fines.  </P> <P> Following arguments, Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone instructed jurors on  the law for about an hour, then told them to select a foreman and begin their  deliberations.  </P> <P> They spent about 10 minutes behind closed doors, then retired for the day. They  were to resume this morning.  </P> <P> The six-woman, six-man jury faces two key questions:  </P> <P> Was the captain drunk, and was he reckless when he left the bridge in control  of his third mate while steering around ice floes?  </P> <P> The trial produced substantial conflicting evidence.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Hazelwood stayed in a bar all afternoon drinking before he  sailed. But shipmates said he had only two or three drinks and a Valdez florist  produced a receipt showing Hazelwood had been in her shop ordering flowers for  his wife when a prosecution witness claimed he was drinking.  </P> <P> Investigators and others noticed alcohol on Hazelwood's breath, but 21  witnesses who saw him before and after the accident testified that they noticed  no signs of impairment.  </P> <P> A blood alcohol test produced a reading of .061%, a level well below the  state's .10% minimum to presume he was drunk, but the test was taken more than  10 hours after the accident.  </P> <P> A state expert, using a controversial "retrograde extrapolation" formula, said  the captain could have had a blood alcohol level of .14 to more than .20 at the  time he boarded the ship.  </P> <P> Madson scoffed at that, showing jurors pictures of the narrow gangway that  Hazelwood had to cross to board his ship that night.  </P> <P> "That's the toughest sobriety test you'll ever see," Madson said, further  citing what he called the "one, solid, uniform voice" of witnesses who  unanimously testified that they saw no physical evidence that Hazelwood was  impaired by alcohol.  </P> <P> Cole also said that Hazelwood was not considering the ship's safety when he  left the bridge in Cousins' sole control. At the time, the ship was changing  course to go around glacier ice that had spread into the shipping lanes.  </P> <P> But Madson argued that Hazelwood left a qualified and competent mate in charge  of making what he called a routine and simple maneuver. What Hazelwood could  not foresee, Madson said, was that the helmsman would fail to follow the mate's  orders to turn the ship.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Cole said that Hazelwood himself had admitted responsibility for the  accident. He referred to earlier testimony by an Exxon supervisor that  Hazelwood, in a phone call an hour after the accident, "indicated that it was  his fault, he was to blame, that he had just gone down to do some paper work  when this happened and he should have been on the bridge."  </P> <P> The defense has taken pains to point out that Hazelwood considered himself  responsible in the timeless tradition of maritime captains who have lost their  ships. But his attorneys vigorously deny that he is a criminal in the fashion  of a drunk and criminally negligent driver.  </P> <P> Hazelwood, accompanied to the courtroom by his wife and father, listened  impassively as Cole declared that the since-fired captain "did not have safety  first on his mind when he drank" before sailing.  </P> <P> Cole, describing tankers as "ecological time bombs," said that when Hazelwood  drank he "chose to be a gambler . . . a risk-taker" who jeopardized the safety  of his ship.  </P> <P> "He gambled that . . . his drinking would not adversely affect his judgment and  decision-making that night. He was wrong."  </P> <P> Madson argued that drinking had nothing to do with the accident, that  Hazelwood's orders were proper and prudent and that he had no reason to doubt  the ability of his third mate, Gregory T. Cousins, to handle "a routine  maneuver."  </P> <P> During the trial Cole was sometimes frustrated by prosecution witnesses --  particularly crew members -- who often seemed to support defense claims that  the captain wasn't drunk or responsible for the grounding. In one surprising  attack during his final arguments Cole blamed the Exxon corporation.  </P> <P> Pointing to Exxon attorneys in the audience who have been present throughout  the trial, Cole suggested that the company had pressured employees to give  testimony favorable to Hazelwood.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see Exxon's interest . . . in seeing  Captain Hazelwood get acquitted," Cole said.  </P> <P> The assertion brought a scornful response from Madson, who said Exxon is one of  several entities -- including the state of Alaska and the Coast Guard -- who  have tried to make Hazelwood the scapegoat for their own failures.  </P> <P> "Politics . . . is the reason we're here today," Madson said.  </P></p>

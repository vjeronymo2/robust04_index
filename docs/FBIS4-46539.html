			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleg Falichev article: "Secrets of the Nuclear Monsters. </F> U.S. and Soviet Special Services Hunted for Them  Even...Underground During Cold War. What About Now?"]    [Text] Everything was going smoothly during the  preparations for one of the first treaties between the USSR and  the United States on limiting nuclear tests. The sides had  agreed that nuclear explosions do irreparable damage to the  environment. And in 1974 the treaty "On the Limitation of  Underground Nuclear Tests" was signed. But it remained  unratified for another 17 years (!) -- ratification only  occurring in 1991. Why?    First and foremost, owing to the lack of joint services to  monitor nuclear weapons tests and the top-secret nature of the  national services. During the Cold War everything relating to  the development and testing of nuclear monsters was top-secret.  Each state strove to retain its priorities in this sphere.    But the most surprising point was something else. No  intelligence service was able to obtain the information which  was obtained by one of the USSR Defense Ministry's special  services. It was set up by a 13 May 1958 government decree. As  the document said, it was aimed at organizing permanent  monitoring of nuclear weapons testing by foreign states and the  development of the requisite ways and means to carry out this  task.    A great deal for the technical equipping of the USSR Special  Monitoring Service was done by well-known Academicians I.V.  Kurchatov and M.A. Sadovskiy.... The very first chief of the  service and its creator was Doctor of Technical Sciences Major  General A. Ustyumenko, a State Prize winner.    Our Informational Note:    Research into the fundamental possibilities of  recording the physical phenomena accompanying nuclear explosions  began in the USSR in 1954-1957. That was when the first Armed  Forces subunits designed to monitor nuclear weapons tests abroad  were set up. The main result of this period was the practical  affirmation of the possibility of carrying out such monitoring.  The results obtained formed the basis of the USSR's position at  the Geneva talks on ending nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in  space, and underwater.    For 35 years the Special Monitoring Service managed to stay  "in the background," so to speak. (Although one of its  subdivisions -- the Eshery Seismic Laboratory -- has been  repeatedly mentioned by the mass media in connection with the  Georgian-Abkhaz conflict). Only today can we say something  about it. How is it organized? Is it true that it can  determine the location of any nuclear test at any test range in  the world?    The brain center of the Special Monitoring Service of what  is  now the Russian Federation Defense Ministry is located in  Moscow. This is where the organizational, operational, and  scientific center is based. The city of Dubna in Moscow Oblast  is home to the Information Collection and Processing Center.  And then there are special monitoring laboratories, automated  seismic stations, and autonomous observation centers dispersed  throughout Russia and even the CIS.    We entered the organizational and operations center. The  duty officer -- Lieutenant Colonel V. Yakovlev -- got up to meet  us. Alongside his console are automated workstations equipped  with visual display terminals and personal computers for the  duty seismologist engineers. Graphics of earthquake intensity  cover the walls. On the other side is a huge three-color  display screen for monitoring the seismic situation worldwide.    "This is where the data from observation posts located  around  the country is collated and analyzed," Lt. Col. Yakovlev said.  "We can time any nuclear explosion down to the second...."    Readers will clearly already have guessed that the main way  of detecting underground nuclear explosions is by seismic  equipment. In order to register the seismic waves generated  during the explosion special highly sensitive instruments --  seismographs set up in tunnels or wells -- are used. The more  powerful the explosion, the stronger the seismic wave at the  earth's crust and, consequently, the stronger the seismic  signals recorded. Information is then transmitted by satellite  to Dubna, where high-speed computers (up to 5 million operations  per second) process it.    For instance, seismic signals from the nuclear range in  Nevada reach us a few minutes later. And in a very short time  full details of the underground nuclear explosion (time, place,  yield, type, and so forth) are reported to the General Staff.  Data from other monitoring methods -- gas-aerosol, magnetic,  acoustic, and electronic -- are used to detect ground, air, and  space-based nuclear explosions. It is impossible to talk about  each one. I will just say a few words about the aerosol method.    There are observation posts on Russian territory equipped  with devices to sample the tiniest aerosol particles from the  air. These devices include very simple equipment --  gauze-covered tables to collect particles that settle on the  ground -- and complex filtration and ventilation devices (a kind  of huge vacuum cleaner that sucks in thousands of cubic meters  of air). That is on the ground. At high altitude specially  equipped aircraft are used to sample the aerosols.    The heart of the matter is that radioactive products of  nuclear explosions containing radionuclides can occur within the  aerosols. From them it is possible to determine the design  [ustroystvo] of the nuclear charge and find out whether the  state has gone very far in improving its nuclear weapons. This  is why at the central laboratory in Moscow aerosol samples are  impatiently awaited by physicists and analytical chemists armed  with numerous clever instruments.    Specialists can learn a lot, for instance, from using  gamma-spectroscopes with semiconductor detectors, mass  spectrometers, and laser analyzers. Ultimately all this helps  to improve the country's security and is a means of verifying  the fulfillment of treaty commitments by other states.    The experience of radiation research was very useful in  1986,  when many Special Monitoring Service specialists had to take  part in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster  in the first few days after it happened. They experienced all  the "joys" of working in the airborne and ground reconnaissance  zone and near the smoking reactor.    Our Informational Note:    Over the course of 35 years the Special Monitoring  Service has recorded more than 600 different nuclear explosions  at foreign test ranges by the United States, France, China,  Britain, and India. This has helped the country's leaders to  make not only appropriate but technically substantiated  political decisions in good time.    With the end of the Cold War the problems with monitoring  nuclear explosions ought to have diminished. But no, explosions  have begun to be carried out solely underground, in tunnels and  boreholes. And with small and exceptionally small yields. This  has made them harder to detect. Potential nuclear weapon states  have also emerged -- Israel, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, South Africa,  North Korea, and Brazil. The world has started talking about  the threat of nuclear terrorism. All this has made sober-minded  statesmen seek above all a political solution to this problem.  Talks under UN auspices have begun in Geneva on a comprehensive  nuclear test ban.    But only two countries currently have highly developed and  effective systems for monitoring nuclear tests -- Russia and the  United States. In other words, the realities of life itself are  forcing the two states to pool their efforts. In the quest for  new and guaranteed ways and means to prevent the proliferation  of nuclear weapons. What progress has been made?    "Plenty," Colonel V. Kovalenko, deputy chief of the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry's Special Monitoring Service, said.  "In December 1992 we signed a memorandum of cooperation with the  U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which  deals with similar issues. This makes it possible for us to  exchange seismic data of potential value for monitoring nuclear  weapons tests and to carry out joint experiments...."    This partnership is mutually advantageous, since both Russia  and the United States have already reached the limits of the  monitoring systems sited on their own territories. The  computerized exchange of information between the centers in  Dubna and Arlington near Washington is a substantial backup for  this monitoring. Moreover, in accordance with the treaty  between Russia and the United States on nuclear weapons  limitation and testing, we have obtained an opportunity to carry  out monitoring at U.S. stations (at Brekkhils [name as  transliterated], Newport, and Tulsa), while they are able to do  so here (at Obninsk, Arti, and Novosibirsk). It is interesting  that other countries are already expressing interest in  cooperating with the Special Monitoring Service, rightly  believing that this will promote the process of global  verification of a nuclear test ban and the speedy conclusion of  an international treaty in this sphere.    There are also some purely civilian aspects to the Special  Monitoring service's work. Last year it was decided through the  Russian Federation Government decree "On the Formation of a  Federal Seismological Observation and Earthquake Forecasting  System" to pool the efforts of seismologists from the Russian  Academy of Sciences, the Special Monitoring Service, and certain  other departments to purposefully work on curbing such a  terrible force of nature as earthquakes -- even though  forecasting them is quite a complex and risky business currently  being cautiously tackled by only a few scientists around the  world. But the Special Monitoring Service has done some good  groundwork in this area too. A unique data base on earthquakes  since 1978 has been compiled and a map of earthquake-prone areas  has been drawn up....    Huge plans are afoot. There is a readiness to cooperate with  Aeroflot and other airlines in issuing information on storm  fronts. And to cooperate with customs officials in detecting  certain narcotic substances with the help of air analyzers....  But, nonetheless, the main aim is to create a global computer  network producing information on nuclear weapons, to become  integrated into an international system for the seismic  monitoring of nuclear weapons tests, and also to use space-based  and other means for purposefully monitoring nuclear weapons.  Almost everything -- experience, a high level of technical  equipment, and unique specialists who training takes many years  -- is in place to accomplish this.    The United States and Russia are currently not carrying out  nuclear tests. I would recall that we have declared a  moratorium until September 1994. As has the United States --  although B. Clinton is said to have already promised to extend  it for another year. We hope to goodness he does. But the  Russian Federation Defense Ministry Special Monitoring Service's  work will not, I repeat, be diminishing. After all, its very  existence is a kind of guarantee and precondition for a  nuclear-free world.</p>

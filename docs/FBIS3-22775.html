This can result in  India taking a lead over Pakistan not only in the nuclear  program but also in the field of conventional weapons, thereby  causing difficulties for Pakistan's defense.    The discriminatory treatment meted out by the United States  to Pakistan does not beggar description. In spite of the fact  that Pakistan has been tied up with the United States through a  defense agreement since 1959, Washington never felt it necessary  to maintain its friendship with Islamabad, except for a brief  period during the Afghan war when the U.S. realized the danger  that the advancement of the former Soviet Union toward the hot  waters would have jeopardized the global power equilibrium.  However, Washington turned its eyes away from Pakistan after  the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan and its  subsequent disintegration, and the same Pakistan, which was said  to be a cornerstone of the U.S. foreign policy during the Afghan  war, discovers itself being called a "fundamentalist,"  "terrorist" state and the standard bearer of the "Islamic bomb."  The United States then not only stopped its own aid to Pakistan  but also began efforts to persuade the entire world to follow  suit. Japan, which has been the largest aid donor to Pakistan,  also stopped providing assistance under the influence of the  U.S. propaganda and pressure, and categorically stated to the  then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in December 1992 that it  would be difficult for Islamabad to receive any Japanese aid if  it did not forgo its nuclear program, reduce military  expenditure, and create a favorable atmosphere for the purpose.  Two days ago, Japan once again reiterated its conditions and  showed a red signal to the new Pakistani Government as well.    It is ironical that India has also openly declared itself to  be a nuclear power in the Indian Subcontinent, but neither the  United States nor Europe nor Japan has objected to India about  this. New Delhi, actually, enjoys complete freedom in  stockpiling enriched uranium, making advances in the development  of delivery systems, and in amassing conventional weapons.  Thus, deliberate attempts are being made to weaken Pakistan's  defense, which is apparently aimed at leaving us on the mercy of  New Delhi and forcing us to accept India's supremacy.    Pakistan's nuclear scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan has said  that weakness in any country's defense is tantamount to inviting  enemy's aggression. He has suggested that we should manufacture  our own weapons, so that we can become a nuclear power by  achieving self- reliance in defense equipment and defend our  sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The  Pakistan Government should also urge the United States to  forsake its discriminatory and biased attitude toward Pakistan  and tell Washington that if it desires to help end the nuclear  arms race in the Indian Subcontinent, then it should adopt a  realistic and equitable policy and also pressure India, along  with Pakistan, to roll back or freeze its nuclear program. It  is the moral duty of the valiant United States to ensure the  supply of F-16's and other equipment for which it has already  received payments, so that Pakistan can be able to defend itself  from India at least in the field of conventional weapons. Trade  ethics also demand that we must get the items for which we have  already made payments. We have been emphasizing in these  columns that the country's real strength lies in its internal  unity and national solidarity. We will have to turn ourselves  into an impregnable (?wall) to defeat the enemy. Our leadership  should therefore pay attention to this issue as well.</p>

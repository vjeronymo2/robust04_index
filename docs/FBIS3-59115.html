"The support of the presidency of the  European Union" to this effect "would be of great importance for  the future prosperity of Lithuania, as well as for the stability  and security of the whole Baltic region," the letter states. It  will be recalled that the Twelve found the negotiating  directives proposed by the European Commission for the Baltic  states to be too limited and have expressed the intention of  going further in creating closer ties with these countries.</p>

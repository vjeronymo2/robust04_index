			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (3): Jockeying for position - Europe BRITISH AIRWAYS' decision to take over the ailing Dan-Air's scheduled European routes is just the latest jockeying for position among UK and European airlines ahead of the planned liberalisation of European air routes when the single market comes into force next year. Virgin Atlantic's Richard Branson, for example, who pulled out of a deal with Dan-Air, is looking at the prospects for developing a European service to rival his long-haul operations to the US and Tokyo. The key question, however, remains how far and fast the plans to de-regulate European air routes will come into effect - or will the determination by some national governments to protect their airlines make the changes more apparent than real? The agreement reached by EC transport ministers last June has three main elements to it. It allows airlines of one EC country to establish airlines in other EC countries; it creates pricing freedom in theory, subject to certain restrictions; and will enable any EC airline the right to pick up traffic within one member state and carry it on to a second destination within that country. For example, BA flying from London to Frankfurt will be able to pick up passengers in Frankfurt and carry them on to Berlin. But, as with many EC developments, the proposed moves do not go as far as some airlines would have wished. A full 'pen skies' policy, for example, would have allowed EC airlines the right to fly freely inside another EC country; this has been delayed until April 1997 at the earliest. British Midland has been the most vocal in its opposition to the present restrictions on European air routes. In a recent report, it pointed out that 11 of the 15 busiest air routes in Europe continue to be served by the two respective leading airlines from each country, charging identical business-class fares and with almost identical schedules. 'The EC needs to back up its proposals with real teeth, by loosening the financial ties between states and their airlines and ensuring it has a mergers and acquisitions policy in place to prevent a further reduction in consumer choice,' argued Sir Michael Bishop, BM's chairman. BM estimates that British business travellers are paying more than Pounds 200m a year more than they need to because of the airline duopoly on principal European routes. More competition and lower fares could prove something of a problem for European airlines, especially as they rely heavily at present on business class passengers to keep routes profitable. BA's Club Europe operation, for example, earns the airline nearly half its European revenue even though Club passengers make up just a quarter of its total. Moreover, there are clear signs that European business travellers are becoming increasingly unwilling to pay higher fares on short-haul routes. Both Lufthansa and Swissair, for example, have finally abandoned their first class cabins in Europe to concentrate on business class instead. But even with improvements in service both on the ground and in the air, many executives are deciding to trade down and fly economy on short-haul European routes.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHICAGO GALLERY TO SELL 11 WORKS TO BUY BRANCUSI  </P> <P> The Art Institute of Chicago is putting 11 works on the auction block,  including paintings by Monet, Picasso, Modigliani, Utrillo and Degas, to raise  the $12-million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, "Golden Bird," by  Constantin Brancusi.  </P> <P> The Art Institute, which in the past has resisted selling works to purchase  others, is making an exception in this case, the Chicago Sun-Times reported  today.  </P> <P> "To let the Brancusi leave is unthinkable," Director James N. Wood said. "The  work is seminal to Chicago's reputation as a center for modern art."  </P> <P> The Brancusi is owned by the Art Club of Chicago, which is selling it to buy a  new gallery for its other works. Wood said the Art Institute already has  possession of the sculpture and is committed to paying $8 million by the end of  June and $4 million more over the next 10 years.  </P></p>

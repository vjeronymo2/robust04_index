			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Wesfarmers predicts profits improvement WESFARMERS, the Australian agricultural and energy group, expects net profits this year to improve on the ADollars 63.05m (USDollars 42.3m) achieved for 1991-92, Reuter reports from Perth. Wesfarmers, headed by managing director Mr Trevor Eastwood, reported a net profit of ADollars 26.1m for the six months ended December 1992, up from ADollars 19.33m a year earlier. It said the profit rise in the six months reflected improved results from its energy operations and a strong contribution from Bunnings, the 44 per cent-owned timber group. Wesfarmers said lower earnings from its fertilisers and chemical operations were partly due to reduced margins, but mainly due to the late 1992 harvest. Most fertiliser sales occur in the second half of the fiscal year. It said its rural trading operations achieved a strong earnings improvement, but the insurance operation was adversely affected by significant losses from hail damage to crops throughout Australia. Wesfarmers said dairy, transport and retail activities all achieved improved results over the six months. ***** Placer Pacific, the Australian gold mining group 76 per cent owned by Placer Dome of Canada, increased after-tax profits by 11 per cent to ADollars 74.9m (USDollars 50.2m) in 1992 on turnover 5 per cent higher at ADollars 607m. The company is paying a dividend of 3.5 cents a share, having omitted the payment a year ago. Placer Pacific said the higher profits stemmed from increased sales volumes from higher gold production and lower costs, partly offset by lower metal prices. ***** Westfield Holdings, the Australian shopping-centre developer and manager, staged an 11 per cent rise to ADollars 15.6m (USDollars 10.4m) in after-tax profits for the six months ended December 1992. The dividend is going up from 5.25 cents a share to 5.75 cents. Westfield said it expected the increase in dividend will be 'at least maintained' for the final payment. Westfield noted that three new shopping centres under its management opened in the period, while it was also appointed developer/manager of another. The total number of centres now under the company's management is 22, with more than 1.1m sq metres of space to let and 3,750 tenants. ***** UDL Holdings of Hong Kong has completed a HKDollars 142.6m (USDollars 18.4m) share placement, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. The private placement with institutional and private investors in New York, London and Hong Kong, involved 92m shares at a price of HKDollars 1.55 per share. It represents 19.1 per cent of the capital of UDL, a marine and civil engineering works group. Amoy Properties is launching a three-year multi-currency loan facility worth HKDollars 1bn through its unit, Amoy Treasury Ltd, bankers said.

Mr Goh said the factory in Nilai produced deep groove and spherical roller bearings of which 90 per cent were exported to the Asia-Pacific region. He claimed that SKF had 20 per cent of the global market. ***** The Saudi Monetary Agency (SAMA) has intervened to control stock market share offerings and halt what it describes as illegal action by some Saudi investors, Reuter reports from Manama. According to locals bankers, SAMA has moved to dampen stock market speculation by asking banks to reduce credits that investors use to purchase shares. 'SAMA's action was aimed at discouraging investors from borrowing money to speculate in the Saudi stock market,' a banker said. He added that SAMA's move also aimed at halting illegal action by some Saudi investors who buy names to improve their chances in the allocation process.</p>

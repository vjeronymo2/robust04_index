			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEOUL SINGER;  </P> <P> DUK SOON NAM WILL ADD SENTIMENTAL NOTE TO GARDEN GROVER CONCERT  </P> <P> Expect some sentimental and delicate singing before the live cannons and bells  blow away you and the neighbors around the Village Green Park in Garden Grove  on Saturday.  </P> <P> The noisy part will come when the Garden Grove Symphony puts the finishing  touches on its annual "Summer Symphony in the Park" concert with Tchaikovsky's  rousing, patriotic "1812" Overture.  </P> <P> Nobody these days dreams of playing this music without real cannons blasting  and big bells clanging. Certainly not conductor Edward Peterson and the Garden  Grove Symphony.  </P> <P> They're all part of the composer's celebratory portrait of the Muscovites'  triumph over Bonaparte and of his humiliated, defeated troops burning the city  as they withdraw from it.  </P> <P> But earlier in the concert, there will be the harmonious, barbershop-style  singing by the 40-member Orange Empire Chorus and two Korean folk songs sung by  soprano Duk Soon Nam.  </P> <P> Nam will sing "Diamond Mountain" and "Lovely Flower," and if her eyes grow a  little misty during the first of these, it's because she's thinking of her  parents.  </P> <P> There is a real Diamond Mountain, Nam said through a translator this week. But  it's located in closed-off North Korea.  </P> <P> "Anyone who looks at Diamond Mountain feels wonderful," Nam said. "It is a  little different from any other mountain in Korea. Nothing else is like it.  </P> <P> "Every time I sing this song, I remember my parents, who (fled) from North  Korea. They miss it."  </P> <P> The song, says Nam, tells "in a beautiful melody" the effect the mountain has  on people. "But there is also a little story about freedom and unity," Nam  said.  </P> <P> Still, the soprano is not greatly optimistic that she or her parents will soon  have a chance to see the mountain again.  </P> <P> Unity of the two Koreas remains a distant goal, she feels.  </P> <P> "We can unite through music," Nam ventured cautiously.  </P> <P> A dramatic soprano who sings opera and lieder, Nam studied in Germany and Italy  as well as in her native county. She splits her time between Orange County --  which has one of the largest congregations of Korean-Americans in the nation --  and her home in Seoul, Korea.  </P> <P> She last sang with the Garden Grove Symphony on a New Year's Eve program in  1989.  </P> <P> Nam also is one of the founding directors of the Orange County Korean-American  Children's Choir, a chorus of about 50 kids, which was started last year.  </P> <P> Future plans include singing in a new opera in Seoul and with the Santa Ana  Symphony, directed by Chong J. Park, on a date not yet set next year.  </P> <P> Who: Korean soprano Duk Soon Nam will sing on the Garden Grove Symphony's  "Summer in Park" program.  </P> <P> When: Saturday, Aug. 25, at 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: Village Green Park, Euclid and Main Streets, Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Garden Grove Freeway (22) to Euclid exit; north to Main Street.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: Admission is free.  </P> <P> Where to call: (714) 534-1103.  </P></p>

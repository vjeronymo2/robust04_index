			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Bank holds UK rate THE UK money markets ended the week on a more sober note, with rates indicating no change in monetary policy for at least the next month. Speculation had been rife earlier in the week that the Bank of England would indicate an interest rate cut when it announced the retail price index yesterday. In the event, the Bank disappointed the optimists, keeping its assistance near the current interest rate level of 10 1/2 per cent. The Bank had 'brought the market around to their way of thinking,' said a senior trader. 'There are a lot of tired bulls out there,' he added. As a result, the futures market had fallen, with the March short sterling contract closing lower than in recent days at 89.76. The one-week interbank rate was firmer at 10- 9/16 per cent. Even one-month money was pessimistic about a rate cut, closing at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent. Further out, things were looking a little brighter with the key-three month interbank rate holding steady at 10 7/16 - 5/16 per cent. Overnight rates were extremely volatile yesterday, trading between 9 and 11 1/2 per cent. The rate closed higher at 11 1/4 per cent. During the day, the Bank twice revised the forecast market shortage, with the final figure pitched at Pounds 1.15bn. Treasury bills and maturing assistance accounted for Pounds 1.103bn of the shortfall, the rise in note circulation a further Pounds 530m, and bankers' balances below target were expected to take out about Pounds 100m. Exchequer transactions were initially forecast to add Pounds 415m back in. By lunchtime, the Bank had stepped in with assistance of Pounds 830m. The injection was comprised of Pounds 115m in band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, with the rest in repurchase agreements at 10 7/16 per cent for resale on March 4,5 and 6. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 215m worth of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and gave late assistance of Pounds 50m. This left the market Pounds 55m short. Tax payments flowing out of the system forced up call rates in Germany to 9.60/65 per cent, compared with Thursday's 9.50/60 per cent. Liquidity was also being squeezed by payments due on the DM1.22bn four-year notes launched this week by the German railroad authority. In the US, the Federal Reserve did not operate in the market. Funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent, close to the presumed target of 4 per cent.</p>

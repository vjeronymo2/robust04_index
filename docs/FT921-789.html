			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sharp decline at Bostrom Bostrom, the vehicle seating and specialist engineering group, saw pre-tax profits for 1991 dive from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 830,000 on turnover down from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 33.3m. Directors said that for the second successive year many of the markets served by its three divisions, KAB Seating, KAB Pressings and Specialist Engineering, contracted. Hardest hit by the recession has been specialist engineering where the majority of work is sub-contracted from larger manufacturers, primarily around the Midlands. The total dividend is maintained at 6p with a proposed final of 3.5p. Earnings per share were 6.4p against 24.8p.</p>

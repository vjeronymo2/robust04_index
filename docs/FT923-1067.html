			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ wool production to drop 7% WOOL production in New Zealand is expected to fall by at least 7 per cent this season to 205,420 clean tonnes, the New Zealand Wool Board said, Reuter reports from Wellington. 'The expected fall will result mainly from poor seasonal conditions, which are expected to reduce wool production per head by 5.2 per cent,' the board said in a statement. A fall in sheep numbers will also contribute to the drop. Shorn wool is expected to be down by 5.2 per cent, while slipe wool will be down by 17.3 per cent. The statistics were calculated by the board's economic service which said they may be on the high side. 'The way things have been lately, with the atrocious winter conditions and stock losses, plus a slow wet start to spring, I believe we may see an even greater fall in wool production,' board chief executive Grant Sinclair said. 'Supplies of wool at auction could be very tight during the season,' he said. Production falls are expected to be the greater in the South Island, with a 9.7 per cent drop, compared with a 3.5 per cent drop in the North Island. The wool season runs from July 1 to June 30.</p>

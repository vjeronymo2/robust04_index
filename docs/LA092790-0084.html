			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> COUNCIL LIMITS MEETINGS  </P> <P> Malibu's unofficial City Council voted Tuesday to meet twice monthly instead of  weekly, beginning in November.  </P> <P> With the selection of a city attorney, an interim city manager and City Hall  space behind them, several council members said there was little point in  continuing to meet weekly until incorporation occurs. However, the council  decided to begin the new schedule in November because agenda items have already  been set for three Tuesdays in October.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECALL LEADERS CLAIM 5,000 SIGNATURES, BUT OTHER GROUPS REFUSE TO GIVE SUPPORT  </P> <P> A group of gun enthusiasts claims to have gathered about two-thirds of the  signatures needed to force the entire City Council into a recall election, but  so far it apparently has failed to woo the support of other community  organizations.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the Whittier Voters Coalition, which includes members of the  National Rifle Assn., last week announced that they had collected about 5,000  signatures on petitions that condemn the council's four-month-old ban on the  sale and possession of semiautomatic assault weapons.  </P> <P> The city statute will become moot after January, when the statewide law against  assault weapons takes effect, City Manager Thomas Mauk said.  </P> <P> The petitions also accuse Mayor Victor A. Lopez and Councilmen Gene Chandler,  Myron Claxton, Thomas K. Sawyer and Robert M. Woehrmann of "abuse of power" for  failing to limit widespread apartment construction in this 12-square-mile city.  </P> <P> "We're convinced that we need a new City Council," said Whittier Voters  Coalition head Paul Schwemler at a planning session recently, "one that is  sensitive to the needs and wants of the citizens of the city of Whittier."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confidence Expressed  </P> <P> The councilmen, in telephone interviews, stood by their decision to outlaw  military-type assault weapons. They said they were confident that the coalition  will not be able to collect enough signatures to force a recall election.  </P> <P> "I am confident in the citizens of Whittier," said Lopez, who added that he has  lived in the community for 50 years. He said the council "did the right thing"  by unanimously passing the anti-assault weapon ordinance in March.  </P> <P> The Whittier Voters Coalition has until 5 p.m. Aug. 22 to deliver the  signatures of 7,500 registered voters to City Clerk Gertrude L. Hill. The  signature-gathering is the second step in the lengthy process to call a special  election. Once the petitions are delivered, the city clerk has 30 days to  certify the signatures.  </P> <P> Schwemler and 26 other gun advocates met at the La Mirada Library to rally  support of other activists who may be dissatisfied with the council. But no  other community organization sent a representative.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview before the meeting, Schwemler said leaders of the  Whittier Peace Coalition, the Whittier Conservancy, the Mark Twain Democratic  Club and the Parent Teachers Assn. had joined the recall effort of the Whittier  Voters Coalition and would attend the planning session.  </P> <P> The La Mirada Library was chosen so the various groups, who disagree on a  variety of subjects, would meet on "neutral ground," Schwemler said. The  meeting was advertised in a local newspaper.  </P> <P> "We have a common objective here," Schwemler said. "We're putting our  differences aside for a common goal. Our dissatisfaction with the City Council  is as uniform as it can be."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deny Supporting Coalition  </P> <P> But in telephone interviews, leaders of the other organizations denied that  they support the recall or the goals of the Whittier Voters Coalition. Some of  them claimed that they were never invited to the meeting, and questioned the  motives of the Whittier Voters Coalition.  </P> <P> "They have tried to align themselves with our group and causes before," said  Mike Sullens, president of the Whittier Conservancy, a nonprofit organization  that has been critical of housing development and proposals to tear down  several historical buildings, including the Whittier Theatre.  </P> <P> "I don't understand why they keep insisting" that the two groups have joined  together to oust the council, Sullens said.  </P> <P> Gerald Haynes, a member of the Whittier Peace Coalition, said none of the  group's members have been working with the pro-gun group. "It would be safe to  say that our members generally agree with the gun-control (ordinance). I'm not  quite clear where the (gun advocates) are coming from."  </P> <P> And Councilman Claxton disagrees with charges that he and the other council  members are out of touch with their constituents and repeatedly ignore them. He  pointed to the pro-gun group's apparent failure to gather the support of  leaders of some other community groups.  </P> <P> "It's just wishful thinking for them to assume that others will join their  cause," Claxton said.  </P> <P> But Schwemler shrugged off the lack of response by leaders of other community  groups to his group's recall effort. "There are a lot of people out there who  support this for different reasons," he stressed. "If they (the leaders) want  to work with us fine. If they don't fine."  </P> <P> The Whittier Voters Coalition began its petition drive in April after the  council joined a growing number of government agencies in condemning  semiautomatic weapons. After five schoolchildren in Stockton were killed in  January by a man using a semiautomatic assault weapon, more than a dozen cities  -- including Los Angeles, Carson and Beverly Hills -- passed restrictions on  such weapons.  </P> <P> State lawmakers have also passed restrictions on military-type weapons, but the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors narrowly rejected one for  unincorporated county areas.  </P> <P> In the Southeast area, Compton, Long Beach and Lynwood have also passed a  variety of laws against assault weapons. Bellflower council members had  considered passage of one in February, but never voted.  </P></p>

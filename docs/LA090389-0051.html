			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WRITER'S ROLE  </P> <P> Both the American and Vietnamese veterans communities found "Casualties of War"  offensive. The portrayal of Vietnam War participants as kidnapers, rapists,  murderers and cowards appears to be evidence that Hollyweird has tired of  pro-eteran films such as "Rambo" and "Uncommon Valor."  </P> <P> Instead of presenting all the facts, director Brian DePalma smeared those who  served while others hid behind college deferments or fled to Canada.  </P> <P> NICHOLAS CAIN  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Greed alleged in insider deal case: 'Network of friends' employed by financial institutions deny charges in biggest British prosecution A 'NETWORK of friends' employed by financial institutions used price-sensitive inside information about imminent takeover bids to make profits for themselves or clients, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday. In the case, the biggest UK insider dealing prosecution, five people deny charges under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. Mr David Gray, formerly a stockbroker with Morgan Grenfell Securities, faces two charges of unlawfully communicating unpublished price-sensitive information to another person, two of dealing on the basis of such information and one of counselling or procuring another person to deal. Mr William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, is accused of two offences of dealing and one of communicating. Miss Catherine Rowlands, who was employed in the corporate finance department at Samuel Montagu, is charged with three offences of communicating information. Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester, faces three dealing charges. Mr Keith Tondeur, formerly UK head of principal trading and sales with Banque Paribas, faces one dealing charge. The alleged offences relate to three takeover bids in 1988. Hawthorn Leslie Group, the USM-quoted cellular phone company, acquired ECT Cellular and London Car Telephones; Australian company Goodman Fielder Wattie made a bid, which lapsed, for UK foods group Ranks Hovis McDougall; and Mecca Leisure acquired Pleasurama, the leisure group. Mr Peter Clarke, prosecuting for the Department of Trade and Industry, said some of the defendants had passed information to others, who had acted on it by dealing in shares or by passing it on and advising other people to deal. Profits had ranged from just Pounds 1,200 to Pounds 20,000, but the case concerned an important principle about the misuse of inside information. Mr Clarke said the jury would hear several hours of recorded telephone conversations between Mr Gray and other defendants peppered with references to being unable to talk freely, or arrangements to see or speak to each other out of office hours or away from colleagues. Mr Clarke said the five's motives had included personal greed, winning the respect of others, repaying favours and enhancing their own reputations. But whatever their motives, 'the fact is that it was illegal and they all knew it'. Miss Rowlands had been the source of the inside information about RHM and Pleasurama, Mr Clarke alleged. Samuel Montagu had been GFW's main adviser and Mr Gray would be heard on the tapes referring to 'Wickets', Samuel Montagu's codename for GFW, in a conversation with Miss Rowlands. Samuel Montagu had also acted for Mecca. Miss Rowlands had not been part of that team but had learned of the pending deal from a colleague who had warned her not to buy Pleasurama shares, Mr Clarke said. The trial continues today.</p>

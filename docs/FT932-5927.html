			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New highs on Pacific Rim as Nikkei declines WORRIES over a higher yen and corporate insolvency troubled investors, and share prices declined by 1.4 per cent on futures-linked arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average surrendered 291.34 to 20,552.35, after opening at the day's high of 20,829.54 and recording a low of 20,516.82 in the final hour of trading. Dealers said the index remained vulnerable to arbitrage-related selling ahead of the June futures settlements on June 11. Trading remained quiet owing to the lack of foreign participants as most stock and foreign exchange markets in the US and leading European countries were closed yesterday. Volume totalled 350m shares, against Friday's 552m. Falls led advances by 728 to 317, with 141 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated for the first time in five trading days, losing 18.22 to 1,636.60. Reports early in the session that Hanix Industry, a construction machinery manufacturer listed on the over-the-counter market, had filed for court protection prompted light selling. The Japan Securities Dealers Association suspended trading in Hanix. Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit company, said the group's total debt amounted to some Y170bn. While traders said the news affected sentiment during the day, they do not expect the effects to last. Some exporters were out of favour due to the higher yen. Nissan Motor fell Y19 to Y746, Honda Motor Y30 to Y1,330 and Fujitsu Y15 to Y755. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y12,000 to Y965,000. Nippon Steel lost Y4 to Y400 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y4 to Y713. Banks were also lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y50 to Y2,880 and Mitsubishi Bank relinquished Y30 to Y2,740. Shintom, an audio and video equipment manufacturer, moved ahead Y16 to Y756 on weekend reports that it would shut down all of its domestic plants and shift production to south-east Asia. Meanwhile, individual investors sought quick profits in speculative favourites. Clarion rose Y23 to Y630 and Morinaga Milk advanced Y15 to Y720. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 206.54 to 22,906.22 in volume of 15.1m shares. The index lost ground for the first time in seven trading days on profit-taking amid low volumes. Roundup PROFIT-TAKING pulled Hong Kong and Singapore lower, and Kuala Lumpur was closed for a holiday, but there was plenty of movement elsewhere. SEOUL closed sharply higher in brisk trading, the composite index reaching its best level since August 1991 as buying interest spread to highly capitalised shares. The composite index climbed 13.56 to 752.31 as turnover reached Won928.1bn, compared to Won575.4bn during Saturday's half-day session. The day's strongest performers were financial issues, including banks and securities houses. Boram Bank appreciated Won600, the day's limit, to Won12,900, while Koram Bank advanced the same amount to Won13,400. The shares were supported by market rumours of capital increases. Securities houses, meanwhile, gained between Won200 to Won400 per share on active buying by institutions. Among large-capitalisation manufacturers, Daewoo Electronics rose to the day's ceiling, ending Won600 higher at Won15,200, and Gold Star gained Won500 at Won16,100. JAKARTA also hit a 1993 peak, the JKSE index adding 4.48 at 341.85 on bullish foreign and domestic sentiment. Indah Kiat jumped Rp200 to Rp1,700 in heavy volume on speculation about higher first-quarter earnings. BANGKOK saw bank shares sold as foreigners reduced their weightings in the sector. The SET index ended 10.32 lower at 825.71 in turnover of Bt1.87bn. The banking sector index fell 1.8 per cent. Bangkok Bank slipped Bt3 to Bt119, Thai Farmers Bt2 to Bt82.50 and Siam Commercial Bt2 to Bt126. AUSTRALIA was notable for some interest in gold exploration issues, although most of the gold mining sector declined and the broader market fell. Hopes of an interest rate cut were dashed by a wider than expected current account deficit for April, and the All Ordinaries index closed 23.0 lower at 1,737.4. A decline in the bullion price from Dollars 381.50 to Dollars 379.25 an ounce left the gold shares index 52.4 down at 1,946.5. However, Central Norseman Gold jumped 24 cents, or 42 per cent, to 81 cents after announcing that exploration drilling indicated gold intersections throughout quartz layers . HONG KONG fell back as investors took profits after a strong performance last week. The Hang Seng index slipped 25.72 to 7,372.19 in thin turnover of HKDollars 4.42bn. NEW ZEALAND weakened across the board as the NZSE-40 index lost 12.65 to 1,637.51. TAIWAN reflected a similar situation as the weighted index fell 27.47 to 4,267.90. MANILA was led down by the continued sell-off of Manila Electric 'A' shares on worries about the national power sit-uation, the composite index giving up a further 8.69 to 1,588.76. BOMBAY rose on short-covering, the BSE index finishing nearly 37 higher at a preliminary 2,202.</p>

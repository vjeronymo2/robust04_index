			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Electricity buy-back South Western Electricity confirmed it had been buying back its own shares, announcing the purchase of 2.5m shares late on Thursday at 820.5p a share and a further purchase of 1m shares, for between 817p and 819p a share yesterday. The acquisitions total 2.8 per cent of the company's shares. south Western has shareholder approval to buy in up to 12.3m, or 10 per cent of its own shares. South Western shares settled 6 off at 816p, outperforming the rest of the sector which suffered from another bout of large scale profit-taking. Southern Electricity, viewed as a potential predator or target in the recent speculative burst of activity in the sector, was badly treated by marketmakers who hammered the stock price all day; the shares closed 28 lower at 777p. Yorkshire dropped 26 to 764p, Norweb 25 to 798p and Northern 24 to 810p.</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM INSULTS FAITH, SAY RASTAFARIAN PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Smoky incense sticks burned over the door. Reggae gospel boomed over speakers  Monday into the gritty Los Angeles street. The bloody shoot-'em-up film "Marked  for Death," in which a white hero does battle with a criminal gang of black men  in dreadlocks, had inspired a protest in Hyde Park, Jamaican-style.  </P> <P> "This film must be stopped," reggae star Ras Michael, an elder in the  Rastafarian religion, said outside his tiny Hyde Park "assembly house," a sort  of storefront record shop and church on busy Florence Avenue. "This film is not  showing the truth of the dread-man and the Jamaican people."  </P> <P> Michael, wearing a red silk African robe, turban and chest-length dreadlocks,  lashed out at the R-rated 20th Century Fox movie starring Steven Seagal for  what Michael called an inaccurate portrayal of Rastafarians and Jamaicans as  killers and drug dealers. The protesters -- about a dozen men and women in  brightly colored African gowns and dreadlocks -- bore such names as I-Locks,  Strangejah Cole and Queen Rejoice. They spoke of themselves as Bible followers  and lovers of peace.  </P> <P> Their long hair, the bearded Michael said, symbolizes holiness.  </P> <P> "And I'm telling you . . . when the dreadlock man is killed by the star (during  the film), they all cheered in the audience," the religious elder said. "That  ain't right. Rasta is love."  </P> <P> Fox, which released the film Oct. 5 to nearly 1,968 Southern California  theaters, declined to comment Monday on the protest. However, the studio  apparently expected some objection to the film, written by Michael Grais and  Mark Victor and directed by Dwight H. Little.  </P> <P> The credits end with a disclaimer saying that the criminal element portrayed  "is estimated to be a fraction of 1% of the Jamaican population and should not  detract from their country or the contributions Jamaicans have made to this  country."  </P> <P> The film does not refer to the gang members as Rastafarians. Neither that nor  the disclaimer was enough to satisfy protesters who said the depiction of gang  members in dreadlocks selling cocaine to Chicago high school students was  implication enough.  </P> <P> Outside the storefront, where a candlelight altar is used for chanting and  prayer, reggae performer Queen Rejoice, 44, read part of a protest poem she  co-wrote. The film, she intoned, "Tarnishes the reputation / And needs  confrontation / To stop the exploitation. . . . These are the people of greed /  Who will do anything to succeed."  </P> <P> I-Locks, a 25-year-old keyboard player in Michael's reggae gospel band, saw the  film Sunday and likened it to "a 1940s Superman movie." In "Marked for Death,"  the hero uses guns, knives and fists to overcome the dreadlock-wearing gang  members. The gang, controlled by an unsmiling character named Screwface, was  involved in cocaine, murder and voodoo, he said.  </P> <P> "To me it looked like a direct propaganda film against the Rastafarian  community," I-Locks said, in reference to the several thousand members in Los  Angeles. "I don't like it. I don't like it at all."  </P></p>

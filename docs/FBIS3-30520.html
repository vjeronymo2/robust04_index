The treaty of association--a chance to put an  end to the artificial division of Europe"--this was stressed by  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during his talks with the "12" on  the last day of his visit to Brussels. In his talks with EC  Chairman Jacques Delors and members of the Commission, the prime  minister appealed for both greater opening of markets to Polish  goods and for a greater influx of investments.    The prime minister stated that "Poland expects the '12' to  propose a schedule of joint work on inroads to membership and to  establish the date for a conference which would review our  mutual relations."    Delors avoided answering a question concerning the  timetable.  At a press conference, the EC chairman merely recalled that the  "12" had made a political commitment to admit new countries;  however, it will do this only when it is possible.    The prime minister also indirectly criticized the West  publicly for its trade policy toward Poland. In a paper  delivered before Polish and Western dignitaries, invited to  Brussels by the Washington Center of Strategic and International  Studies (CSIS) and by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Prime Minister Pawlak  declared that Poland is threatened by, among other things, the  maintenance of barriers in the economic and civil development.    "Our efforts to take part in Western structures are supposed  to serve the purpose of European cooperation and extending the  zone of stability, and, as a consequence, the purpose of  strengthening the entire continent," he said.    The "Partnership for Peace" initiative was referred to by  the  prime minister as "a first step" toward improving our security.  According to him, Poland and NATO should begin cooperation in  such areas as making systems of communications and logistics  uniform, because without any great financial investments they  could contribute to the adjustment of our Armed Forces to  Western standards. At a breakfast with members of the press,  when asked about the attitude of Moscow toward Polish efforts to  become a NATO member, the prime minister said that Russia's  reservations show that the time when some states meddled with  the affairs of others is not yet over. German Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe, who was present at the CSIS conference, saw  "Partnership for Peace" as a preparatory step for Polish  membership in NATO.    He stressed that "stabilization in the Euro-Atlantic region  is possible only with Russia, but the security zone cannot be  limited from outside by any state." "Germany does not want its  eastern border to be a line of division between the area of  stability and the area of instability. Poland is entitled to  membership in Europe and to the protection of its democratic  development," said Ruehe.    Waldemar Pawlak, in talks with EU General Secretary Willem  van Eekelen, tried to convince him that the organization's  council, jointly with the Central European states, should  negotiate the draft of the status of their association with the  Western European Union [WEU]. Pawlak emphasized that "we are  interested in obtaining the association status we already have  with the EU." Eekelen gave assurances that the status of such  states as Poland is being discussed in the WEU. [passage omitted]</p>

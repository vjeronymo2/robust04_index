			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Peshawar, Dec 5 -- The Sessions Judge, Peshawar,  Khan Akbar Khan, on Wednesday granted bail to Mir Murtaza  Bhutto, son of former Prime Minister the late Mr Z.A. Bhutto, in  two different cases of terrorist activities.    The accused is currently detailed in Karachi.    He had been sentenced by a military court in 1985 for his  alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Two FIRs [First  Information Reports] had been registered against him at police  stations east Cantt [Cantonment] and Faqirabad.    The Judge directed the public prosecutor to submit to the  court complete record of the cases. In his judgement, the judge  wrote that the original judicial file was not received though  the same was requisitioned in connection with the present  petition and the court was told that the same had been destroyed  and not received back from the martial law authorities whereas  only the police file consisting mostly of carbon and photostat  copies of various documents were submitted.    The Judge wrote that a careful perusal of the record  submitted to the court showed that the present petitioner (Mir  Murtaza Bhutto) was not named in the FIRs in question nor was  there any direct evidence against him. Though some of the  co-accused had mentioned the name of Mir Murtaza Bhutto,  alleging that he gave them training instructions about the  explosions, the confessions were in the form of photostat copies  while the originals thereof were not available.    The court was of the view that in this situation the alleged  abscondance of the petitioner had no material, solid and genuine  support.    The court accepted the application of the petitioner and  ordered his release on bail in the sum of Rs. 100,000 with two  local and reliable sureties in the like amount to the  satisfaction of the court.    [Karachi DAWN in English on 6 Jan on p 18, in an additional  report adds: "Mir Murtaza Bhutto, son of the late Zulfikar Ali  Bhutto, went on hunger strike on Wednesday.    "At 71-Clifton, [Nusrat Bhutto's residence] spokesman Ahsan  Bhazzi told newsmen that Mir Murtaza had asked his family not to  bring food for him until the demands of 40 Hyderabad Jail  inmates, now on hunger strike, were accepted.    "The spokesman recalled that Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who has  been  lodged to Borstal Jail, Landhi, since his arrival after 16-year  in self-exile in Syria, had given a notice to the jail  authorities about his hunger strike.    "In reply to a question, Bhatti said that as no one had been  allowed to see Mir Murtaza Bhutto after the Larkana tragedy, he  could not say what his reaction was."]</p>

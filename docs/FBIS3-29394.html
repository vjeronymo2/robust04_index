Under the accord at the bilateral aviation talks held in New  Zealand, Japan Airlines (JAL) and Air New Zealand will operate  the flights together three times a week, the official at the  Transport Ministry said.    Air New Zealand will also make separate flights of its own  on  the route three times a week.    JAL will give over to Air New Zealand the route between  Nagoya and New Zealand, being jointly operated by JAL and Air  New Zealand, late next month.    JAL decided that it would be better to change to a route  from  the new Kansai airport, to open this fall, since most of its  passengers who use the flights from Nagoya are from the Kansai  region.    JAL is thinking of introducing a route from Kansai to either  Christchurch or Auckland, while Air New Zealand is considering a  route to either of those destinations with a stopover at  Brisbane, Australia, the official said.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. DELAYS BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES, WILL AWAIT RULING  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials agreed Wednesday to hold off on enforcing a ban on  possession of semiautomatic rifles until March 1, pending a federal judge's  ruling on an ordinance intended to rid the city of the lethal weapons.  </P> <P> "As far as we're concerned, this is the beginning of the end of this ordinance.  One step at a time," said a lawyer for Colt Industries Inc., manufacturer of  the AR-15 assault rifle. Colt filed suit last week challenging a week-old city  ordinance banning possession and sale of the rapid-firing military-style  rifles.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William P. Gray persuaded the city to postpone enforcement  of the ban on possession of the weapons, but he refused to halt restrictions on  semiautomatic weapons sales. A lawyer for the city said those restrictions are  needed immediately "to protect the safety of our citizens (and) our police  officers."  </P> <P> "I have a great deal of sympathy with the city's concerns, but I also am  mindful of the constitutional arguments asserted by the plaintiffs," Gray said,  scheduling a hearing Wednesday to determine whether to issue a preliminary  injunction blocking enforcement of the ordinance.  </P> <P> The Colt Industries lawsuit was the first of what will probably be many legal  attacks against a growing move to outlaw semiautomatic rifles in cities across  the country.  </P> <P> Although several cities have adopted similar ordinances, many others are  awaiting the court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Los Angeles  ordinance before deciding whether to adopt similar bans.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the National Rifle Assn., which claims 250,000 members in  California, said Wednesday that it will attempt to go directly to the state  Supreme Court next week to seek a determination that the growing number of  cities adopting ordinances controlling the weapons are illegally usurping the  state's authority in the field of gun regulation.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court could refuse to hear the case directly and send it back to  the lower courts for initial review.  </P> <P> Those mounting the legal challenges say the proliferation of local ordinances  will produce confusion among gun owners and dealers until the matter is  resolved. Already, Colt Industries argues, someone can buy a gun in Culver City  and take it home to Beverly Hills, but the Los Angeles ordinance would make it  a crime to go through that city while taking it home.  </P> <P> At least six California cities, including Los Angeles, Compton, Stockton,  Carson, Gardena and Lynwood, have adopted ordinances barring the sale and  possession of assault rifles, as has Santa Clara County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Vote Postponed  </P> <P> Nearly a dozen other cities throughout the country, from New Orleans to Boston,  are considering similar ordinances. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors  postponed a decision this week on a countywide ordinance. A vote is scheduled  in two weeks.  </P> <P> State legislatures are also moving to fill in gaps in gun control and  registration laws that have historically been directed at handguns or fully  automatic machine guns. Committees in the California Senate and Assembly will  consider legislation on Feb. 28 prohibiting selling, distributing or importing  assault rifles anywhere in the state.  </P> <P> The control measures have all been proposed in the weeks since Patrick Edward  Purdy, 24, opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle in a Stockton schoolyard,  killing five children and wounding 29 others.  </P> <P> In its lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Colt Industries  claims that the Los Angeles ordinance is "wildly over-broad" and intrudes into  an area of regulation that is within the jurisdiction of the state, not  municipalities.  </P> <P> City officials, in response papers filed with the court, said the state has  exclusive jurisdiction only over registration and licensing of guns, not over  sale and possession. Assistant City Atty. Byron R. Boeckman argued that urban  areas like Los Angeles have a unique need to control semiautomatic weapons that  may not be present elsewhere in the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Significant' Interest  </P> <P> "These weapons are an ever-increasing problem in Los Angeles, weapons of death  and intimidation, and the local interest in their regulation is very  significant," Boeckman argued.  </P> <P> City attorneys also rejected Colt Industries' protests that the AR-15 is  designed primarily as a sporting gun for use in target practice. "Assault  weapons are not used for hunting or target practice but are military-style  weapons designed for wholesale killing," the city said in its court papers.  "Their force and magnitude render them inappropriate for anything other than  war."  </P> <P> In Wednesday's hearing, Gray said he is not certain that the federal courts  should intervene in a dispute over state law.  </P> <P> "I'm troubled about whether this court should take jurisdiction," he said.  "This is a case that strictly pertains to what is the California law, and I  can't think of any court in the land that is more equipped to handle that than  the courts of this state."  </P> <P> But the judge set Wednesday's hearing to decide whether to take jurisdiction in  the case and, if so, to consider the constitutional challenge and determine  whether a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the ordinance should be  issued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reasonable Approach'  </P> <P> "We're very pleased with the result," Colt attorney Harry G. Melkonian said of  the hearing. "The (possession) ordinance is not going to be enforced on Feb.  22."  </P> <P> City Atty. James Hahn noted, however, that the judge left the key part of the  ordinance, the ban on sale of the weapons, in effect.  </P> <P> "I think the judge has taken a reasonable approach to dealing with this, and  we're confident that we're going to prevail on this issue," he said. "The key  part of this ordinance is to stop these weapons from being sold in Los Angeles  and to get them off our streets, and we consider that we won half of that  today."  </P> <P> Other California cities that are considering bans on possession and sale of  semiautomatic weapons include Thousand Oaks, San Diego, Burbank, Davis,  Sacramento, Santa Monica, Hawthorne, Lawndale, West Hollywood, La Palma,  Glendale, Beverly Hills and Bellflower.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this article from Sacramento.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political commentator Taro Yayama: </F> "Irresponsible Attitude of the Opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) Revealed in Tax Reform"]    [Text] Is a "Rough Figure" Unreliable?    Tax system reform has been finalized under the condition  that  a 6 trillion yen tax reduction is to be effected first, with the  problem of sourcing funds to be discussed and settled later, and  a related law enacted within this year.    Prime Minister Hosokawa's original proposal was to abolish  the consumption tax and to introduce, three years later, a  7-percent welfare tax. However, the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] strongly opposed the idea, going so far as to  threaten to withdraw its cabinet members. So, Prime Minister  Hosokawa had to withdraw his proposal that a tax increase and  reduction be effected at the same time, agreeing instead that  tax reduction be effected first. With the change in policy, the  SDPJ was awash with victory, saying, "We won, we won." However,  such an attitude is considered extremely irresponsible for a  government party. Its mentality has not changed at all from the  time when the party was permanently in opposition.    If a 6 trillion yen tax reduction per year is effected for  three years, it creates an 18 trillion yen deficit in finances.  According to a tentative Finance Ministry calculation, the  amount of tax revenue procured by the 7-percent consumption  tax--we may call it either a consumption tax or national welfare  tax--is 9.5 trillion yen. Of this amount, we obtain a surplus  of 3.5 trillion yen after deducting 6 trillion yen as the source  of funds for the tax reduction. Concerning this figure, certain  people claim "the Ministry of Finance intends to earn 3.5  trillion yen by taking advantage of the consumption tax  increase." However, this opinion is a miscalculation. To raise  the consumption tax to 7 percent, 0.8 trillion yen is needed as  the cost for reviewing social security expenses. Also, another  1.3 trillion yen is needed to cover the 7-percent consumption  tax to be assessed on goods to be procured by the government.  Thus, only 1.4 trillion yen is to be left as a source of funds  to cover the revenue deficit. If we repay the 18 trillion yen  with this 1.4 trillion yen, it will take well over 10 years for  repayment of the principal alone. A longer period is needed if  we include repayment of the interest. What the government  should do is to judge, taking into account the financial  situation 10 years from now, whether the 7-percent consumption  tax is enough, and if there is any surplus left, whether it is  possible to further reduce the tax using the surplus as the  source of funds. Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to explain  these figures, saying that the 7 percent was a "rough figure,"  and was accused of being unreliable. However, even if we try to  give a detailed explanation by piling up accurate figures, it  will be impossible to definitely show a picture of future  financial conditions as economic conditions change every second,  and drastic administrative reform may take place during the  period. A flexible attitude "to start with the 7-percent  increase for the time being, and to review the figure as the  situation changes" is considered necessary. It may be the prime  minister's expression to say that the figure was "a rough  figure." The shoes (the finances) are to be made to fit the  feet (the economy), and it would be an absurd argument to ask  the feet to fit the shoes.    The Hosokawa government compromised with the SDPJ's  proposal,  giving priority to avoiding the collapse of the coalition  government. However, the SDPJ's argument has virtually carried  over the discussion as to who is to be held responsible for the  tax system reform. Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa asked:  "Is the SDPJ opposed to the consumption tax itself? Is the  party opposed to raising the consumption tax rate? Is it  opposed to raising the tax rate now?" However, the SDPJ has not  adequately answered these questions.    The party may be hoping to repeat its past wonderful  experience of creating the [Takako] Doi [former SDPJ leader]  boom by saying "what is not good is not good." At first, the  SDPJ proposed "[the tax system] will be reviewed two years  later." It must have been the SDPJ's expectation that, by so  doing, the party could fight the House of Councilors' election  to take place in the summer of next year with the slogans "The  consumption tax should be abolished," or "The tax rate should  not be raised." In that case, the election is going to be a  ridiculous election [with the parties] flattering the masses.  For that reason, it has been agreed, with both Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and Komeito strongly supporting the idea, that a  conclusion [about the tax system reform] be reached within this  year.    The LDP Has Become an Irresponsible Opposition  Party    It was because the people were too ignorant about indirect  tax that the Doi boom occurred. At that time, the people were  not even familiar with the difference between direct tax and  indirect tax. When the Takeshita cabinet forcibly introduced the  consumption tax, many people felt "they were cheated." Although  the SDPJ availed itself of the situation, bringing about victory  at the House of Councilors election, the good luck did not  always repeat itself. Presently, public opinion survey shows  that the ratio of the people who admit to the necessity of  indirect taxes is as high as 60 percent.    The balance of national bonds issued has exceeded 200  trillion yen. In addition to repaying the principal and the  interest of the national debt, the government has to procure 18  trillion yen to cover tax reduction. If we were living in a  baby boom era, we might expect the younger generation to  shoulder the burden. However, from now on, our society is aging  rapidly. The big debt is to be shouldered by the working  generation whose numbers will decrease in the future. If the  existing tax system remains the same, it is inevitable that the  heavy pressure will become unbearable.    Immediately after the birth of the Hosokawa government,  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the opposition LDP's Policy  Research Council said, "If the new government intends to raise  the consumption tax rate, we should also seriously deal with the  problem." I was impressed by his comment, thinking that an  opposition party ready to take responsibility was born.  However, he recently changed his opinion that "the problem  should be reviewed deliberately together with the problem of  social security and the problem of pension financing." When the  Hosokawa government was born, everyone thought it would have a  short life. Hashimoto must have speculated that, since the LDP  would return to power sooner or later, it would be appropriate  to let the Hosokawa government take care of such a troublesome  task as increasing the consumption tax rate. However, the  Hosokawa government is assuming the aspect of a long-lasting  government.    At any rate, the Hosokawa government has settled the problem  of political reform which had been pending for six years, and  has brought about a conclusion to the rice negotiations at the  GATT's Uruguay Round (multilateral trade negotiations) which had  been pending for eight years. The government also started to  reform the tax system, although tax reduction was effected  first. While each of the three problems can be regarded as a  serious task for a cabinet, the government has settled as many  as two and a half of the problems in six months.    After finishing all the domestic tasks the LDP had left  undone, the Hosokawa government is about to grapple with policy  tasks of its own, such as deregulation, administrative reform,  and decentralization. Each of the tasks is closely related and  should not be regarded as a separate task. Moreover, each of  the tasks was an unsolved problem under the LDP government  because the zokugiin [Diet members having strong influence over  a particular ministry or agency] were involved in the process.  The main reason behind the creation of the zokugiin was the  medium-sized district system. The reason for the existence of  zokugiin has also been removed through election system reform  centered around the introduction of the single-seat district  system. In short, the Hosokawa government is ready to start  remodeling the state.    If so, what points of issue will be advantageous to the LDP  in fighting the next general election and the House of  Councillors' election? There seem to be many LDP members who  are of the opinion that it is advantageous for the LDP to fight  the elections by opposing the consumption tax increase.    At a meeting of the LDP's Research Commission on the Tax  System held immediately before the budget for 1994 was drawn up,  Chairman Tatsuo Murayama tried to coordinate opinions within the  party along the line that "in order to operate the state of  Japan, it is inevitable to raise the consumption tax rate to  cover tax reduction." However, opinions were expressed one  after another to the effect that "there is no need to dare to  take the risk," that "it is better to have the coalition parties  take care of the matter," and that "there is no need for an  opposition party to take the responsibility by being involved in  the problem to that extent," et cetera, finally making it  impossible for Murayama to coordinate the opinions. This  incident shows that, similar to the former SDPJ, the LDP has  also become an irresponsible opposition party.    Under these circumstances, former Deputy Prime Minister  Michio Watanabe, who advocates the necessity of "politics based  on real intentions," expressed his pet theory on 10 February at  a meeting of an "Economic Policy Study Group" sponsored by  Toshio Yamaguchi and Takeo Nishioka that, "When it comes to  economic problems, it does not matter whether the party is a  government party or an opposition party. Consumption tax is the  only source of funds to cover the tax reduction. I do not agree  to making the consumption tax an objective tax." His attitude  may be regarded as a desirable attitude for a politician.    Not only the SDPJ, but the LDP as well, are intently aiming  at obtaining a popularity among the masses. The only way to  disappoint such speculations is to settle the problem of tax  system within this year.  <H5>  Prime Minister Hosokawa Maintains a "Resolute Attitude" </H5>   It is an urgent task to change the ratio of direct tax and  indirect tax, that is, to correct the ratio between direct and  indirect taxes. While the necessity of making the correction  had been recognized since the time the LDP was in power, the LDP  was actually not able to propose the correction because of its  bitter experience of suffering a crushing defeat in the House of  Councilors election in 1989. Though both the Kaifu and Miyazawa  cabinets recognized the necessity of tax reduction, [they knew]  it was inevitable to touch consumption tax if they wanted to  effect a tax reduction. For this reason, they both carried over  the problem saying "My cabinet does not intend to raise the  consumption tax rate."    Though people say Prime Minister Hosokawa's proposal was  made  abruptly, the prime minister clearly expressed his intention to  reform the tax system as soon as he assumed office. In his  policy speech on 23 August, immediately after his inauguration,  he stated that he was to "check the conformity of the existing  tax system" with the needs of the aging society and with the  change of the socio-economic conditions, and declared that  "structuring of a tax system keeping balance between income,  assets, and consumption" would be studied. After giving his  speech, the prime minister asked the Research Commission on the  Tax System (Hiroshi Kato as chairman) to study "an ideal form of  tax system." Also, in his policy speech given at an  extraordinary Diet meeting on 21 September last year, he stated  that he asked the government Research Commission on the Tax  System to study "a total reform of the tax system such as  correction of the ratio between direct and indirect taxes, and  other issues including reduction of income tax," and expressed  his intention to "grapple with tax system reform" as soon as the  commission came up with its conclusion.    When we look at the Hosokawa politics during these six  months, we notice that, though the pace fluctuates, he never  avoids what should be done. When he announced, before daybreak,  his intention to introduce a "7-percent welfare tax" the mass  media and the SDPJ criticized his announcement as too sudden or  too abrupt. However, they thought the announcement was made  abruptly simply because they failed--being absorbed in the big  problems of rice and political reform--to realize that  discussions about tax were underway. In the meantime, the  government Research Commission on the Tax System submitted its  report as scheduled, revealing that discussions were being made  concurrently.    Why is it an urgent task to correct the ratio between direct  and indirect taxes?    According to the settlement of accounts for 1992, the ratio  of income tax, corporation tax, and local inhabitants tax  (direct tax), and consumption tax, liquor tax, and tobacco tax,  et cetera (indirect tax) was 70.7:29.3. We may roughly grasp  the ratio as 7:3. The ratio of direct tax is the highest, and  the ratio of indirect tax is the lowest among the 24 OECD member  countries. The ratio between direct and indirect taxes in the  OECD member countries averages 49.6 percent and 40.3 percent  respectively. The remaining 10 percent is being covered with  taxes on assets. Incidentally, the ratio of assets tax in  Japan's total tax revenue is 13.7 percent, which is lower than  that of England and the United States.    A reader opposed to the consumption tax increase once  claimed  in the reader's column of a newspaper that "examples in foreign  countries should not be referred to." However, in reality, such  a claim does not hold true.    Let me illustrate an international comparison of the  minimum taxable ceiling and the rate of income tax. The minimum  taxable ceiling in Japan is Y3.277 million [yen], whereas the  ceiling in the United States is Y1.934 million (conversion rate:  $1=Y124). In other words, low-income earners are also paying  income tax [in the United States]. Among advanced countries,  Japan's minimum taxable ceiling is the second highest after  France. This fact may be attributable to the strong influence of  the SDPJ as an opposition party which claimed that low-income  earners should be taken into consideration when it comes to  reducing tax. That the minimum taxable ceiling is high, that  is, the lower income classes are exempted from tax assessment,  means that the higher income classes are to be assessed  additionally for the exempted amount. Now, comparison of the  highest tax rates shows that, while the total rate of the  national tax and the local inhabitants tax is 65 percent in the  case of Japan, the rate is approximately 47 percent in the case  of the United States. I used the word approximately because,  while the rate of national tax is being fixed at 39.6 percent  (the rate is 50 percent in the case of Japan), the rate of local  inhabitants tax varies by state. If you live in a state where a  lower rate of the local inhabitants tax is applied, the rate of  your tax will be only about 40 percent.  <H5>  There Are Signs That People Are Losing Their Will To Work </H5>   Why do not golf player Ayako Okamoto and Nobel prize winner  Professor Susumu Tonegawa come back to Japan? Though it may be  partly because of a more comfortable environment for playing  golf or for studying, these persons have to pay an additional 20  percent or 25 percent tax if they come back to Japan. An Osaka  businessman with whom I am acquainted (the name of his company  is familiar to everyone) the other day moved to the United  States and is "paying tax in that country." He moved to that  country because the U.S. tax law becomes applicable to him if he  stays in the United States for more than 180 days. It means,  therefore, that, if a maximum tax rate is applied, our country  is to lose extremely capable people and also the tax they are  supposed to pay. If international exchange of goods, money,  people, and services is further promoted, Japan will not be  allowed to stick to its own tax laws.    The same thing can be said about corporation tax. The rate  of corporation tax in Japan, with both national and local taxes  totaled, is 49.98 percent, which is the highest next to Germany.  The rate is 41.05 percent in the United States, and 33 percent  in England. Because of the higher rate of corporation tax,  Yaohan Department Store Co., Ltd., moved its head office to Hong  Kong, where a lower rate of corporation tax is applied.  Recently, even the Japan Communist Party [JCP] stopped arguing  in a stereotyped way that "taxes are supposed to be assessed on  large enterprises." Raising the corporation tax will bring  about an emasculation of industry.    With the 6 trillion yen tax reduction effected recently, the  government not only failed to reduce the maximum rate of income  tax, but even limited the maximum amount of income tax reduction  to Y2 million, and the maximum amount of local tax reduction to  Y200,000. In other words, the benefit to be received by  high-income earners through the income tax reduction to be  effected this time will be a maximum of Y2.2 million yen. Under  such circumstances, Okamoto, Tonegawa, and the businessman from  Osaka will not feel like paying tax in Japan. If the situation  remains the same, highly capable persons in every field will  flow out to foreign countries one after another. Concerning the  government's failure to reduce the maximum tax rate, Michio  Watanabe severely criticized it, saying "it is a wrong idea to  set an upper limit to the income tax reduction to avoid  criticism that rich people are to be treated well. The  depression cannot be overcome with an irresolute attitude."    If Japan is to face the aging society without changing the  7:3 ratio between direct and indirect taxes, it is inevitable  that the burden on workers' households will become unbearable.    The pension system is being operated in the form where  workers ranging in age from 20 to 64 years support people over  65. While 8.5 workers were supporting one aged person in 1970,  this structure had been changed by 1990 so that 5.1 workers had  to support one aged person. A severe situation will be created  by 2020 when 2.1 workers will support one aged person. The  ratio of the aged population in 1992 was 13.1 percent in Japan,  14.6 percent in France, and 14.0 percent in Germany (the figures  about the latter two countries are as of 1990). In the very  near future, Japan will outpace France and Germany, and by 2020  will rise to the highest among the advanced countries.  Presently, the ratio between direct and indirect taxes is about  5:5 in France, and 6:4 in Germany. Japan should change its  ratio between direct and indirect taxes to a closer level to  that of France and Germany where the percentage of the aged  population is similar to that of Japan. Otherwise, it is  evident that the direct taxes to be borne by the workers will  become heavier.    The ratio of tax burden and social security burden against  national income is called the national burden rate. In 1992,  this rate was 38.1 percent in Japan, 51.3 percent in Germany,  62.1 percent in France, and 52.2 percent in England. An  excessively high national burden rate is supposed to spoil the  will to work. In Sweden, a state with high-level welfare and  high-level burden, the national burden rate is as high as 77.4  percent, which means the largest portion of salaries is being  taken away as tax. It is doubtful such a social system taking  the form of high-level welfare and high-level burden is welcome  to the people.    In 1981, immediately after the Doko-rincho [provisional  administrative research council headed by Doko] made its start,  a study was made "seeking an ideal form of tax burden." A study  group was also sent to Europe. A tacit conclusion reached at  that time was that "society becomes sick if the national burden  rate exceeds 50 percent." The loss of the people's will to  work, which used to be called the English disease or the West  German disease in those days, is supposed to become apparent  about the time the national burden rate exceeds 50 percent.  Based on this supposition, the rincho proposed that Japan  should keep its national burden rate "within 40 percent for the  time being." Following the rincho, the Provisional Council for  the Promotion of Administrative Reform also proposed that "the  national burden rate should be below 50 percent" even in 2020  when the aging society reaches its peak (18 April 1990).  <H5>  Are Pensioners Weak People? </H5>   In order to maintain balance with the international  community, to reflect the maturity of the aging society [to the  social welfare system], and to maintain social energy, it is  indispensable to correct the ratio between direct and indirect  taxes.    For this reason, Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his  straightforward policy "to correct the ratio between direct and  indirect taxes" which had been regarded as a taboo by the LDP  government. Originally, to reduce the tax by 6 trillion yen, it  was thought to be enough to raise the consumption tax by about 3  percent, making the total 6 percent. However, it became  necessary to take into account the problem of countercyclical  measures. An ideal form of tax system reform is to take a  "neutral way" with tax increase and reduction to be made for an  equal amount. However, business conditions are not stimulated  that way. For this reason, the raise of the consumption tax  rate was postponed for three years. In that case, the government  has to suffer a large deficit of 18 trillion yen--6 trillion yen  times three [years]. To cover this deficit, it is not enough to  raise the [consumption tax] rate to 6 percent and, therefore,  the government had to come up with the unexpectedly large figure  of 7 percent.    Yet, 7 percent is still the lowest among the advanced  countries for the rate of the value-added tax (consumption tax)  of all the European countries is around 20 percent.    Although the SDPJ and Chairman Yamagishi of Rengo expressed  their opinion that "it does not matter whether [the source of  fund is to be procured] by the deficit financing bonds or by  other means," it should not be allowed to take such a reckless,  negligent, and desperate attitude. Though the SDPJ and Chairman  Yamagishi may think they are speaking for the benefit of the  workers, it is the younger generations who are to pay the bill  caused by issuing the deficit financing bonds. If the bill is  to be paid by direct tax alone, the national burden rate will  rapidly break the danger zone of 50 percent.    If indirect taxes are raised, the burden will be directly  borne by the lower-income earners who are not paying tax.  However, it should be endured as, originally, the minimum  taxable amount in Japan is too low. There is an argument that  the lifestyle of pensioners will become harsh. Yet, no trouble  is likely to be created because, if commodity prices rise due to  the rise of the consumption tax, the amount of pension is to be  raised automatically for the same proportion of the commodity  price rise. In the first place, it is wrong to think that  people living on pensions are the weak people. It is an old  idea. We may say that, presently, Japan's pension system is the  most satisfactory among the advanced countries. Comparison of  the wages of the working generations and the amount of pension  paid to the aged generations shows that, while the monthly  take-home pay after tax of the working generations (a standard  household) is Y244,512, the amount of pension paid to pensioners  (a couple) is Y195,492, which is equivalent to 80 percent of the  wages earned by the working generations (source: "Suggestions on  the Pension System Reform" by the Ministry of Health and  Welfare).    According to a survey of the actual situation of aged people  conducted in 1973 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, as many  as 55.3 percent of people over 65 answered a question about  their "real feeling of life," that "I cannot make a living."  However, the ratio dropped to 14.5 percent in 1986. According  to a life-consciousness survey by age group (in 1991 on  householders), 7.9 percent of the aged people in their sixties  answered, "It is very hard to make a living," and the ratio was  8.9 percent for people in their seventies. Therefore, it is  necessary to take into account the situation of these groups  when the consumption tax rate is raised.    The SDPJ argues that the consumption tax should be made an  objective tax, and Chairman Hashimoto of the Policy Research  Commission says that "we should hold overall discussions  including the problem of social welfare and all other problems."  However, neither of the arguments appeals to me. If the  consumption tax is made a tax to cover the pension, there will  be no way to check the expansion of welfare, and Japan might  become a high-welfare and high-burden type state just like  Sweden. I wonder whether or not the people really want Japan to  become such a state.    The problem with the existing pension system is that the  amount of pension is raised automatically in proportion to the  rise of commodity prices. In the 1960's, Italy introduced,  based on the Socialist Party's proposal, an automatic pension  slide system called "Acala mobile." However, this system, which  proved to be merely an inflation accelerator, accelerated  inflation and completely destroyed the Italian financial system,  and the country had to suspend the automatic slide system when  the Socialist Party took power in the latter half of the 1980's.    Presently, pensions in Japan are financed in an undesirable  form with pensioners receiving their pension from the fund paid  by the generations in active service, and not from the fund they  themselves accumulated for their old days. They do not withdraw  money from their own deposits, but are receiving money from  their children. It is for this reason that the government is  planning to change the age to receive pensions from 60 to 65 to  improve the pension financing system. Yet, under the existing  system, it will be inevitable that, in the future, Japan will  repeat the same failure as Italy.    Being used to the high economic growth after the war, we  have  been taking it for granted that "the pension and the commodity  price are supposed to rise." That is why the automatic slide  system has been introduced to the pension system. If that is  the case, it is a matter of course that the pension should also  be reduced automatically with the decline of commodity prices.  However, it has never been considered that wages and commodity  prices might decline. From now on, we should change our way of  thinking.    Hosokawa Politics About To Display Its Essence    The future annual rate of growth of the Japanese economy,  which has grown so big, will by no means exceed two or three  percent. If affluence is to be pursued in this situation,  politics should, first of all, make it its major objective to  reduce commodity prices.    The deregulation policy presented by Prime Minister Hosokawa  is a very adequate policy as a first step toward creation of an  affluent life.    According to the result of a commodity price survey  announced  in 1993 by the Economic Planning Agency, price index in Tokyo  was 131 (New York = 100). According to a survey conducted  around the same period by "International Economic Forum," a  private organization in Switzerland, the price index at major  Japanese cities averaged 159 (excluding house rent) (New York =  100). In other words, commodity prices in Japan were 30-60  percent higher than the international level. If commodity  prices are as high as 160 percent in Japan, goods and money are  supposed to rush into Japan from all over the world. While it  is the principle of economy that if supply increases prices  decline, it is strange that prices do not decline in Japan. Why?    In the first place, because of the regulations, it is  difficult [for goods and money] to come into Japan. Also, if  goods and money come into Japan, the price does not decline  because of the disturbing factors involved in the distribution  system. In Japan, the industrial fields which produce 40.8  percent of the gross domestic product are being placed under the  regulations, whereas the ratio is only seven percent in the  United States. In the United States and Europe, the market is  free in principle, with regulations placed as exceptions. In  Japan, however, a net of regulations is being stretched over a  huge area. There are 42 laws and 68 systems providing for  exemption of application of the Antitrust Law.    The U.S. and European markets are being operated based on  the  philosophy that economic activities shall be free and, if evil  influences take place such as monopoly, collusion, and price  cartel and others, then such actions shall be severely punished  by the Antitrust Law. In the case of Japan, on the other hand,  it is hard to say that free competition is taking place in the  market in view of the scandals involving the general  contractors, the large banks' collusion in setting interest  rates, and the practice of price cartel often exposed in the  field of the sealing material industry and paint industry. The  Antitrust Law should be applied more strictly.    The distribution market in Japan remains undeveloped because  of the law called Large Retail Store Law. While distribution  revolution took place in Europe and the United States 50-60  years ago, the revolution is about to take place in Japan.    In short, Japan is 50 or 60 years behind Europe and the  United States in the field of antimonopoly and distribution.  Japan being a late starter in capitalism, there are so many  regulations in Japan with undesirable aftereffects. During the  war and during the postwar period of reconstruction, the  Japanese Government and the private sector cooperated with each  other to effectively operate the state. However, this  cooperative line between the government and the private sector  should have been liquidated as long as 20 years ago with Japan  becoming a superpower. Presently, far from being cooperative,  the collusion between the government and the private sector  seems to be at its peak.    The Clinton administration has come up with the  comprehensive  economic framework talks based on its understanding that Japan  is a heterogeneous state. It is because the United States does  not regard Japan as a free market similar to Europe and the  United States that it requests that "import targets by area  should be shown." Against this request, Prime Minister Hosokawa  claims that, since he is going to remove the administrative  guidances and regulations, "it is not my intention to set up  import targets which means that administrative guidance and  regulations are strengthened." The Japan-U.S. talks having  broken off, which is an unusual case, the only way left for  Prime Minister Hosokawa is to show actual results by removing  the regulations and establishing a fair market.    If deregulation is promoted on a large scale, it will  finally  necessitate administrative reform and decentralization which is  the prime minister's pet project. If a free market is formed,  there will be no trade friction and the nation's lifestyle will  become affluent. If commodity prices decline by 30 percent, it  means that wages are raised by 30 percent. With political  reform having been realized, politics is ready to follow. The  Hosokawa politics is about to display its essence. The LDP  government showed a typical form of bureaucracy where  politicians, bureaucrats, and business circles maintained  collusive relations, yet, the bureaucrats actually took the  initiative. Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership is to be  tested by whether he can control the bureaucrats.</p>

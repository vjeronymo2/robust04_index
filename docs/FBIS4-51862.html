			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- World political and  public circles have expressed full support to the Korean  people's struggle for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula.    Secretary general of the Central Committee of the Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party Feliciano Salomao Gundana  said when he received the Korean ambassador to his country on  April 20 that he hoped that the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula would be solved peacefully through talks between the  DPRK and the U.S.    The Korean people, he said, will win certainly in their  struggle for a solution of the nuclear issue under the wise  guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association and  the Zimbabwean National Committee for the Study of the Chuche  Idea in a joint statement April 7 urged the United States and  the International Atomic Energy Agency to give up their  schemings to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the fictitious  "nuclear development" by the DPRK.    The statement said if the forces hostile to the DPRK try to  fish in troubled waters after aggravating the situation on the  Korean peninsula on purpose, it is a miscalculation.    A letter adopted at the annual meeting of the Ghana-DPRK  Friendship Association which was held in Ghana on April 7 said  the U.S. hostile policy of stifling the DPRK will end in  failure, and urged the United States and the South Korean  authorities to immediately stop their war provocation moves.</p>

He is on his way to  Paris to where will pay a working visit. He was met by  President Mahamane Ousmane. Responding to questions put to him  by the press, President Mahamane Ousmane spoke about the demands  of the armed rebellion. According to him, Niger is one and  indivisible and its partition is unacceptable. He, however,  asserted his readiness to pursue the dialogue to find a solution  to the armed rebellion. Here is the head of state's position.    [Begin Ousmane recording] As the president, guarantor of  national unity, guarantor of the integrity of the national  territory, and guarantor of the Constitution, naturally, my  position is that this is unacceptable. Niger is one and  indivisible. Once and for all this must be made clear to all  the sons of this country. The various demands made have now been  transmitted to the various institutions of the state and to the  various active forces of the nation to inform the public about  their contents and also make their contributions in the form of  proposals and suggestions for the holding of future  negotiations. Naturally, the demands submitted by the  Coordination of the Armed Resistance is a maximal position. It  is just a negotiating position. This does not mean that they  will stick to this. We know this very well, but it must be  clearly understood that Niger is one and indivisible. It is one  country. In fact, in the organization and management of the  affairs of the state, there are forms and modalities which call  on all the citizens of this country to be in charge of the  administration of their own affairs at the various levels -- at  the local, subregional, regional, and national levels.

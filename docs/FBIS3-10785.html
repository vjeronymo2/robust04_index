			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos F. Chamorro B.] </F>   [Text] Because of that inclination from which we suffer for  enthusiastically aggrandizing the people's struggles without  engaging in any critical effort to review their blunders, the  failure of the recent transport strike headed by the National  Transport Council (CNT) went nearly unnoticed.    Attempting to be constructive, I would like to share a  number  of reflections not unrelated to those now being debated by the  Sandinist Front concerning our methods of struggle and their  relationship to the people's struggles.    The circumstances in which this strike took place were in  total contrast with those that existed in September 1993, when  the transport movement succeeded in representing the national  consensus and heading up a vote of censure of the government's  economic policy. That was a broader movement. This one was more  focused, but influenced by other factors.    In the case at hand, the National Workers Front (CNT) had  differing opinions about the viability of gaining widespread  support for the movement. This in turn had an undeniable effect  on the CNT's decision to try to show its own capacity for  leadership.    Whatever the real reasons may have been--some allude to a  background of competence for potential leadership of the CST  [Sandinist Workers Federation]--these are matters deserving of  serious review, given the results of the strike.    One little-known fact--at least in terms of the public--is  that by calling off the strike Tuesday night, the CNT obtained  nothing more than what had already been obtained by the other  federations that signed an agreement with the government  Saturday morning. The strike was suspended in exchange for a  promise of talks and negotiations which others had already  obtained at a lower cost.    The CNT leadership squandered the strike's peak of strength  and political legitimacy last Friday, when negotiations were  opened with the government as a result of pressure brought by  the strike and with the participation of five other transport  federations. At the precise moment that the CNT could have  exerted the most influence by placing itself at the head of the  negotiations, in order to put forward the just demands of the  transport workers pitted against the government, it let itself  get caught up in a hegemonic position.    The result was an overestimation of its own forces, which  led  them to underestimate other natural allies. This in turn made  the division of the movement which the government had sought  from the very beginning a far easier task. The CNT subsequently  went about maintaining its own strike without being able to  control acts of violence targeting other transport workers. This  objectively weakened the vitality and legitimacy of the program.    An evaluation of this movement yields several troublesome  conclusions, the most important of them being the need to take a  new look at the conditions in which strikes are waged and the  methods of struggle for promoting and effectively achieving  their objectives, or at least part of them.    The best alternative would never be to stand idly by and  abandon the strike tactic and methods of popular pressure.  Rather, we must rethink the conditions under which strikes can  be staged victoriously.    It is sad to admit it, but it would be even worse to stick  our heads in the sand and refuse to recognize that this defeat  has weakened an irrenounceable instrument of the people's  struggle, which the strike is.    Social and trade union movements that follow this transport  strike will have to meditate long and hard on their future  steps. They must gauge their strength, identify their allies,  choose more flexible methods of struggle in order to achieve a  consensus, and clearly define objectives.    The Sandinist Front must take the same self-critical vision,  reviewing its actions and political positions on the strike.  Although this was indeed an autonomous movement of transport  workers, we cannot deny that, having been defeated despite the  support of Sandinists for its demands, the FSLN [Snadinist  National Liberation Front] must share in the repercussions in  order to draw lessons that will improve its leadership of coming  contests.</p>

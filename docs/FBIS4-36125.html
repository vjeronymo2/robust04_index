			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Opinion" column: "The British Decision" by Ahmad Suwan] </F>   [Text] The British Government's decision to end the ban on  arms shipments to Israel is objectionable not only because it  was made against the backdrop of unmistakable Israeli  intransigence in the peace process, but also because it  symbolizes brazen support for the Israeli entity's terrorist and  coercive practices in the West Bank and Gaza and in south  Lebanon. The reason that prompted the ban in the first place is  still there, the 1982 Israeli invasion of south Lebanon. The  combination of air raids, strafing, piracy, abductions, combing  of towns and villages and their devastation and depopulation is  an invasion in another guise. By lifting the arms embargo on  Israel, the United Kingdom is, in effect, rewarding the Israeli  aggressors and furnishing them with the means to bolster their  superiority and pursue their recklessness and acts of terror and  aggression.    Advancing an alibi for removing the embargo, the United  Kingdom cited "encouraging developments in the peace process,  specifically the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho", to  quote British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. More  surprisingly, London has made lifting the arms ban on the Arabs  conditional on the bilateral talks moving forward. The party  that must take the blame for the failure of these talks to  advance is Israel itself. This is an example of the double  standard in UK policies -- one standard for Israel, another  against the Arabs.    By ending the ban on arms sales to Israel and making its  revocation regarding the Arabs conditional on the peace process  making headway, the British Government has set a serious  precedent in international relations. Britain has underscored  its blind bias toward Israel, its aggressive and terrorist  policies, and has stabbed the Arabs and their worthy causes.  The British Government defended its decision by citing  encouraging developments, sidestepping the facts and the  substance of the peace process. Just what are these  developments that prompted this decision? Do they include the  substitution of Israeli withdrawal as stipulated by UN Security  Council resolutions with the redeployment of forces provided for  in the self-rule agreement? Is the continuing existence of  Jewish settlements and consequently Israeli occupation an  encouraging development? Does Israel's responsibility for  security and political matters in the self-rule area or its  control over roads, crossings, and bridges also rank as  encouraging developments? Does the United Kingdom really rate  these as truly encouraging developments, or is it knowingly and  deliberately pursuing deceptive policies calculated to mislead  world opinion and liquidate the Palestinian people's rights?!    The United Kingdom is all too aware that the self-rule plan  does not meet the Palestinian people's aspirations. The United  Kingdom is equally aware that Israel continues to cling to  occupation, and thus is not eligible for any reward. Nor should  Israel's repressive machine be rewarded for its savagery and  terror. It is not right that the Israeli military should be  furnished with what it takes to pursue coercive and genocidal  programs.    It is worthwhile to make one thing abundantly clear:  Britain's pro-Israel stance is bound to further complicate  things in the region. It would have been more helpful if  Britain had acted to deter Israel's aggression and brought  pressure to bear in the interest of making it comply with UN  resolutions. The lifting of the arms embargo will only  exacerbate Israel's excesses and intransigence and its rejection  of the bases on which the peace process was launched. Britain  should have acted to end Israel's recklessness and arrogance,  and should have helped the cause of an even-handed and universal  peace settlement in the Middle East.</p>

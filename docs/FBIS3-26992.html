			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "The Chinese Side Is Studying the Airport </F> Financial Arrangements and Is Willing to Exchange Views With the  British Side"]    [Text] Guo Fengmin, Chinese chief representative to the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, said yesterday (16 February)  that the Chinese side has initially studied the British side's  fourth set of financial arrangements for the airport, adding  that there is still one question to study and a need to exchange  views with the British side. He hoped that the Airport  Authority experts group could call a meeting this month.    Guo Fengmin made these remarks while attending a Lunar New  Year gathering sponsored by the Heung Yu Kuk [local consultative  bodies in the New Territories]. He pointed out: On the airport  issue, not long ago, some people from the British side said that  the Chinese side had not raised comprehensive suggestions at  all, but subsequently they said that the British side's  proposals completely met the Chinese side's demands. This is  contradictory.    Guo Fengmin further explained: Since the Chinese side did  not raise any comprehensive suggestions, why did the British  side say that its proposals completely met the Chinese side's  demand? As a matter of fact, at an Airport Authority meeting in  August last year, the Chinese side had already systematically  put forward its suggestions. It took almost six months for the  British side to raise its proposals. Who is delaying after all?    On granting land approvals, he said that the Airport  Authority would certainly discuss land approvals, but some  detailed questions would have to be discussed by the Land  Commission [Sino-British Land Commission].    Guo Fengmin said that the defense experts group meeting of  the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group had been delayed too long  by the British side. He hoped that major progress would be made  at this meeting.</p>

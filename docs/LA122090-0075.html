			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW ROSARITO BEACH CAFE;  </P> <P> GOODBY, CHIPS;  </P> <P> DISHES FROM SOUTHERN MEXICO CONTRIBUTE TO AN UNUSUAL, DELICIOUS DINING  EXPERIENCE.  </P> <P> At first glance, the Rosarito Beach Cafe might be taken for just another  Mexican diner. Its street-front window, lit up in bright orange neon, and its  fairly plain decor do nothing to dispel this initial impression. But then I  looked at the menu and realized there wasn't a single combination plate to be  found. Another clue: no complimentary chips. When I spotted the description of  the Bahia shrimp with coconut milk, chiles and hearts of palm, I began to  revise my idea about the place for the better.  </P> <P> The first bite of the first dish I ordered, however -- a crab taco appetizer  plate -- almost made me change my mind again. Despite some good guacamole and  cucumber, the crab tasted like shredded paper towels. Then my dinner companion  slid her salad across to me with a grimace. I thought it was all over.  </P> <P> But it wasn't. The orange-chile dressing may not have been to her taste, but I  loved it. It was sort of a Thousand Island dressing spiked with orange juice  and the subtle hint of garlic and chile.  </P> <P> From that moment, Rosarito Beach only got better and better. Many of the dishes  on the menu come from southern Mexico, and some have a definite Caribbean  influence. The chicken with chile-nut sauce, for instance; it came with  plantains and a sauce full of wonderfully pungent spices.  </P> <P> Swordfish Yucatan turned out to be a perfectly grilled fish lightly coated with  a blend of achiote chiles, citrus juices and spices. Yellowtail Veracruzana was  a big chunk of tender fish covered with tomato sauce shot through with green  olives and capers. Carne asada had a spiced citrus marinade pounded into it and  came with papaya salsa. The chicken mole had one of those terrifically complex  sauces -- some of the ingredients were honey, chiles, plantains, ground almonds  and tomato.  </P> <P> The entrees come with fabulous rice and beans -- the kind that make you want to  eat them every day. For dessert, there's key lime pie, exceedingly sweet and  exceedingly sour. Pumpkin flan was a cross-cultural treat that mixed the best  of two great traditional desserts.  </P> <P> There may be no free chips for munching and you may not get that enchilada-taco  combo platter you expect from most Mexican places, but for my money, Rosarito  is marvelous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> Rosarito Beach Cafe, 256 Main St., Ventura; (805) 653-7343.

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais taking over Woodchester WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, has announced its ambitions to become the third force in the Irish banking market and a significant company in the European small-ticket leasing market. In its interim results for the half-year to June 30, also announced yesterday, Woodchester reported a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from IPounds 18m to IPounds 17.5m (Pounds 16.7m). The company intends to acquire from Credit Lyonnais Group a 30 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais Leasing Europe, in a share and cash deal worth IPounds 22.1m. The deal will take the French group's stake in Woodchester to 48 per cent and it intends to increase this to 51 per cent by purchases in the market. CLLE is Credit Lyonnais' principal holding company for its continental European leasing activities outside France. It has advances and other assets worth IPounds 1.1bn. Mr Craig McKinney, Woodchester chairman, said: 'Within 12 months I expect Woodchester to be the third largest Irish bank with a strong retail banking presence in Ireland. Credit Lyonnais and ourselves share that aspiration. 'If you are in the lending business you need a partnership like this otherwise you are dead in the water'. He added that the company was seeking to acquire a retail banking network of 50 to 60 branches in the Republic, to add to its existing 12. With electronic banking he said Woodchester would not need the 400-branch networks of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, the market leaders, to be able to compete effectively. He expected that a deal would be announced within the next three to six months. On the leasing side Mr McKinney said: 'We want to be a big pan-European player in partnership with Credit Lyonnais. We are going in with a partner who knows those markets well. 'In Ireland we have 45 per cent share of the car finance market. We believe the sector we are working in is too narrow. With what we have done in a population of 3.5m people, we believe there is huge potential in Europe backed by the financial muscle of Credit Lyonnais. If we cannot quadruple (the CLLE) leasing portfolio in four years, I would be very disappointed.' On the results Mr McKinney said: 'I believe it represents a considerable achievement given the difficult trading conditions in the UK and represents only a small decrease on the record profits achieved in the same period last year.' The result was in line with expectations, improvements in the core domestic market having been offset by the difficult conditions in the UK. Overall advances and other accounts increased 65 per cent to IPounds 1.36bn (IPounds 826m). Gross rentals were IPounds 231m (IPounds 197m). Earnings per share came out lower at 7.47p (7.7p) and the interim dividend is raised by 20 per cent to 1.81p (1.51p). One analyst said the increase was 'indicative of Woodchester's intention to establish itself as a banking group'. The shares rose 16p to 154p.</p>

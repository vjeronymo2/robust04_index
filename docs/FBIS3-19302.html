			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 15 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  is heading for crisis over Britain's refusal to back down in a  balance of power dispute over voting rights, Danish Foreign  Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said here Tuesday [15 March].    He was speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers which  was deadlocked over the voting issue, which is holding up the  entry of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the EU on  January 1 next year.    "The EU is heading towards a very serious crisis. This  really is serious," Petersen angrily told journalists.    EU enlargement is being blocked by London's demand, backed  by  Spain, that the entry of more small countries into the EU should  not dilute the ability of bigger members like Britain to block  decisions they do not like.    The Danish minister suggested that it was a waste of time  continuing to negotiate with Britain, because "it is out of the  question that it will give in today."    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he doubted whether  a compromise was in sight, despite telephone contact earlier in  the day between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime  Minister John Major.    But several ministers said agreement was near in a dispute  between Spain and Norway over fishing catch quotas which  threatens to stop Norway from entering the Union with the three  other applicants.    Austria, Finland and Sweden finally agreed on their terms of  membership for joining the EU on March 1. The EU's negotiations  with Oslo are still blocked by Spain's demand for access to  Norway's fish-rich waters.    Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos said: "We are very  close to an agreement on fish. Diplomats said Norway, together  with Spain's EU partners, might buy off the Spanish opposition  to Norwegian membership with more fish."    The more intractable balance of power deadlock hinges on the  effect of enlargement on the EU's delicately-balanced system of  majority voting.    It provides that the bigger members such as Britain, France  and Germany have more votes than their smaller partners, but  fewer votes in relation to their populations.    The current system allows one small and two large countries  to band together in a blocking minority with 30 percent of the  total votes.    Most EU countries want to keep this proportion unchanged  when  the four applicants join the Union. But this would raise the  blocking minority threshhold and three countries would no longer  have the power of veto.    It would mean that Spain, Italy and Greece, for example, can  no longer block decisions they believe are bad for Mediterranean  agriculture.    Britain, Germany and Denmark or the Netherlands would lose  their power to block trade regulations backed by the EU's more  protectionist members.    Britain's stand accords with its general policy to keep the  EU's power as limited as possible. Its opponents accuse the  British of wanting to paralyse the decision-making process.    Spain is wary of any enlargement that would shift the EU's  balance of power away from the agricultural south to the  industrial north, which might be less inclined to subsidise  Mediterranean farmers.    The dispute heralds a wider ideological dispute between  federalists and free traders at a 1996 conference to change EU  rules before the Union decides on accepting such countries as  Malta, Cyprus, Poland and Hungary.</p>

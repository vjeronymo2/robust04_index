			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jibril al-Rajub, 'Arafat's senior adviser, </F> by political correspondent Udi Segal in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Rajub] Look, in my opinion they have not given  up anything [not further specified]. An agreement was reached,  we received something, and I am also absolutely sure that peace,  coexistence, and security will be achieved for all the civilians  living in the territories.    [Segal] What about the agreement between the PLO and Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement]?    [Al-Rajub] There never was, nor will there ever be such an  agreement after we enter the territories. We will abide by  everything we signed.    [Segal] Do you see any possibility for cooperation between  Hamas and the PLO?    [Al-Rajub] It is not a question of cooperation, but rather  of a national interest. I think it is in the national interest  of the Palestinian people to convince most of the public to  abide by the agreement.    [Segal] What about collaborators?    [Al-Rajub] Look, as you say in Hebrew, it is necessary to  stamp out all traitors. I think that those who shed blood and  those who crossed the red line will be tried. We are entitled  to put these people on trial. It is inconceivable that a man  who opened fire and killed people because he collaborated with  the occupation forces will be pardoned. This will never happen.    [Segal] What about the others?    [Al-Rajub] Look, we will examine every case individually.    [Segal] What remains to be solved before the comprehensive  agreement is signed on Wednesday?    [Al-Rajub] It has been determined that the agreement will be  signed on Wednesday, which means that all the other problems  will be overcome in the next three days.</p>

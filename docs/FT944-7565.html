			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Political Notebook: A tonic for backbench nerves The Tories, clearly, have not learnt the lesson. The plotting and the preening at Westminster these last few days have exposed once again the instinct for self-destruction which permeates Tory backbenches. In today's stupid party (Conservatives used to take pride in the epithet) self-publicity comes before self-restraint. Mr John Major, once again the subject of a whispering campaign in the lobbies, is dismayed. By and large, his cabinet colleagues share his dismal opinion of the rightwing trouble-makers. The so-called cabinet bastards have been seeking with limited success to restrain their Eurosceptic acolytes on the backbenches. There is more to come. Mr Major has become entangled in the contest between Sir Marcus Fox and Sir Nicholas Bonsor for the chairmanship of the 1922 committee of backbenchers. It is a far more complicated struggle than commentators have had the patience to explain. But the point is that it provides plenty of soundbite opportunities for those with grudges against No 10. So too does the forthcoming vote on the European Union budget. The odds are that Mr Major will once again survive. Like the hero of an old-fashioned children's comic, the prime minister has become accustomed to emerging blackened but still standing from each successive explosion. His enemies have another week to garner the 34 signatories needed to mount a leadership challenge. They are living in hope rather than expectation. Barring a fatal accident during Monday's EU vote (there is always a chance that this party will shoot itself in the head), Mr Major's hope of restoring a semblance of order now rests on the broad shoulders of Mr Kenneth Clarke. The chancellor's task in Tuesday's Budget is to demonstrate that the government has a chance - however small - of winning the next general election. Mr Major will only be safe if and when the irreconcilable minority on the backbenches can no longer feed on the deep electoral anxieties of the uncommitted majority. So Mr Clarke must show that spending and borrowing are under control, the recovery is sustainable and that tax cuts are within sight. The FT's customary pre-Budget survey of opinion on the backbenches distills the priorities of the would-be loyalists as well as the dissidents. An overwhelming majority expect swingeing reductions in the cash plans for next year's public spending total. Anything under Pounds 5bn will be a disappointment. Some 31 per cent of the 70 Tory MPs who replied to a detailed pre-Budget questionnaire said they wanted reductions of Pounds 6bn or more. The odds are that Mr Clarke will not disappoint them. Ministers smile at the speculation that he has Pounds 5bn up his sleeve - so it should be safe to assume that the chancellor has another Pounds 3bn or so in reserve. As for tax cuts, the backbenchers for the moment are prepared to give Mr Clarke the benefit of the doubt. There is intense concern still about value added tax on fuel. A third would like him to hold the rate at 8 per cent. But a majority are prepared to grit their teeth. Look ahead to next year and 1996 and the picture changes. The message is clear: we will bear the pain now as long as you deliver the bribes to the voters in good time for the election. Rank-and-file MPs are as conscious as was Mr John Maples in his ill-fated memorandum to Mr Major that the worthy combination of stable growth and low inflation is not enough. The punters want money put in their pockets. Nearly two-thirds of the MPs insist pre-election tax cuts are vital or important. Most of the rest think they are desirable. Only 4 per cent regard them as unimportant. Take note, Mr Clarke. There are doubts, too, over interest rates. The pre-emptive increase in September won broad support. But the backbenchers do not like the idea of the government being pushed around by the Bank of England. Two-thirds want the chancellor to wait before applying the brakes again. The MPs are clear how Mr Clarke should spend any spare cash. A substantial majority want him to meet his commitment to remove the worst of the poverty and unemployment traps. Almost as many believe he must add some lustre to their tarnished claim to be the natural party of small business. The chancellor rightly is perceived to be heir apparent should Mr Major one day decide he has had enough of being blown up by his own supporters. Mr Clarke's ratings in the FT survey - more than 80 per cent say his performance has been excellent or good - reinforce the claim. But, this time around at least, Mr Major is as anxious as anyone that Mr Clarke produces a Budget to calm Tory nerves.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             WHAT TORY MPs WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE BUDGET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Results shown in rounded percentages.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Aqiba Eldar] </F>   [Text] Three out of four Arabs support immediate military  confrontation with Israel while the fourth prefers to maintain  the current situation of neither peace nor war while awaiting a  time when the Arabs will be able to realize their goals. This is  the conclusion drawn from a study recently published in MIDDLE  EAST QUARTERLY. The scholar who conducted the study, which  included 1,000 Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian Muslims outside  Israel, warns that Arab leaders foresee the danger of  delegitimization by their people, who lag behind them in their  policies toward Israel.    Professor Hilal Qashan of the American University in Beirut  found that, on the eve of the signing of the agreement between  Israel and the PLO at the White House, none of those surveyed  could find a single positive aspect to peace with Israel. The  most common opinion was that peace is a temporary tactic  designed to enable the Arabs to reorganize themselves in order  to strike at Israel at some later time. Of those questioned who  supported peace, 90 percent said that they would withdraw their  support for it if Israel were to weaken in the future. The  scholar concludes that his findings teach that even they do not  support a lasting peace.    Writing in the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Qashan states that the  Arab public's desire to launch an immediate war against Israel  indicates an anomaly in the findings, for if the Arabs failed to  wipe out Israel when superpower polarization was at its peak, it  is irrational to believe that they can succeed at a time when  just one superpower exists. He concludes from his survey  findings that the Arabs--including those who support peace--are  not psychologically ready for this change. The respondents  expressed fear that peace would enable Israel to become the  leading economic power of the Middle East and to gain a larger  share of the region's water sources. Many of the respondents  blame Israel for instigating the civil war in Lebanon, inciting  the clash with the Qurds in northern Iraq and aggravating the  rebellion in southern Sudan. They believe in the existence of a  grand Zionist conspiracy to create "ministates" to take the  place of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt.    The respondents--two-thirds of them engaged in the liberal  professions--reveal a very faulty conception of the meaning of  peace and its benefits. A majority sees it as surrender and  prefers to continue the confrontation with Israel. According to  the study, Arab political culture still harbors strong  anti-Israel sentiments.    Qashan blames Arab leaders for educating their people to  distrust Jews, hate Zionists, and dream of destroying Israel.  When they decided to open negotiations with Israel, Qashan  notes, they did not properly prepare their public for what might  ensue. The Arab public feels abandoned by its leaders and  bypassed by modernization and political liberalism. Nonetheless,  he believes that true peace can be achieved if Arab leaders  undertake a new process of socialization in the Arab public. He  calls on the United States to make a contribution by promoting  mutual interaction, cooperation and understanding so that peace  will stand on its own.</p>

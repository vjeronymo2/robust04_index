			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Belgian drive to sweeten chocolate sales: How hopes are being pinned on exports One company is so secretive that it refuses to reveal how many Easter-eggs it makes. Another recently sent out spies to test the quality of a competitors' truffles. A third is quietly plotting to usurp a rival's royal seal. As Europe prepares to embark on its annual Easter-egg binge, Belgium's luxury chocolate sector is bubbling with some serious business battles. Faced with a domestic market that is almost saturated, after a decade in which total domestic chocolate production has more than doubled to some 300,000 tonnes, its luxury chocolate makers are now gearing up for an export drive. It is a battle, however, that is provoking soul searching, particularly among the small - and highly secretive - band of traditional chocolate makers, who have been the source of Belgian's luxury chocolate fame. Although most recognise that their best hope of expansion will be through export, some fear this could eventually cost them their independence. 'It is a difficult situation. We want to export. But if we lose the quality we are in danger of losing our name,' explains Mrs Miriam Wittamer, a third-generation traditional chocolate shop owner - a business where white-robed workers still dip chocolate rabbit moulds by hand before filling them with pralines made to a closely guarded recipe. Their fears have been fuelled by change. Belgium's largest mass market chocolate producer, Cote D'Or, has been gobbled up by the Swiss company Jacobs Suchard, and Godiva - Neuhaus's main rival in the mass-produced luxury market - is now part of the US group Campbell Soup. These changes have spurred the luxury end of the market into action. Godiva, which started as a family business in 1927, now splits its production between the US and Belgium and records a turnover of about BFr1bn (Pounds 19m) a year, with more than 50 per cent of its sales now export-driven. 'Export is where the main growth is now. The Belgians already eat a lot of chocolate - it's hard to get them to eat any more,' says Mr David Johnston, European manager of Godiva. Although Belgian chocolate has enjoyed a higher prominence in the Anglo-Saxon world - exemplified by Haagen-Dazs' recent decision to use its name in the luxury ice-cream brand - the main challenge now, he says, is boosting recognition among German and French consumers. Neuhaus, the oldest chocolate house and one of the few large ones still entirely Belgian-owned, saw its profits rise by 10 per cent last year, to reach a turnover of BFr1.1bn, after a period of stagnation in the 1980s. It has recently opened 120 foreign outlets and conducts 30 per cent of its business outside Belgium. Meanwhile, the secretive Leonidas group, which is controlled by a Greek family, is estimated to have a turnover of about Dollars 86m (Pounds 58.9m), controlling half the luxury 'praline' chocolate market in Belgium with a network of some 1,600 independent overseas distributors. But most of the tiny, traditional chocolate makers, who continue to produce the most exclusive Belgian chocolates, are still struggling to find their own export networks, hampered by their small levels of production and problems of distributing a product whose shelf-life is rarely longer than a few weeks. Some believe their best hope would be through the duty free or mail order business. Meanwhile, others admit they have already had bigger players sniffing at their doors. 'There is a danger that some artisans could be taken over,' explains Mrs Sanne Lamberty, owner of Mary, a traditional Brussels chocolate maker, who enjoys the coveted right to supply to the Belgian royal court. 'But the fact is we do not want that at all.'</p>

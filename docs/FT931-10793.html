			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Bugging to be curbed in press code THE newspaper industry yesterday added a clause to its code of practice to limit the use of eavesdropping equipment and the recording of private telephone calls. An industry committee which reviews the code of practice for journalists annually has added a new clause which will form the basis for adjudications by the Press Complaints Commission. The clause says journalists should not obtain or publish material 'obtained by using clandestine listening devices or by intercepting private telephone calls' unless justified by the public interest. Public interest is defined as detecting or exposing crime or serious misdemeanour and seriously anti-social conduct; protecting public health and safety; and preventing the public being misled by statements or actions of an individual or organisation. The committee is also consulting the newspaper industry on a further proposal which would try to regulate the use of long-lens cameras on private property. The government has made clear it wants to change the criminal law to make eavesdropping and telephone tapping criminal offences.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Paribas tightens retail banking links PARIBAS, one of France's leading banking groups, plans to forge closer links between Banque Paribas and Credit du Nord, its retail banking networks, through a commercial co-operation agreement. The agreement, when France's banks are trying to cut costs to counter the recession, involves the two networks collaborating in areas such as the sale of products to their customers, particularly to their corporate clients, and also in the development of information technology. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of the Paribas group, has been seeking synergies. He has ruled out a merger in order to retain separate identities for Banque Paribas, Credit du Nord and Compagnie Bancaire, the group's specialist finance unit. Banque Paribas is one of the largest players in the French investment banking scene, with a network of 40 branches dealing mainly with corporate accounts and wealthy private clients. Credit du Nord is a mainstream retail banking network with 540 branches. Paribas said yesterday that the new agreement would only affect the 'behind the scenes' aspects of Paribas and Credit du Nord. It said that the two networks had for three years been working more closely together. The agreement would formalise their collaboration. Paribas aims to sustain its recovery after returning to the black with a net profit of FFr886m in 1992 following its first loss in 1991.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Time the pessimists ate their hats One of the hazards of being a reporter, especially a foreign correspondent, is that you have no control over headline writers. In more than three years of reporting on the US economy I have detected a subtle bias. Gripped by Euro-pessimism, the London-based subeditors are reluctant to believe any part of the globe is enjoying a strong recovery. On Friday I thought I had them finally on the run. A drop in the jobless rate from 6.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent - the biggest in a decade - would surely convince even the sceptics of Number One Southwark Bridge that the US economy was on a roll. By no means. 'Big fall in US jobless lifts hopes of robust recovery' was the most that could be squeezed from the still-cautious news desk. The stark difference in the economic performance of the US and Europe is still not fully appreciated in Britain. America has not been grappling with the worst recession since the 1930s. It had only a mild and brief downturn during the Gulf war. It has since enjoyed 10 consecutive quarters of expansion. The annual rate of growth has averaged 3 per cent in real terms during the last seven quarters and seems likely to reach 4-5 per cent this quarter. But to be fair to FT headline writers, their perception of events mirrors that of Main Street America. George Bush lost last year's election because he could not convince voters the economy was truly reviving. The problem was that growth was slower than in most previous recoveries, and alarmingly erratic. With hindsight, nobody should have complained about the last three quarters of 1992, which registered annual growth rates of 2.8 per cent, 3.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent. But then came the payback. The first three quarters of the Clinton presidency saw growth of only 0.8 per cent, 1.9 per cent and 2.7 per cent: miserable by US standards. The conventional view is that this saw-tooth pattern will continue. Growth will therefore moderate early next year, although not as abruptly as at the beginning of this year. The consumer is expected to retrench because spending has outstripped personal incomes, pushing down the savings rate to 3.7 per cent against an average of 5.3 per cent last year. Factory output, meanwhile, is less robust than it looks because of an unsustainable surge in car production after a weak third quarter. Familiar villains - weak exports and defence cuts - will continue to exert their negative pull. There is solid logic behind such arguments. But they seem a trifle pessimistic. The economy has worked its way through the financial problems of the late 1980s. Debt ratios are down in both the personal and corporate sectors. Banks are lending again. Commercial property values have stabilised. The barometer is thus now set fair for a more normal expansion. Monetary policy has been highly stimulative for more than a year. The magnitude of the boost from lower rates, especially on longer-dated securities, should not be underestimated. Rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing, consumer durables and business investment, are booming. Personal income figures do not allow for big sums released by refinancing mortgages at lower rates and thus understate consumers' buying power. The employment outlook has been quietly transformed. Some 1.6m jobs have been created so far this year, twice the rate in 1992 when the economy grew by 2.8 per cent. This is what lies behind the surge in consumer confidence reported last week - one of the biggest in 25 years. The rapid growth of this quarter could thus persist well into next year. Indeed, even if the old saw-tooth pattern repeats itself, two or three quarters of above-trend growth would be more likely than a solitary strong quarter. After producing a stream of over-optimistic forecasts in recent years, US forecasters are on the brink of making the opposite mistake. Now that the constraints on growth have finally been lifted, they are unable to celebrate the dawn. The relative pessimism about growth is prompting a second mistake: complacency about inflation. US analysts, despite the much greater buoyancy of the American economy, are beginning to adopt the Euro-pessimist view of inflation. It is dead, finished, caput. Anybody who fails to recognise that prices are dormant is simply out of touch with reality, a relic from the 1970s. Perhaps inflation is 'yesterday's fight'. Perhaps the 'long wave' view of economic activity is correct. After the inflationary headaches of the 1970s and 1980s, maybe the world has entered a glorious new era of stable prices. All I can say is that this view looks less plausible in an economy that has not been flirting with depression. (I suspect it looks less credible still in regions that are growing even faster than the US, such as China and the rest of east Asia.) In the short run, the recent sharp fall in oil prices will improve an already promising inflation outlook. Upward pressure on US wages and producer prices remains low. But this is the stage of the business cycle when policymakers always drop their guard. It may not be time for the US to apply the monetary brakes, but it is time to stop pressing the monetary accelerator. If Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gradually raises rates from 3 per cent to, say, 4.5 per cent, he will be moving from stimulus to a neutral stance. We take out insurance against events we hope will never occur. It is in this spirit that Mr Greenspan should be preparing to rein in his monetary stimulus. If he does so, he may be the first Fed chairman in decades to preside over a faster rate of economic growth than inflation.</p>

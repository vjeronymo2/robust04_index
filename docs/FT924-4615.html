			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (16): A small stick to beat them THE UGLY JAPANESE: NIPPON'S ECONOMIC EMPIRE IN ASIA by Friedemann Bartu Longman Singapore Publishers (Pte), SDollars 29.90, 287 pages. UK rep. Longman Group UK THOSE WHO instinctively recoil from Japan-bashing would probably do well to remember how in 1990 Nicholas Ridley, then a Conservative minister, was vilified for a public bout of German-bashing, and how today - after the humiliating retreat of sterling before the Bundesbank and an outbreak of fascist demonstrations in Germany - even his critics concede that he had a point. Like Germany in Europe, Japan in south-east Asia is a formidable economic power and its expansionist 20th century history conjures up images of wartime atrocities in the minds of the region's elder statesmen. This year, for the first time since the war, Tokyo has sent Japanese troops abroad, to serve with the UN peacekeeping force in Cambodia. The mission is being undertaken with caution and reluctance, but Japan's persistent refusal to apologise for, or in many cases even acknowledge, its imperial adventures in Asia has angered Asians from Korea to Singapore. On the economic side, the flood of Japanese investment into south-east Asia since the mid-1980s by companies relocating their factories in response to the rise of the yen has been crucial for the success of the region's export-led economic growth. Bartu argues that 'the Ugly Japanese' - a phrase coined by an unusually frank Japanese diplomat - has replaced 'the Ugly American' in the role of loud-mouthed, high-spending tourist and would-be economic and cultural imperialist. The increasingly visible Japanese presence in south-east Asia certainly means that the strategies of Japanese governments, the intentions of Japanese corporations and the reactions of non-Japanese Asians are fruitful subjects for investigation; by the time I was nine pages into the book I had already heard two advertisements on Thai radio for Japanese department stores in Bangkok. But Bartu, the economic and financial correspondent of the Swiss newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung, who describes himself as 'a strong believer in the power of 'karma', has failed to find enough anti-Japanese ammunition to match the book's dramatic title or to satisfy the aspiring Japan-basher. Most of the sticks with which he beats the Japanese in this anecdotal survey of Japan in Asia are old ones and could equally be applied to their commercial competitors: the language of Japanese business, he writes scathingly, is the language of war and conquest, but Bartu himself later volunteers the statement that both western and Japanese managers are 'warriors competing in a global market'; he describes transfer pricing as 'this old Japanese trick' as if it were unknown to European or US companies. He deplores the use of foreign aid for commercial advantage, as if it were a form of leverage exerted only by the Japanese, and provides a fascinating account of how Japan and NEC fought dirty to win a big telecommunications contract in Indonesia. Yet at the same time he suggests that the US fought back to help AT&amp;T by secretly tapping high-level telephone conservations about the contract between Tokyo and Jakarta. Bartu damns the Japanese in south-east Asia for working too hard, and then damns them for playing golf. There is not enough space for golf in Japan, he says, so 'the Japanese should collect stamps and play table tennis, mahjong or chequers.' In spite of the occasional gratuitous insult Bartu is ultimately defeated in his attempt to sustain an anti-Japanese polemic by his own fair-mindedness. He tries to show that south-east Asia is drifting into the Japanese sphere of influence, but concedes that Japanese cultural influence is 'remarkably shallow'; he tries to portray the Japanese businessman as a ruthless samurai warrior, but ends up feeling sorry for the lonely Japanese husband who has left his family in Tokyo. Wading through his 20kg of newspaper cuttings on the Japanese in Asia, Bartu allows himself to be diverted into such intriguing but peripheral topics as the rise of Japanese feminism, leaving too little space for serious analysis of his central theme. The reader is left wanting to know more about the notorious reluctance of Japanese companies to transfer technology to south-east Asia or to promote locals to senior management positions (there is a good chapter on the evolution of Mitsubishi's Proton Saga car factory in Malaysia), more about the challenge to Japanese dominance being mounted by investors from Taiwan and Korea, and more about the consequences of Japan's failure to provide leadership on issues such as the environment, human rights and world trade negotiations. Bartu concludes lamely that Asians do not want to be forced into a Pax Japonica, but acknowledges that this a concept for which 'even most Japanese themselves are still ill-prepared'. If the Japanese are indeed ugly, the case is not yet proven.</p>

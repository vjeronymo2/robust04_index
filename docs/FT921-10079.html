			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Yeltsin and Mitterrand exchange a treaty Russian President Boris Yeltsin and French President Francois Mitterrand pictured yesterday exchanging a treaty on a new partnership based on 'confidence, solidarity and co-operation'. Signed at the end of a three-day state visit by the Russian president, the agreement is entitled 'Treaty between France and Russia', and effectively replaces the 'Franco-Soviet Treaty of Understanding and Co-operation' signed with President Mikhail Gorbachev in October 1990, but never ratified, writes Ian Davidson from Paris. The treaty promises more intensive consultations between the two countries, and says the two governments will co-operate with a view to the conclusion of a European security treaty. The two governments also stress the importance of nuclear disarmament, which they say should aim to bring down nuclear arsenals to levels of 'minimal sufficiency'. France insists that it will not take part in nuclear disarmament until the arsenals of the superpowers have been brought down to comparable levels, though President Mitterrand now says that France may be prepared to slow its nuclear modernisation in response to nuclear disarmament by the superpowers. President Yeltsin said he respected the French position.</p>

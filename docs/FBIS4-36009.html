			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry in the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Since dawn today, the enemy has  been launching aggressive, indiscriminate attacks using  artillery, missiles, and aircraft on residential areas,  government buildings, civil installations and schools. This is  part of the hysterical and adventurist behavior on the part of  the head of the military regime in Sanaa. Our air, naval, and  ground forces resisted these aggressive attacks with rare  heroism on all fronts, striking deadly blows on the invading  enemy forces, whose operations today resembled the fighting of  remnants, thieves, and infiltrators. Our forces inflicted on  them heavy human and material losses. On the Abyan axis, eight  enemy tanks were destroyed while two others were captured. On  the Tawr-al-Baha-al-Khattabiyyah axis, 10 enemy tanks were  destroyed, with three other tanks captured. Four (BNB) armored  cars and two Katyusha rocket-launching vehicles were also  destroyed. On the Kharaz-al-Mandeb axis, five enemy tanks were  captured and three others captured. One enemy aircraft was shot  down. On all these fronts, the enemy forces retreated to their  rear positions leaving behind hundreds of dead and wounded.    Many of the officers and men of the attacking forces have  surrendered. In the Shabwah Governorate, the enemy forces  attempted to repeat their attacks, but our Armed Forces and the  masses of the people resisted, striking crushing blows against  them. We shall bring you more information in a subsequent  communique about the front in the Shabwah Governorate.</p>

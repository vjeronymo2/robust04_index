			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sincere payments re-define executive mores - A look at boardroom remuneration in Hong Kong business EXPLOITATION of minority shareholders is so much part of the corporate culture in Hong Kong, that the boundaries of the acceptable have become totally muddied. Department store operator Sincere, however, may have aided definition when it proposed that directors' remuneration be 245 per cent of net profit. At an annual general meeting last week, Sincere's shareholders approved directors' payments of HKDollars 115m (USDollars 14.8m) for the year to February 1993, compared with net profit before extraordinary items of HKDollars 47m. By comparison, one of Hong Kong's largest companies, Hutchison Whampoa, paid out directors' remuneration of HKDollars 67m last year, against net profit of HKDollars 3.05bn. The rarely outspoken Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Hong Kong is to publish an editorial in its magazine claiming the move by Sincere's directors 'is beyond bold - it is obscene'. In Hong Kong, making money is rarely a dirty phrase. Sincere is typical of Hong Kong's smaller listed groups; the board of directors is tightly controlled by one family, the Mas, who make up seven of the company's eight directors; the eighth is Mr Selwyn Mar, whose family has long been connected with the owners. Sincere is also representative of the Hong Kong inclination towards trading property assets, and this has proven a lucrative combination. In April 1992, the company sold its headquarters for HKDollars 1.18bn and then paid out a special bonus dividend of 60 cents a share. This represented a pay-out of more than HKDollars 160m, allowing the Ma family to reap some rewards from the transaction. However, it has only come to light now that the executive directors paid themselves an additional HKDollars 67m bonus for their role in this transaction. It still remains unclear how they have justified paying themselves what amounts to a 17 per cent transaction fee. They had already received as ordinary remuneration the equivalent of the company's entire net profit before extraordinary items. This is no isolated incident. Hong Kong's minority shareholders rarely challenge directors, and it has become accepted that certain groups carry exceptional risk/reward profiles. Evergo Holdings, run by the Lau Brothers, instigated one of the more notorious payment schemes when its four family directors increased their remuneration by 32 per cent to HKDollars 60.8m in 1990, a year in which the company posted a net loss of HKDollars 13.4m. Although the package was approved by shareholders, the Laus eventually agreed to reimburse HKDollars 15m of their pay through a bonus dividend, in response to the subsequent public uproar. The UK's Cadbury report addresses the issue of directors' reimbursement in detail, but since most Hong Kong companies have yet to take up the primary recommendation of introducing a broad base of independent directors, there seems little hope of short-term change. However, Hong Kong's regulators are keen to demonstrate the stock market is evolving. In the past year, the government has appointed inspectors to examine accusations of alleged corporate misfeasance by two large groups, Allied and Tomson Pacific. This has coincided with a tightening of the rules on disclosure, and an increasing willingness on the part of the stock exchange to investigate suspected abuses of minority shareholders and extreme price movements in shares. However, few investigations have borne fruit. Mr Herbert Hui, head of the stock exchange's listing division, said the exchange was 'looking into' the issue of Sincere's remuneration policy, and the company had been put under pressure to release a more detailed explanation to shareholders. One irony in the furore over Sincere is that when Mr Selwyn Mar took on the job of managing director in 1989, he allowed himself only a nominal salary of HKDollars 1 per year, and said he was going to shake up the 90-year-old department store group. As Mr Archie Hart, research director of Crosby Securities, said: 'Whatever Cadbury means to UK institutions, in Hong Kong it is still just a chocolate bar.'</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Fears over Lombard TRADERS experienced one of the most bearish sessions this year on both the sterling cash and futures markets, with many operators fearing that the Bundesbank will move the emergency Lombard rate up in the autumn. Cash rates in the sterling money market firmed to the highest levels that they have been at since the  1/2 percentage point base rate cut on May 5. Three-month and 6-month sterling cash were offered at 10 5/16 per cent from 10 1/4 per cent the night before, and 1 year LIBOR ended at 10 1/4 per cent from 10 3/16 per cent. Sterling futures were also bearish, with the September contract dropping 23 basis points to close at 89.68. That figure reflects the view that the next base rate move could be upwards, and that 3-month sterling cash in September will be in the region of 10 1/3 per cent. The fall was partly triggered by another poor performance from sterling on the foreign exchanges. It dropped nearly a pfennig to close at DM2.855. One trader said that he feared the Bundesbank has a 'hidden agenda' to raise the Lombard rate next month in an attempt to curb the growth in M3 money supply. Traders are now waiting to see whether the Bundesbank allows call money to firm towards the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate on Wednesday. The Bank of England's decision to deal in bands 3 and 4 at the rates of 9 21/32 per cent and 9 19/32 per cent - which applied prior to its decision to shave rates on July 3 - had no impact omn cash rates. The fact that the Bank was again dealing in the longer-dated bands might have been expected to soften cash rates from the highs that they had attained over the last week, but failed to do so. 'The Bank has lost the initiative for the moment,' said one trader. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn, dealt in Bands 1 and 2 at the established rate of 9 7/8 per cent and bought repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank purchased Pounds 15m in Band 3, Pounds 8m in Band 4, and Pounds 200m in a repo repayable on 6 and 7 August. Later, it purchased Pounds 80m in Band 1, Pounds 162m in Band 3, Pounds 4m of Band 4 Local Authority bills, Pounds 132m in Band 4, and Pounds 39m in the repo. In the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 629m in Band 1, Pounds 220m in Band 2, Pounds 84m in Band 3 and Pounds 21m in Band 4. Late assistance was Pounds 140m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Man-no (3769 2581 1226): "It Is Said That </F> Deng Xiaoping Will Pass Lunar New Year in Zhuhai"]    [Text] An informed source in Zhuhai told this reporter  that mainland China's supreme leader Deng Xiaoping is planning a  trip to Zhuhai on the eve of the Spring Festival and planning to  pass the Lunar New Year there. State Council Premier Li Peng  has just had a vacation in Zhuhai and took the opportunity to  inspect some large capital construction projects there.    The informed source revealed that State Council Premier Li  Peng's current southern tour is basically a winter vacation, and  he is to carry out an inspection tour of the developing urban  economy of the Zhu Jiang Delta in Guangdong in passing. Li Peng  spent seven days in Zhuhai this time, the longest stay in a  single place in his southern tour itinerary. While vacationing,  he visited some large capital construction projects in Zhuhai.  Endorsing Zhuhai's plan to build the Lingdingyang Bridge, which  will link the city with Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Li Peng urged  Zhuhai to speed up the construction of the project.    The informed source said several central leaders will take  vacations in Zhuhai this year since it is quite cold in Beijing  during winter. As the weather is fine in Zhuhai, the city is  clean, and traffic and personnel control is easy here as a  special economic zone, apart from Li Peng, who has just left  Zhuhai after vacationing, Deng Xiaoping will also come to Zhuhai  on the eve of the Spring Festival to pass the Lunar New Year  here, and then return to Beijing after the Spring Festival.</p>

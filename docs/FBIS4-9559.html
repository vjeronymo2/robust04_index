			<p>BFN     [Text] The Presidential Council of the Croat republic of  Herzeg-Bosna, at a session which is still in progress, is  considering the last three meetings of the highest-ranking  representatives of the Bosniak Muslim and Croat sides concerning  the election of the leaders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation. Here is a report by Zdenko Vranjes:    [Vranjes] The delegation of the Croat republic of  Herzeg-Bosna has already been to Sarajevo three times and they  were also willing to reach a compromise in order for a political  agreement on the nationality of the president, vice president  and prime minister of the federation to be reached. Despite the  fact that the deadline for the election of the leaders of the  federation is drawing to an end -- according to the  constitution, the assembly should reach a decision on this by 30  April at the latest -- the Bosniak side, in the talks hitherto,  has shown absolute disinterest and a lack of readiness to  discuss this. The Bosniak side, furthermore, has also failed to  fulfil the obligations it took on with the agreement between the  government of Herzeg-Bosna and the government in Sarajevo.    In addition to this assessment, the Presidential Council of  the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna also concluded that the  Croatian representatives and the authorities of Herzeg-Bosna --  if the Bosniak side does not soon fulfill its obligations and  fails to come up with an initiative for political agreements --  will interpret this as its unwillingness to implement the  Washington agreement consistently and will propose measures  within its competence which, in this situation would protect  Croatian interests.    This conclusion could even have been sharper in view of the  fact that several examples were cited which indicate that the  Bosniak side has not taken the provisions of the Washington  agreement sufficiently seriously and responsibly. Both in  Sarajevo and in Mostar there are all too many public statements  which show that the Bosniak side has not halted the media war,  but is even intensifying it. The Bosniak members of the  commission for development are not coming to meetings because  they are refusing to answer the question of where are the 26  Croats, whom Muslim soldiers took away from their prison in  Bugojno and led off in an unknown direction. Bosniak  representatives are not only not giving proof of their interest  in implementing the constitution of the federation, but want to  conduct all talks on the basis of old relations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and not on the basis of the declared  constitution of the federation, it was said at the session of  the Herzeg-Bosna Presidential Council which is still going on in  Mostar.</p>

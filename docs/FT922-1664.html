			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Portents give few clues to Irish talks SYMBOLISM rather than substance dominated the first negotiations yesterday between Northern Ireland Unionists and the Irish government since 1973 - or since partition in the 1920s, depending on definitions. This was not 'strand two' of the talks on Northern Ireland's future. It was about drawing up an agenda for the point when the Irish government will formally enter to talk about relations between north and south Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has still to announce when that will be. As befitted a meeting no side wanted to overpromote, delegations were of officials or MPs, not party leaders and ministers. Arrivals were in modest official saloons or black cabs. Confidentiality was kept. The Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party was expected to be the most recalcitrant. He wants strand one - on devolution, and still supposedly taking place in Belfast - finished before strand two starts. But he sent his daughter Rhonda and Mr Nigel Dodds, a former lord mayor of Belfast - the grandest post in Ulster's local politics, even if its responsibilities stretch only to bins, bogs and burials. As for other portents, Dr Chris McGimpsey, of the Ulster Unionist party, wore a green tie. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party - the most keen on strand two and strand three (the final strand) - arrived 10 minutes late. 'Bomb scares all over the place,' said Mr Seamus Mallon, SDLP deputy leader. The independent chairman was Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia. He has had a rapid lesson in the nuances of Northern Ireland politics. Inside, the delegations sat around a rectangular ash table with green inlay. They talked, broke for lunch, then met again. Late in the afternoon, as a storm broke over Westminster, a statement was agreed. 'The parties completed consideration of a possible agenda for strand two,' it said. As with the thunder, it was not clear what was foreshadowed.</p>

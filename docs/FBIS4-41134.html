			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian Presidential Press Secretary Levon Zurabyan  held a news conference today. Our correspondent Gevorg Gazaryan  was present.    [Begin recording] [Gazaryan] Armenian Presidential Press  Secretary Levon Zurabyan opened his news conference by saying:  The republic's president has so often expressed his views on  the Constitution that there is no need to discuss it again  today. I will instead discuss Karabakh and the peace process.  He reminded reporters of the different phases of the mediation  efforts for peace by the CSCE and Russia, and of the fact that  no guaranteed cease-fire has been established due to the  position of the Azerbaijani authorities, something that could  have opened the door to further steps.    Asked about Azerbaijan's position on the establishment of  peace in the region, Mr. Zurabyan said:    [Zurabyan] Azerbaijan is reneging on its previous position,  which it declared during the visit of Ambassador Mosberg, deputy  chairman of CSCE Minsk Group, to the region between 26 April to  2 May. At that time, Azerbaijan was ready for an unconditional  cease-fire. This change, and the latest incidents in  Noyemberyanskiy Rayon, about which you already know, and the  [Armenian] Foreign Ministry's statement on 18 June in connection  with these incidents testify to the hardening of Azerbaijan's  position. This causes serious concern for Armenia.    [Gazaryan] The press secretary then assessed the mediation  efforts of Jan Eliasson, chairman of CSCE Minsk Group. Let me  remind you that Eliasson visited Baku and Yerevan twice and  Stepanakert once. The ambassador met with the Armenian  president. He also met the Armenian foreign minister yesterday.    [Zurabyan] Eliasson's mission produced no tangible progress  in the peace process in practical terms. In contrast to his  previous visit, this time joint examination of the first and  second phases [of the peace process] and the deployment of the  peace forces in the conflict zone were stressed. Eliasson also  expressed concern that if there were a delay in agreement on the  second phase, the CSCE observers who were to be deployed at the  first phase could find themselves in a dangerous and uncertain  situation.    [Gazaryan] Asked if the CSCE and Russian mediatory efforts  have reached an impasse, the press secretary replied:    [Zurabyan] Regarding cooperation between CSCE and Russia on  stationing observers and peace forces -- which would have  prevented Azerbaijan from engaging in constant evasive maneuvers  between the two mediatory missions -- there has not been any  real progress on this issue yet. In effect, this issue lacks  the necessary mutual consensus and cooperation, which otherwise  would substantially contribute to the productivity of the  peaceful settlement. [end recording]</p>

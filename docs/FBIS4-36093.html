			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The Nonaligned Movement's  [NAM] foreign ministers conference issued a resolution today  ending the work of the NAM committee on South Africa and  submitting a recommendation to this effect to the movement's  countries and governments leaders for ratification.    The conference said in its final session that this  resolution  is based on the start of a new stage in the history of South  Africa following the holding of the first democratic elections  there and the formation of a nonracial government.    It noted that the resolution is in line with the report  presented by Indonesia's special envoy Nanasutrisna [name as  received], who chaired the NAM session and who called for ending  the work of the committee in light of these developments.</p>

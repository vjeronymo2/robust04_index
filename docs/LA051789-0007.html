			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST  </P> <P> Five reputed gang members are in custody in connection with the shooting last  week of Paul Holmes, a Southeast San Diego resident who was listed in good  condition Tuesday at Mercy Hospital, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police on Monday arrested a 17-year-old boy and 19-year-old Jovee Smallwood.  Three other suspects, 18-year-old Andy Villareal, a 17-year-old juvenile and a  15-year-old juvenile, were arrested last week, but Smallwood is believed to be  the triggerman, police said.  </P> <P> The youths had gone to the Holmes residence in the 300 block of Northgate  Street on May 8 to visit Holmes' son. Police said Holmes' son went outside but,  when an argument ensued, Paul Holmes called his son back inside. As the door  closed, four shots were fired, all of them hitting Paul Holmes.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Dave Cohen said investigators believe all five suspects are  gang members. A search of Smallwood's residence in the 3900 block of Birch  Street and another residence in the 200 block of 19th Street turned up several  guns, including a .22-caliber pistol believed to have been used in the  shooting.  </P> <P> The five are expected to be charged with attempted murder, assault with a  deadly weapon and conspiracy to commit assault, Cohen said. Smallwood also was  being held on suspicion of possessing a stolen gun.  </P></p>

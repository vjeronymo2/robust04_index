If the approval is conditional, the conditions shall be set forth in the Cooperative Agreement. Upon approval or conditional approval, a Cooperative Agreement may be issued by the Grants Management Specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In considering the application, significant factors shall include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The ability of the applicant to contribute Matching Funds; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For applicants who have been previously funded, the quality of their performance in the previous Budget period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In the event of a conditional approval, SBA reserves the right to conditionally fund a recipient organization for one or more specified periods of time up to a maximum of one Budget period in order to provide the recipient organization with time to resolve the conditions set forth in the conditional approval. When the SBA conditionally funds a recipient organization, the specific conditions and applicable remedies which must be addressed will be set forth as special terms and conditions in the Cooperative Agreement. In the event the recipient organization fails to resolve such conditions to SBA's satisfaction within the time period provided by SBA, SBA has the right to determine not to continue to fund the SBDC, subject to the provisions of &sect;130.700(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;130.440  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maximum amount of grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No recipient of funds shall receive an SBDC grant which would exceed the greater of: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The minimum statutory amount, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Its pro rata share of all SBDC grants as determined by the statutory formula set forth in section 21(a)(4) of the Small Business Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;130.450  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Matching Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) As a condition of any Cooperative Agreement or amendment or modification thereof, the recipient organization must provide total Matching Funds equal to the total amount of the SBA funding and all amendments or modifications thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All sources of Matching Funds must be identified as specifically as possible. In the case of cash, sources shall be identified by name and account number in the budget proposal and shall be certified by an authorized official of the recipient organization or by any sponsoring SBDC organization providing a Cash Match through a sub-contract agreement. The account containing such cash must be under the direct management of the SBDC Director, or, if provided by a sponsoring SBDC organization, by its SBDC employee. If the State is providing such cash, and if the State appropriation cycle permits, the recipient organization must verify that sufficient funds will be available prior to the use of Federal dollars. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Grants Management Specialist is responsible for determining Matching Funds or Cash Match meet the requirements of the statute and appropriate OMB circulars. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overmatched amounts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) SBDCs are encouraged to furnish Overmatched Amounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Once approved as part of the budget, any Overmatched Amount can be applied to any additional Matching Funds requirements that would be necessary in the case of a supplemental funding increase received by the SBDC during the budget period, as long as the total Cash Match being provided by the SBDC remains at 50% or more of the total SBA funds provided during the budget period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If used in the manner described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, such Overmatched Amount is reclassified as committed Matching Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Allowable Overmatched Amounts which have not been used in the manner described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may, with the approval of the AA/SBDCs, be used as a credit to offset any confirmed audit disallowances applicable to the Budget period in which the Overmatched Amount exists. Offsetting funds shall be considered to be used as Matching Funds and are not again allowable as Matching Funds for past or future Budget periods. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

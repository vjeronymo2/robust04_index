			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Export credit rates review THE premiums Australia's exporters pay to insure against default by foreign buyers are under review, with higher rates possible on trade with riskier countries, according to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. According to Mr Graham Nottle, manager of the Treasury and Loans division of EFIC, the review is due to be complete by the end of June: 'The objective would be to move to a more market rate of premium,' Mr Nottle noted: 'We are adjusting premiums with policy holders. They may not pay more, but may take on more risk themselves.' The Australian review follows recent decisions by Hermes, the leading German export credit agency, and the US Eximbank, to adjust their premium structures.</p>

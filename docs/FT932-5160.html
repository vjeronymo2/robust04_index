			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Bundesbank attack on 'sham' proposals for changes in EMS RECENT suggestions for adapting the European Monetary System were dismissed yesterday as 'deceptive. . . sham proposals' by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank. He was particularly antagonistic to notions that German monetary policy must pay greater attention to conditions in the entire EMS area and that Germany should agree to increase intramarginal intervention in order to defend fixed central exchange rates. In his view, this was neither acceptable in Germany, where policy is controllled by the Bundesbank, nor in the best interests of other EMS member states, he told an international audience in Frankfurt last night. The Bundesbank, which has drawn fresh international and domestic fire for its renewed reluctance to ease interest rates in the interests of helping the EC, including Germany, to escape from recession, 'must and will do all it can to safeguard the anchor function of the D-Mark,' he said. Success in this task depended mainly on maintaining the credibility of Germany's domestic anti-inflation policy, which was the only way of safeguarding stability in the entire system. Proposals for an early shift to monetary union by the so-called 'hard-core' group were also blighted by substantial institutional differences, political uncertainty and economic divergences, Mr Tietmeyer observed. There were considerable disparities between the 'stable' Community countries, especially in public sector budgets and labour market conditions. Germany had particular difficulties with the economic adjustment to unification, a process which had started relatively late, he noted. The Community should abide by the timetable set down in the Maastricht treaty, which provided for an initial review at the end of 1996. Mr Tietmeyer, expected to succeed Mr Helmut Schlesinger as Bundesbank president this year, said modifying the economic convergence criteria governing potential participants in monetary union would be a 'fateful mistake'. Easier conditions would discredit and threaten the stability of the future European currency even before it came into existence. He also criticised more recent suggestions for softening EMS rules by extending permissible margins of exchange rate fluctuation and allowing the temporarily over-stepping of intervention points. A monetary system fitted with loopholes 'for all possible contingencies will hardly be able to fulfil its purpose as an instrument of discipline,' he said. He also warned against the 'artificial' development of the Ecu into a parallel currency. In this context, measures to promote the use of the Ecu, recently reactivated by the EC Commission, could adversely affect member states' monetary policies.</p>

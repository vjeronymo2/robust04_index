			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 24 Jun (AFP) -- Police armoured vehicles were  posted on main roads in Lagos on Friday [24 June] as authorities  boosted security following the arrest of Moshood Abiola,  believed to have won Nigeria's free elections, local residents  said. Some police armoured vehicles were stationed along  Ikorodu Road, a main thoroughfare that crosses the city, and in  the residential Oshodi district, as well as along Western  Avenue, a major artery into the commercial nerve-centre of the  city, they said.    The move came after Abiola was picked up from his residence  Thursday by policemen after addressing a public rally in Lagos  attended by about 2,000 people. Abiola was arrested after  vowing on June 11 to set up an alternative government, ahead of  the anniversary of presidential elections of June 12, 1993 which  were annulled by the military government.    Officials said that the extra security might be connected to  a visit by Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha to military  officers and men at the Ikeja military cantonment, as part of  his efforts to rally military support to his government. But  groups of policemen, armed with guns, teargas canisters and  batons were also seen Friday morning -- stationed about 100  metres (yards) apart -- on some other major Lagos streets,  particularly in trouble-prone areas of northern Lagos, residents  said. They also noticed a sudden increase in numbers of armed  soldiers usually deployed to protect government agencies such as  the central bank, the national radio and television stations,  and the national telephone and electricity companies.    Newspapers here Friday published the photograph of Kudiratu,  a wife of Chief Abiola, leading a group of peaceful protesters  on Thursday in some streets around the Lagos residence of the  politician in Ikeja. The GUARDIAN reported that hundreds of  people in Ibadan, capital of western Oyo State, on Thursday  booed and jeered General Abacha.    The head of state, accompanied by his service chiefs, has  been paying visits to other major military formations in various  parts of the country since Wednesday.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Perot claims of electoral 'dirty tricks' backfire THERE were signs yesterday that Mr Ross Perot's unsubstantiated charges of dirty tricks against President George Bush's presidential campaign were beginning to hurt him in the eyes of the US electorate, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. The two latest public opinion polls, by ABC News and CNN/USA Today, restored a double digit lead, 11 points in both cases, to Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate. Both had Mr Perot at less than 20 per cent, while the head of Gallup said in an interview his surveys found that support for the independent candidate had peaked and that his 'favourable' ratings has stopped going up. Mr Bush yesterday described Mr Perot's charges that there was a Republican plot to disrupt his daughter's wedding as 'crazy'. He thought Mr Perot's self-financed campaign was, historically, 'most unusual' and, generally, 'a little bizarre'. Throughout his swing through North Carolina on Monday, Mr Clinton confined himself to disparaging both his opponents for apparently investigating each other's children. Media reports and commentaries have turned savagely critical of Mr Perot who, in turn, has been critical of the media. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post, in editorials, found it incredible he should now invent another reason for leaving the race in July. The Times referred to 'traits that bear directly on his fitness for office,' while the Post wondered about his 'startling belief in secret manoeuvrings against him by malign forces worldwide'. The condemnation of the political columnists has been almost universal. Mr David Broder of the Washington Post, who had reported favourably on Mr Perot's post-debate surge only last week, wrote yesterday that the candidate's behaviour was 'odd and disturbing'. Mr A. M. Rosenthal in the New York Times urged Mr Clinton and Mr Bush to stop treating Mr Perot with deference so that he did not continue to blight US political life. If Mr Perot's popularity starts falling, the logical beneficiary is Mr Clinton, who has been hurt most by his rise. Amid the latest polling volatility, Mr Bush's support has remained flat, in the low 30s, while Mr Clinton's has dropped from the upper to the lower 40s. In his TV interview yesterday, Mr Bush expressed confidence he would win next Tuesday because he felt he had earned the trust of the country, which Mr Clinton had not. Asked if he liked Mr Clinton, he smiled and said: 'Yeah, and I think he likes me.' On the stump in New Mexico the president sought to lift the level of the campaign in a speech about the economic and philosophical differences between him and Mr Clinton. He described himself as a 'conservative activist' and laid claim to some of the populist traits of both his opponents. This was apparently the speech long promised for delivery by Mr James Baker, the hitherto invisible White House chief of staff who is now accompanying Mr Bush on his travels. It was deemed better for the president to voice it so as to avoid the implication that he is weak on economic issues. Mr Clinton, while never misses a chance to condemn 'trickle down economics', has also been pushing his vision of a participatory economic democracy. Throughout his North Carolina bus trip he sought to portray himself as a non-conventional Democrat whose message was: 'We're going to empower people to take control of their own lives, then hold them accountable for doing so.'</p>

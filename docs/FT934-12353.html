			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Democratic credentials in South Africa Sir, Joe Rogaly's assessment of the South African scene displayed some familiarity with the subject. But his lofty assertion that the newly formed Freedom Alliance's leaders (Inkatha, Conservative party, Afrikaner Volksfront, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei) have poor credentials as demo-crats cannot pass without comment. I will not attempt to claim that Africa produces state-of-the-art, western-style democrats. But as many well-informed South Africa correspondents, human rights campaigners (including Helen Suzman) and political commentators have observed, the two most blatantly undemocratic organisations in South Africa are the ANC-South African Communist party alliance and the ruling National party. It is difficult to determine which of them has the more shameful human rights record or which, in the past, had the firmer resolve to squash free speech or criticism. Many now feel the ANC-SACP alliance is the greater offender, since left-wing 'censorship' is now so virulent. Either way, one wonders what on earth Joe Rogaly is trying to say. He cannot be implying that Nelson Mandela's or President F W de Klerk's democratic credentials are impressive, can he? They are both good public relations men, not democrats.

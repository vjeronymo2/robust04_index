			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Army chief dies in shoot-out At least 13 people, including the commander of the Algiers military district, died in a shoot-out yesterday that ended a 24-hour standoff between police and Moslem militants in the Algerian capital. The clash was the bloodiest single gun battle in the capital during the 33-month conflict pitting Islamic extremists against the military-backed regime. Among the dead was Col Cherif Djelloul, shot by gunmen as he tried to negotiate the release of hostages. The government, meanwhile, returned two fundamentalist leaders to jail after they urged militants to continue their rebellion, which has left more than 11,000 dead.</p>

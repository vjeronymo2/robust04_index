			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / People: Finance moves Ernst &amp; Young International has appointed Michael Henning as its first international chief executive officer. Ernst &amp; Young International is an affiliation of national firms which maintain considerable independence rather than a single global operation. The creation of this position, therefore, marks part of a reorganisation of the network designed to strengthen its ability to serve multinational clients and create a common approach around the world. As part of the change, the firm has also created three regional executives, who will report directly to Henning. Bryant McCarthy, based in New York, will be responsible for the international activities of the Americas region. Ben Gossens, based in Amsterdam, will take charge of Europe, Middle East and Africa. Paul McMahon, based in Singapore, will be in charge of Asia/Pacific. Henning became co-chairman of the US firm in 1993, and was previously vice-chairman for tax services there. His new job will give him a role in shaping the future direction of the firm's 600 offices in 100 countries.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS WATCH;  </P> <P> UNFAN-LIKE CONDUCT  </P> <P> Fans who would like to savor Los Angeles Raiders games without showing up at  the Coliseum with bodyguards -- or first completing bodybuilding or Tae Kwon Do  training programs -- perhaps can breathe a little easier.  </P> <P> The general manager of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum says he has had  enough.  </P> <P> So have the police.  </P> <P> Last Sunday a fan rooting for the opposing Pittsburgh Steelers was given a  severe beating by Raider fans, or fan. (One alleged assailant has been arrested  but the investigation is continuing.)  </P> <P> By the time security officials reached the scene, the 35-year-old Tucson  resident had to be taken to the hospital. As a result of this vicious and  unacceptable incident, Coliseum policy is to be toughened, effective Sunday at  the Chicago Bears game. Violent spectators will now be subject to arrest by  police, not just banishment from the stands. Fans entering the stadium will be  screened by police for drunkenness. The sales of alcoholic beverages will be  closely monitored.  </P> <P> One hopes the new policy will curb the ruffians who would spoil the game for  the rest of the fans. Fan violence is not a new phenomenon, but until now its  prevalence has seemed largely the predilection of some American hockey and many  English soccer fans.  </P> <P> The thought that someone might even lose his life -- the Tucson victim briefly  sank into a frightening coma -- while watching a football game is chilling. The  game on the field is brutal enough without people in the stands behaving like  prehistoric beasts.  </P></p>

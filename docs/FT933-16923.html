			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Mates and worse MR MICHAEL MATES, the former Northern Ireland minister, is convinced that something is wrong with the system whereby the controversial businessman Mr Asil Nadir is, or is not, being brought to justice. Who could disagree? Mr Nadir has inflicted losses on hundreds of innocent people. He has obstructed the administrators of Polly Peck in their attempts to retrieve something from the wreckage. He has jumped bail, despite retaining enough money to hire the best lawyers in the land. Yet Mr Mates worries about the plight of Mr Nadir, now sunning himself in northern Cyprus. He accuses the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) of a campaign to undermine Mr Nadir's defence. In his own campaign, however, Mr Mates has failed to deliver persuasive evidence of any conspiracy. There is a debate to be had about the SFO's powers and its style, but Mr Mates has not made the case for basing that case on the Nadir affair. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, was right yesterday to reject an independent inquiry and his decision to publish the relevant correspondence, albeit in edited form, is welcome. Mr Mates's priorities look quixotic. Mr Nadir, in contrast, is no Quixote, but he must be congratulating himself on finding a Sancho Panza prepared to defend his interests to the death. The government's priority should still be to put Mr Nadir on trial. That may be a pious hope, but ministers have little alternative but to apply further pressure on the Turkish authorities to secure the return of a man who has made a fool of Britain's politicians and its courts.</p>

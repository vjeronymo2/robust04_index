			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pressure at Metallgesellschaft Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive at the troubled Metallgesellschaft metals, mining and industrial group, is set to come under increasing pressure at a specially convened meeting of the group's supervisory board tomorrow. It is understood that the meeting will examine preliminary results of intensive investigations by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, large shareholders in the company, as well as creditors, into the Frankfurt-based group's liquidity. The investigations were launched last week after Deutsche and Dresdner granted Metallgesellschaft special credit facilities to allow it to meet what were then described as temporary liquidity problems. These arose as a result of the activities of MG Corp, the group's US trading subsidiary, in US commodities futures markets. Frankfurt sources suggest that the liquidity support may have been as high as DM2bn (Dollars 1.1bn). News of the special credit facilities triggered a fall in the share price last week in spite of a public declaration of support for Metallgesellschaft from Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive. The shares, up DM4.9 to DM305.20 yesterday, have fallen 28 per cent since the start of last week and the group is now capitalised at DM2.7bn. Although Mr Kopper said last Tuesday that Metallgesellschaft's liquidity problems were caused by technical problems and were not 'life-threatening', it is understood that since then the banks have reassessed the group's problems in the the light of new information. The banks are believed to be prepared to carry on supporting Metallgesellschaft. The group has been hit by cheap metals imports from eastern Europe and the severity of the German recession. In the year to the end of September it lost DM347m. The immediate cause of the current problems were said last week to be margin calls - cash pay-outs - on oils future contracts taken out by MG Corp, triggered by the recent sharp fall in oil prices.</p>

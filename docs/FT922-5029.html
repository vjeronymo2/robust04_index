			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Observer: Step in the right direction Anglo American, having long resisted token appointments of blacks to its board, has now leapt into the deep end by making sociologist Dr Mamphela Ramphele a non-executive director. While Anglo is doubtless pleased about the symbolic effect of having a black woman on the board, there is nothing tokenistic in the appointment. Indeed, chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson's comment that she 'would bring a new aspect to our deliberations' is an understatement. Ramphele, a close friend of martyred black activist Steve Biko, who died in police detention in 1976, is a formidable personality, likely to subject Anglo's corporate practices to gruelling scrutiny. Indeed, the dialogue between her and Anglo hard men like Graham Boustred and Lesley Boyd would be worth paying good money to listen to. A deputy vice-chancellor at Cape Town university, Ramphele made her name as co-author with Dr Francis Wilson of an acclaimed study on poverty. She has been helping Anglo in research to define affordable programmes to alleviate hardship. The company will have been attracted by Ramphele's robust liberalism, combining championship of the oppressed with the tenet that the state must not encourage a culture of entitlement. But will it be enough to stop those who want Anglo broken up?</p>

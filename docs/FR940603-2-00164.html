Building contractors, construction tradespeople, building inspectors and plan reviewers play an essential role in ensuring that new construction, additions, and alterations are accessible. Many smaller projects, particularly alterations, are accomplished by contractors and tradespeople without the use of architects or other design professionals. Business owners, State and local governments, service agencies and other ADA covered entities rely on the knowledge and expertise of builders to meet a myriad of needs, one of which is compliance with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design; and contractors and tradespeople rely on building inspectors and plan reviewers for advice and assistance in understanding and applying these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With access to educational materials and services, building contractors and skilled construction tradespeople at the local level can help business owners comply with the ADA and reduce claims of discrimination by people with disabilities based on inaccessible facilities or elements. Since the enactment of the ADA, a wealth of educational material on complying with the accessible design requirements has been developed by Federal agencies for use by entities and individuals with responsibilities and rights under the ADA and professionals who may provide services that will assist these groups in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act. Examples of such information include the Department of Justice's ADA Standards for Accessible Design, and title II and III Technical Assistance Manuals; the Access Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines Checklist and various Technical Assistance Bulletins (addressing accessibility topics such as detectable warnings, visual alarms, TTYs, slip-resistant surfaces and using ADAAG). Other materials have been produced through federally funded grant programs and examples include DOJ funded projects such as the American Hotel and Motel Association's Accommodating All Guests compliance manual, the Food Marketing Institute's ADA Starter Kit for Supermarkets and the ADA Compliance Manual for Supermarkets, and the National Restaurant Association's ADA: Answers for Foodservice Operators compliance manual and A Warm Welcome videotape on compliance for the food service industry. Examples of grants funded through the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) include numerous ADA Design Tech Sheets (illustrated technical materials addressing such topics as signage, areas of rescue assistance, accessible route, ATMs, curb ramps, ground and floor surfaces, etc.), and the Title II Action Guide for State and Local Governments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

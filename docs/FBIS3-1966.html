Official sources said that by the end of this century, an  estimated output value of more than three billion yuan will be  realized by the fluorination industry of the province.    At present, the fluorination industrial sector is capable of  producing about ten types of products, including basic  fluorination materials, elementary fluoride and fluo-medicine,  according to official sources.    In the past decade, the province has invested a total of  some  470 million yuan to introduce advanced technology and equipment  such as instruments for the production of anhydrous hydrofluoric  acid and methane-chloride, in support of the technological  development of its fluorination industry.</p>

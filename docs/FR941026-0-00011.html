The SEC has amended Rule 17a&hyph;11 and the Department's amendments parallel the SEC's changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pub.

(202) 219&hyph;3632. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> When the Department first adopted rules and regulations affecting government securities brokers and dealers, it took into consideration the already existing regulation of securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC under sections 15 or 15B of the Exchange Act, with a view toward preventing overly burdensome or duplicative regulations. In that regard, the GSA regulations incorporated, by reference, many of the SEC's rules regulating brokers and dealers, including, with modification, Rule 17a&hyph;11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 7, 1993, the SEC adopted amendments to 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;11 (Rule 17a&hyph;11), which became effective August 12, 1993. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The primary purpose of Rule 17a&hyph;11 is to provide the SEC and other regulatory bodies with advance warning and information regarding brokers and dealers that are experiencing financial or operational difficulty. Prior to the SEC's amendments, Rule 17a&hyph;11 required a broker or dealer to give notice and transmit supplemental reports to the Commission and other regulatory bodies when its net capital declined below its required minimum level or when its total outstanding principal amount of satisfactory subordination agreements exceeded allowable levels for more than 90 days. The SEC's amendments, among other things, eliminated the requirement that brokers and dealers file Part II or Part IIA of Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5, Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (``FOCUS Report'') after a net capital deficiency. Brokers and dealers, however, remain obligated to transmit same-day notice of such a capital deficiency. Additionally, prior to the amendments to Rule 17a&hyph;11, brokers and dealers whose net capital fell below certain ``early warning levels'' <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  were required to file monthly FOCUS Report for at least three successive months. This requirement was eliminated by the amendments and replaced with the requirement that brokers and dealers promptly notify the Commission and their designated examining authority (``DEA'') of the triggering event. However, the changes to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11 did not apply to registered government securities brokers and dealers because the Treasury is the rulemaker for these firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32586 (July 7, 1993), 58 FR 37655&hyph;58 (July 13, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Early warning levels are capital levels set at amounts that are higher than the minimum capital requirement. In situations where the capital level of a broker or dealer is declining, the early warning level serves the purpose of alerting regulatory agencies that the firm may be experiencing financial or operational difficulty. This early notification enables the regulatory agencies to monitor the activities of a broker-dealer and assess its financial condition while there is still time to take action to prevent the broker-dealer from falling out of compliance with the minimum capital requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires, with certain modifications, every registered government securities broker or dealer to comply with Rule 17a&hyph;11. Consistent with the SEC's pre-amendment Rule 17a&hyph;11, &sect;405.3 has required registered government securities brokers and dealers, including interdealer brokers and futures commission merchants (FCMs), to provide notice of capital deficiencies, to submit financial reports within 24 hours of a capital deficiency, and to file supplemental reports for three successive months when capital falls below early warning levels. Since the SEC's amendments to Rule 17a&hyph;11, without conforming amendments to &sect;405.3 of the GSA regulations, the rules applicable to government securities brokers and dealers have been unclear. At the time of the amendments to SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, Treasury was unable to revise the GSA regulations accordingly because its rulemaking authority had expired in October 1991 and reauthorization legislation was still being considered by the Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

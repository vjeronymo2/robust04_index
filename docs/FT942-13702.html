			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: J Bibby sells feeds business to AB Foods J Bibby &amp; Sons, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday called off the proposed flotation of four of its businesses in favour of a Pounds 35m sale of the agricultural feeds operation to Associated British Foods. Shareholders will still receive the promised spin-off dividend of 2p, as well as a previously uncertain interim pay-out of 1p. Last year, the group paid a 2p interim. Barlow Rand, the South African company which owns 79 per cent of Bibby, has waived its entitlement to the special dividend. The decision to call off the flotation means that Bibby's profits this year will be hit by the absence of the agricultural business, a substantial provision for the three operations it will retain, and the Pounds 2.5m costs of the abortive float. Charges to restructure the paper products, laboratory and electro-optics businesses are expected to run into several millions of pounds. The special dividend will cost a further Pounds 600,000. The effects of the provisions and profits loss are likely to be partially offset by interest savings of at least Pounds 1m this year. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said the group had also significantly reduced trading losses in Spain, where Bibby owns the Caterpillar dealer Finanzauto. He said the loss on the disposal would be Pounds 12.1m, against more than Pounds 35m had the four businesses been floated. The sale to ABF will net Bibby about Pounds 31.75m, after a pension payment of Pounds 3.25m. Bibby, which built up substantial debt following the ill-fated Pounds 82m Spanish acquisition in 1992, expects gearing to fall from 70 per cent to 55 per cent after the sale.</p>

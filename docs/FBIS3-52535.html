			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, Jan 5 (AFP)--The PLO executive committee has  accepted some of the demands put forward by a delegation of  leading Palestinians towards making the organisation more  democratic, Palestinian sources here said Wednesday [5 January].    Delegation head Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi has been given full  powers to organize a broad dialogue grouping all factions with  the aim of uniting the Palestinians, the sources said.    'Abd-al-Shafi, who led bilateral negotiations with Israel  before the signing in September of an autonomy accord by the PLO  and the Jewish state, has headed the seven-member delegation  holding talks with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and close associates  here since Sunday.    The delegation called for the adoption of nine points  included in a memorandum signed by 120 prominent Palestinian  personalities from the occupied territories and the diaspora  last month.    The memorandum calls for more democracy in running PLO  affairs and demands a change in the conduct of negotiations with  Israel over limited autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank  town of Jericho.    'Arafat, who has been accused of being autocratic, is yet to  comment on the proposals.    The Palestinian source said two of the demands presented to  'Arafat and the executive committee have been rejected, while  all the others were likely to be adopted by the organisation.    These two were the proposal to create a high consultative  committee of experts with a parallel status to that of the  executive committee and the call for forming a supreme authority  to guide, direct and follow up the autonomy negotiations with  Israel.    Nabil 'Amr, an adviser of the PLO leader, said Tuesday he  expected some opposition to the proposal calling for the  creation of a consultative standing committee made up of experts  that would have similar authority to that of the executive  committee.    The question is not in the abundance of new structures, a  participant in the executive committee meetings told AFP  Wednesday.    "Our aim is to democratise and to make those already  existing  more efficient and productive," he said.    According to executive committee member 'Ali Ishaq, the body  chaired by 'Arafat has approved the reactivation of the PLO  Council of Planning which has been crippled for some time by a  financial crisis hitting the organisation since the end of the  1991 Gulf War.    Officials close to the PLO leader doubt that any result  would  come out from the democracy debate as they consider the move  itself a struggle for power only, rather than a call for real  sharing in the decision-making process.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Overseas buying lifts Hong Kong by 2.6% STRONG demand in the futures market prompted arbitrage buying, but later profit-taking eroded most of the share price gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed marginally ahead but at the day's low of 20,357.64, up 14.11 on the day. The index rose to a high of 20,599.36 in the morning on strength carried over from overnight trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The index later declined on small-lot selling by investment trusts and tokkin, or specified money trusts. Volume totalled 270m shares, against 261m. Rises led falls by 500 to 430, with 216 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 2.43 up at 1,657.22. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.25 to 1,255.11. Concern over the higher yen receded as the market hoped that the rise in the currency will prompt a cut in the official discount rate. Meanwhile, investors remained inactive ahead of the special parliamentary session tomorrow, where Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party, is expected to be chosen as prime minister. Financial issues were firm on renewed hopes of monetary easing. Industrial Bank of Japan appreciated Y80 to Y3,390 and Bank of Tokyo gained Y40 at Y1,780. Electronics issues continued to weaken. Hitachi fell Y13 to Y840 and NEC slipped Y11 to Y999. Steel makers were also lower, with Nippon Steel finishing Y8 off at Y357. Speculators traded Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day, which put on Y2 at Y25. Mining issues, which gained ground on the rise in gold prices on Monday, retreated on profit-taking. Mitsui Mining and Smelting shed Y10 to Y546 and Sumitomo Metal Mining lost Y30 to Y1,060. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 46.05 to 22,437.09 in volume of 12m shares. Some individuals and dealers sought bio-technology related issues. Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, was traded actively on prospects of firm profits, but was finally unchanged at Y2,820. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets turned in some impressive performances. HONG KONG advanced 2.6 per cent after a wave of overseas buying which took the Hang Seng index 182.80 higher to 7,211.83. Trading was quiet for much of the day but a late flurry of activity near the close brought turnover to a moderate HKDollars 3.5bn. Hong Kong Telecom advanced 50 cents to HKDollars 11.40 as some analysts recommended utilities as being immune to any downturn in the Chinese economy. China Light was up 75 cents to HKDollars 41. SINGAPORE finished sharply higher on buying by US funds which concentrated on index-linked stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index strengthened 31.34, or 1.73 per cent, to 1,844.58. NEW ZEALAND continued to climb to three-year highs, although activity was restrained after the recent good volumes, and trading in some second line stocks was thin. The NZSE-40 Capital index turned around from a weak opening to close a net 11.57 ahead at 1,826.90 in turnover of NZDollars 44m. AUSTRALIA crept to another post 1987-crash high, consolidating after recent strong gains, and the All Ordinaries index closed 0.6 higher at 1,855.4 in turnover of ADollars 383m. MANILA again closed at an all-time high although the recent strong rally began to ease as investors cashed in their gains. The composite index added 7.44 to 1,783.30. KUALA LUMPUR saw strong institutional buying of banking stocks which lifted the composite index 8.21 to a new high of 771.67. TAIWAN edged ahead with many investors sidelined in the absence of fresh incentives to buy. The weighted index rose 2.73 to 3,949.29 in turnover of TDollars 9.25bn. KARACHI was sharply lower as jobbers unloaded stocks to square holdings ahead of account settlement today. The KSE index fell 17.87 to 1,356.23.</p>

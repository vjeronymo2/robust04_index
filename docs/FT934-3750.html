			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Rover to switch staff to assembly line work Rover Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is seeking to transfer up to 1,000 indirect production workers and white-collar staff on to direct assembly line production work next year, Kevin Done writes. Mr John Towers, Rover Group managing director, has written to indirect production workers and staff in the search for volunteers to switch to direct jobs on the assembly lines in order to cope with an expected increase of more than 10 per cent in output in 1994. The company said that it was seeking to raise output without making any significant increase in the total workforce of about 33,000. Rover said that it had surplus indirect production workers in areas such as logistics, materials handling and maintenance, and it was chiefly seeking volunteers among these indirect workers to transfer to direct jobs on the assembly lines or in engine and transmission assembly and body pressings.</p>

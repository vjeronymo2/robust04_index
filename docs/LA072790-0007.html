			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPENING OF LIBRARY-MUSEUM RETURNS NIXON TO LIMELIGHT  </P> <P> Worse than burning the flag -- worse than parading Willie Horton -- worse than  the Iran-Contra guilt.  </P> <P> Worse than all these is the desecration of all the ideals our country is  supposed to stand for was the obscene spectacle of three ex-Presidents honoring  a man who escaped impeachment by resigning.  </P> <P> At this celebration, where were all the former jailbirds from his  co-conspirators who were found guilty of crimes lesser than his?  </P> <P> What greater shame can our ex-presidents Bush, Reagan and Ford bring upon  American history? This was a day that exceeds all in infamy.  </P> <P> GLENN L. ANDERSON  </P> <P> Topanga  </P></p>

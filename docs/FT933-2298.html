			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Guarantee of access for all citizens DRAFT versions of the Clinton plan propose the following: Universal benefits: For the first time all Americans would be guaranteed access to a standard package of healthcare regardless of income or employment status. National health security cards would prove eligibility. el,2 Employer mandate: Employers would be required to pay at least 80 per cent of the average cost of insurance premiums for employees although none would be expected to pay more than 7.9 per cent of payroll. Federal government would subsidise small businesses, and help low-paid employees and unemployed. el,2 Health alliances: Most individuals and companies would obtain care via regional purchasing co-operatives known as 'health alliances'. These public or private sector entities would use market clout to buy high-quality care at the lowest prices from competing 'health plans', offered by networks of doctors and hospitals. Companies with more than 5,000 employees would be able to set up independent 'corporate alliances'. National Health Board: A federal panel would oversee the creation of health alliances and regulate healthcare. It would set limits for growth rates of private-sector premiums, and government healthcare programmes. Caps on private premiums would aim to cut annual growth of private spending from about 7.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent by 2000. Managed care: Health alliances would supervise local health plans and facilitate consumer choice with information on prices, physicians and service quality. There would be a choice of traditional fee-for-service medicine, pre-paid health maintenance organisations (HMOs), which restrict choice of doctors, and hybrid schemes. Financial incentives would encourage choice of HMOs, which are seen as more cost-efficient. el,2 Financing: Goal is to finance the extension of health insurance to the 37m without cover and improve healthcare quality without a general tax increase. Revenue would come from new 'sin taxes' on cigarettes and alcohol, but main source is projected to come from capping growth of federal programmes, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Tax reforms: Employer-provided benefits in excess of the federally guaranteed package to be treated as taxable income of employees. Tax changes to be phased in over 10 years. Self-employed would be treated like those in employment, and be able to deduct 100 per cent of the cost of the standard benefits package. Primary care: Financial incentives would aim to increase proportion of doctors trained as GPs rather than specialists, and to encourage physicians to work in inner city and rural areas. New benefits: Dollars 80bn federal long-term care programme would subsidise nursing home and community care for the elderly and chronically ill. Range of mental health benefits to be expanded, and subsidies offered on prescription drugs. Timetable: Some states expected to introduce reforms in 1995, but all expected to meet a deadline for setting up health alliances of January 1997. Administrative costs to be reduced by standardising insurance claim forms; health alliances expected to reduce the need for thousands of small insurance companies.</p>

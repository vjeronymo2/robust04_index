			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS ANNOUNCE THEIR WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS ON JIM HILL  </P> <P> I am appalled at the demeaning, hurtful and obviously jealous manner in which  Larry Stewart presented Jim Hill.  </P> <P> To begin with, Jim Hill, or any other citizen, can elect to return a phone call  if he or she wishes. No one has any obligation to any reporter.  </P> <P> Sour grapes has no business in reporting news.  </P> <P> Jim Hill's salary is and has been well earned. He has paid his dues reporting  the sports news, and he is a gentleman.  </P> <P> During the early-evening broadcast when he was approached about the subject, he  never said anything offensive concerning the article.  </P> <P> Jim Hill does not have to show his teeth and grin to his viewers and bosses. He  doesn't have to be an Uncle Tom. White broadcasters don't do this, don't expect  it from our race.  </P> <P> DELORES REBO JAMAN  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

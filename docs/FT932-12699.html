			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wensum improves in second half but stays in loss for year WENSUM, the men's wear manufacturer, showed an improvement in the second half but that proved insufficient to offset the first half loss. Consequently there was a pre-tax deficit for the year ended January 30 1993 of Pounds 44,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 607,000. Following the cut to the interim dividend the final is reduced to 1.25p (2.35p) for a total of 1.825p, against 3.5p. Losses per share came to 0.33p (5.63p). Both operating companies achieved a small trading profit totalling Pounds 75,000 (Pounds 747,000) but insufficient to offset an interest charge of Pounds 119,000 (Pounds 140,000). In manufacturing, turnover rose to Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.94m). The corporate company saw a substantial fall to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 2.7m) as the decline in repeat orders continued through the year, and there was no significant uniform launch. The group entered into a three-year licensing agreement for a leading Japanese company to manufacture and sell men's clothing in Japan under the Wensum label. Directors viewed that as 'an exciting development' with great potential for the longer term development of the label. On prospects they said both companies had substantially better forward order books. Corporate had a significant new launch and there were signs that repeat orders were improving. The manufacturing subsidiary was well under way with the projects for increased production and efficiency.</p>

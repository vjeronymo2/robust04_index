It includes 104 parliament  members. Most of them (56) represent the Agrarian-Democratic  Party, which won the February 27 elections. The Agrarians hold  that the parliament should first of all adopt a new  constitution, create a legislative basis for economic reforms,  and resolve the Dniester and Gagauz problem by granting a  special legal status to those territories.    The bloc of Socialists and the International Movement adhere  to a very similar stand. They won 28 parliament seats due to  the backing of the Russian-speaking population. Without calling  in question the proposals of the Agrarian-Democrats, the  Socialists believe that the parliament should first of all  ratify all the agreements on the Commonwealth of Indepenent  States (CIS) and on the economic union, should stop state  language tests, feared by the non-indigenous population.    They will be opposed by the Christian-Democratic People's  Front and the bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals, a group which  has split away from the front. They both call for unification  with Romania. The front and the group have lost the trust of the  electors and now have only nine and 11 parliamentary seats  respectively. The split-away group is headed by ex-speaker  Aleksandr Moshanu. These parties oppose the ratification of the  CIS agreements, regarding them as an "attempt to revive the  Soviet empire". However, the 20 seats they have in the new  parliament will not give them a chance to effectively influence  Moldova's policy.    Petr Luchinskiy, one of the leaders of the  Agrarian-Democratic Party, which has won the parliamentary  elections, is expected to be elected parliament speaker. He is  54 years old and had formerly been first secretary of the  central committee of the Communist Party of Moldavia and  secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. Last year, after an  acute parliamentary crisis, he was elected speaker of the  previous Moldovan parliament. However, it was impossible to  save that parliament which was elected during the Soviet period  and which was torn asunder by contradictions. It had to be  dissolved ahead of schedule.</p>

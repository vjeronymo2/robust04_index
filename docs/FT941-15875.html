			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Aluminium flood unites US and EU The US and EU this week agreed to take common approaches in dealing with the flood of Russian aluminium exports, now depressing prices to record low levels, and to act together in pressing Japan to improve its Uruguay Round tariff cuts. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the crisis in the aluminium industry had been discussed 'at the highest levels' during President Bill Clinton's stop in Brussels on Monday. It will also be broached with President Boris Yeltsin, when Mr Clinton gets to Russia this week. US, Russian and EU officials next week will meet in Brussels representatives of other aluminium-producing nations - Australia, Norway and Canada - for a third round of talks to seek a solution. Aluminium prices have plunged from Dollars 1 to 47 cents a pound. Mr Kantor said a voluntary restraint agreement was 'certainly one instrument we would consider'. Others have suggested price floors or export licensing. The representative, who accompanied the president to Brussels, also said he and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, had agreed to work together to induce Tokyo to improve its market access offers, in the Uruguay Round, on copper, wood, leather, shoes and financial services. In a briefing yesterday Mr Kantor said he would not back away from the US-EC negotiating 'framework' deal reached at the Tokyo summit, which called for 'measurable results and objective criteria' to measure progress in reducing Japan's trade deficit. This is 'the heart' of the framework pact, he said, 'the sharp departure this (US) administration made from others in terms of how we believe we can reach effective agreements with the Japanese government'. He seemed sympathetic to the problems faced by the Japanese government, which is preoccupied by political reforms. But he will urge that government to view steps taken to open its markets as part of the reforms necessary to boost Japan's recovery. 'The US, Japan and the EU have the opportunity to build markets and expand trade - they have corresponding responsibilities,' Mr Kantor said. On other matters, he added: The chief US textile negotiator, Ms Jennifer Hillman, has left for China for talks to begin on Saturday, two days before the US is due to cut China's textile and apparel quotas for alleged quota cheating. A study, to be released next week by the US and EU, will recommend 'a balance of opportunities' for opening their telecommunications markets to imports.</p>

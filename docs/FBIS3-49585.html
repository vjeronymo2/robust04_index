This interview is being recorded on Tuesday morning,  only a few hours before Bill Clinton's arrival. Do you think  that choosing our capital city for the Visegrad Four summit  testifies to something that is good for our country?    [Klaus] I do not think we should get involved in endless  polemics with our neighbors as to why this meeting is taking  place in Prague and not in Budapest or Warsaw. This is  pointless, and I know that our neighbors are very sensitive to  this sort of thing. On the other hand, it is quite obvious,  evident, and clear that choosing Prague was not an act of God  and that, therefore, the U.S. side had a reason for making this  choice.    [Stahlavsky] In this context, one should note that the  volume  of U.S. foreign investment in our country is the second highest.  In 1993, total foreign investment amounted to $0.5 billion. Was  it enough?    [Klaus] I think this was just right, really quite right. I  have said repeatedly that it is not the government's job to  artificially accelerate or, through various errors, to slow down  the influx of foreign investment. This level of foreign  investment is absolutely adequate to what the economy needs. I  would like to warn, however, against accelerating the influx of  foreign capital into nonprivatized enterprises.    [Stahlavsky] When I look back at the days past, one of the  important events was undoubtedly Slovakia's overdraft on the  limit credit in the mutual clearing account with the Slovak  Republic, as well as the relatively fast settlement of this  overdraft. However, you said that the method of Czech-Slovak  clearing is being analyzed, and you did not rule out its  reassessment.    [Klaus] When speaking about the reassessment or supplements  to the system, I am not thinking about abolishing it or changing  it in any fundamental way. I think the fast Slovak payment is a  signal that the Slovak side really fulfills the things that are  part of an already signed agreement. This is something for our  citizens to differentiate between. As for the property issue, no  agreement has been achieved yet. However, where there is an  agreement, the Slovak side meets its obligations with great  precision. This was also the case in this particular event.  [passage omitted]    [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] At the end of the last year,  you indicated that there is a certain revival of useful economic  contacts with the countries of the former so-called real  socialism bloc. What is your idea of our future cooperation with  these countries, especially now, after we, as an unofficial  spokesman of Central and East Europe, became a member of the UN  Security Council?    [Klaus] The contacts of the Czech Government and Czech  politicians, as well as the contacts of Czech business with  eastern countries, are growing rather than declining. I  think--and I repeat this--this is good.    The Cabinet has made decisions about a number of trips that  should take place this year. I am personally sure about a visit  to Moscow. Nevertheless, this will be possible when there has  been some stabilization, when it has become clear what the newly  established parliament will do, whether the stability of the  government will or will not be maintained. In any case, I hope  this will be decided within a few weeks, and my visit should  certainly take place then.    I expect to visit the Baltic republics. I have an invitation  from all three governments of these countries. An invitation  from Belarus is on my table, as is one from Ukraine. [passage  omitted]</p>

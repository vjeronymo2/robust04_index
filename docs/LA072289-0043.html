			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT FIRM STARTED BY CAWTHORNE  </P> <P> Former San Diego Urban League President Herb Cawthorne unveiled his new venture  Friday -- a for-profit development company "with a social philosophy."  </P> <P> In a luncheon speech Friday, Cawthorne, who resigned his Urban League post June  7 amid rumors of financial improprieties and conflict within the organization,  championed free enterprise as a means of solving inner-city problems.  </P> <P> Cawthorne said economic development is the key issue for minorities and backed  the creation of "free enterprise zones." Housing and Urban Development  Secretary Jack Kemp recently proposed tax breaks and other incentives for  businesses relocating to such zones in underdeveloped neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "Capital will not come here because it is sentimental," Cawthorne told an  audience of community leaders and corporate executives. "Capital will come  because it gets a return. I want to make the return here better than any place  else in San Diego."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking for Permanent Home  </P> <P> The newly established Cawthorne Co. will "improve the opportunity to create  wealth in (the) community" by developing Southeast San Diego, Cawthorne said.  The business, now operating out of a church, is still looking for a permanent  home, he said.  </P> <P> Last year, Cawthorne opposed tough development curbs sought by slow-growth  activists and argued in favor of a less restrictive proposal.  </P> <P> Business investment can cure many of the social ills afflicting San Diego,  Cawthorne said. "Education and health care are not social work problems, they  are business and economic problems," he said in his speech before the Logan  Heights Family Health Center Foundation. "Social work is important, but you  feel like you are walking on a treadmill," he later added.  </P> <P> Cawthorne refused comment on his resignation from the Urban League, and on last  Tuesday's departure of league chairwoman Carolyn Smith after a four-week  tenure. He has previously said that Smith left because she lacked the support  of Urban League board members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Move Beyond Controversy'  </P> <P> "The Urban league was not made up of Herb Cawthorne, or of any single member of  the board," Cawthorne said in his address. "It should move beyond controversy  to provide the services needed in the community."  </P> <P> School Principal Cecilia Estrada introduced Cawthorne as "a man who will always  be controversial because he is willing to take risks." She later said she was  referring to Cawthorne's stands on public issues, rather than to "that Urban  League fight."  </P> <P> Estrada said Cawthorne "is very effective, and his ideas are excellent, but he  just takes on the issues that aren't popular with the majority."  </P> <P> Cawthorne pledged Friday to start an association of small businessmen in free  enterprise zones, and to seek such zone designations for parts of the downtown  and much of Southeast San Diego. He also said he would lobby in Sacramento and  Washington to require greater bank lending in the poor neighborhoods, and seek  to revitalize Market Street.  </P> <P> "If San Diego is to remain a strong and powerful city, if its businesses are to  continue to grow . . . you need the black and the Hispanic community,"  Cawthorne said. "You cannot have one part of the community that's bleeding."  </P></p>

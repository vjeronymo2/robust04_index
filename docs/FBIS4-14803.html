			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- United Nations Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told a news conference upon the  completion of his meeting with Andrey Kozyrev here today he is  optimistic about a possibility of U.N.-Russian cooperation in  peace-making around the globe, including Georgia and Tajikistan.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about the Russian peace-making role in  former Soviet republics and a possibility of these efforts'  integration with the United Nations global peace-making  operations, Butrus-Ghali said this was discussed with the  Russian foreign minister.    In his words, the U.N. secretariat is very interested in  cooperation with Russia and its participation in peace-making  contingents in various areas. At the same time, a resolution of  the United Nations Security Council to the effect is necessary,  which will entail certain financial difficulties.    The U.N. peace-making budget has increased from 500 million  dollars to 3.6 billions within two years, and this is an  obstacle to be overcome in order to expand cooperation with  Russia in this sphere, said Butrus-Ghali.</p>

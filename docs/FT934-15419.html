			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Significant trade source Sir, Andrew Stone (Letters, October 7) is right to claim that British trade with Israel is significant. A survey we have just published of small and medium-sized exporters in south-east England reveals that almost a third as many trade with Israel (9.4 per cent) as with the rest of the Middle East (26.2 per cent). Furthermore, almost as many have plans for Israel (4.4 per cent) as for the rest of the Middle East (5.3 per cent). As the survey was undertaken before the recent peace agreement, this figure is likely to prove even higher in reality.

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Three men and a recession: Industry leaders in Germany, France and the UK explain their strategies for economic survival to David Marsh For leaders of industry in Germany, France and Britain, 1993 is the year not of the single European market, but of the single European recession. At the Federation of German Industry (BDI), the French Patronat and the Confederation of British Industry, talk centres less on how to succeed than on how to survive. Everywhere, the main source of concern is the post-unification downturn in Germany. Mr Tyll Necker, the BDI president, a relaxed 63-year-old with the creased features of a benevolent chaplain, points to errors at the heart of Bonn's expensive attempts to revive the east German economy. Underlined by the annual total of DM140bn (Pounds 58.7bn) in net fiscal transfers to the east, west Germany is exporting eastwards 'blank cheques', he says, rather than a market economy. Germany's main industry spokesman is worried about the damage to competitiveness caused by excessive increases in labour costs during the now-faded unity boom. Smiling wanly in his Rhine-side Cologne office, he explains: 'Germany's unit labour costs have risen 9 per cent during the last two years . . . Revaluation has hurt industry a lot.' He worries that Germany's successful postwar industrial system, based on consensus between management and trade unions, might prove insufficiently robust to weather the strains of reunification. 'I see the danger that we will learn only through crisis.' Mr Necker, head of a prosperous north German machinery company, returned to the BDI presidency last September, after already holding the post between 1987 and 1990. He appears to have accomplished one of his tasks: rebuilding BDI relations with the government, dented under his predecessor, Mr Heinrich Weiss, who never struck up a rapport with Chancellor Kohl. Mr Necker believes disequilibrium in the German economy will be prolonged. 'Reunification struck like a meteorite. It will take time for the dust to settle. In 1989, I said it would take 10 years to stabilise the east. That was optimistic.' The handicap of high German labour costs, obscured during the reunification upswing, is now visible, he says, indulging in his fondness for naturalistic metaphors. 'When the sun shines, you do not see the holes in the roof.' He adds: 'Cyclical difficulties are temporary - like bad weather. But if we don't solve our structural problems, we face the risk of a climatic change, and perhaps an ice age.' As part of necessary budgetary cuts for the next few years, Mr Necker believes Germany has to make big reductions in welfare spending. This is one of the most contentious points in the 'solidarity pact' being negotiated between the government, employers and unions to try to put unity financing on a sounder footing. Pointing to diminished enthusiasm in Germany about European integration, he says the BDI is doing its best to lower compatriots' 'fears' about the single market. But Mr Necker is cautious about the drive to economic and monetary union. His priority is clear: 'I would rather have a stable currency than a single currency.' In view of reunification-induced inflationary pressures, the Bundesbank has had little alternative but to tighten monetary policy. 'The Bundesbank wants to discipline government and wage partners.' This has implications for Germany's neighbours. 'We were the locomotive (during the unification boom). Now we are the brake . . . This will cause problems for the whole of Europe, and this rebounds on Germany.' The reverberations of Germany's monetary and fiscal policies are certainly felt in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, where Mr Francois Perigot, president of the French Patronat, has his headquarters. He talks of 'impatience' at the high French interest rates needed to maintain the franc's D-Mark parity. A strong supporter of European union, Mr Perigot, a debonair 66, headed Unilever's French operations for 10 years before becoming Patronat chief in 1986. He says Europe is undergoing 'its most important crisis since the beginning of the European Community'. Where Mr Necker shows coolness on Emu, Mr Perigot terms it a 'weapon' enabling Europe to stand up for its worldwide economic interests. 'Monetary union is absolutely necessary. We need homogeneity of economic policies to avoid distortions caused by 15 per cent differences in exchange rates. This will give Europe a different authority on the international stage.' Mr Perigot hints at the painful ambivalence in French policies which have produced low inflation and a strong franc - at the cost of 3m unemployed and a probable heavy defeat for the Socialist government in this month's general election. 'There is no other solution but Franco-German solidarity. But can we afford it?' He says he backs the franc fort policy, but adds that, given the nervousness on the foreign exchanges, it would be impossible for him to say anything else. While Mr Perigot says he does not find the idea shocking that other countries have to bear some of the costs Germany faces in overcoming 40 years of communism, he admits German unification could crack the edifice of European integration. He frequently complains that social charges on French employers are too high, but has established a good modus vivendi with the Socialist government. 'You must be respectful in order to be respected.' Mr Perigot refuses to participate in criticism of alleged UK attempts to attract jobs through lowering labour market standards. After the decision by Hoover, the appliance maker, to relocate its Dijon factory to Glasgow, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, accused the UK of heading down a 'dead end'. Mr Perigot is more elegant. To avoid devaluation pushing up inflation, he thinks the UK may need assistance. 'I pray God will help the English,' he says sardonically. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of Britain's CBI, does not give the impression of needing divine intervention. And he scotches the idea that the UK is out on a limb. Back from an overseas visit to industrialists, Mr Davies, with his feet on an office table, says: 'I've been a week in Madrid and Barcelona, Milan and Rome. No one said: 'You're going down a dead end.' 'I don't see that we are following a policy of competitive devaluation. We are reacting to severe maladjustment in the economy.' Mr Davies, 42, who took over at the CBI last July after a successful civil service career, sums up the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September in brisk terms. 'We followed the first law of being in a hole  - stop digging. It's not clear there was another way out.' Mr Davies thinks the gloom about Britain's industrial record and prospects is exaggerated. But he admits to disquiet that, unlike other European countries, Britain still has to mount campaigns to show manufacturing does, after all, matter. He is far from sanguine about the outlook. 'There will be some sort of recovery, but for many people, in terms of spending power, it's not going to look like one.' British companies have not benefited significantly from sterling's devaluation because competitors elsewhere in Europe are aggressively trying to protect their positions in rapidly declining markets. 'The problem of the economies of our continental partners,' Mr Davies says, 'is that they are falling off a cliff.' He puts questions over Britain's employment policies firmly in a European context. Pointing to the EC's high labour costs, 16m unemployed and declining share of world trade, Mr Davies asks whether the Community as a whole can afford the social chapter. He claims other European employers' federations support Britain's Maastricht opt-out from the social chapter on the grounds that the threat of jobs migrating to the UK helps restrain overall Community labour costs. He spells out his advice to the government with the precision born of long familiarity with Treasury briefing papers. Room for economic expansion is tightly constrained by the 'dual problem' of large UK budget and current account deficits. If the government wants to run a looser monetary policy to help industry, he believes it will need to tighten fiscal policy through raising taxes on wage-earners and consumers during the next two years. In view of the sharp financial constraints on the economy, he says: 'Either we have a production and investment-led recovery, or we don't have one. Does the government accept the political consequences of that analysis? 'The jury is still out on that.' Like the rest of European business, Mr Davies expects 1993 will deliver no easy answers.</p>

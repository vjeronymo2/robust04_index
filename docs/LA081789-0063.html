			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: ARTESIA;  </P> <P> DRUG-DEALING TENANTS TO BE EVICTED UNDER NEW LAW  </P> <P> Tenants involved in drug dealings can be evicted by their landlords under an  ordinance adopted unanimously Monday by the Artesia City Council.  </P> <P> A landlord can evict a tenant if it is determined that the tenant is involved  in illegal drug activities, including possession or sale of illegal drugs.  </P> <P> "We are just trying to give the landlord a tool to stop drug dealing,"  Councilman Ronald H. Oliver said. He said the council acted after a landlord  asked for help in evicting a tenant allegedly involved in drug activities.  </P> <P> "Whether this works, we don't know. But we should do something other than  slapping their hands," Oliver said.  </P> <P> Landlords who are aware of the activities and fail to evict tenants, can be  fined up to $5,000 under the ordinance.  </P></p>

This action is being taken because the Department was unable to publish the final rule before the end of Fiscal Year 1993 and the Buy American requirements were again included in the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994. Pursuant to these statutory provisions, the Department proposes to extend the requirements to Fiscal Year 1994, under the same terms as set forth in the August 12, 1993 document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be in writing and must be received by February 14, 1994.

Section 319 of the Act was entitled ``Buy American Requirements.'' The section applied to funds appropriated or transferred pursuant to the Act for the purchase of any equipment or product that may have been authorized to be purchased with financial assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 319(b)(2) required that in providing financial assistance under the Act, the Secretary shall provide to each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the Buy American requirement. No other specific Congressional guidance was given regarding the implementation of this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department proposed to revise 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart E to implement these requirements. Since no specific guidance was provided by Congress, the Department decided to base its implementation upon similar rules in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 103&hyph;138, the ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994,'' and Public Law 103&hyph;126, the ``Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994,'' extend the Buy American requirements to awards of financial assistance under the Department's general appropriation for Fiscal Year 1994, as well as to similar awards by the Bureau of Reclamation. Because the statutes change no other portions of the Buy American requirements, and because the Department was unable to issue a final rule prior to the enactment of the two statutes, the Department now proposes to issue a final rule based on the proposed rule published on August 12, 1993. No other significant changes are proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one public comment was received in response to the publication of the proposed rule. This action will allow for the receipt of more comments to be considered prior to the publication of the final rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 22, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> B.R.

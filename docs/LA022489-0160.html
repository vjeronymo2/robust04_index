			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BITES / BEVERLY BUSH SMITH: MARCH IS A FINE TIME TO LEARN ALL ABOUT WINE  </P> <P> Which foods marry best with which wines, and vice versa? You'll find numerous  opportunities to learn -- and enjoy -- during March.  </P> <P> Nine restaurants and 20 California wineries will participate in "A Toast from  the Heart" March 9 at 6:30 p.m. in the Grand Ballroom of the Westin South Coast  Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa.

Tickets cost $35 and can be ordered by  calling (714) 953-5757.  </P> <P> And that's not all:  </P> <P> Larry Lee will present six different Buena Vista wines to complement dinner at  Le Midi in Newport Beach on March 2. Six courses include salmon poached in  Chardonnay and tournedos Perigourdine. A $65-per-person tab will cover food and  wines, tax and tip.

Prime New York steak with  fried onions, basted with hazelnut butter, for instance, will cost a mere  $11.95.  </P> <P> CANO ON THE MOVE: Larry J. Cano, who resigned after 24 years as president of  the El Torito restaurant chain last year, has bought Cano's in Newport Beach,  which he originally opened as part of the El Torito family in April, 1977. And,  with Fred Le Franc, Cano has purchased the Studio Cafe in Corona del Mar from  Hovik Abramian. At Cano's, he has remodeled the bar; at the Studio, he foresees  no radical changes, but does plan kitchen and menu "improvements."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Abramian, who will concentrate his efforts on his Balboa Studio  Cafe, welcomes the slowdown in his "crazy" life style. ("I actually went  skiing. . . .")  </P> <P> MORE NEWS ABOUT Hans Prager, who owns the Ritz in Newport Center: He is opening  the Yankee Tavern on the first of April at Bayside Drive and Coast Highway in  Newport Beach because he thinks the Ritz has become a special-occasion place  and that the Tavern will fill the need for "a casual dinner house," offering  such things as pan-fried pork chops with apple-jack country gravy and mashed  potatoes, Yankee pot roast with buttered noodles, and rice custard pudding.  </P> <P> TABLE TALK: Tia Juana's Long Bar and Mexican Cafe Deluxe in Old Town, Irvine,  is now open for lunch. . . .

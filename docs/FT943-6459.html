			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / The Markets: What value greater disclosure? - Global Investor Who would argue with the proposition that more information is a good thing? In suggesting that banks should reveal more about their use of volatile financial instruments, bank regulators and congressmen have struck a popular chord. After six months of worrying trading reports from banks, funds and companies which bear the scars of losses on such instruments, the markets have given a warm welcome to such proposals. The expanses of newsprint devoted to the subject also show that the plans have a wider resonance, touching widespread public suspicion of Wall Street's recklessness. However, those trying to improve the banks' disclosure of information may have set themselves an impossible task. There is little sign that the methods they are considering will prove useful; some may, in fact, prove counterproductive. The current clamour has been prompted by the events of this spring, when the proprietary trading desks of banks were hit hard by the sharp increases in US and European interest rates. The rises produced heavy losses on many of the huge range of financial instruments now labelled 'derivatives', the value of which depends on the movement of an underlying variable such as an interest rate or currency. The losses revealed that the banks' use of these instruments had sharply increased during 1993. In a recent analysis of US banks' current disclosure practices, Mr Ethan Heisler, analyst at Salomon Brothers, calculates that 'derivative contracts for the eight largest US banks grew by Dollars 3 trillion in 1993 to Dollars 10 trillion', a level some 10 times greater than the banks' combined assets at the end of 1993. Banking regulators, including Mr Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, and Mr William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have called for higher standards of disclosure, and Fed officials may announce preliminary proposals within months. The House of Representatives' banking committee is studying plans for new disclosure rules, and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board is also considering new ways to represent the use of derivatives in trading statements and balance sheets. There is, in this flurry, an air of compensating for the escape of the horse by shutting the stable door many times. Regulators believe that since the Fed began to tighten monetary policy on February 4, banks have sharply reduced their exposure to further shifts in interest rates. Mr McDonough commented in an article in the Financial Times earlier this month that 'the visions of melt-down are overblown'. The best argument that more should be done lies not in recent experience but in the principle that the role of the banks in providing liquid deposits and in administering payments needs to be safeguarded from risky activity which they may undertake on their own behalf. Regulators appear to favour proposals that banks should publish accounts of their outstanding derivatives contracts quarterly, or even monthly. By establishing a series of such figures for each bank, regulators hope to compensate for wide variations in accounting practices, particularly in the choice of the period over which losses or gains are recognised. That does not, however, overcome the central difficulty: the risk of exposure to derivatives cannot be represented in conventional ways. The nominal value of the contract gives no clue to the potential losses if the fundamental variable moves in an unexpected direction. In contrast, the most that a bank can lose in extending a loan is the principal sum extended. Nor do such proposals distinguish between the use of derivatives to reduce exposure to the volatility of interest rates or currencies and speculative trading. Neither do they inform the markets about whether the bank is vulnerable to a rise or to a fall in those variables. Inclusion of more data in a bank's trading statements could even be misleading, in that creditors, investors and counterparties may be tempted to overlook other risks. As Salomon puts it, 'the market's current derivative obsession will distract attention from potentially riskier activity' such as banks' renewed taste for developing countries' debt and for highly-leveraged deals. A more fruitful route than trying to quantify risk in a bank's trading statement would be to ask banks to calculate the loss in earnings or asset value which they would suffer from an adverse change in interest rates or currencies. Some regional US banks do this to an extent, though given their much more modest level of activity in the derivatives markets, this has proved of limited use: Salomon estimates that 'less than 3 per cent of (regional) banks' earnings would be affected if interest rates moved adversely by 100 basis points'. There is, though, an inevitable risk of focusing on the wrong variable; current concern centres on exposure to shifts in US interest rates, even though many banks have been caught out less by the Fed's change of policy in February than by the rise in European rates that followed. A more radical route would be to insist that banks ring fence deposits from trading in derivatives on their own account. That would answer many of the concerns of creditors, although not those of investors in banks' shares or of counterparties to their trading. The choice of the best route forward might be clearer if the regulators had been more forthcoming about the use they themselves might make of better information. The danger is that they are fashioning a new tool with little sense of why it is needed or how it will be used. The current anxiety about derivatives may simply generate a flood of financial data from the banks that is, on closer inspection, worthless.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total return in local currency to 25/8/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  % change over period                        US    Japan  Germany   France   Italy      UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                 0.09     0.04     0.09     0.10    0.18    0.09 Month                0.38     0.18     0.42     0.46    0.69    0.43 Year                 3.44     2.78     5.88     6.06    8.38    5.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week                 0.19     0.09     0.18     0.40    1.12    0.33 Month                0.47    -0.70    -0.79    -1.56   -2.66   -0.70 Year                -1.16     2.79     3.43     1.05    1.20    0.87  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week                 0.06    -0.10    -0.02     0.27    1.60    0.74 Month                0.50    -1.37    -1.85    -3.37   -4.55   -0.82 Year                -4.43     2.05    -0.22    -3.59   -4.05   -2.20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week                  1.1     -1.7     -0.1      0.6     7.3     1.6 Month                 3.3      1.1      0.6     -1.0    -5.5     4.5 Year                  4.5      0.4     11.3     -0.3     8.8     9.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

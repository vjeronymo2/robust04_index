[Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Before leaving  Uganda, Velayati had a meeting in Kampala with the Sudanese Vice  President George Kongor Arop who was there to attend the  Pan-African Congress. They discussed bilateral ties and  regional and international issues. In view of the two  countries' good relations and common viewpoints, the two  ascribed the adverse propaganda in relation to Iranian-Sudanese  relations to some Western countries' and the Zionist regime's  antagonism toward the prevalence of Islamic values.    The Sudanese vice president, for his part, said: We have  been  subject to constant attacks by the hegemonistic powers for the  sake of upholding Islamic and humanitarian principles.

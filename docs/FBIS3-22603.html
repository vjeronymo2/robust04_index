			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Japan Energy Corp. said  Thursday [10 March] that clinical tests on its newly developed  second-generation AIDS medicine are set to get under way in the  United States.    The tests, already approved by the U.S. Food And Drug  Administration, will be conducted on a small number of patients  at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, starting in mid-March.    Japan Energy is the first Japanese enterprise to begin  clinical tests on a second-generation AIDS medicine.    Company officials said the firm hopes to file with the U.S.  authorities in about three years for permission to produce the  new medicine and market it as an oral drug.    The medicine will inhibit the working of a protease  necessary  for the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thereby  arresting AIDS, the officials said.</p>

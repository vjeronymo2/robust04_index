			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEEN-AGER SHOWS OFF HIS WHEELS;  </P> <P> 16-YEAR-OLD BRANDON TALLMAN OF NEWBURY PARK EXCELS IN ROLLER SPEEDSKATING, A  POTENTIAL OLYMPIC SPORT  </P> <P> The average Southern California teen-ager may roller-skate, but only as a  hobby. Brandon Tallman is not the average Southern California teen-ager.  </P> <P> Tallman, 16, a junior at Newbury Park High, is one of the area's rising stars  in a relatively obscure sport -- roller speedskating. And, as in any other  sport, he has gained his prominence through hard work.  </P> <P> What, exactly, is roller speedskating?  </P> <P> "It's basically the same thing as ice speedskating, but it's on roller-skates,"  Tallman said.  </P> <P> Tallman is a member of the Southern California Speed League, which features  teams from Lancaster, Riverside, Santa Ana and Ventura. Tallman is accustomed  to "hopping around from rink to rink," but has found a home with the Ventura  Speed Club, which practices at Skating Plus in Ventura.  </P> <P> He also has found success. Tallman was selected to attend a weeklong  speedskating camp at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.,  after qualifying for the amateur nationals in the Junior Olympics last July.  </P> <P> "There are 200 slots for 10,000 skaters," said Don Lovato, Tallman's coach.  </P> <P> The emphasis at the training camp was on the word training.  </P> <P> "You have to wake up at 5:30 every morning and then you have to walk about a  half-mile to the track, " Tallman said. "You have to do land exercises, which  is practicing on form and balance for when you get onto your skates. You do  that for two hours. Then you to go practice for two hours. Then you get a  little break. Then you have to go practice for another two hours. Then you've  got to go slideboard for an hour."  </P> <P> The training center has a 200-meter outdoor track with banked turns. This is in  contrast to the tracks that Tallman is used to, which are measured out with  pylons. Distances on these tracks, which have either wood or cement surfaces,  vary between 100 and 500 meters.  </P> <P> For Tallman, the camp was not much of a change from his usual hectic life  style. Tallman cycles 100 miles a week, trains with weights twice a week and  works for one hour every day on the slideboard, a polished linoleum surface  with two adjustable two by fours on either side. The skater, wearing wool  socks, simulates skating on the board, shortening or lengthening the distance  between the boards to shorten or lengthen his stroke. Longer strokes are better  for longer distances, and shorter strokes for shorter races.  </P> <P> All this in addition to school and team practices.  </P> <P> "I go to school from 7:30 to 2:10 and then I have practices Monday from 5 until  7 and then 9 to 11," Tallman said. "Thursdays I have practice from 4:30 to 6:30  and on Saturday mornings I have practice from 7 to 9."  </P> <P> Understandably, the training has paid off.  </P> <P> "He's shown a lot of improvement," Lovato said. "He's a hard worker, he pays  attention and does those extra things that are necessary."  </P> <P> Tallman also provides his own equipment, which costs a bit more than an average  pair of skates. The speed skates average $700 and differ from recreational  skates in more than price. Roller-skates have one single-action cushion; speed  skates have two cushions for double action, giving the skater better  performance.  </P> <P> Tallman, who moved to Newbury Park from Oregon a year ago, initially became  interested in roller-skating as a pastime.  </P> <P> "I started roller-skating (when I was) about 9 years old. I started training  for speedskating when I was 11 or 12, and I started competition when I was  nearly 15," Tallman said. "I was just hanging out with my friends at school and  then they tell me they're going to go roller-skating, so I go. I just kind of  got hooked on it from there."  </P> <P> Hooked is an apt description for Tallman's enthusiasm for the sport.  </P> <P> "In competition you get really psyched out at first when you get up to the  starting line," Tallman said. "When they say, 'Skaters, take your mark,' you  get down there and your heart's going a million miles an hour. Then they blow  the whistle and you go.  </P> <P> "Then, if you've got all the mental (aspect) down, you're doing pretty good,  because it's about 75 percent mental. You've got to be a smart skater as much  as a physically fit skater. You've got to know how to draft, how to make your  passes, when to take the lead and when not to take the lead, how to balance  into a corner."  </P> <P> There is a possibility that roller speedskating will be included in the 1992  Games. If that comes to pass, Tallman's chance at winning an Olympic medal  might not be far behind.  </P></p>

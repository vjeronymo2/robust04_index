			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold demand slackens off Gold demand slackened further in the third quarter of this year, but remained on course to challenge the record level achieved in 1992, according to the World Gold Council, the international gold industry's promotional body. Total demand in the 75 per cent of the gold-producing world where the council operates amounted 559.7 tonnes in the July-September period, down 4 per cent from a year earlier. That followed year-on-year rises of 20 per cent in the first quarter - when buyers were attracted by exceptionally low prices - and 1 per cent in the second quarter. The total for the first three quarters was up 6 per cent on last year at 1,816.5 tonnes.</p>

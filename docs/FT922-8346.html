			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's coffee pot begins to overflow - Enthusiastic growers have not been deterred by historically low prices A CHART the length of the lobby of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters logs the demise of the world price for Indonesia's robusta coffee from 1985. With London robusta contracts languishing at 22-year lows, space on the wall has mercifully run out; the price has dropped off the chart. The response of Indonesia's 1.8m coffee farmers to market forces has been perplexing: whilst reducing exports in an attempt to hold up prices, they are expanding production. The association has forecast exports of coffee at 303,540 tonnes for the year ending September 1992, down 21 per cent from last year. That would compensate for relative over-supply of the market the year before: trade officials say world demand for Indonesian coffee for blending is between 330,000-360,000 tonnes a year. Between last October and the end of March, Indonesia exported 78,000 tonnes, and harvesting of the main crop began last month. Production of 476,280 tonnes is forecast this year, continuing the upward trend which has led to 53 per cent growth in production since 1985 making Indonesia the world's third largest producer. The association forecasts production next year of 511,920 tonnes. Association officials say Indonesia's 1.8m smallholders, who produce 90 per cent of the crop, are stockpiling their harvest. Historically, farmers have normally held between 100,000 and 120,000 tonnes in stock, but by last October stocks had fallen to 47,880 tonnes. The association forecasts that stocks will rise to 145,620 tonnes by September. The bearishness of the international market about robusta coffee has been exacerbated by expectations of heavy sales from Indonesia over the next few weeks. However, Mr M. Yahmadi, head of the exporters' association's production and quality development department, says the farmers will not rush to the market. 'It is common for our farmers to keep coffee as savings. When the time comes they will sell, for instance, to go to Mecca'. The association is also lookly for government intervention to help stabilise the export market. It has 1,072 members, but only 300 are active and 'making any money'. A recent agricultural report by US embassy in Jakarta described the majority of exporters as 'now in dire economic straits'. The problem is not just the low world market price but competition between exporters in Indonesia. Despite static domestic consumption at 75,000 tonnes a year, the association estimates the domestic price of a kilogram of grade 4 robusta coffee at Rp1,650 (81 US cents), as against an fob export price of 80 cents. 'Exporters lose Rp200 per kilo,' says Mr Noer Madjid, the association's executive secretary, after redrying, handling and bagging costs are included. The only incentive to export, officials say, is to maintain customers while waiting for prices to improve. The association believes that exporters need to be better regulated and last October set out proposals to government. It wants all traders to register their exports and to deposit with the association between 10 and 20 per cent of the value of all export commitments. The greater the quantity committed to export, the higher would be the percentage of export value deposited. This is to ensure that exporters do not commit themselves beyond their own financial resources or beyond Indonesia's production capability. A government response to the proposal was expected in January, but none has been forthcoming. Association officials want to implement the plan 'as soon as possible' and clearly feel frustrated. The association has also recommended that its members form groups to reduce competition and enjoy greater economies of scale but the idea has not met with much response. Steps are being taken to diversify Indonesia away from robusta coffee, which accounts for 93 per cent of production. The remaining 7 per cent is of the milder and more sought-after arabica variety. A three year trial programme testing high-yielding arabica plants is being undertaken by the association, particularly for use in the higher altitude areas of north Sumatra. But weaning farmers away from robusta will take time. Industry officials expect arabica to increase its share to 15 per cent of production in the next two years but attaining the target of 25-30 per cent of the crop may take 'a decade or two', predicts Mr Yahmadi. The industry says there is substantial room for growth domestically, although the price of packaged robusta at Rp12,000 per kilogram in supermarkets puts it out of reach of the average wage earner. The association's figures give cause for pessimism. Production is forecast to outstrip international and local demand by 76,920 tonnes next year. This would leave farmers holding unprecedentedly high stocks of 222,000 tonnes. The bright spot on the horizon is Indonesia's strong case for a higher quota if an international coffee agreement is signed. From 1986 to 1990, Indonesia increased exports to quota countries by 49 per cent and the country now accounts for more than 7 per cent of the world export market, association officials say. Costa Rica is suspending coffee exports indefinitely from today in protest at low prices on the world market. Costa Rican vice-president Arnaldo Lopez said the board of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, of which he is president, had taken the decision unanimously after consultations with all sectors of the country's coffee industry. Lopez said Costa Rica, which produces three per cent of world coffee exports, hoped the move would hasten an international coffee agreement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of a speech by Polish Prime Minister Waldemar </F> Pawlak at a conference of the Center for Strategic and  International Studies in Brussels on 3 February]    [Text] Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:    I accepted with pleasure an invitation by the Center for  Strategic and International Studies to meet with such prominent  personalities from U.S., European, and Polish business  communities, as well as with political leaders of the European  Union [EU], NATO, Poland, and the United States.    Such meetings provide good opportunities to conduct  discussions, exchange views and conclusions, and debate any  issue that is in our mutual interest.    I would like to take this opportunity to express my  recognition of the activity of the U.S.-Poland Action  Commission, which has done so much for the sake of developing  Polish-American cooperation in the political, economic, and  scientific areas.    My speech today will be devoted to Poland's policy toward  Western political, military, and economic institutions.  Establishing closer ties to these institutions--and membership  in them in the near future, if possible--is a crucial issue for  our security. That issue should be approached against the  background of new challenges that Poland (and all of Central  Europe) has been confronting in recent times.    Currently, we are going through a period of instability with  regard to the European security situation. There are few stable  elements in the situation, with positive phenomena and trends  being continuously intertwined with negative ones.    The situation has led to another reshaping of the European  "security map." A diversification of interests and positions  taken by different countries soon became clear, depending on the  economic and security standard enjoyed by each of them. It is  particularly important to be aware of that fact because it is  beyond doubt the most important change in European relations  since a "new Europe" was declared in 1990.    That does not mean that "classic" dangers have emerged--for  instance, with regard to the territorial integrity of Central  European states. Our assessment is that there is no such  danger--at least speaking of the short and medium term. Dangers  that could occur today would rather take the form of political  and economic pressure, a weakening of perceptions and of the  "psychological" component of security. The likelihood of  sustaining barriers in economic and civil development and of a  deterioration in Poland's international position--this is  another problem that causes concern.    We must counteract these challenges. It is a supreme  obligation of any state to secure its independence and proper  conditions for development. Generally speaking, we perceive a  permanent anchoring of Poland in the system of connections  created by the Western world as the most secure guarantee for  protecting the country's interests. So our membership in West  European and transatlantic institutions remains a strategic goal  for us. But, at a time when the issue of that membership is  made difficult--which, by the way, is not because of us--we must  demonstrate innovative thinking in the process of looking for  transitional solutions. Our own effort--a Polish, Central  European effort--will be the determining factor.    Ladies and Gentlemen:    Transforming Central and East Europe into any kind of "gray  area" would become a cause of instability in this strategic part  of the continent. It would also be dangerous when it comes to  peace and stability throughout Europe.    Our efforts to participate in Western structures are not  targeted against any country. On the contrary, these efforts  are supposed to serve to widen the area of stability and  European cooperation, and also, as a result of that, they are to  strengthen the entire continent's security. We are convinced  that extending Western institutions to cover the East will  constitute a center around which the framework of the future  architecture of European security will be built. The future  shape of that center will be determined by today's courage  displayed by Western countries in making their decisions.  Failure to use the historic opportunity being created by the  possibility of gradual extension of a stabilizing influence of  the Western democratic sphere, a sphere of peace and prosperity,  could have a detrimental impact on the future development of  European relations, particularly in the continent's eastern  part. The first step toward stabilizing the situation,  preventing a disadvantageous development of the situation,  should be by way of an opening up of Western structures as soon  as possible to those Central European countries that are ready  to take the step, and with a simultaneous establishment of  partnershiplike relations between the "widened" Western  structures and the continent's remaining countries.    We perceive the "Partnership for Peace" initiative, proposed  by the NATO "summit," as a first step, which makes the future  prospect of Polish membership in NATO more and more realistic.  The initiative also assures us of possibilities for wider  cooperation with NATO member states than up to now, and it also  improves the level of our security.    While declaring a readiness for close cooperation with  Western countries in the area of security, we expect the West to  come up with concrete cooperation in the technical and  technological areas--the kind of cooperation that would allow us  to rationally use our scientific and industrial potential. The  prospect of a future, stable, and safe Europe requires  supplementing the idea of "Partnership for Peace" with an  economic aspect of cooperation--that is to say, a "partnership  for development."    I do not mean here establishing new bureaucratic structures  or introducing new and special mechanisms of cooperation. But  what I would like to point out is a necessity of making  permanent a set of indispensable principles in international  economic cooperation. Such a specific code of behavior for  countries and economic organizations could include the task of  counteracting the trends of isolationism; it could also cover  eliminating obstacles, shaping a cooperative approach,  understanding the partner's needs and, in justified cases, it  could also cover a readiness to provide aid. Such a "partnership  for development," broadly speaking, will contribute to increased  mutual confidence and will also constitute a permanent basis for  cooperation in the area of security.    Ladies and Gentlemen:    Apart from NATO, the other institution of the Western world  that plays an important role from the standpoint of Poland's  security is the Western European Union [WEU]. We see our future  membership in the WEU as a logical addition to our links to the  European Union [EU]. Leading to a situation of the same legal  status of Poland in both organizations is an urgent issue. We  are prepared for serious dialogue within the framework of the  WEU.    Ladies and Gentlemen:    A speeding up of Poland's integration into the EU is an  important and urgent task for Poland. Apart from its economic  and civil-related dimensions, the issue is important from the  standpoint of my country's security.    That is because the most secure path toward permanent  security is by way of the inclusion of Poland and other Central  European states in the Western system of associations and  institutions. The EU has a determinant role to play in that  context. It constitutes the most dynamically developing area in  our neighborhood. The shape of the EU as an organization with a  political dimension, one with a common foreign policy with  regard to security as well as sophisticated systems of  cooperation within the area of domestic and justice-systems  policies--all of these justify our efforts to join the EU for  political reasons, as well.    We regard integration as an instrument of implementing  Polish interests, particularly in the new era of relations  initiated by Poland's association with the EC, which became  effective yesterday. In our relations with the EU, we will  defend our interests no less vigorously than the current EU  members are defending theirs. Routine discrimination against our  exports and an erosion of concessions that had been granted to  us with regard to EU markets are cause for concern.    The civil dimension of our relations with the EU is about  keeping Poland in the Western sphere of free exchange of  thoughts, ideas, and information. It is natural behavior for a  nation that derives from the same civilization roots and that  constitutes an integral ingredient of European culture. Making  contemporary scientific achievements, technical progress, and  modern management popular in Poland is one of the aspects of  this issue.    Ladies and Gentlemen:    To reduce the issue of Poland's security to mere efforts  aimed at membership in Western institutions would be a major  oversimplification. We perceive security issues in a wider  context.    We are aware of a fundamental role played by Poland's  internal stability: A persistence in building and strengthening  democratic institutions, an effective market economy, and  scientific and cultural achievements.    With regard to Poland, one can say that parliamentary  democracy and a system based on rule of law not only established  its firm roots, which go all the way back to the 3 May  Constitution, which was close in spirit and in time to the U.S.  Constitution, but also in the day-to-day political life of my  country; the most recent parliamentary elections in Poland are  proof of that. We observe human rights fully. In Poland there  are no nationalistic or ethnic disputes. Poland's borders are  not put into question by anybody, and they are defined by  international treaties. All of the above makes us a factor for  stability throughout the region.    Poland's economic situation makes it possible to be  optimistic about the prospect of the growth rate; according to  many forecasts, the growth rate may become one of the most  dynamic in Europe. The Polish economy, while going through a  process of deep transformations, is already based on its own,  new, market logic, and one can count on permanent and positive  results if one continues on the path.    An increase in industrial output has been holding for more  than 10 months now. The private sector is already producing  over 60 percent of the gross domestic product [GDP]. During the  past three years, about 1.7 million new, private companies have  been established. Over 80 percent of trade and automobile  transportation is in private hands. Private companies are  providing half of all new jobs. At the same time, inflation is  under control.    We expect Polish GDP to increase by 4.5 percent and exports  to increase by 6 percent in 1994; investments should increase by  6 percent in the same period. The assumption is that inflation  will continue to fall and that it will be about 25 percent.    The achievement of such a magnitude of economic  transformations means a lot of sacrifices, but it is also a  unique achievement in European terms. These results of ours are  being perceived and appreciated by international financial  institutions, among them the IMF, the World Bank, and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.    My government is continuing with the process of reforms  based  on a market economy, the principle of economic freedom, and a  demonopolization of economic relations with foreign countries.    The government will also continue the process of ownership  transformations, but we want privatization to be understandable  to the people and to be approved of by society; we also want the  state's interest to be efficiently protected.    In Poland, legal foundations for a market economic system  were established. Institutions of fundamental importance for a  market economy were created, even if some of them are still at  the initial stages of development. The role of market  mechanisms has increased, and also of such economic parameters  as money, profit, demand, competition, capital market, and  entrepreneurship. Along with that, Poland's economic system is  already characterized by a majority of typical traits that  developed market economies have, even if the process of  transformations has not yet been finalized.    Opening up the Polish economy to the world is an integral  part of our reforms. We are interested in establishing the  right conditions for an unrestricted flow of goods, services,  capital, and labor--naturally based on principles of mutuality.  We see in that possibilities for further activation of the  economy and a revival of competition. We see in that a chance  for further strengthening the economy with foreign capital and  new technologies and the organization of labor.</p>

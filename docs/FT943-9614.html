			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Observer: Fatal din Bet this angle hasn't occurred to The Hecklers, a band of musical terrorists on the rampage in Britain trying to discourage the 'sonic sewage' of avant garde music. But perhaps the death in Copenhagen of a female okapi over the weekend was not in vain. This giraffe-like African beastie has just keeled over, stressed out by the sounds of opera singers practising the - relatively tuneful - Wagner opera Tannhauser. Its male companion and the calf were less affected and are still alive to tell the tale. But just think what a blast of late 20th century music might have done to the rest of the family.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIZING LINES, DOING TIME;  </P> <P> INMATES LIKE 'CREATURE' MAKE PRISON HISTORY IN 3 ONE-ACT PLAYS  </P> <P> Actors come in all sizes, shapes and guises.  </P> <P> Director Spike Sorrentino recalls his first encounter with a major cast member  in the production of "Inside Out," opening tonight at the Lyceum Space.  </P> <P> Sorrentino was "auditioning" at a local institution, the R. J. Donovan  Correctional Facility, also known as the Rock Mountain medium-security prison  near Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> "This huge, very large man comes in and puts out this great big paw and says,  'Hello. My name is Creature.' " Sorrentino warily grasped the man's hand.  </P> <P> As it happened, Creature -- that's what he likes to be called -- turned out to  be "quite a find, a fine actor," Sorrentino said.  </P> <P> The biggest problem with Creature was not with learning his lines, but in  finding the Triple X shirts to costume him for one of the title roles in Israel  Horovitz's parable "Rats," and for the walk-on part in Christopher R's "The  Scam."  </P> <P> Creature and five of his co-prisoners are about to make prison history with  today's 8 p.m. performance and Sunday's 7 p.m. performance of "Inside Out,"  three one-act plays, in a benefit for the Crime Victims Fund. "Inside Out"  marks the first time California prisoners have performed a play outside of  prison.  </P> <P> "We've taken something from the community," said David, one of the inmate  actors participating in the state's Arts-in-Corrections Program. "This gives me  a chance to give something back to the community."  </P> <P> David, whos face looks naturally fierce, has shoulder-length black hair,  numerous tattoos and a husky build, the result of hours spent pumping iron in  the prison yard. He has served 8 1/2 years behind bars, he said, including time  at five other prisons.  </P> <P> Like the other inmates who received special clearance to perform on the  outside, David is a minimum-security prisoner. Most of the men chosen will  complete their two-year terms within 12 months.  </P> <P> "Prisons used to try rehabilitation," David said. "Now it's just warehousing.  It's not doing no good, being locked up. You have no values when you get out.  The programs they do have like this are very limited. This brings values back."  </P> <P> David is impressed by the message of the play Sorrentino has cast him in. In  "Rats," he plays a rat who has intruded into the home of another, played by  Creature. During rehearsal, the two lock in a muscle-bulging, realistic-looking  fight.  </P> <P> "The value part of the story has to do with getting somewhere," David said.  "Not just giving up, but fighting to get there."  </P> <P> Robert Mendoza of Pacoima tried out for the acting program because "I've always  had an interest in music and entertainment."  </P> <P> Mendoza plays a monster in "The Actor and the Invader" by Robert Patrick and a  baby in "Rats." As a cast member, he said, he has learned to work with other  convicts.  </P> <P> "We've got to work together to do the play. I had a little problem with one of  the people. I've been trying hard to learn the part. He sees that, and he likes  that, and we're working together."  </P> <P> The toughest part of acting in a play is taking the kidding from other  prisoners, said Mendoza, who wears a diaper for his role as a baby.  </P> <P> "Being in this prison, you can't let it get to you," he said. "People say,  'Agh, a play is stupid.' I've put in a lot of work in this play. I don't let  them get to me."  </P> <P> Through Sorrentino, Mendoza has discovered other plays, such as David Mamet's  tough-guy "American Buffalo."  </P> <P> "I know those kinds of characters," Mendoza said. "That's something I'd like to  do."  </P> <P> Sorrentino chose the three one-acts rather than an eight-week acting course  because "you can't go to your cell and act. If they're doing a poetry or  drawing course, they can do that in their cell."  </P> <P> But inmates can go to their cells and memorize lines in a play. Outside of the  eight hours spent each day at manual labor, they've got nothing but time.  </P> <P> "It's boring and drab in prisons," Sorrentino said. "This program gives a  chance to be a little more colorful, to laugh a bit. It gives them a chance to  talk for a few hours with someone from the outside other than a guard. One of  the biggest things down there is to pump iron. But that's not everybody's cup  of tea."  </P> <P> Last year, inmates under Sorrentino's direction produced a Christmas musical  video that was broadcast on the prison's closed-circuit television.  </P> <P> Although Sorrentino does not have to worry about Hollywood stealing his actors  with more lucrative offers, prison does have its peculiarities. A month before  opening night, a member of the cast broke a prison regulation and was taken out  of the program. Another inmate volunteered for the role, and the show went on.  </P> <P> As a group, the men are savvy and bright, Sorrentino said. And they are  surprisingly good actors.  </P> <P> "Creature is so big, and yet he shows a great vulnerability. From the  beginning, he had a clear view of where his character should go, and he went  there."  </P> <P> A human mountain with a shaved head and a bushy beard, Creature said he has  always been a drama fan. While a student at Hoover High School, he played in a  takeoff of "Hair."  </P> <P> "The toughest part is going over the lines," Creature said. "Reading them over  and over and trying to work out the nuances, the inflections of the character.  </P> <P> "Probably what I've enjoyed the most is reading it over and over again,  realizing you're finally coming to terms with the character you're taking from  this script. It's rewarding, you know."  </P> <P> For 21-year old Scott Ferrell, who plays in "The Scam," acting has meant  "learning not to be afraid to express myself in front of people. At one time  that was a problem."  </P> <P> Ferrell has less than a month before he gets out of prison, and he counts  himself lucky for having the chance to act.  </P> <P> "I've always wanted to try something like this," he said. "I think everybody  has."  </P></p>

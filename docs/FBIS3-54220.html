In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that  on 3, 17, 18, and 19 of January, this plane overflew large areas  of Iraq and then headed back for its base in Saudi Arabia.    The letter reiterated Iraq's belief that this plane is being  used for purposes other than those specified by the Security  Council and that its activity prejudices Iraq's security and  sovereignty.</p>

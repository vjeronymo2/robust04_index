			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Heribert </F> Prantl and Martin E. Sueskind; place and date not given: "Kohl?  The Man Has No Idea of What the Future Is!"]    [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, are you a  bad loser?    [Scharping] No, but I prefer to win.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Three months ago you said: "The  greatest risk to our victory in the Bundestag election is that  too many people assume the Social Democratic Party [SPD] will  simply win the next election and lead the next Federal  Government." This risk no longer exists. What now?    [Scharping] I also said that he who is too arrogant will  have to watch out. After the fine victory in Lower Saxony we  have sometimes reanimated bad old habits instead of  concentrating on formulating a reformist policy. I am speaking  of a policy that benefits the people in Germany and improves  their living conditions. We have to implement the triad of  reform in Germany -- fighting unemployment, social justice, and  protection of the environment and nature. And we must link the  necessity for reformist policy to the need for security. There  is a good old statement that is even more true today than at  many other times: He who wants to live in security tomorrow  must fight for reform today.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Half a year ago the general feeling  still prevailed -- even in the media -- that the time was ripe  for a change of power. Yet now the winds have turned....    [Scharping] Time remains ripe for a change in power. Yet,  those who look at things only from the perspective of the  election to the European Parliament do not see everything.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Have you not noted the change in  mood, which one can feel so strongly?    [Scharping] I have, too, and it is true that a lot has  changed as far as the mood is concerned. And the cartel for  preserving the conservative power works and it also involves  certain media. I never expected Helmut Kohl to relinquish power  without a fight. This is exactly why I warned against assuming  we would win automatically. He who wants to enforce his policy  and gain the necessary power must be determined and concentrate  his arguments on what is politically essential. We have not  exactly managed to do that in the past three months.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] There is something the voters have  against the SPD. Can you imagine what it is?    [Scharping] No, I think that the premise of your question is  wrong. In the European election we did not manage to mobilize  the voters. In the Bundestag election this will be completely  different. I admit that some have become more skeptical about  whether the SPD really wants the change and whether it can do  it. However, starting with the party congress in Halle, this  will be different.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is it a matter of time to emerge from  the low or does the SPD, does its chairman, its chancellor  candidate have to think of something very special?    [Scharping] People will not put up with the chancellor's  complacency until 16 October. When I speak of the challenges of  reformist policy, then I have to point out one thing: The  Federal Government announces that, contrary to what it had  promised so far, it will not provide a tax policy concept for  the remaining years of this decade. As usual, it does not keep  its promise and, as usual, it refuses to give answers. Just as  in 1990 it is telling lies again on the tax issue, because it is  planning to raise taxes after 16 October. Yet in the media this  is not playing any role at the moment.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does this mean that the media are to  blame for the current atmosphere and the bad image of the SPD?    [Scharping] No. Nevertheless -- and I say this ironically  -- there are too many people in your trade who have found Kohl  too hard a nut to crack. One example is all that talk about  economic recovery. I wish it would come, as does any reasonable  man. Yet, unfortunately, this does not change the fact that 2.3  million households are on welfare in our country -- more than  ever before, that we are short of 5 million jobs -- more than  ever before, that public debts have reached 2,000 billion --  more than ever before -- and that a wave of bankruptcies is  rolling across the country -- also unprecedented in the postwar  era. The real situation is, thus, contradictory. It will only  turn into a recovery for everybody when the slight recovery of  the economy is made into something more with great  determination. Politics must formulate hopes but it must not  play around with those hopes for the purposes of party politics.  Yet, this is exactly what the Federal Government is doing at the  moment in an irresponsible way, as it did in 1990.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If things were the way you have  said, then the question still remains whether you, whether the  SPD has underestimated the chancellor.    [Scharping] I have not. Yet, when the SPD or some of its  members argue about the speed limit, a dispute that was  absolutely irrelevant, then the SPD's clear objective of a  policy for ecological reform is thrust into the background. The  establishment of an energy policy that is compatible with the  environment, phasing out nuclear energy, the promotion of solar  technology, preventive ecological work instead of repair --  these are the issues that are at the center of our policy. When  the SPD says that it will put through equal child benefits and  make sure that the living wage is not taxed -- and, at the same  time, conducts artificial coalition debates, then these  artificial things will always get more public attention than  anything substantial. Or when the SPD says that it will cut  ancillary wage costs, modernize state activities, and limit  state debts -- and, at the same time, starts a public debate on  certain rates -- then this is bound to irritate people. I want  the SPD to focus on its own policies and the resulting dispute  with the CDU.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Vague voices have spoiled the clear  course, so to speak. Do you see no reason at all to be  self-critical?    [Scharping] I have certainly also made mistakes, worked too  much in certain areas, thus losing concentration. This will  change.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Slogans from the sphere of security  used by the SPD in the European election campaign were  attributed by listeners in a radio survey to the Republikaner  and the Christian Social Union [CSU] rather than to the SPD.  Does this bother you?    [Scharping] I have noticed one thing: In 1972, the SPD  conducted an election campaign for reform and enforcing its  ostpolitik. One slogan at the time was: "Germans, you can be  proud of your country."    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So you have not jumped on the  bandwagon of nationalism?    [Scharping] On the contrary. In any public speech I  campaign against nationalism and promote an open-minded society  that is being held together by freedom and social  responsibility. In connection with internal security I would,  therefore, like to point out the following: Taking a tough  position on organized crime is a struggle for freedom and the  integrity of democratic institutions, which are indispensable  for a law-governed state. Those who fail to understand that  should look toward Italy.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The SPD helped the government  coalition to surmount parliamentary hurdles on some substantial  issues. Has this been worth the trouble for you?    [Scharping] The SPD has carried its point, which is  something completely different to helping the government  surmount some hurdles. This happened in the case of the pension  reform and the health reform. On the issue of the nursing-care  insurance, we achieved a compromise, which, from my point of  view, was necessary for two reasons: First, to help the people  affected; and, second, to eliminate the suspicion that the  politicians have become absolutely unable to make any decision  at all. As far as the asylum law is concerned, we made a joint  decision. I wonder what the situation would be like in Germany  today if things had not been changed. And the suspicion that we  only shifted the problem to our neighbors, such as the Poles or  Czechs, was and is wrong, as I could see first hand in both  these countries. We did not remove any controversial points but  carried our point, albeit sometimes by moderating our demands.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Somebody said that the SPD was  "flirting" with the coalition government.    [Scharping] But then we would have to agree to the  coalition's anticrime law in the Bundesrat, which we will not.  The reason that we are not doing it is that this law is  incomplete in substance and will remain ineffective. Nobody  must think that DM80-100 billion in "sales" achieved by  organized crime each year remains hidden somewhere in a sock or  under some criminal's pillow. All of it is pumped into the  economic system, building up a power that may ultimately be  fateful for the economy and for politics. And if the accusation  were right that we wanted to eliminate the controversial points  with the coalition, then we would now have to assume a cowardly  position and agree to everything the coalition wants. Yet, this  is exactly what we do not want. This applies to many issues,  particularly the Bonn government's blatant disrespect for the  social matters of the citizens in eastern Germany. In light of  the accusation that we are "flirting" with the government, how  could anyone still understand the other accusation, namely that  we are obstructing work in the Bundesrat? Both accusations are  wrong.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Your policy vis-a-vis the government  so far has often been described thus: Rudolf Scharping is a  power tactician!    [Scharping] At the conclusion of the Wiesbaden party  congress, I referred to major features of my personal conduct  because I felt very clearly that some persons were deliberately  spreading that suspicion, I mean the suspicion whereby I am not  a man who acts according to an internal clock or compass. I  consider that a denunciation. My participation in the first  large peace demonstration in 1981 was linked to an attempt to  throw me out of political office and thus intimidate me. I was  not impressed by that. Instead, I was frightened that something  like that could happen. But my attitude has not changed. A  second example: When work was started on the construction of  the Nuelheim-Kaerlich nuclear power station in  Rhineland-Palatinate right at the beginning of the 1970's, the  entire social democratic sector, not to mention the whole of  German public opinion, was in favor of nuclear energy. Less than  50 people spoke out against Muelheim-Kaerlich. I was one of  them.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why should Helmut Kohl be voted out  of office?    [Scharping] One can answer with a question and a sentence.  The question is: Does anyone seriously think Germany will reach  the year 1998 or even 2000 in a better condition with Helmut  Kohl at the helm? Does anyone seriously think this man has any  idea about the future? The man has no idea about the future.  He thinks he can have another attempt. Is that enough? Never!    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You suspect him of downright egoism?    [Scharping] In any case, the kind of egoism that is  established in society. Social responsibility and a feeling of  compassion have shrunk under Helmut Kohl's administration.  Elitism is assessed purely on the basis of one's wallet.  Anyone who confuses elitism with a high income must include  Messrs Schneider or Zwick among the elite. I do not do that.  And anyone who thinks that productivity rises in line with  income ignores the real producers in this society. Apart from  the responsible, innovative, and creative enterprises, these  producers include those who, working in factories, hospitals,  the police, and other places, see to it that society remains a  society. We are facing a decisive question: Do we want to  constitute a society, in which case, to put it in casual terms,  we must keep the business running by means of a common  conception of the dignity of the individual, his social rights,  and mutual social responsibility? Or should society, according  to Schaeuble's way of thinking, be kept together by means of  national pathos and nationalist slogans?    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have answered the question why,  and very energetically. The question how is probably even more  important. What conditions and what kind of party alliance  should Chancellor Kohl abandon on 16 October?    [Scharping] I have never seen a coalition on any ballot  paper for a Bundestag election. I have only seen parties.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In that case do you consider a  black-green alliance possible after the Bundestag elections?    [Scharping] I hear rumors about such a possibility in  Saxony, but I cannot imagine it on a federal level. The SPD as  a whole must take greater care that the debate is held with all  parties, primarily with the CDU/CSU, about the federal  government's policies. But one must not forget that, for example  in eastern Germany, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]  represents a danger to the possibility of pushing through a  reform policy in Germany. One also cannot forget that the  Greens are affecting people's acceptance of reform policy with  their partially irresponsible suggestions, for example the  avalanche of levies they suggest or the clear nonsense they have  uttered concerning foreign policy.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Then who is to blame for the fact  that  the PDS has become so strong and has risen to become the third  strongest force in the East?    [Scharping] The Federal Republic's policies are to blame.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE] Are the Greens on the way to becoming a party  of the people?    [Scharping] No. They evidently want to take the FDP's place.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has the political battle with the  Republikaner already been won?    [Scharping] No. It is a good thing that we were able to  prevent the Republikaner from entering the European Parliament  at the elections. It is enough that there are neofascists in  the Italian Government. But one should make no mistake. The  rightist radical and nationalist part of the Republikaner has  not been beaten yet.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You said recently: We need the  entire party to be much stronger than over the past three  months. Be more precise! Has a section of the party left you  in the lurch? What section was it, which persons?    [Scharping] The SPD has developed a greater team spirit than  one year ago. Lately this team spirit has fluctuated somewhat,  but after the Halle congress it will be different again, and  then everything will move forward.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But is it wrong to ask whether  Gerhard Schroeder has been helpful for the chancellor  candidate's election campaign?    [Scharping] He will be helpful.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Last weekend, he accused you of  having a wrong election campaign concept, and he even said you  would have to get "clearly" more than 40 percent of the votes on  16 October. Is that helpful?    [Scharping] Schroeder did not put it this way. But I see we  also have problems with public impressions. It remains a clear  goal -- a policy of reform, which is specifically aimed at  improving conditions for the people, will only be possible if  the SPD is at the front. So we want to become the strongest  party, and there is a considerable potential for reaching this  goal.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is it true that the SPD is in a deep  communication crisis?    [Scharping] Not within the party itself. But outside the  party, there are certain barriers. The journalistic cartel in  the surroundings of Helmut Kohl works relatively well. It is  unconstitutional for the Federal Press Office to use public  funds for covertly launching derogatory comments on the SPD  chancellor candidate. Moreover, the fact that some of the  information on the government's work is withheld -- a case in  point is the Federal Government's tax policy concept -- means  that precisely the same method is being employed as in 1990, in  other words, the method to withhold the truth and act according  to the motto: Vote for Kohl first, and collect the money later.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In this election campaign, you will  probably not repeat the mistake of marching at the top alone.  What will be your team in the Bundestag election campaign? We  would like to hear names.    [Scharping] You will have to wait.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How long?    [Scharping] Until 31 August at the latest, but presumably  not as long as that.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But will there be a team?    [Scharping] First, there will be a suggestion of how a new  federal government could work in an efficient and modern way.  This means that the number of ministries will be reduced, and  the number of state secretaries will be drastically reduced. We  will thereby demonstrate how public administration can be made  leaner and more efficient, so that the state does not have to  impose new taxes or surcharges on the citizens whenever a new  project is to be implemented. Second, clarity will be created  on who will be in charge of which ministry in such a federal  government.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If it is not or cannot be you, by  whom would you want to be governed?    [Scharping] Are you honestly expecting an answer to this  question?    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] By what type of federal chancellor  would the citizen Rudolf Scharping want to be governed?    [Scharping] By a federal chancellor who combines economic  competence and social responsibility, has a clear idea of the  future, and knows that Germany can only live in peace with its  neighbors, if tolerance and living in peace with one's neighbor  are appreciated to a larger extent again. By a federal  chancellor who never forgets that people who work their way up  have an obligation toward those who have not been able to do so.  And by a chancellor who never forgets that the strong countries  on the earth must assume an existential obligation for the  weaker ones and for their development.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why does the public know so little  about Rudolf Scharping as a private person? This is at least  our impression.    [Scharping] Because preserving the private sphere requires  us not to agree to every deprivatization, and because  demonstrating publicly what is on one's mind ultimately leads to  equating policy with lifestyle. The substance of policy is not  determined by the way you dress or spend your vacation.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When did you really feel at ease in  the last 12 months since you were elected party chairman?    [Scharping] Repeatedly. I have had many wonderful  experiences in this time. One of them, which is to do with  politics, was the great initiative of pupils under the motto  "Pupils Help Others Live" for the benefit of refugee children in  the former Yugoslavia. There are also wonderful private  experiences. I have seen children who are self-confident and  show regard for others. Such self-confidence includes respect  for self-confidence, which means rejection of the  commercialization of children.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you a religious man?    [Scharping] I am a Christian.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What does this mean to you as a  politician? Is being a Christian a private matter, or is it  more?    [Scharping] I think it is more. If you have a certain inner  attitude, it will also influence the way you act in public.  Those who out of private conviction or faith speak about  charity should act accordingly in political life. Let me  illustrate this by an example. I said some time ago that it  would not be bad if the salaries of the members of the Federal  Government were frozen for some time. I earned gloating remarks  because the Rhineland-Palatinate Government is bound by the  Civil Service Remuneration Act, just as every civil servant is,  including those who work only on a temporary basis. I found it  extremely unpleasant to publicly demonstrate my private  attitude. Since I have been a member of parliament -- in this  particular case, of the Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag -- I have  always told myself that now I am in a relatively good position,  should think about my own career, and help those who have to  finance university studies, bridge unemployment, or must  overcome some other difficulty. I have done so since 1975,  without publicly talking about it. I made available my salary  increases as minister-president for charitable purposes.  However, it embarrasses me to publicly demonstrate my private  behavior, in order to be able at all to act credibly as a  politician. I consider it much more important that the  political parties that call themselves Christian have largely  given up the social contract, which is based on charity and  solidarity.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does a politician who is a Christian  have to advocate retaining the church tax?    [Scharping] He does not have to, but he may.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Should the church-state relationship  in our country be maintained in the current form and  characteristics?    [Scharping] Not in every respect, but basically, it should.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] One of the bases is church tax.    [Scharping] I would not consider this a basis, but a  characteristic -- however, one that makes sense.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are there any personages, possibly  examples, that have coined or impressed you, from whom you are  trying to learn?    [Scharping] The first figures in whom I was politically  interested were John F. Kennedy, Willy Brandt, and Martin Luther  King. I have gradually come to orient myself at  characteristics, not individual persons alone. However, I still  hold the view that -- to mention two social democrats -- the  vision and steadfastness of Willy Brandt and the clarity and  efficiency of Helmut Schmidt are exemplary characteristics.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has there ever been a point in your  political life at which you considered giving up this job?    [Scharping] Yes.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What was that?    [Scharping] Being aware of the high risk of being defeated  in the 1987 landtag elections and the possible consequences, I  had made arrangements to promptly resign from politics, if  necessary. Independence is important to me.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Can we draw conclusions from this for  the Bundestag elections on 16 October?    [Scharping] No, we will win the Bundestag elections. Nor  would anyone take over a task such as that of party chairman for  fun, even less so if there were the prospect of having to give  it up after two years. In this respect, you need a firm, inner  conviction and the ability to go through difficult times and  conflicts.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] One does not take it over for fun.  Is it fun, nevertheless?    [Scharping] On the whole, it is. I like this task, and I am  doing it with great inner commitment. Otherwise, I would be  unable to hold such an office.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (8): Green, fertile and volcanic - Western Islands GOMERA: The most important news for Gomera is that it is finally due to have its own airport. The only one of the seven islands lacking an airport, Gomera's new landing spot is to be built with Pta3.3bn (Dollars 31.7m) support from the local government and the European Community. Part of the stipulation any contractors - and tenders from all EC member countries are invited - must meet is to complete the work within three years; the government hopes work will start by July 1992. Gomera is the second smallest island in the group, with a surface area of roughly 370 sq km; its coastal perimeter is just 87 km. A volcanic island, Gomera's 20,000 inhabitants suffer a familiar Canarian problem - water shortages, hindering all but the most basic agricultural development. It is connected to the other islands by a ferry system from its capital, San Sebastian, across 32 km of water to the port of Los Cristianos in southern Tenerife. Tourists tend to spend brief periods on Gomera, depending on the ferry shuttle service. Columbus sailed from Gomera in 1492 on his voyage to the New World; other, supposedly more sophisticated Canarios say that was the last time anything happened on the island. The only resort hotel is the Hotel Tecina, which provides a comfortable spot to launch off into the lush green forest, ideal for walking holidays. One of Gomera's many curiosities is a language exclusive to the island, a whistling language called Silbo and used to communicate across valleys. HIERRO: The smallest and least populated of the Canaries, its 274 sq km area being home to just 6,000 people, Hierro is one of the more fertile islands; production of wine and livestock farming are the main commercial activities. Tourism is limited, with just one hotel offering four rooms on the quayside of Las Puntas. Its main town, Valverder, lies inland, the only capital of the islands not on the coast. Adventurous explorers may spend time searching out concealed beaches along the southern coast, where strange circular rock-carvings, known as Los Letreros and thought to be a primitive script, can also be found. LA PALMA: Fifth largest in the island group (728 sq km), La Palma has a population of 72,000 and is 97 km from Tenerife. The greenest of the Canaries, one of its most famous features is the Caldera de Taburiente, one of the world's largest volcanic craters stretching 9 km across. La Palma's volcanoes are still quietly murmuring to themselves; the last major activity was in 1971 when a new volcano erupted in the side of an older. The new volcano, Volcan de Teneguia, still smoulders. The island's main town, Santa Cruz de la Palma, is architecturally interesting, its houses decked with colourful balconies. La Palma is also home to one of Europe's most important astronomical observatories, at the high point known as Roque de los Muchachos. TENERIFE: More than 600,000 people live on the group's largest island (2,056 sq km). Tenerife has always been the best-known of the Canaries. Many English and German citizens have so fallen in love with it that they have taken up permanent residence. Although most of the administrative offices and functions are now in Las Palmas, Tenerife has managed to cling to the Canaries' only university. Pressure in Las Palmas to create its own university caused a political uproar in 1988 and led to the collapse of the government.</p>

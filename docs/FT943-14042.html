			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Graduate debt up 13% to Pounds 2,000 The level of debt held by students on graduation rose by 13 per cent this year to an average of Pounds 2,004, according to a survey of 2,286 students by Barclays Bank. The study shows that students are relying increasingly on funds from parents  -in the form of gifts rather than loans - and less on banks. The average size of a bank overdraft at graduation now stands at Pounds 286 - down from an average Pounds 295 two years ago. They are also trying to avoid the government's student loans scheme. The average borrowed from the scheme was Pounds 699, compared with an average available of Pounds 1,205. The figures suggest that student hardship will increase in the next three years, as grants will be cut by 10 per cent each year, with the balance made up by loans. Evidence that middle-class parents are being forced to spend more money on university education for their children, and that the take-up of loans is low will intensify the pressure on the government from academics to reform the student finance system, possibly by allowing students to repay loans via higher income tax or national insurance payments. Parents and guardians are bearing the brunt, and were nominated as the main source of income by 31 per cent of students this year, compared with 26 per cent last year. Those naming student grants and loans as their main source of income fell from 61 per cent to 57 per cent. More than 80 per cent of parents knew about their children's debt levels, with 35 per cent saying they were worried by them. The proportion owing money to their parents has fallen from 21 per cent to 12 per cent in the last two years, as parents increasingly give money on a 'no-strings' basis. Barclays found that students were becoming more 'serious-minded' about their personal finances, with most resigned to going into debt, and about their careers, with exams overwhelmingly cited as the most important issues facing them. Those on professional courses were most likely to be in debt on leaving university, while pure sciences graduates had the lowest debt levels. Students from six institutions - including old universities and former polytechnics - were surveyed. The six were Strathclyde, Manchester Metropolitan, Sheffield, Warwick, Bristol and Westminster.</p>

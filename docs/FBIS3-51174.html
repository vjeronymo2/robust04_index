			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- UCR [Radical Civic  Union] President Raul Alfonsin today expressed concern over the  participation of military leaders in yesterday's meeting at the  Olivos presidential residence. The meeting was held to review  the security situation in the interior of our country.    Alfonsin said he believes it is right for the government to  be interested in this issue, but pointed out that he would like  "this issue to be tackled from a social and economic viewpoint,  without apparent preparation for repression."    The main opposition party leader pointed out that he was  very  surprised at "the presence of the military leaders who,  according to Interior Security regulations, should not become  involved in this issue until the final phase is reached, via a  decision that does not seem to have been made."    Alfonsin said the UCR is studying the regional economies. He  said: "In February, we will have a panorama for discussion with  the government because we want to change the direction of these  talks -- instead of waiting for an invitation to join any  commission, we will present our own proposals."    In remarks to Radio del Plata, Alfonsin said: "I have been  talking about the deterioration of social peace for more than a  year. I have traveled the entire country. Every time I return  to Buenos Aires, I repeat that measures must be taken because  all the regional economies are experiencing crises, some of  which seem to be terminal."    Alfonsin emphasized that "it is absolutely impossible" to  pursue the current adjustment program, which "might be possible  if the private sector were hiring personnel fired."    The former president ruled out the possibility of guerrilla  pockets cropping up in the provinces. He said: "Petitions may  be tabled by people who are living beyond conceivable limits."    Alfonsin again endorsed the agreement he signed with  President Carlos Menem on constitutional reform. He said: "From  a democratic viewpoint, we managed to overcome a tremendous  crisis, which I have described as disastrous."    Alfonsin noted that before this agreement "we were on a  collision course," which "would have forced the UCR to refuse to  elect constituent assembly members and to refuse to accept the  new Constitution."</p>

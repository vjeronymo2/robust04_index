Of the $16.5 million, $5 million is being  distributed to local agencies.  </P> <P> The McIntosh Center will use the money to develop materials in Braille for the  visually impaired and sign language for the deaf so that these people can be  informed of new types of telecommunications equipment. Public presentations  also will be made to the disabled community, Brenda Premo, executive director  of the center, said.  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick slips in opening quarter FIRST-quarter pre-tax profits from the Sedgwick Group of insurance brokers came to Pounds 40.7m, compared with Pounds 41.5m last time. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said the difficult market conditions continued, but there were indications that rates were hardening in some areas of business in the US. In London there were substantial rates increases in areas such as aviation, oil and gas, and marine hull business, but there was a marked contraction in the size and capacity of the market. For the three months to March 31 brokerage and fees rose 3 per cent at constant exchange rates. There was strong growth in continental Europe and Asia Pacific broking operations, in Sedgwick Payne in the US and in consulting worldwide. Lower interest rates in the US and UK led to a 27 per cent drop in investment income, but the profit benefited by Pounds 5.1m as a result of currency management activities and weaker level of sterling. Earnings per share for the period worked through at 5.7p (6.4p).</p>

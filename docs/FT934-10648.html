			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Observer: Fax of the matter John Katz, the research consultant who emerged from obscurity to marshal opposition to PosTel's bid for property company Greycoat, has had to attend to a spot of administration in the past week. For he has been besieged by disgruntled Ferranti shareholders, seizing on him as their possible saviour in fighting the 1p-a-share offer from GEC. Operating from a PO Box in Richmond, Surrey, with just one line for the phone and fax, John Katz &amp; Associates has this week procured itself an answering service, ordered two extra telephone lines, and started making inquiries as to whether it needs regulatory authorisation if it decides to take the Ferranti case further. Katz, it emerges, is essentially a one-man-band, but he has obviously used his scarce resources to considerable effect. One merchant banker, slightly bewildered by the following he has built up, says the Katz technique is to bombard his prey with faxes. 'God knows what he did before the machine was invented,' observes this particular victim. A barrister who qualified in South Africa, Katz has lived in the UK since 1979, initially working as European marketing manager of a subsidiary of Anglo American. Later, investing his own funds in the stock market, he extended his advice to 'a select group' of clients, his speciality being undervalued shares. He was roped into Greycoat because one such client, a Rolls-Royce dealer in Putney, had got involved with the company at his recommendation. 'So there was a measure of commitment for the advice I had previously given,' he remarks. Now he has warmed to the cause: 'The arrogance which merchant banks and directors adopt in these circumstances is very damaging'. It would certainly seem that Greycoat's advisers, Rothschild, seriously underestimated Katz, an unknown in the City hitherto. SG Warburg, advisers to GEC, take note.</p>

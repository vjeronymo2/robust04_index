			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Lower financing helps Nabisco RJR NABISCO, the tobacco and food conglomerate which was the target of a Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday reported a small decline in operating profits during 1992. However, the after-tax figure, ahead of extraordinary items, increased sharply, thanks to lower financing charges. At the operating level, the group made a profit of Dollars 2.9bn, compared with Dollars 2.93bn in 1991. The fourth-quarter figure was Dollars 703m, against Dollars 752m in the same period of the previous year. Total sales for the year were Dollars 15.7bn, up from Dollars 14.9bn. RJR added that domestic tobacco volume rose 3 per cent during the year, increasing market share, although there was a 2 per cent decline in the final quarter. The tobacco division made slightly lower profits, of Dollars 2.69bn for the year against Dollars 2.73bn last time, while the food division's contribution increased to Dollars 947m from Dollars 920m. Tobacco sales were Dollars 6.16bn, up from Dollars 5.86bn on the domestic side, and Dollars 2.86bn compared with Dollars 2.68bn on the international front. Food sales rose to Dollars 6.71bn from Dollars 6.45bn. The refinancing of RJR's debt burden - encompassing over Dollars 3bn of borrowings in 1992 - helped reduce cash interest expense to Dollars 995m from Dollars 1.326bn, and non-cash interest expense to Dollars 434m from Dollars 787m. This left net income before extraordinary items at Dollars 776m compared with Dollars 368m. After a Dollars 477m charge related to the repurchase and retirement of higher-cost debt instruments, the group's net profits for the year fell to Dollars 299m from Dollars 368m.</p>

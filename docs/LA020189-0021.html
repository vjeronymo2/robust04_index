			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR GUERRILLAS' OFFER IS WORTH A TEST  </P> <P> On paper the Salvadoran guerrillas' peace initiative seems to be exactly what  the United States has been urging for years: to settle the conflict with  ballots, not bullets. The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front says that  it will support the presidential election this year, urge votes for its allies  in the leftist Democratic Convergence and accept the results. In return it  wants security guarantees, fair electoral procedures and a six-month  postponement of the election, to September. This would give the Convergence  time to organize a countrywide campaign if popular and political organizations  are allowed to operate without repression.  </P> <P> Washington officially welcomed the offer as a positive sign, but it remained  wary -- and rightly so. The guerrillas have violently disrupted past elections,  demanding negotiations and a part in a provisional government before any  further balloting. Now, just when they are showing new strength militarily,  they seem to be making an about-face. Unpredictable as this new twist is, the  United States cannot afford to ignore the possible opening.  </P> <P> For eight years U.S. strategy has had two parts: military aid to defeat the  Marxist guerrillas, and political and economic assistance to promote a reform  Christian Democratic government and ameliorate the repression and poverty that  ignited the revolution.  </P> <P> The guerrillas have neutralized U.S. efforts. They appear able to sabotage the  economy indefinitely, mount damaging strikes against government forces and  prevent the army from imposing a military solution. In fact, the army has been  on the defensive in recent months.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the U.S.-backed Christian Democratic government proved corrupt,  inefficient and unable to cope with the urgent problems that plague the  country. The economy is deteriorating. Real wages continue to drop; under- and  unemployment are more than 50%. Land reform has been severely limited, and the  intended beneficiaries are being driven under by lack of credit, technical  assistance and marketing support. The armed forces continue to repress labor  and peasant leaders. Arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, torture and  disappearance go unpunished, and death-squad activity has increased.  </P> <P> Widespread disillusionment with the government has set in. The far-right ARENA  party, long associated with death squads and the oligarchic Establishment, won  control of the legislative assembly last March and began to dismantle the  Christian Democrats' tentative reforms. Now ARENA is favored to win the  presidency, which would polarize the situation still further, threatening the  bipartisan support for continued aid in Washington.  </P> <P> Although this deteriorating situation makes it rational for the White House to  take the guerrilla offer seriously, the key actors in El Salvador have little  interest. Jose Napoleon Duarte and ARENA cite insurmountable constitutional  problems as preventing postponement of the election, an uncharacteristic  adherence to legal strictures that belies their real objections. The right is  confident that it can win next month. Giving the left the time and freedom to  organize would certainly block ARENA from winning a majority on the first  ballot, and would threaten its position in a run-off. ARENA is probably  mistaken in thinking that it can create political and economic stability and  win the war, but it wants to take office and try.  </P> <P> The Christian Democrats know that they are doing badly against ARENA, and a  six-month postponement of the election would allow a unified left to attract  many Christian Democratic supporters disillusioned with the party's failure to  deliver on promises of reform, recovery and peace. There is a reasonable chance  that by September the Democratic Convergence could beat the Christian Democrats  on the first round, forcing a run-off with ARENA.  </P> <P> The military's prime interest is in destroying the guerrillas and keeping the  left out of power. A leftist civilian government that would stop the  institutionalized corruption and punish human-rights abuses gives many military  commanders a chill. They were hoping that the March election would provide  enough legitimacy to keep counterinsurgency aid flowing from Congress. The FMLN  demand that the assassinations, jailings and repression be ended to facilitate  a democratic vote would give the non-guerrilla opposition space in which to  challenge military dominance.  </P> <P> Does the initial rejection of the FMLN offer doom it? Not necessarily. All of  the actors in the capital know that without the $1 million a day in U.S. aid  the economy and the war effort would collapse. If Vice President Dan Quayle  makes clear, when he visits San Salvador this week, that the FMLN's offer is  worth negotiating, there is a good chance of progress.  </P> <P> There are points in the proposal that need to be clarified and negotiated; it's  not clear, for example, what the guerrillas mean when they say that they are  willing to "accept the legitimacy of the electoral result," nor is it clear  whether they will cease urban terrorism like car bombings.  </P> <P> Wisely, the initial State Department response was to call the FMLN proposal  "worthy of serious and substantive consideration." There is good reason for the  United States to urge its reluctant allies in El Salvador to test the FMLN's  intentions. Eight years of U.S. efforts to win the war and create a centrist  alternative have failed. If the election were postponed, the worst that could  happen is that the situation would be back to where it is today. But there is  the possibility that it might be better -- that the FMLN offer might be the  start of national reconciliation and peace.  </P></p>

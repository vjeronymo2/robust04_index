			<p>BFN     [Text] After learning that the two-headed government's  Ministry of the Interior had set a deadline for the  representatives of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] to  vacate their office in Phnom Penh, King Norodom Sihanouk was  very worried. He expressed his worries in two messages.    In the first message dated 18 June and addressed to His  Excellency Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK, the king said  there was a threat to Democratic Kampuchea in Phnom Penh. For  this reason, he believed it was preferable for the PDK to  withdraw its representatives from the capital, because he feared  that accidents might happen to PDK representatives. If  accidents did happen to PDK representatives, he said, there  would surely be a serious problem.    In the same message, King Norodom Sihanouk added that he  would continue to have good relations with the PDK.    In another message King Norodom Sihanouk demanded that the  two-headed government avoid doing anything harmful to PDK  representatives and that it give the latter sufficient time to  prepare for their departure.    Observers have noted that the king was worried because he  understood that should the two-headed government harm PDK  representatives in Phnom Penh there would be serious  consequences both at home and abroad.    At home, there would be a collapse of and an apathy in the  process of national reconciliation and the entire nation and  people would never forgive the traitors -- the communist  Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed elements -- for that. As  a result, there would be a traumatic situation in which the king  himself would no longer be able to play any mediating role in  the settlement of the problem. This was the main cause of the  king's worries.    Moreover, observers have agreed that the PDK office in Phnom  Penh was closed because the communist Vietnamese, their puppets,  and the two-headed government were afraid of the Cambodian  masses and they were trying to exercise the powers of their  fascist, dictatorial regime. However, the more fascist they  become, the sooner their suicide.</p>

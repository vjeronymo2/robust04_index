			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan continued to recover well from surgery to remove  fluid from his brain, a spokesman for Reagan said. Reagan was operated on  Friday in Rochester, Minn., for a subdural hematoma, which apparently resulted  from a July 4 accident in Mexico when he was thrown from a bucking horse. His  daughter, Maureen, visited him, and Reagan, his wife, Nancy, and his daughter  had lunch together in the former President's room at St. Marys Hospital. Reagan  has been going through many get-well messages, including cards from Bob Hope,  Claudette Colbert, Jimmy Stewart and Cardinal John Krol. No date for Reagan's  release from the hospital has been set.  </P></p>

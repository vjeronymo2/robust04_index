			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHEEN, ASNER ARRESTED IN EL SALVADOR PROTEST  </P> <P> A hundred demonstrators, including activist-actors Martin Sheen and Ed Asner  and several Los Angeles clergymen, were arrested again this week for blocking  access to the downtown Federal Building in protest of U.S. involvement in El  Salvador.  </P> <P> The action marked the sixth weekly civil disobedience protest at the Federal  Building by a coalition of religious leaders and peace activists since the  slaying of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador.  </P> <P> No arrests have been made in the November slayings, which the protesters  believe are linked to the U.S. government-supported military forces of El  Salvador.  </P> <P> The protesters, cited for trespassing on federal property, linked arms to keep  employees from entering the building. Before their arrests, a series of  speeches were delivered by health-care workers and AIDS-care activists against  U.S. involvement in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Father Don R. Kribs, chaplain at County-USC Medical Center, called on the U.S.  government to redirect military spending to help improve health-care programs  here and in El Salvador.  </P></p>

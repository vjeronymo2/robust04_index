			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- A subcommittee of the  Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the international trade  and industry minister, will soon propose the liberalization of  imports of gasoline, kerosene and gas oil, panel sources said  Wednesday [8 June].    The plan is contained in a draft of the subcommittee's  interim report, which will be officially finalized on June 20,  the sources said.    Under a current oil products import law, only oil refiners  can import such oil products. The report, however, will propose  the law be scrapped in March 1996, they said.    Instead, the report will call for the government to  introduce  a new law to liberalize imports of petroleum products with some  limitations.    The import liberalization will allow trading firms having no  oil refining facilities to import petroleum products to help the  government promote deregulation of the petroleum industry.    When the interim report is officially adopted, the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry and the Agency of Natural  Resources and Energy will begin drafting a new law with the aim  of it being enacted at an ordinary Diet session next year, they  said.</p>

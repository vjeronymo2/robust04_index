			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to Azerbaijan Valter </F> Shonia by Garanfil Khalilova; place and date not given]    [Text] As we have already reported, a statement was adopted  on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict at the latest meeting  of the CIS heads of state. After that statement, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin declared that the acceptance of any  document, particularly with such speed, does not mean that the  Karabakh conflict has been resolved. This is a difficult and  complex issue. The conflict could be resolved with the active  participation of all sides. If this happens, how is Russia  going to carry out its mediation effort in the future? Our  reporter Garanfil Khalilova put this question to Russian  Ambassador to Azerbaijan Valter Shonia:    [Begin recording] [Shonia, in Azeri] Russia is determined to  continue to fulfill its part of the responsibility; my country  is ready for it. We believe that the first thing to do is to  secure a definite cease-fire. This is our view, and we are  working and will continue to work in this direction, no matter  what it takes to achieve our goal. All our efforts are directed  toward this goal. As you know, our special representative, that  is, our president's special representative, Ambassador  [Vladimir] Kazimirov, met with Chairman of the Minsk Group [Jan]  Eliasson in Stockholm yesterday. They achieved a certain result;  that is, they achieved a unanimity of views to continue with the  two missions [CSCE and Russia] through consultations and  cooperation. I believe that Russia will certainly continue with  its efforts.    [Khalilova] [Armenian President Levon] Ter-Petrosyan stated  during the CIS heads of state meeting that in general Armenia is  not taking part in the war. However, Vladimir Kazimirov  confirmed the view that Armenia is waging war with Azerbaijan.    [Shonia] No matter who says what, it will not change  reality.  The realty is already known by everybody. What I am saying is  that mediation is a difficult job, and no one side should lose  faith in the mediator. If such a thing happens, there cannot be  mediation. Therefore, disregarding what others say, Russia will  continue on the path it believes to be correct. [end recording]</p>

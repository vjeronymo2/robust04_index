			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wessex Water advances 21% - Acquisitions and organic growth boost waste management activity Wessex Water brought the reporting season for the 10 privatised water companies to a close with better than expected results showing a 21 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and a 10 per cent increase in the dividend. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman, attributed the strong profits growth, from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 53.4m, to tight control of costs, which, excluding depreciation and infrastructure maintenance, have not risen for the last two years. Sales rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 109m for the six months to September 30. Fully diluted earnings per share were depressed by the Pounds 144.5m rights issue in January, falling from 31.6p to 31.4p. The interim dividend is raised to 8p (7.3p). There was a strong performance from Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture with Waste Management International, which increased its contribution from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 4.2m. Mr Hood said the sharp increase was because of both acquisitions and organic growth. Five businesses had been acquired since the previous year for Pounds 7m, contributing turnover of about Pounds 15m to the operation's total sales which doubled to Pounds 42.1m. Wessex Waste Management intended to continue pursuing acquisitions, Mr Hood said, and had Pounds 80m with which to fund expansion. The core utility side improved profits by 19 per cent, with just 6 percentage points due to price increases. The rest had been down to cost controls, Mr Hood said. These included a small reduction in jobs through natural wastage and strict control of fuel costs and other overheads. Mr Hood said he was confident the company would achieve a satisfactory settlement in next year's review of pricing by Ofwat, the regulator. 'We have got an amazing efficiency programme which I know is recognised by Ofwat,' he said. 'I am confident we will get as good a deal as anybody.' However, there was likely to an element of negotiating. 'You will always end up with some eyeballing.' Wessex has capital spending requirements of Pounds 120m in the current year and about Pounds 100m is targeted for 1994. The group ended the first half with net cash of Pounds 53m, against Pounds 54m at the start of the year. Mr Hood said he expected the group to have no borrowings at the end of the current year.</p>

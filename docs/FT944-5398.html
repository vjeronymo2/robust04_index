			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (10): Candour is always the best policy - Insurance I is for insurance. . . It's also for injustice, something which people can feel a great sense of when an insurance claim is scaled down or rejected altogether. As a general rule it is is worth arguing the toss when an insurance company says no. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that those who don't ask don't get. Claims can, however, be turned down for legitimate reasons. The two best ways to avoid disappointment are to be honest with the insurance company, and to know what a policy covers. Unfortunately, neither is easy. The onus is on the person taking out insurance to disclose anything that may be relevant to the insurer's decision on whether to take on - or continue underwriting - a risk, and how much premium to charge. You should not wait to be asked questions which would elicit the relevant information. In practice, it is easy to forget crucial information or to answer a question wrongly. Visits to the doctor over apparently small ailments, minor thefts you did not report to the police, and modifications to a car could all affect different types of insurance. A claim can be rejected (and a policy invalidated) even though the claim has nothing to do with the information you fail to disclose. It is always worth reading an insurance policy when you get it, and preferably before you buy, to find out what is covered. A house contents insurance policy, for example, will only pay out on the items covered up to the value covered. It will only pay out for certain 'perils', and then there are likely to be exclusions, limits, especially for valuables, and excesses. There may also be extra conditions which, for instance, stipulate that you must effect specific security precautions. The point about taking time to examine a policy is that you will be able to go back to the broker or insurance company and see whether there is a policy with extra cover of the sort that you need. In practice, you are likely to need a broker if you want anything other than standard insurance. If you have a work of art, a cellar full of vintage wine, fine furniture or a classic car, a specialist can help track down the best deal. One source of information used by professionals is The Insurance Buyer's Guide from Kluwer. It has details on a huge range of both commercial and personal areas where insurance is available, including: juggling, multiple births, kidnapping, sheep-worrying, gymkhanas, houseboats, property abroad, thatched roofs, personalised number plates and so on. Bookshops can order The Insurance Buyer's Guide. Alternatively, write to Kluwer Publishing Ltd, Croner House, London House, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey KT2 6SR. It costs Pounds 33 plus Pounds 1.10 postage and packing. That can be a small price to pay if you have valuable items which should be properly insured. The next edition of this annual publication is due out in March.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Board resigns as Steetley more than halved to Pounds 34m STEETLEY, the building materials group taken over last month by Redland, yesterday reported profits for the year to December 31 more than halved, in line with the estimate made in its unsuccessful defence document. The Rugby-based company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 85.2m to Pounds 34.1m, on sales 6 per cent lower at Pounds 724.3m. Earnings per share tumbled from 34.8p to 14.2p. Steetley holders accepting Redland shares through the bid will receive the 16.75p Redland final dividend announced on Thursday; this is equivalent to 14.57p per Steetley share, it was stated. Those taking the cash alternative will receive no dividend. Following the successful bid, the Steetley board resigned yesterday to make way for the Redland team. Mr Gordon Stanley, who was in charge of the industrial product and services division, will remain in an executive capacity. The interest charge rose from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 26.3m on debt that ended the year at Pounds 222m, giving gearing of 67 per cent. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 17m, about half of which related to bid defence costs. Operating profits on the quarry products side fell from Pounds 70.7m to Pounds 43.3m while in the bricks, tiles and concrete products division they dropped from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 7.1m. Geographically, profits in the UK fell most heavily, from Pounds 51m to Pounds 19.5m, while those in North America were halved to Pounds 7.2m.</p>

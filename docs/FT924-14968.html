			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cost-cutting limits decline in Gold Fields' profits A SUCCESSFUL containment of production costs helped the gold mines in the Gold Fields group limit the fall in operating profits to only 1 per cent during the September quarter, despite a weaker gold price and increased wages. A particularly good performance at the Kloof mine helped lift group gold production by nearly 800kg to 31,375kg, from 30,756kg in the June quarter. This helped offset the lower average gold price, which fell to R30,865 (Dollars 10,956) per kg from R31,086 per kg three months earlier. Unit costs per kg of gold produced were only 1 per cent higher at R21,558 per kg, compared with R21,346 per kg in the June quarter, as annual wage increases offset the higher production. Although operating profits were only 1 per cent lower at R293.3m from R299m three months before, net profits fell to R226.7m from R286.7m, owing to a large drop in sundry revenue and a higher tax charge caused by season-ally lower capital expen-diture. The Kloof mine, comprising the Kloof and Leeudoorn divisions, merged with the Libanon division on July 1. The newly-merged operation earned net profits of R115.3m, compared with combined profits of R96.3m from the three mines in the June quarter. The Kloof division reported a big increase in grade to 15.5 grams per tonne from 13.7 grams three months earlier, and a rise in production to 8,368kg from 7,375kg. This made the mine the lowest-cost producer in the South African industry. The Leeudoorn division made its first ever net profits - R8.8m against losses of R2.9m - while the Libanon division incurred R9.3m operating losses, which its managers said were largely due to a fire. They were working towards making a profit in the current quarter. Driefontein Consolidated, the group's largest mine, had a modest quarter, with production shortfalls because of a fire in its West mine and lower sundry revenue, pushing net profits down to R115.7m from R161.5m in the June quarter Deelkraal results suffered from a poorer grade ore, while Doornfontein, despite achieving its production target of 110,000kg per month, made losses of R17m. Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said a decision on Deelkraal's future - closure being a possibility - would be taken within 'days and weeks, not weeks and months'.</p>

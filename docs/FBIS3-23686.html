			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sh. A. Akhmedov and N. A. Agayev, Azerbaijan </F> National Aerospace Agency, Baku; UDC 551.521:629.195]    [Abstract] A study was made of the spectral properties of  the atmospheric transfer function, on the basis of the color  tones and saturation of surface features observed from  spaceships making it possible to ascertain their colorimetric  characteristics at the surface. The findings are illustrated by  the results of computations of the colorimetric characteristics  of the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea and uniform water  surfaces for the case of a molecular atmosphere in the presence  of ozone and a molecular atmosphere in the presence of aerosol  and ozone for three observation angles (0, 30, 60) with a  change in solar zenith distance from 0 to 60. For a uniform  water surface the transfer functions always have greater values  than those for the shores. With the addition of scattering  particles (aerosols) to a molecular atmosphere in the presence  of ozone the values of the transfer functions for the color  coefficients X and Y increase, whereas those for Z decrease.  When the atmosphere is polluted by aerosol particles the role of  scattering particles in the transformation of surface  colorimetric characteristics substantially increases. The  results indicate that the colorimetric characteristics observed  from space are dependent not only on the relation among the  optical parameters of aerosol, but also are determined by the  conditions of atmospheric illumination by direct solar  radiation.

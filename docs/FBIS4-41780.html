			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "The 14th Army Likes It in the Dniester </F> Region"]    [Text] At a news conference held in Moscow Igor Smirnov,  president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldavian [Moldovan]  Republic [DMR], declared that "individuals in the 14th Army are  not interested in resolving the conflict" between Moldavia  [Moldova] and the DMR. He based his opinion on the argument  that the wages of a 14th Army officer stand at 300,000 Russian  rubles, i.e. 1.5 million former Soviet rubles, which are the  basic monetary unit in the DMR. Therefore, officers would not  like to leave the Dniester region.</p>

Vavilov, St.Petersburg; UDC 621.373:535]    [Abstract] An unstable resonator is proposed for the  LIT-100 commercial YAG:Nd laser. The active medium of this laser  consists of two cylindrical YAG:Nd rods 100 mm long and 6.3 mm  in diameter, a thermal lens being induced in each. They are now  placed each inside a single-lamp ellipsoidal reflector-luminaire  and each pumped with a 24 A - 150 Hz current supplying a power  of 5.5 kW. These luminaires are very energy-efficient but, owing  to multimode radiation emission by the active medium, they form  a widely divergent radiation beam. Stable resonators in the form  of long planar cavities minimize the beam divergence, but with  an attendant loss of power caused by distortions of higher  orders than those due to formation of the thermal lenses in the  active medium. Unstable resonators operating on the negative  branch of the stability curve are known to minimize the beam  divergence with minimum energy loss. Two variants of such a  resonator have been designed and tested. The telescopic  resonator providing an M= -1.7 magnification has a cavity formed  by two concave mirrors with respectively 0.67 m and 0.4 m radii  of curvature, the latter having a 3.6 mm diameter. The focus of  each mirror coincides with the focus of the nearest to it  thermal lens, the two thermal lenses having the same focal  length and the distance between them being equal to twice that  focal length. This resonator forms a radiation beam similar to  that formed by a ``cat's eye'' reflector and not much better  than that of the LIT-100 laser. The other resonator has a cavity  formed by two plane total-reflection back mirrors and an exit  mirror with a hole smaller than 6.3 mm in diameter. The image of  this hole, formed by the two thermal intracavity lenses,  coincides with it and the radiation beam thus exits through it  with hardly any loss of power. Such a resonator with  self-imaging of the exit hole rendered the best performance when  its critical dimensions were: 1. diameter of exit hole d= 5.2  mm, 2. focal length of thermal lenses f= 1 m, 3. distance from  focus of the thermal lens before the exit mirror to the nearest  back mirror L= 0.74 m. With this resonator the laser delivered a  power of 160 W (80 W per rod) in a beam with a 1.6 mrad  divergence angle (at 86% maximum intensity level).  Figures 3;  tables 1; references 6.</p>

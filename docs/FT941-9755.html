			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: All eyes on Glaxo - The Week Ahead On Monday Westminster Health Care, the nursing home group which was floated in April, is expected to announce a sharp rise in profits at the interim stage. For the six months to November, pre-tax profits are estimated at Pounds 4.9m compared to Pounds 1.6m. The previous figure was stated after interest of Pounds 2.7m, but the Pounds 64m proceeds from the float will have cut that bill. Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, reports first-quarter results to the end of December on Tuesday. There is a wide range of forecasts because of the many uncertainties involved. The cost of the US coal strike, which has now ended; the severity of the negative swing on interest charges; the contribution from Quantum Chemical, acquired at the end of the last financial year; and the effect of exchange rates. However, hopes are for a modest underlying rise from last time's Pounds 216m, excluding Pounds 20m of disposal profits. Glaxo's half-year figures on Thursday kick off the UK's pharmaceuticals sector results season. With SmithKline Beecham the following week, and Wellcome and Zeneca in March, analysts will be examining the sector's fortunes in an unfamiliar light: that of the yield. Until the early 1990s, the drugs sector was the darling of the capital growth investors. But the threat of cost-cutting in government healthcare budgets has stopped that in its tracks. This means that all eyes will turn first to Glaxo's proposed interim dividend. Forecasts range from 8p to well over 9p, compared with last year's 7p. Even a rise at the lower end of the scale would be a powerful reminder that a yield of almost 5 per cent compares favourably with a FT-SE 100 yielding less than 3.5 per cent. Pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 970m, against Pounds 819m, are expected to reflect falling interest income and tighter profit margins. Alfred McAlpine on Thursday will become the first of the larger contractors to announce annual results, for the year to October 31. The big question is by how much Oliver Whitehead, the new chief executive, will write down the company's assets following the departure of Graeme Odgers. Profits should have benefited from the recovery in the UK housing and US construction markets and are expected to be in the region of Pounds 6m before write-downs. This compares with pre-tax profits Pounds 3.6m the previous year. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, also reports annual profits for 1993 on Thursday. Analysts are expecting a near doubling of profits to around Pounds 90m before a Pounds 10m profit on the sale of Sharps Pixley, the bullion business sold to Deutsche Bank for Pounds 17.6m. Wickes, the DIY and timber retailer, is expected on Thursday to announce a strong increase in full-year profits to between Pounds 17m and Pounds 19m, more than double last year's pre-exceptional figure of Pounds 7.8m. Analysts are keen to hear whether Wickes is benefiting from the upturn in the housing market, but are concerned about the impact of the recession on its operations in continental Europe.</p>

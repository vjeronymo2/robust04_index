			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F> lower house floor leader, by Stefano Marroni; place and date not  given: "Berlusconi Wants Di Pietro as a Minister" -- first  paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] "There is a real  problem," the League's second-in-command, Roberto Maroni  explained, "and that is that this government, already grappling  with so many problems, must not also tackle working in a climate  of sharp conflict in the country. In order to prevent this, a  great deal depends on the Left. But a great deal also depends on  the majority, on what signs we issue: In our choice of ministers  and in the procedures to reform the Constitution. This, because  government responsibility is ours and because otherwise there  would be a system of clubby politics. The formulation of the  rules is another matter which concerns the whole of parliament."    [Marroni] One thing at a time, Mr. Maroni. What do you mean  when you say that a great deal depends on the Left?    [Maroni] I mean that the Left must decide what to do. It is  not I that should tell you this. Do they want to entrench  themselves in their citadel, do they want to continue making an  issue about [lower house speaker] Pivetti's being anti-Semitic?  Well, they are entirely free to do so. But they must realize  that this will have an effect on the government's composition.    [Marroni] In what way?    [Maroni] Look, I do not think that people can believe that  the League is speaking out on the question of the ministries  simply because it is seeking some for itself. There are some  specific political issues behind this. One of them concerns the  functioning of the Interior Ministry, the need to bring together  all the responsibilities regarding local government which are at  present divided between four or five ministries -- those of the  interior, public works, finance, public administration. Local  authorities must be given certainties; they must not be  confronted with the fact that on the same issue -- do you  remember the repayment of the ICI [Municipal Real Estate Tax]?  -- the Finance Ministry issues a circular which says one thing  and the Interior Ministry another which states the contrary.  But that is not all; we are raising a much wider issue....    [Marroni] Namely?    [Maroni] It is obvious: We do not want to force the Left to  seek street confrontations. To this end it is important that  the key ministries not be occupied by representatives of a  single party: If Berlusconi thinks he can claim the prime  ministership and the interior, foreign, treasury, and defense  ministries, then he is very much mistaken.    [Marroni] Why, is Berlusconi seeking a confrontation?    [Maroni] Not at all. I have spoken with Berlusconi; he is  very much aware of the problem. In any case, pardon me for  asking, but why is he so keen on having [Radical leader]  Pannella in the government?    [Marroni] Yes, why?    [Maroni] Because Pannella has led him to believe that he is  the link with the Left. Whereas, in fact the PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left] does not care about Pannella in the least.  And this is why Pannella is now attacking us -- because it is  we who are conducting a dialogue with the Left, because we could  constitute this link.    [Marroni] Well, perhaps in fact he is attacking you because  you do not want him as a minister....    [Maroni] Look, on the whole I have nothing against it. The  National Alliance was the first to veto Pannella's becoming  foreign minister. And with regard to the Justice Ministry, I  agree with much of what Marco [Pannella] has to say. But, I  repeat: If the aim is not to seek a confrontation, what is the  point of provoking the magistrates by making Pannella justice  minister? Because, if that happens, a conflict is guaranteed.    [Marroni] As far as you are concerned, however, your real  dispute with Berlusconi seems to be over the Interior Ministry.  A separation cannot take place in a matter of weeks....    [Maroni] I know, but the law is clear: There is six months  in which to transfer responsibilities. There could be many  solutions in the meantime.    [Marroni] There is something else that is not clear,  however:  Do you really want to be minister of the interior?    [Maroni] Of course. The problem is that someone, let us say  someone very high up, does not want a League member as interior  minister....    [Marroni] Because of the business of the three Italies....    [Maroni] Not at all: That is a pretext, the result of the  fact that you journalists insist on portraying Miglio as the  "League's ideologue." No, look, nobody is afraid that we will  quietly start erecting border fences. They are afraid -- and  rightly so -- that closets will be opened at the Interior  Ministry, that people will discover what has happened in past  years, what happened at Ustica. This is why Costa or Cossiga are  being mentioned -- to keep the lid down tight....    [Marroni] Who does Berlusconi want as interior minister? One  of his own men, or who?    [Maroni] It seems to me that [Judge] Di Pietro's name is  emerging again, is it not?    [Marroni] Is he Berlusconi's candidate?    [Maroni] Let us say that it would please him greatly....  But, you know, it is difficult to know what will happen, with  so many people putting themselves forward to serve the country  as interior minister....    [Marroni] Why, is Di Pietro putting himself forward?    [Maroni] No, I was not talking about him. It is just that it  is not we who are having meetings with Di Pietro....</p>

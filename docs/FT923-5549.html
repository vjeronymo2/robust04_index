			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Books: The wit and wisdom of an Irish man of letters THE LETTERS OF BRENDAN BEHAN edited by EH Mikhail Macmillan Pounds 45, 224 pages BRENDAN Behan once remarked that, when his biography came to be written, they would have trouble making out anything from his letters because he hadn't written any. Well, he bargained without EH Mikhail. Every time Behan set pen to paper, he unwittingly added to the scope of The Letters of Brendan Behan. When, as an IRA man back in 1942, he sent a package of detonators and a Webley revolver to a friend, his accompanying note ('Please give bearer my equipment') was fodder for this wonderfully exhaustive work. When he signed an agreement with one Gerald C. Raffles giving him the 'sole and full rights' to his most famous play, The Quare Fellow, the letter (including the three halfpenny stamps) finished up in this volume. Mikhail's intention that his book should 'restore the reality of the artist and the man' is unlikely to be advanced much by his inclusion of Behan's one-line note (in Irish) on the outside of a brown paper package to a pub owner, saying: 'To Arthur, with the love of my heart.' Behan, who often had to pawn his typewriter to get the price of a drink, would have been prostrated by the thought that his idlest scribble would have ended up in a book costing no less than Pounds 45. Still, this volume will be a gift for those like myself to whom anything by the author of Borstal Boy - the most remarkable of autobiographies - and The Quare Fellow is a pure pleasure. But I cannot say honestly that it will do much to explode 'the myth of the boisterous performer,' because Behan is a performer as a letter writer just as much as he is anywhere else. Many of the letters are included already in Ulick O'Connor's admirable biography of Behan. The correspondence with Iain Hamilton is amusing. He was the publisher who commissioned Behan's first book, and whom he bombarded with excuses for late writing, requests for money, suggestions for textual alterations, and sundry thoughts such as his reflection that sexual frustration might have been what drove him and his IRA friends to political violence. 'Maybe it would be a good thing for the peace of the world if sex (boy and girl stuff, I mean) was compulsory,' he mused. There is not much in the book to illumine Behan's relationship with his long-suffering wife, Beatrice, except for a charming little poem apologising for lapsing from his promise to her to foresake all other drink but stout, which ends with the lines: 'Why does any woman/ give herself the trouble that/ husbands are when with less trouble/ she could buy and train a cat?' Most, if not all, Behan's letters to the newspapers are printed here. Some are more essays than letters, such as his letter to the New Yorker which was published at the time his play, The Hostage, opened in New York and which summarises Behan's perception of himself as a playwright: 'You see, in The Hostage I have nothing to sell, not religion, not a political system, not a philosophy, and certainly not a panacea for the ills of the world. I respect kindness to human beings first of all, and kindness to animals. I don't respect the law; l have a total irreverence for anything concerned with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper, and old men and women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer. One feud that he carried on through the letters pages of newspapers was that with Patrick Kavanagh, the northern Irish poet, who detested Behan (it was mutual). He also wrote to them to defend the Dublin working classes from the charge of fecklessness and the IRA from that of sectarianism. Behan might have left his past as a republican and house-painter behind with his success as a playwright, but he wasn't having anyone think that he had abandoned his identity. Interestingly, his early letters from prison show that he was perfectly confident in his ability to capture the diction of the Dublin working classes in his first stab at a play: 'I do claim to have taken nine real Dublin slummies and stuck them on paper. I even go so far as to claim that they are as genuine as any of O'Casey's battalion - maybe more so because O'Casey was a Protestant and that means a big lot.' Because Behan's great charm was to represent a very fluent Dublin proletariat, anything he writes is bound to give pleasure, receipts and all. But the wit of an Irish republican and alcoholic cannot really be captured by a heavy-handed Canadian academic. Anyone who wants the essence of Behan should save the Pounds 45 and clamour for his collected journalistic pieces, Hold Your Hour and Have Another, to be returned to print.</p>

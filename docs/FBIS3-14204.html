The visit is  the first of its kind to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.    In a statement to QUDS PRESS, the source said that the  visit,  which falls within framework of the political moves by the  opposition Palestinian forces to mobilize support for their  positions that are opposed to continuing the talks with Israel,  is aimed at discussing political developments in the region and  the Libyan stance toward the current peace process. Libya  opposes the self-rule accord reached by Israel and the PLO at  the end of last year.    All leaders of the opposition Palestinian factions, with the  exception of Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, are  participating with the Palestinian delegation, which is expected  to meet with Libyan President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    The source said that Jibril, who resides in Damascus, did  not  accompany the delegation for security reasons. He added that  the visit was made upon an invitation from the Libyan leadership.    The Palestinian forces opposed to the Declaration of  Principles are seeking to mobilize a hardline Arab stance  against this accord. For this purpose, they have established an  alliance which they have called "the Alliance of the 10  Palestinian Forces," whose headquarters is in Damascus.</p>

The endowment said it was prepared to offer  disaster relief funds to arts institutions that sustained specific losses of  such things as vehicles, costumes and buildings. Affected organizations can  contact the endowment program office that oversees their disciplines. The  endowment's general telephone number is (202) 682-5400.  </P></p>

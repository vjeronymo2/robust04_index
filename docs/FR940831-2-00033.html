Scoping activities are initiated early to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify reasonable alternative operational procedures and environmental enhancement measures that should be evaluated in the EA; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify significant environmental and public recreational access issues related to the operation of the projects; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determine the depth of analysis for issues that will be discussed in the EA; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify resource issues that are of lessor importance and, consequently, do not require detailed analysis in the EA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scoping Meetings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Staff will hold two meetings. An evening scoping meeting is designed primarily for receiving public input, whereas an agency meeting will focus on federal, state, and local government concerns. We invite all interested agencies, tribes, organizations, and individuals to attend either or both meetings and to assist staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evening meeting for the general public will be held from 6:30 p.m. until 9 p.m. on Tuesday, September 20, 1994, at the Bittersweet Branch of the Mishawaka_Penn Public Library, located at 602 Bittersweet Road in Mishawaka, Indiana. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency-oriented meeting will be held from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, September 21, 1994, in the Commission Chamber of Buchanan City Hall, located at 302 N.

Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to sign in before the meetings start and identify themselves for the record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerned parties are encouraged to offer us verbal guidance during the public meetings. Speaking time allowed for individuals at the evening public meeting will be determined before that meeting, based on the number of persons wishing to speak and the approximate amount of time available for the session, but all speakers will be provided at least five minutes to present their views. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scoping Meeting Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the scoping meetings, the staff will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the multiple-project EA; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Identify resource issues that are of lessor importance and, therefore, do not require detailed analysis; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable data, concerning significant local resources; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Requested <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal and state resource agencies, local government officials, interested groups, area residents, and concerned individuals are requested to provide any information they believe will assist the Commission staff to analyze the environmental impacts associated with relicensing the Buchanan and Twin Branch Projects.

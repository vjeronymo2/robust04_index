			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (12) - Perfect mix of ingredients / Incentive Holidays / Fun, sun and fantasies, but business clients are never far away from five-star food and accommodation Medieval banquets, Venetian masked balls and Beefeaters charging among the dunes do not raise eyebrows in Dubai. It is possible to stage the most Disneyesque event and carry it off with the accompaniment of superb food and five-star accommodation. Little wonder that Dubai has captured the fertile imaginations of incentive operators. They are always looking for different destinations, mostly for business clients, and Dubai provides the almost perfect mix of the right ingredients. It is off-beat enough to be exotic but in this case the travel-speak does not mean roughing it. There is an efficient ground system of experienced operators, in addition to a wide choice of excellent hotels. Whacky incentives and corporate promotions could not be executed with the same aplomb in many Arab countries. All well and good being lost in the desert and fending off the marauding Bedouin, but the tired and thirsty businessman will require a hotel with showers that work, and a drink. In some other Arab countries, the paperwork required for a bash in the desert would take until nightfall while the implications of helicopters circling the dunes in somewhere like Syria are too awful to contemplate. Business-based incentive travel fits the profile of Dubai's tourism promotion drive. Business promotions, after all, are good for business - large companies entertaining their clients who are, in turn, businessmen. For a country which effectively has a No Backpackers sign at the airport, this is good news. Lots of businessmen coming in, even if they do insist on dressing up as tribesmen. Dubai is well accustomed to the eccentricities of the English and the words of Noel Coward have been adapted to account for the vagaries of business promotions and incentive tours. Largely unsuitable for publication, the refrain is: 'Mad dogs and businessmen go out in the desert sun'. Ever vigilant on the opportunities front, Dubai's hotels have developed a range of both tourist and business incentive programmes. The Hatta Fort and Jebel Ali hotels produce tailored events, complete with drawbridge, longship or any other props which may be required. They are a very good deal, with a 40 per cent discount on normal rates for groups of 15 people or more. Other hotels are jumping on the wagon (stagecoach or canvas-covered, available on day rates). Ms Jill Thompson energetically operates a range of Dubai incentives in co-operation with Gulf Ventures, part of the Gray MacKenzie travel group. She enthusiastically reports considerable interest in Dubai incentives from France, Germany and Spain. With wide experience of the Gulf region, Ms Thompson was well placed to spot the advantages of the emirate and has helped develop the promotion of Dubai incentives. They are having the desired effect. Mr Tony McIver from Maritime &amp; Mercantile International (MMI), enthuses over a recent desert jaunt. The group set off for a desert outing and spent a couple of hours dune-climbing in four-wheel-drive vehicles. There is something exhilarating and perverse about racing up a dune and plunging down the other side, defying both gravity and common sense. Stranded in the desert after a breakdown, the driver set off to find help. Several 'Bedouin' appeared over the horizon, each riding a camel decked in the company colours and sporting the corporate logo, their riders bearing gifts of company products. An enforced but thankfully short camel ride later, the group were enjoying a barbecue, belly dancing and Arabian sunset before being whisked back to their hotels by helicopter. Mr McIver's verdict: Impeccable timing, perfectly executed, excellent fun and jolly good for business. Jill Thompson, JTL Associates (UK), 051-334 2435.

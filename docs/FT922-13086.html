			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Party row erupts as Kinnock quits: MPs voice opposition to early leadership contest - 'Tory press' blamed for defeat AN ACRIMONIOUS row broke out within the Labour party yesterday over plans for a speedy change of leader after Mr Neil Kinnock stepped down following last week's election defeat. Several MPs, including Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment spokesman and a likely contender, declared their strong opposition to an early contest which could see Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor and odds-on favourite, elected to succeed Mr Kinnock. In a sombre statement in his Commons offices, Mr Kinnock blamed what he called the 'Tory press' for his defeat. 'I make and I seek no excuses, and I express no bitterness when I say that the Conservative-supporting press has enabled the Tory party to win yet again when the Conservative party could not have secured victory for itself on the basis of its record, its programme or its character.' He told Labour supporters to ignore media coverage of the internal election which the party must hold to replace him. 'I have only one piece of advice for the Labour movement at every level  - do not feed and do not believe the press and broadcasting media in their reporting of these events,' he said. Tributes to his leadership flowed in from several senior party figures and included a private message from the prime minister. Mr Kinnock made clear that he and Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, would ask a special meeting of the National Executive Committee today to call the elections for late June. Arguing that the date served the 'best interests' of the party, he said the timetable would allow the parliamentary party to elect a new shadow cabinet before the summer recess. With the Conservatives holding a small majority and continuing deep economic difficulties 'it would not be right for the Labour party to wait six months until October', he said. Although most MPs on the NEC oppose an early contest, Mr Kinnock's timetable is likely to be agreed, but the vote will be close. Some unions are understood to be worried, however, at being seen to 'steamroller' through an early contest when their dominant role in the process is the subject of controversy. The row was fuelled yesterday by a vituperative letter to The Guardian from Mr Colin Byrne, Labour's chief press officer until last autumn. Claiming that a hurried contest will cut short a full debate on how to respond to Labour's election defeat, he wrote that Labour was 'sleepwalking towards a leadership fix in the grubby old style with ageing trade union barons, nods and winks about easing up on the accelerator pedal of reform and smokefilled rooms being the main features'. Mr Byrne also accused Mr Smith of failing to support Mr Kinnock adequately in his party reforms. His intervention was interpreted by party insiders as an effort to open the contest to other potential leadership candidates, not least Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade secretary. But union leaders differed. Mr Bill Jordan of the engineers' countered that the need for stability within the party meant the election should be completed 'as soon as possible'. The ferocity of the row provoked Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaigns co-ordinator, to intervene with a call for self-discipline in the contest. Supporters would not forgive MPs who 'jeopardised' Mr Kinnock's achievements, he said.

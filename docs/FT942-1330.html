			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ML recovers with Pounds 5.23m and restores dividend ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronics group, yesterday reported a Pounds 5.23m pre-tax profit for the year to March 31, compared with an Pounds 11.2m loss last time. The group underscored its return to pre-tax profits - the first since 1991 - by proposing to resume dividend payments. Earnings per share of 2.9p compared with losses of 18.4p and the board is recommending a 0.85p final dividend. It intends to pay both an interim and final dividend in future. The shares closed 4p higher at 45p. Mr Howard Grant, chief executive said: 'In 1993 we laid down our strategy for recovery. The first stage of the process has been successfully completed. We now intend to build upon this so that recovery leads into a period of growth.' Turnover increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 84.9m) with particular strength in overseas markets. Overall sales per employee advanced by 30 per cent. An operating profit of Pounds 6.39m compared with a Pounds 7.01m loss previously. The turnround was underpinned by a strong recovery in the aerospace and marine division, which achieved an operating profit of Pounds 3.84m (Pounds 488,000 loss) on turnover up by 19 per cent to Pounds 46.1m. The aircraft and cargo handling division reported an Pounds 334,000 operating profit, compared with a Pounds 756,000 loss, on turnover increased 16 per cent to Pounds 26.8m. The electronic component distribution division increased operating profits by 61 per cent to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.38m) on turnover up 19 per cent to Pounds 27.6m. Net interest costs were reduced to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 2.74m), partly reflecting a decline in borrowings which fell to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 13.8m), equivalent to gearing of 39 per cent.</p>

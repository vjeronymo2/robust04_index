			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [James Cotton Commentary: "Cold War Gains New Lease of Life"] </F>   [Text] The United States, Japan and South Korea are now in  agreement that the time has come to impose sanctions upon North  Korea because of its failure to implement international  inspections of its nuclear program. Yet few have asked what  such sanctions would achieve, it being assumed that sooner or  later North Korea would have to admit to its nuclear ambitions.    But if such an admission is not forthcoming, and if neither  Russia nor China cooperate fully with Washington's policy, the  US will have little real leverage, and North Korea will have  succeeded in undermining the post-Cold War principle of the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.    The assumption behind much of the manoeuvring over the  Korean  crisis has been that in the right circumstances North Korea  would assent to international inspections which would establish  the true character of the country's nuclear program.    In the past year, following the breakdown in inspection  which  occurred in early 1993, it has further been assumed that such  inspections would expose this program as having the purpose of  producing nuclear weapons.    This fact being demonstrated to the international community,  pressures and inducements would then be used to motivate North  Korea to abandon this weapons program. Tensions in the  peninsula would ease, the Washington-Seoul alliance would be  vindicated, and the principle of the unacceptability of nuclear  weapons proliferation would be established.    These assumptions have never been valid, and have now been  exposed as flawed. There is little chance that North Korea  would take any steps which would make available incontrovertible  evidence that the country has a nuclear weapons program. All  through this crisis, North Korean spokesmen have asserted that  such a program does not exist.    North Korea has rejected the final appeal to make available  its nuclear records, so the issue will again be debated by the  United Nations Security Council. If a resolution is proposed  which would impose sanctions against the regime, what policy  will North Korea follow?    The most likely step North Korea would take would be to  leave  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] regime. For more  than a year, the country has been on its own reckoning but not  according to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] in a  position of "suspended withdrawal" with regard to the treaty.    Such a step is the sovereign right of all signatories of the  NPT, though withdrawal must be according to a set procedure  which includes a three-month period of notice.    Once outside the NPT, North Korea would undoubtedly suffer  further recriminations and isolation. But UN action to levy  sanctions or take other measures would only be legitimised if  the country could be declared a common security danger to the  general peace and safety of the world.    Is it credible to regard North Korea as such a danger? The  claim that the country is a general threat by virtue of its  development of nuclear weapons is a weak one. There are a  number of states outside the NPT, including Pakistan, Israel and  India, that have nuclear weapons programs more sophisticated  than that possessed by North Korea.    North Korea has not been engaged in a war since 1953, and  although its international behaviour leaves something to be  desired, its recent record is no worse than (for example) Syria  which is presently courted by Washington as an associate in the  Middle East peace process.    With these considerations in mind, it is unlikely that China  would cooperate in levying sanctions. Without active Chinese  support sanctions would not work, as more than half of North  Korea's trade is with China.    And it is always possible that China would act positively to  veto any UN Security Council resolution on this issue.    Meanwhile, the Russian proposal to convene an international  conference on the issue, rather than adopt sanctions, has  complicated matters further. Ever since President Yeltsin's  visit to Seoul in 1992 the Russian influence in North Korea has  been very much reduced. Now, smarting from domestic criticism  from the right to the effect that Moscow's foreign policy has  been made in Washington, Russia seeks to revive a role in a  region long of strategic concern.    This leaves the US in a difficult position. South Korea and  Japan are prepared to act in concert with the US to pressure  Pyongyang. Without cooperation from Beijing and Moscow,  however, it is not clear what pressure will achieve beyond  including further perceptions of isolation and embattlement in  North Korea.    American actions have contributed to these difficulties.    Initially, it was said that North Korea had to surrender its  nuclear capability, and unless it did so the military option  would be considered.    Then the US Secretary of State lectured the Chinese  Government on its human rights failures. And Pakistan was  offered a nuclear deal whereby provided no further fissile  material was produced and the capping of its nuclear program was  internationally verified, the country would be allowed to  acquire further US weaponry.    The first initiative undermined efforts to co-operate with  China on the North Korea issue. The second must have signalled  to Pyongyang that the US was prepared to refrain from too close  a scrutiny of the past activities of nuclear proliferators  provided that their behaviour improved in the future.    But by arguing that the International Atomic Energy Agency  have free access to the nuclear fuel elements currently being  replaced in the reactor at Yongbyon, the US is insisting that  all of the past history of North Korea's program should be  exposed.    Just at the time that it is possible to speak of the  post-Cold War era in Europe, the Cold War alliance structure in  North-East Asia has been given a new lease of life.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NIGHT STALKER VERDICTS;  </P> <P> THE STALKER MURDER CASE  </P> <P> The list below illustrates the complex web of direct and circumstantial  evidence against Richard Ramirez, including incriminating statements he made  after his arrest.  </P> <P>  The 43 felony charges involved 13 murders. Prosecutors said most of the crimes  contained various Ramirez "signatures," such as "distinctive" and "gaping" stab  and slash wounds to the throat or body; the language he used that was recounted  by survivors; the use of ligatures and restraints, including handcuffs and  thumbcuffs, and unusual Avia shoe prints at some of the crime scenes.  </P> <P>  Another alleged Ramirez trademark was the pentagram, which first appeared at  the scene of a murder in Monrovia, drawn on a bedroom wall and on a victim's  thigh. Such pentagrams also were found on the dashboard of Ramirez's car and on  his arm.  </P> <P>  Four handguns were used, but only one was recovered. However, firearms tests  showed that unused bullets in a Ramirez bag had been loaded into the gun that  was used in two of the incidents. Finally, about 375 pieces of jewelry and  other personal property taken from six of the murder sites were recovered and  linked to Ramirez.  </P> <P> INCIDENT  </P> <P> Jennie Vincow, murdered June 27 or 28, 1984, in Glassell Park home.

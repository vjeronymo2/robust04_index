			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIFE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Here's a commentary on life in Los Angeles: My neighbor was driving en route to  Palm Springs when his car developed trouble. He pulled over to the side and  started walking for help. Several motorists stopped offering help, but being  wary of strangers my neighbor refused, and continued walking 3 miles to the  nearest gas station. Life ain't what it used to be!  </P> <P> ETHEL M. STUBBS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The recycling of Ukrainian ammunition which has  exceeded its expiry date is now being conducted by the  joint-stock company "Alliyant-Kiev," formed in 1993 by the  Shostkinskiy scientific and research institute, the U.S.  Alliyant-Tecsystems, and Repirbase Ltd of Great Britain. The  Ukrainian partner has 51 per cent of the shares in the  joint-stock company. In the first quarter, "Allyant- Kiev"  already received 5,600 tonnes of ammunition for recycling. The  127 tonnes of extracted gunpowder were sent to the UkrVybukhBud  explosives manufacturer and the 250 tonnes of brass cartidges to  a nonferrous reprocessing factory to be reprocessed into rolled  metal.    According to unofficial sources at the Defense Ministry,  there are 320,000 tonnes of ammunition stocks in line to be  scrapped.</p>

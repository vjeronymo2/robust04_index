			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter O Yong-chin] </F>   [Text] Korea is expected to give an ultimatum to China to  withdraw its unacceptable demand or risk no agreement at all in  their future aviation talks aimed at inaugurating regular  flights between the two countries.    A senior official of the Transportation Ministry strongly  hinted yesterday that it might have to stop the negotiations  with China and open aviation talks with Taiwan, instead.    "Negotiations between Korea and China have been going  nowhere  over the past two years due to China's unacceptable demands. It  is now time for Korea to consider another option, which is  Taiwan," the official said.    Korea switched diplomatic ties to China from Taiwan two  years  ago. Since then, regular flights between Korea and Taiwan have  been cut off, while Korea and China have initiated charter  flights between Seoul and China's two cities, Shanghai and  Tienjin.    For Korean Air alone, the loss from the closing of the  Taiwan- Korea route is estimated to reach about 100 million U.S.  dollars a year, according to an airline official. Hundreds of  thousands of Taiwanese visited Korea annually before the  diplomatic breakup.    "We can't accommodate China's demands, which are on the  borderline with outrage," the official said. "Either they back  off or else."    The two countries will make last-ditch efforts to conclude  an  aviation agreement in the next meeting, expected to take place  later this month or early next month.    So far, there have been seven such meetings with the last  one  in February.    A major bone of contention is China's demand to unilaterally  use a beyond point right from Seoul, possibly to Los Angeles,  while Korea reserves its due right to link their flight from  Beijing to Europe.    If that's not possible, China argued for its unilateral  right  to shuttle from a major Chinese city to Seoul, excluding the  participation of a Korean airline.    None of China's demands is acceptable to Korea since they  violate the basic spirit of "fair and equal opportunities"  evident in all air agreements, according to the official.    He observed that China's demands are based on "fair and  equal  benefits," a typical socialist code but unacceptable in terms of  market-oriented competition.    "At the moment, Korean carriers fly about 70 percent of  passengers using Korea-China chartered flights, while the rest  go to Air China," he said. "If regular flights open, the gap  will be soaring."    He interpreted China's stubborn pursuit of the biased  agreement as being aimed at rectifying the current imbalance of  revenues and nipping in the bud the future runaway gap.    However, he said that some of the imbalance can be corrected  through the negotiations between the two countries' airlines.    "The imbalance of revenues can be tackled through the  consultations between the two countries' airlines, although the  government can't dictate what policies they will take," he said.    Despite Korea's hint at using the Taiwan option, it remains  to be seen whether it will actually use it if the future talks  don't promise much since China is the only remaining upscale  market Korea's airlines can exploit.    In addition, preventing Korea's strong hand is China's  aviation policy that bans airlines flying to Taiwan, from  serving Chinese routes.</p>

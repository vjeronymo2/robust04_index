			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Weary Clinton sets sights on Pacific goals: The President showed new-found enthusiasm for the region at the Apec summit Judging by his haggard looks and weary tones as he delivered his final speech before leaving the Asia-Pacific summit in Seattle at the weekend, one might have thought President Bill Clinton had suffered a dismal week riddled with defeat. In fact, he left the summit as he arrived - riding high. 'Other than being tired, and he is very tired, he is loving it,' a senior administration official said. Mr Clinton came to Seattle fresh from victory in Congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and left after a step towards an ambitious vision of the US as a country that looks not only to the Atlantic but also, perhaps with keener interest, to the Pacific. This vision is rooted in Mr Clinton's desire to place economics at the core of US foreign policy. In his election campaign last year Mr Clinton articulated the belief that US jobs depended on exploiting trading opportunities overseas, but US officials say he did not make a 'gut connection' until the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Tokyo in July. His message sharpened by the Nafta debate, Mr Clinton last week in speeches in Seattle closed the circle between international security policy, international economic policy and domestic economic policy. 'We cannot remain strong abroad unless we are strong at home,' Mr Clinton said. 'Stagnant nations eventually lose the ability to finance military readiness, to afford an activist foreign policy or to inspire allies by their example.' At a time when wealthy nations must become ever more productive to meet competition from both low wage countries and highly skilled countries, the only way they can increase jobs and raise incomes is through expanded trade. 'There is no alternative. No-one has yet made a convincing case that any wealthy country can lower unemployment and raise incomes by closing up its borders. The only way to do it is to expand global growth and to expand each country's fair share of global trade,' Mr Clinton said. This emphasis on export opportunities has led the US inexorably towards the Asia-Pacific region, which is not only by far the fastest growing segment of the world economy but also the area with which the US has the largest trade deficit. Japan and China between them account for more than two thirds of the entire US trade deficit. At the same time, Mr Clinton in Seattle directly linked US military presence in the Pacific and its security treaties with five countries in the region to expanded market access. 'We do not intend to bear the cost of our military presence in Asia and the burdens of regional leadership only to be shut out of the benefits of growth that that stability brings,' he said. The administration is anxious not to snub Europe. The approved formula adopted by even the most Asia-minded US officials, such as Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for the region, is that 'no area will be more important than Asia,' and Mr Clinton himself insisted that Europe remained 'a central partner for the US in security, in foreign policy and in commerce'. But many senior officials can scarcely conceal the feeling that all Europe has to offer them is mature markets with few opportunities for expanded US exports, foreign policy nightmares such as Bosnia, and an unimaginative and backward-looking pessimism. Turning Mr Clinton's new-found enthusiasm for the Pacific into something concrete may prove difficult. In the first place, the administration's approach to realising its goals in the region is largely built on combining divergent policies previously seen as incompatible alternatives: engaging China on trade issues while taking a tough line on human rights; aggressively pursuing bilateral trade initiatives while pressing on with multilateral talks in the Gatt round; seeking to expand its free trade agreements in Asia and Latin America at the same time. 'We want it all,' says Ms Joan Spero, undersecretary of state for economic affairs, while experts from the Bush administration scoff at their successors' inability to set priorities. Second, many Pacific nations - including even those with a more western heritage, such as Australia - resent the US efforts to link its own values, such as human rights, market economics and democracy, to trade. Asian leaders look at a US beset by budget deficits, governmental gridlock and violent crime, and question whether this is a price worth paying for greater democracy. Third, many Asian members of Apec have shown reluctance in Seattle to get sucked into grandiose US schemes for Mr Clinton's 'new Pacific community,' in which Apec could play the same role of anchoring peace and prosperity in Asia that Nato played in weathering the Cold War in Europe. Several countries remained wary of any attempt to institutionalise Apec with larger bureaucracy and more regular meetings. US officials describe these reticences as 'birthing pangs,' and for all their doubts, Apec leaders took several steps in the US's direction. They agreed tariff cuts as a token of sincerity in final Gatt negotiations, accepted the US proposal for a meeting of Apec finance ministers, and agreed on a leaders' summit in Indonesia next year. But the US's Asia vision has a long way to go before, as Mr Clinton hoped, 'future generations may look back and say they can't imagine how the Asian-Pacific region could have thrived in such a spirit of harmony without the existence of Apec'.</p>

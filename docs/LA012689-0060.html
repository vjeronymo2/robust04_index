			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego's Balboa Park wants to spend $6.6 million to  expand its facilities, but various city and private committees must approve the  plans before construction can start. A gift shop, restaurant, rehearsal  facility with rooftop parking and a bricked-in plaza with a fountain are  included. The approval process could take 15 months or longer since a master  plan for the park must first be approved. While the plan has the support of the  neighboring San Diego Museum of Art, the Museum of Man and the San Diego Zoo, a  private planning and lobbying group, Citizens Coordinate for Century III,  opposes the project as an "ad hoc" expansion that is premature until the entire  planning process is complete. Globe managing director Tom Hall concedes that  "we're in the eye of the storm now as far as the Balboa Park Master Plan goes,"  but he added that expansion is critical to the Globe's artistic success and  financial stability.

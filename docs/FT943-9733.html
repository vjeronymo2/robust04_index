			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond yields offer modest boost to Dow Wall Street US share prices edged higher yesterday in quiet trading as an early decline in bond yields provided a modest boost to stock market sentiment, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.79 up at 3,753.81 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 0.80 to 457.89, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.80 at 720.47. New York SE trading volume was low at 217.7m shares. After last week's late sell-off that was prompted by a surge in bond yields, trading was expected to be subdued yesterday. Bond yields had risen on Friday because a stronger than expected July jobs report had raised fears that the Federal Reserve would tighten interest rates again to slow down the economy. When bond yields opened lower in the morning, it provided a lift to equities. A slight firming in the dollar also supported stocks initially but trading activity remained light, with many investors and dealers choosing to stay on the sidelines until later in the week, when July inflation figures are due to be released. Prices, however, held their ground in the face of an upturn in bond yields later in the day. Leading issues were mostly firmer, although gains were kept to a minimum. General Motors was ahead Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 50 3/8 , IBM Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 63 3/8 and Merck Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 30 1/2. North American Mortgage forged ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 30 5/8 in heavy trading after the mortgage banking company revealed that it had asked Morgan Stanley to advise on strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Molecular Biosystems jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 12 3/8 after the US Food and Drug Administration gave final approval for Albunex, the company's flagship product used as a contrast-imaging agent. Canada Toronto stocks ended mixed in moderate trading after a strong showing by the Canadian dollar and bonds failed to carry over to the equity markets. The TSE 300 index gained 6.8 at 4,175.4, but declines outscored rises by 365 to 309. Volume was 53.3m shares. Canadian bonds and currency surged after the release of a survey in Quebec that showed weakening support for the separatist Parti Quebecois in the upcoming provincial election. Venezuela Equities in Caracas showed little reaction to reports that a further crisis in the financial sector could be developing following the suspension from trading of four of the country's banks. The Merinvest composite index closed 1.24, or 1 per cent, down at 124.58. The stock exchange authorities later lifted the suspension from two of the banks. Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the country's finance minister, denied that there was a problem in the banking sector, but added that there could be changes to the boards of directors in some of the banks. Among major stocks, Electricidad de Caracas was down 5 bolivars at 300 bolivars.</p>

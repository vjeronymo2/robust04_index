			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Sumitomo aims to establish securities unit SUMITOMO Trust &amp; Banking will apply to set up a securities dealing subsidiary this autumn, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The bank said in March that the subsidiary was likely to be capitalised at around Y10bn. This level of capital looks set to rise since Sumitomo plans to let the unit engage in government bond trading. Financial reforms allowing banks and brokerages to enter each other's turf through subsidiaries took effect in April. So far, Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Norinchukin Bank, the main agricultural co-operative bank, have set up securities arms. Sumitomo Trust and Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking have said they would join the business in 1993-1994. Japan's big commercial banks are not allowed to set up securities subsidiaries before next July.</p>

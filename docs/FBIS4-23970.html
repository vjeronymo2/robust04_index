			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with interim Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu </F> by Assane Diop in Canada; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Twagiramungu] My position is very clear. I imagine  it is the same as that of most Rwandans. Given the involvement  of France in the Rwandan conflict since 1990 up until the  signing of the peace accord, France should not intervene, even  if the resolution is presented to the UN Security Council.    Second, you yourself know that UNAMIR-2 [UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda] exists, in accordance with UN resolution 918.  This resolution should be implemented.    What we might rather ask of France is to supply the  logistical material so that the 5,500 troops that have been  agreed on can be in Rwanda.    [Diop] In other words, even if the United Nations votes for  the French resolution to send 1,000 French troops, you will not  hear of a physical presence of French troops?    [Twagiramungu] No, indeed. I believe that there are other  countries that would be rather interested in intervention,  countries of the European Union -- there are some of them -- and  other Western countries such as Canada. But, among European  countries, for instance, we can cite the Netherlands, Italy, and  many other countries that are neutral in the Rwandan conflict.  Given French involvement in this conflict, I guess that it would  be necessary for France to be able to make this proposal, but it  should refrain from intervening in any way.    [Diop] However, isn't the French proposal in response to an  emergency?    [Twagiramungu] We do not deny that it is important to  intervene for humanitarian purposes, but for France to take this  initiative...[pauses], but not only must some clarifications be  made, we also fear that this might cause us further problems and  that this might lead us to a conflict of a rather regional  nature.    [Diop] Do you think that this is not negotiable? Don't you  think that, if you meet French officials...[pauses] won't you be  able to reconsider this position? Is it an inflexible position?    [Twagiramungu] What we also reject is the fact that France  often takes such decisions without consulting anyone. We  believe that we are responsible for our country, so, if there  are decisions which can be taken, we should really be consulted,  we should know the procedure used by France.    [Diop] France is carrying out consultations with the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] and seems to intend to do the same with  the government born from the Arusha accord, that is, the  government you should have led. Could you possibly reconsider  your position during negotiations?    [Twagiramungu] I have not been consulted and I don't think  that I can reconsider this decision or this position unless I am  told what is happening. The RPF, the Republican National  Movement for Democracy and Development, and the CDR should not  be the only ones to be consulted: We too are a political force  regrouping the parties which took part in the peace accord.  This is why it would be necessary for us to know what France is  doing. But even if this intervention takes place within the UN  framework -- given French involvement since 1990 and the fact  that the peace accord banned foreign intervention -- it is going  to create many difficulties for us. Other ways should be found.  A country other than France should be involved.    [Diop] Mr. Prime Minister, this will be my last question:  You are rejecting the French solution; we must perhaps wait for  other countries to get possibly involved in this military action  or to make up the 5,500-strong force. Apart from these  uncertain possibilities, what do you suggest now for an end to  the bloodshed?    [Twagiramungu] First, given that UNAMIR-2 has been accepted  by the Security Council in accordance with resolution 918, we  believe that France should rather encourage the other countries  to provide the logistic means so that those African countries  which have agreed to send the troops can do so immediately.  This is what must be done.    Second, if France has taken the decision to influence these  other western countries or even the African countries, it can  also take the initiative to send equipment, that is, the  logistic means, and nothing else.    Third, I believe that there should be respect for the  officials so that they can take part in such a decision aimed at  rescuing the country from the situation where it now finds  itself.</p>

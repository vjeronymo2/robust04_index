			<p>BFN     [Text] Chongqing, 30 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In  recent years, business losses incurred by the state-owned  enterprises continued to plague Chongqing's economic  development. This year, losses incurred by enterprises in  Chongqing have shown a tendency to increase further. The  Federation of Trade Unions in Chongqing is trying to stabilize  the feelings of workers in enterprises that are operating in the  red, and is organizing workers to increase production and carry  out self-salvation in order to free the enterprises from the  mire of business losses.    Chongqing is one of the six largest old industrial bases in  China. As its industrial structure was not adjusted across the  board for a long time, the state-owned enterprises there failed  to achieve satisfactory economic results, and an increasing  number of such enterprises incurred business losses. According  to the data offered by the department concerned in the city, in  January this year, 58.96 percent of the state-owned enterprises  in Chongqing incurred losses, and the proportion increased to  66.94 percent in February, with total losses in the city  amounting to 140 million yuan. The industrial economy there  once again faced the danger of decline.    This year, Chongqing put forward the guideline of "combining  assistance with elimination, taking both radical and stopgap  measures, enlivening assets, and making breakthroughs in various  fields" so as to change the loss-incurring situation. It  planned to make a breakthrough by reforming the property rights  system. Zhang Xuanyuan, chairman of the city's federation of  trade unions, said at a recent meeting on halting business  losses that trade unions in the city should take an active part  in the work of transforming the enterprise operation system, and  should sign joint-guarantee contracts with the enterprise  management and the government departments concerned in order to  perform their duties in the course of halting business losses.    Zhang Xuanyuan said: The trade unions should serve the  purpose of raising the enterprises' competitive power in the  market by means of organizing various types of labor emulation  and encouraging them to raise rationalization proposals. They  should help promote technological progress in the enterprises  through structural adjustment, and should carry out activities  of supporting the poor by means of science and technology.  Zhang Xuanyuan stressed, in particular, that the trade unions  must organize workers to carry out self-salvation through  increased production, thus reducing the burdens on enterprises  and freeing enterprises from their predicament as soon as  possible.</p>

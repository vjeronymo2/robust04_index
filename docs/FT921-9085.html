			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Money Markets: UK rates firm RATES firmed at the short end of the UK money market, as the central bank dealings indicated no immediate change in interest rates. One week money rose to 10- 9/16 per cent. Further out, however, the market was still tentatively hoping for an interest rate cut, with the key three months interbank rate at 10 7/16 - 3/8 per cent. Overnight rates traded at 11 1/4 per cent for most of the day, but closed at 10 7/8 - 5/8 per cent. The March short sterling contract ended one basis point down at 89.80. At that level, the contract still implied a cut in rates by the middle of March. Market rates were pushed up by the Bank of England's measured approach to easing the forecast Pounds 1.35bn shortage. By noon, the Bank had resolved about half of the shortfall, purchasing bills worth Pounds 780m. They included band one bank and treasury, and band two bank paper at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank also offered two repurchase deals at 10 7/16 per cent, which fell due on March 3 and 4. In the afternoon, a further Pounds 115m was injected through band one and two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 440m left the market only Pounds 55m short. Traders said it was significant that the bank had not operated in band three or four paper, which tends to be slightly cheaper. 'It is as if the Bank is saying: Steady as she goes, 10 1/2 is here to stay for a while,' said a senior trader. Most of the overall shortage - Pounds 922m  - was due to repurchase agreements falling due. Treasury paper and maturing assistance accounted for Pounds 283m, while exchequer transactions added Pounds 205m back into the market. Bankers' balances below target and a rise in note circulation took out Pounds 245m. Tomorrow is expected to be another expensive day in the money markets, said one senior trader. A generous DM2.4bn securities repurchase agreement from the Bundesbank helped to ease call money in Germany from 9.55/65 per cent to 9.50/60 per cent. In the US, the Federal Reserve exercised a matched sale-purchase agreement while rates were trading at 3 7/8 per cent. The presumed Fed target is 4 per cent, and yesterday's action signalled no change in monetary policy. Market sentiment is turning from an expectation of a reduction in the funds rate to a more measured wait-and-see approach, said many dealers.</p>

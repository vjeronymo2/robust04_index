			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Southern Electric Southern Electric's decision to postpone its results until mid-December is good for transparency. By then the market should have clearer idea of the regulator's thinking on the vexed issue of electricity supply contracts. With an interest in three gas-fired generation projects, Southern is arguably the most exposed of all the regional companies. One danger is that Professor Littlechild may decide to put gas-fired power to the test of the market by denying Southern the right to pass on higher costs to customers. The company would then have to swallow the difference between the electricity pool price and the cost of gas-fired power. The cost of gas-fired power is, of course, at the heart of the argument. Yet if independent estimates are anything to go by, shareholders have not much reason to flinch. Southern's Barking power project is reckoned to produce electricity at around 2.8p per kilowatt hour. With the pool price currently at 2.5p, covering the difference would have only a minor impact. The damage would get worse if the pool price declined. But even on worst-case sums Southern's profit would be cut by little more than 15 per cent. Dividend growth would be secure, although cover might fall from around 3 times to 2.5 times. Little wonder that the shares have enjoyed strong support despite the uncertainty. Southern will, however, have won no friends among cash-hungry fund managers by pushing its dividend payment into the New Year. That alone may explain the 2 per cent fall in the shares last week on the day the results were postponed.</p>

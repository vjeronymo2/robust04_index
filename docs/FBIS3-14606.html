Shahin, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--an Islamist/leftist coalition Monday [28  March] marked the one-month anniversary of the Hebron massacre  by calling on Arab and Muslim governments to pull out of peace  negotiations with Israel.    "We, together with the Arab masses, must continue to exert  pressure on the Arab regimes and the Palestine Liberation  Organisation to give up the policy of surrender and stop their  negotiations with the Zionist entity," read a joint statement  issued by the two Jordanian political parties, the Islamic  Action Front (IAF) and the National Action Front (NAF).    "Our conflict with the Zionist enemy is the struggle over  existence not over borders," said the statement.    The coalition leaders, which include IAF Secretary General  Ishaq al-Farhan and former leftist radicals Muhammad al-Zu'bi,  Naji Allush and Breik Hadid, asked the "Arab nation to resist  all attempts of normalisation with the Zionist enemy," during a  joint press conference."    "We warn the Arab regimes and the Arab League of the dangers  inherent in lifting the boycott of the Zionist entity," read  their joint statement. To lift the boycott, said the group,  would constitute the imposition of further "Zionist domination  and occupation."    The coalition, also known as the United Front, said it held  the media partially responsibly for supporting the peace process.    "We call on the free and honest press to shoulder its  responsibilities in highlighting the plight of Palestine and to  actively counter normalisation policies in all their forms as  well as to expose the cheap writers promoting normalisation with  the Zionist enemy," said the statement.    The IAF, recognised as Jordan's most powerful political  party, and NAF a relatively new political party, announced that  they were "coalition partners" in early March. Their declared  aim is to "resist Zionist designs and new world order strategies  to disrupt the Middle East region," according to IAF Secretary  General Ishaq al-Farhan.    The NAF, which only received official political party  licence  in January, is composed mostly of hardline pan-Arab nationalist  parties and groups, many of whom were outlawed in Jordan before  democratic reforms were introduced in 1989.    The coalition between the two parties was formed after the  February killing of worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron  and the subsequent attack on a Maronite church in Lebanon.    The two parties declared that they had an "historic  responsibility" to work together to actively oppose the  normalisation of Arab countries with Israel.</p>

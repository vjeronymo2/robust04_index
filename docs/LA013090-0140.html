			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> FORD AEROSPACE OFFICIALS WORK ON MANAGEMENT-LED, LEVERAGED BUYOUT  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co.'s efforts to sell its Ford Aerospace subsidiary haven't yielded  concrete results yet, but several executives of the Newport Beach-based company  are working on a management-led leveraged buyout, a company spokeswoman  confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> It could not be learned exactly who was involved, but sources say that the  group will find it difficult to raise money for such a buyout in the current  economic climate.  </P> <P> Prices for the so-called junk bonds used to finance leveraged buyouts have  plummeted as one-time highfliers -- including retailer Robert Campeau -- buckle  under huge debt burdens.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ford Aerospace formally announced some good news Monday: it has  received a $220-million contract to provide Chaparral antiaircraft missiles to  the Egyptian military. The award carried the highest dollar value of any in the  history of the Newport Beach-based Aeronutronic division, considered to be the  weakest of Ford Aerospace's far-flung operations.  </P> <P> But though such foreign sales generally carry high profit margins, Aeronutronic  is hardly out of the woods. About half the money will flow to the six  subcontractors who also are involved in the four-year contract. Compiled by  Jonathan Weber, Times Staff Writer  </P></p>

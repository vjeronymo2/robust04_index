			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Guatemalan Army stands ready to begin joint  military operations with Mexican military forces to counter the  guerrilla uprising in Chiapas, as long as agreements to the  effect exist between the governments of both nations, Armed  Forces Spokesperson Edith Vargas de Marroquin said yesterday.    Although she recognized that the Mexican Army is  well-organized and is capable enough to face and quell the  rebels' actions launched on 1 January, the military spokesperson  said that Guatemala could provide some logistical support, if  requested by authorities of the neighboring country.    The statements by the military spokesperson came as news  agencies reported that Mexican soldiers were approaching the  Guatemalan border (10 km away) to counter the actions of the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN).    Vargas de Marroquin explained that since the fighting in  Chiapas began Salinas de Gortari's government has not officially  informed them of the events, but Army units patrol the border  areas to prevent any eventuality.    Regarding a possible entry of Mexican troops into Guatemalan  territory, the officer explained she does not think that may  happen, although Guatemalan soldiers have sometimes entered the  neighboring country, chasing members of clandestine groups, the  participation of which in the Zapatist movement has not yet been  confirmed.  <H5>  Concern over the PMA [Mobile Military Police] </H5>   Vargas de Marroquin also stated that the military forces  have  expressed their great concern over recent bank robberies,  because police investigations indicate that members of the PMA  are involved.    To avoid that situation, Vargas de Marroquin added, the Army  has decided to review each of the contracts, as well as the  weapons of agents assigned to the security of private  enterprises. In addition, the military officer said that  Obdulio Carias Garcia, who died in the robbery of Banco Uno,  located in Vista Hermosa, was one of the security agents.    Eustaquio Ramos Vasquez and Pilar Florian Cordero, who were  arrested the evening of 12 January, the National Police have  reported, also participated in that action. The Information and  Press Department of the Army (DIDE) has confirmed those  individuals are PMA members.</p>

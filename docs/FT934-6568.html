			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / The vexed question of fund measurement The dogged resistance of British actuaries to the hegemony of the American financial theorists continued this week with the publication of a paper on the measurement of portfolio managers' skills. 'Disciples of modern portfolio theory have confused risk with volatility or variability,' says the paper by Nick Day, Sos Green and Jack Plymen. The three prefer a quite different concept which they dub 'embedded risk' and which they define as the risk that shares deliver investment returns which are lower than expected. The arguments have gone on for a long time. Two or three years ago one of the founding fathers of MPT, Harry Markowitz, who produced his original thesis in 1952, and his classic book Portfolio Selection in 1959, was brave enough to attend a debate at the Faculty of Actuaries in Edinburgh. He was courteous, but declined to agree that he should redraft his theory which used the variance of the mean as a measure of the risk. It all depends, of course, on what you are trying to achieve. Americans are much more impressed by the importance and the validity of short-term market values, which explains why they are so obsessed with the quality of financial reporting, with control of insider trading and so on. Outside America many investment practitioners believe that market values are too volatile and unreliable to form the basis for long-term decisions. British actuaries, for instance, have developed concepts of smoothed market values. When they assess the solvency of life assurance companies or pension schemes they value the assets and liabilities on a long-term basis. Hence their lack of comprehension of the US approach. Short-term price volatility has no place in the valuation basis of UK pension funds. For the same reason, the idea that treasury bills are somehow 'riskless' assets seems bizarre. Their short-term volatility of returns may be negligible but they certainly do not amount to a riskless way of financing salary-linked pension liabilities. But how on earth can you assess whether some shares will achieve targeted returns with more certainty than others? According to MPT, when markets are efficient it is impossible to achieve excess returns through stockpicking. Yet even the American academics have moved away to an increasing extent from extreme views about market efficiency. The academic debate these days is more about the degree to which inefficiency exists and can be exploited. Management techniques in an efficient market should differ from those where inefficiency exists to a significant degree. The three actuaries, however, go much further. They say: 'With the enormously improved statistical background and the increased power of computerised analysis we suggest that it is now possible to find shares that are exceptionally cheap and liable to outperform the market over a reasonable period.' This is a controversial claim. The power of computers can work both ways: you can argue that the more numbers are being crunched the more efficient the market's pricing ought to be. The authors' proof comes down to the performance of two equity funds, one the small portfolio of a professional society and the other the much larger fund of a Perpetual unit trust, the American Growth Fund. Both were monitored for a year, and the first outperformed its benchmark slightly, the second by a handsome margin. The authors admit that two portfolios tracked over one year have no statistical significance. The Perpetual fund does not appear to be a very suitable example because turnover during the year was more than 100 per cent; presumably the managers were very good at spotting short-term trading opportunities, but has this much to do with the risk that shares will fail to meet long-term targets? Surely fund performance should be tracked at least over the full course of a market cycle, including both bull and bear markets, before the portfolio managers' risks and skills can be properly assessed. British actuaries can be guilty of short-termism after all.</p>

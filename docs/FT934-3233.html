			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 2.3% as political, economic worries grow Increasing worries over the political and economic outlook left share prices substantially lower on the day. But they closed well above their worst after comments by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, indicating concern over the recent drop in share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225-issue average fell by 2.3 per cent after fluctuating in technical trading, finishing 395.54 down at 16,507.95, and the Topix index of all first section stocks weakened 24.07, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,396.54. The Nikkei looked steady at the opening, registering the day's best level of 16,892.59. It plunged later on arbitrage unwinding ahead of tomorrow's settlements of December futures and options contracts, hitting a low of 16,216.82. Index-linked buying towards the end of the session, prompted by rumours of an imminent discount rate cut and Mr Hosokawa's comment that Japan must take every possible step to help stock prices, lifted equities, helping the Nikkei to recoup some of its loss; and in London, later, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 8.80 to 1,145.79. Volume totalled 270m shares, against 217m. Declines led rises by 831 to 190, with 137 issues remaining unchanged. Fears over the delay in the announcement of economic stimulus discouraged investors. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y19,000 to Y685,000 and East Japan Railway slipped Y9,000 to Y413,000. Other railway shares were also weak, with Keisei Electric Railway down Y13 to Y788. Bank shares were lower on index selling. Industrial Bank of Japan retreated Y80 to Y2,780 and Fuji Bank lost Y70 at Y1,820. However, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank gained Y2 at Y482 on bargain hunting. The bank, a main creditor of Kabuto Decom, a property developer, has met heavy selling recently on the arrest of the president of the company. Steel issues lost ground on profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, receded Y8 to Y296 and Kawasaki Steel shed Y7 to Y299. High-technology blue chips were also weak, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y20 to Y1,410 and Toshiba dipping Y5 to Y641. Reports that Eisai, a pharmaceutical maker, will conduct final clinical tests for a cure for Alzheimer's disease pushed the stock up Y30 to Y1,790. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 371.58 to 18,334.21 in volume of 24.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, relinquished Y140 at Y6,360. Roundup Records continued to be set in the Pacific Rim markets, although profit-taking also emerged. HONG KONG ended marginally higher after a day of see-saw trading in which the Hang Seng index clawed its way back from an early 91-point loss as investors await the results of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group meeting which ends today. The index closed 13.66 higher at a record 9,750.23, after rising a cumulative 442 points in the previous two days. Turnover fell to HKDollars 6.46bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 9.76bn. MANILA remained at a record high, fuelled by an overnight rise by PLDT on Wall Street, but profit-taking pared some of the early gains. The composite index closed a net 9.92 ahead at 2,518.92 after posting a 46-point gain within the first 30 minutes of trading. PLDT advanced 25 pesos to 1,875 pesos, mirroring a Dollars 2 3/8 rise to Dollars 64 7/8 in New York. AUSTRALIA moved sharply forward in response to strong commodity prices coupled with heavy demand for News Corp. The All Ordinaries index added 22.1 at 2,096.0. SEOUL rebounded strongly after Tuesday's correction. The composite stock index moved up 13.54 points to 836.71 in heavy turnover of Won1,100bn. BOMBAY saw hectic buying by foreign investors and speculators in market leaders push the local index beyond the 3,300-point mark to a new 1993 high, although profit-taking in kerb deals left prices off their best levels. The BSE 30 index ended 78.53, or 2.4 per cent, ahead at 3,310.24. Cadbury India, a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes, of the UK, rose Rs35, or 12.1 per cent, to Rs325 amid market rumours that Jardine Fleming plans to buy heavily into the company. KARACHI broke records amid heavy buying of blue chips as brokers injected a backlog of orders into the market after two local holidays. The KSE 100 index soared 62.57, or 3.5 per cent, to 1,853.45 in volume of 4.6m. The rise is attributed to continuing confidence that the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, has brought badly needed political stability, writes Farhan Bokhari in Faisalabad. In addition, some companies involved in the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, as well as those in the financial sector, are expected to reveal higher profits than last year when they announce their results next month. NEW ZEALAND finished a moderately active session higher amid strong foreign demand for forestry shares. The NZSE-40 capital index put on 9.69 at 2,097.26. TAIWAN edged ahead in heavy, volatile trade, and the weighted index firmed 8.51 to 4,692.11 in TDollars 50.52bn turnover. SINGAPORE gave way to profit-taking in blue chips after Tuesday's record close, and the Straits Times Industrial index dipped 4.33 to 2,159.21. KUALA LUMPUR closed easier as profit-taking erased early gains. The composite index lost 2.46 at 1,060.79, ending a six-day rising streak which saw the index add 91.15. BANGKOK edged lower on profit-taking in bank shares in active trade. The SET index softened 5.64 to 1,436.92 in heavy turnover of Bt23.44bn.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hints of Hydro move Rumours swept the market late yesterday that Scottish Hydro had called a meeting of analysts for this morning, triggering speculation that it may announce it will accept the terms of the recent regulatory review rather than ask for a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Hydro shares underperformed the rest of the electricity stocks as the rumours circulated, closing unchanged at 313p, contrasting with a 7 gain to 349p in Scottish Power and good gains in the English generators. Hydro shares have underperformed the market by 10 per cent since the Offer review last month, as some analysts have adopted the view that the package would damage Hydro's dividend growth prospects.</p>

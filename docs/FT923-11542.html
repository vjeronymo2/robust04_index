			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television THE Kirghiz came to the Prophet Mohammed late in history, and it seems they did not take tremendously to his message. From Marx to the Market (C4, 7.20) is the last in the splendid series on Central Asia, The Crescent and the Star. What can a scriptwriter do these days to make a detective different? Aristocratic, black, oriental, disabled, female. . . we've seen them all. Virtual Murder which starts tonight (BBC1, 9.30) comes up with an academic with time on his hands - a rare bird these days. But then, he is a criminal psychologist, which should give him a head start. Glyndebourne Gala (BBC2, 8.30) presents a star-studded list of artists, including Frederica von Stade, Ruggiero Raimondi and Felicity Lott, singing a rag-bag of arias to mark the last night in the old opera-house. And opportunity for Glyndebourne habitues to shed a sentimental tear, and for the rest of us to wonder what all the fuss is about. If you own a place across the Channel and want to upgrade from Bizzy Lizzies, try Le Manoir (C4, 9.30), which relates how 8 acres in Brittany were transformed into an English garden.</p>

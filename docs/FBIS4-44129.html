			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark completed his lightning visit to Cyprus  yesterday declaring that "there is no change in the situation to  report."    This means that [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas  continues to reject the final U.N. paper on the confidence  building measures of March 21, which has been described by the  U.N. Secretary-General as fair and balanced and as offering  advantages to both sides.    Clark's visit was clearly the result of the intense pressure  exerted by Washington and London to resolve the deadlock and so  avert the adoption of the U.N. Secretary-General's report which  blames the "lack of political will" by the Turkish side for the  failure of the talks.    Despite the clearcut conclusion of Butrus Butrus-Ghali the  British and the Americans continue to credit Denktas with the  will to reach an agreement. The point is, what kind of  agreement? Clearly not the one hammered out by the U.N.  officials as a compromise, which no matter how painful and  controversial, has been accepted as is by President Glavkos  Kliridhis as yet another sacrifice by the Greek Cypriot side for  the sake of reaching an agreement as long last.    The Turkish side, however, is clearly not satisfied with the  occupation of north Cyprus, the expulsion of the Greek Cypriot  population through a major ethnic cleansing operation, and the  illegal usurpation of the refugees' properties.    It has the effrontery not only to mock the Security Council  by refusing to implement any of its numerous resolutions on  Cyprus, but insists in effect on the legitimisation of its  criminal actions.    The tragedy of the Cyprus story is that the major powers,  particularly the United States, acting on the basis of its own  global interests, and the once-upon-a-time imperial Britain,  which is only too happy to see the continuation of the island's  division, even through it is a guarantor of its territorial  integrity and independence, both refuse to sanction any action  that would force Turkey to behave.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd declared this week  that there was a chance of "decisive progress," adding that the  stone has been pushed almost to the top of the mountain and  should not be allowed to roll down again.    Would this were truly so. Regretfully, as President  Kliridhis pointed out yesterday, the differences, resulting from  the Turkish rejection of the U.N. document are substantial, and  "becoming worse," as a result of the insatiable appetite of the  Turkish side to ask for more and more, which keeps growing as  long as the Security Council continues to take no action to see  that its resolutions do not remain hollow words.    As Kliridhis pointed out in connection with Hurd's  assessment  that agreement was so close, why doesn't the British minister  then persuade Denktas to accept the "fair and balanced" March 21  document?    It remains to be seen now whether the Security Council will,  finally, take a stand, by closing the long-drawn-out efforts by  successive secretary-generals of the U.N., which have led  nowhere due to the lack of political will by the Turkish side,  and at long last demand that Turkey implements the U.N.  resolutions on Cyprus without further delay.    If the Council succumbs to Anglo-American pressure, as it  has  been doing ever since the 1974 invasion, and once more chooses  to do nothing concrete, ignoring Butrus-Ghali's call for the  adoption of alternative ways, Cyprus will be left with no option  but to rethink its strategy and tactics which have so far been  based solely on the clearly pointless U.N.-sponsored negotiation.</p>

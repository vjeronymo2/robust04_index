			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Observer: Trivial pursuit Meanwhile, after the toppling of Brazil's president, Fernando Collor, Brazilians can spend the festivities seeing whether they can do any better by playing a board game devised by a Rio professor. Looking as if it is destined to be the country's best-selling present, the game is called Casa da Dinda after Collor's house, which was the centre of much of the corruption scandal that ousted him. Players have the choice of following corrupt or ethical paths with a view to being first to win the presidency and keep it. Among hazards en route are love affairs between ministers, a symbolic sea of mud, and battles with the ever-present inflationary dragon. Temptations include kickbacks from government contracts which players can use to buy flats in Paris and Babylonian gardens a la Collor, while the ultimate obstacle comes in the shape of a vengeful brother determined to destroy everything.</p>

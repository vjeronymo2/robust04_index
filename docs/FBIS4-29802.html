			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "A Cornor of Society" column: "Being Wavering, </F> One Cannot Be King!"]    [Text] First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen are the  leaders to whom the people throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia  have given their unconditional trust in taking care of their  survival.    The people do not want any other people to become prime  minister or deputy prime minister. Those people will be able to  do so only after they stage a successful coup.    The people are confident that only these two prime ministers  are able to prevent the return of the genocidal regime because  they know the true nature of the Khmer Rouge much better than  the Khmer Rouge themselves.    As for His Majesty the King, we would like him to abide by  the nation's Constitution because deviating from it will only  bring trouble. The Constitution does not allow Your Majesty to  hold power. So, please just sit still. As king, you should not  waver.    KAOH SANTEPHEAP is still unconditionally sincere to the King  and the Royal Government.    But please stop negotiating with the Khmer Rouge. They are  vanishing, are they not?</p>

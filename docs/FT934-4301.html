			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Tory unease grows over 7% rise in council tax Unease among Conservative MPs and councillors intensified yesterday over the rise in council tax of about 7 per cent expected after this week's financial settlement for local authorities. Some Conservatives in London fear that higher bills could undermine the party's electoral prospects in local elections next May, soon after the new council tax bills are delivered - several London boroughs have been subjected to steep cuts in the grant they receive. One Conservative MP said London had been used as a 'milch cow' for the rest of the country in the new settlement, announced on Thursday. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, predicted disaster for the Conservatives in the local elections around the country. Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North, whose local authority sustained the 10th greatest cut in standard spending assessment, said the expected rises were 'a very serious matter' when inflation was 1.7 per cent and the government was planning to freeze the public-sector pay bill. 'This is another way of raising taxes and it won't be popular in the run up to the elections,' he said. Brent was captured by the Conservatives from Labour in the last local elections in 1990. Wandsworth, a Conservative stronghold which suffered one of the sharpest cuts, was confident that its council tax would remain 'lower than average' thanks to the buffering grant given by the government to authorities which lost heavily. The borough would not rule out cuts in services. Mrs Kathy Tracey, a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, described the package as 'very worrying for Conservative boroughs'. Finance experts for the local authority associations predicted that average council tax bills would be in line with government predictions, thanks to new measures for capping council budgets, which are tighter than ever. Mr David Congdon, Conservative MP for Croydon North East, said that the decision to cut the budget for transitional relief from the poll tax to council tax from Pounds 380m to Pounds 130m next year could mean 'much higher bills'. Other London boroughs expected swingeing cuts in services to meet government targets, with Hammersmith and Fulham predicting a cut of about Pounds 5m. After cuts of Pounds 40m over the past two years, the council suggested it would be difficult to make further cuts without job losses. Leicester City Council, the largest non-metropolitan authority in England, suffered a severe cut in its spending assessment, and must cut its budget to stay within the government cap. The city's SSA has been reduced by Pounds 6.4m. Mr Don Grant, director of resources, said that over the next two years Leicester would have to reduce spending by 12.5 per cent and this would cost jobs 'in hundreds rather than tens'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOCAL GOVERNMENT GRANTS (UNADJUSTED INCREASE %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP WINNERS                        TOP LOSERS Brentwood         35.93            Slough           -13.74 Tewkesbury        29.63            Leicester        -13.73 South Bucks       28.30            Blackburn        -11.52 NE Derbys         25.83            Luton            -10.18 Ashfield          24.83            Burnley           -9.54 East Dorset       23.43            Wandsworth        -9.26 Three Rivers      23.35            Ipswich           -8.97 Blyth Valley      22.56            Hammersmith       -8.88 Basildon          22.33            Hyndburn          -8.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures show change in government's estimated total standard spending, 1993-94 to 1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: AMA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SPACE SHUTTLE: THE QUEST CONTINUES BY GEORGE TORRES  (PRESIDIO PRESS: $12.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> George Torres writes about the U.S. Space Program and the shuttle program in  particular with the relentless boosterism of a used-car salesman describing the  bargains on his lot. He ignores the questions about overspecialization raised  by critics of the shuttle, much as he ignores the enormous and, in the opinion  of many experts, insurmountable problems of creating a functional SDI system.  The illustrations help redeem the text, especially the photographs from the  Apollo missions, which recall the excitement and hope that galvanized the  nation only 20 years ago.  </P></p>

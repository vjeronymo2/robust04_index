			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tariq Abu-Hamdan: "Eastern Sector"] </F>   [Excerpts] According to reports being disseminated by  Lahdist militia circles, the Israeli army will probably carry  out a limited withdrawal from the areas of Hasbayya and Jazzin  and retreat to the area controlled by the militia during the  reign of former militia Commander Sa'd Haddad and that was  called "Free Lebanon" before the Israeli invasion in 1982.    Pro-Israel militia men report that the occupation army  intends to withdraw from Hasbayya and Jazzin, where the Israeli  army has been the target of fierce resistance attacks. This  step will enable the Israeli army to keep away from the  Hizballah-controlled combat line extending between Iqlim  al-Tuffah and Western al-Biqa'. The Israeli army will create a  3-8 km wide buffer zone that will separate the expected Israel  withdrawal point and the resistance positions. Israel's  objective behind this step is to cancel the combat line, explore  whether the Lebanese Army can fill the vacuum should withdrawal  occur, and control security in the area. It will also  demonstrate Israel's good intentions during the upcoming  peaceful negotiations and exploit it on the international level.    Observers believe that the Israeli occupation army's  withdrawal from Kawkaba, which overlooks the western al-Biqa'  and the liberated area in Hasbayya, is a basic step toward the  Israeli withdrawal from the areas of Hasbayya and Jazzin and  toward placing them under the full control of the Lahdist  militia. The Lahdist militia has become more convinced that the  Israeli occupation army is using it as a buffer to protect its  presence inside the Lebanese territory. The observers also  believe that the Israeli army views the militia as a burden  restricting its freedom of options in the ongoing negotiations,  especially as the militia cannot be legitimized or accepted on  the Lebanese official and popular stance. Lebanon cannot even  bargain over this militia's being a traitor and collaborating  with the enemy. Accordingly, this issue plays a major role in  the continuing desertion of many militia members.    Security sources affirm that the Lebanese army is fully  prepared to fill any vacuum that might occur because of a sudden  Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted]    The security sources do not rule out that Israel might  effect  its partial withdrawal during the next three months, especially  if a tangible progress is made on the issue of negotiations  concerning what is called "Hasbayya and Jazzin First." Could  this Israeli option be accepted by Lebanon?</p>

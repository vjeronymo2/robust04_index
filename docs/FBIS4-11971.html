			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri received in  Beirut today, Majid 'Izzu Ruhaybani, the Syrian minister of  reconstruction and building, and his delegation who arrived in  Beirut this morning.    Talks centered on bilateral relations, historical links, and  existing ties between the two countries and ways to bolster them  to realize joint aims and interests.    In a statement to reporters, the minister emphasized  continued Syrian support of Lebanon's march to entrench its  national unity, rebuild it, and support its struggle to liberate  its occupied territory.    The minister said: At President Hafiz al-Asad's  instructions, Syria is always prepared--prompted by its  brotherly feelings--to implement any projects by Syrian general  construction companies if Lebanon needs them. Ruhaybani alluded  to schools constructed in southern Lebanon by Syrian companies  in cooperation with the higher committee in support of the  south. He said: We are prepared to contribute to reconstructing  Lebanon within the framework of the close brotherly cooperation  between the two countries.    This afternoon, Ruhaybani and his delegation held meetings  with Dr. Hasan Yusuf, head of the council of the south, and the  council's members. They discussed joint work to implement  services projects being implemented in southern Lebanon by joint  financing of the Syrian committee of solidarity with the people  of the south and by the council of the south. Discussion also  dealt with aspects of future cooperation and ways to support the  people of southern Lebanon and western al-Biqa' to confront the  repeated and bestial Israeli attacks.    Dr. Hasan Yusuf, chairman of the council of the south,  praised Syria's continuous assistance to the people of the  south, under President Hafiz al-Asad, to ensure the means of  their steadfastness in the face of the Israeli occupation.</p>

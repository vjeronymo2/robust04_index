			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Strong first quarter for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab, the San Francisco-based retail broker, has confounded gloomy predictions for stockbrokers' first-quarter profits. It indicated that its earnings per share had risen by 10 per cent in the period, to 66 cents. Schwab, which specialises in low-cost dealing services, added that the amount of share trading it handles had not fallen in recent weeks, despite the decline in US stock and bond prices, and that volumes continue to be 'robust'. In January, Mr Charles Schwab, chairman, warned that first-quarter earnings were unlikely to match the exceptionally strong first three months of 1993. But yesterday, Schwab said full figures to be published later this month would show net income of Dollars 39m, or 66 cents a share, against Dollars 35.4m, or 60 cents, in the earlier period. Schwab handled an average of 33,000 trades a day during the quarter, up from 29,700. The company's shares jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 28 3/4 on the news, before falling back to Dollars 28 by late morning in New York.</p>

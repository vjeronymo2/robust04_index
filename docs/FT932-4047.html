			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Court threat to Nigerian poll A NIGERIAN high court yesterday ordered the National Electoral Commission not to hold tomorrow's presidential election until it heard a suit filed by a group calling for extended military rule, Reuter reports from Abuja. 'I hereby issue an order restraining NEC from conducting the presidential election on June 12 pending the determination of the substantive suit,' Justice Bassey Ikpeme told the court in Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital. Justice Ikpeme gave the ruling after hearing an application for an interim injunction from the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN). The ABN is asking the court to make President Ibrahim Babangida extend his rule until 1997, saying that civilian politicians are not ready to govern Africa's most populous nation.</p>

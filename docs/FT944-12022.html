			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Observer: What am I bid? Bob Bauman, former chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, may have been known as 'Mr Restructuring' in the drugs industry, but British Aerospace shareholders were left wondering yesterday whether he needed some restructuring himself, after getting rather mixed-up about BAe's bid for submarine-maker VSEL. Urging shareholders to back the group's bid for the Barrow-based shipbuilder, BAe's new two-day-a-week chairman said the offer was worth 'Dollars 14 a share'. 'You mean pounds, not dollars,' shouted one investor from the back of the ballroom. Hardly had he corrected himself, when another shareholder put him right again. 'GEC has bid Pounds 14 a share, not BAe.' Apologising, the mastermind of the Beecham and SmithKline Beckman merger quipped 'this was my first time at this sort of thing'. But not the last, eh?</p>

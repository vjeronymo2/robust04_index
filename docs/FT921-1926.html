			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Carrying over capital gains I HAVE made quite a lot of capital losses this year. When I have off-set my gains is it permissible to carry any remaining losses on for use in another year? If so for how many years? Yes, until you die. Ask your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet on capital gains tax, CGT14. This tends to over-simplify the intricate and arbitrary rules, but it is quite good as a starting point. In particular, we have maintained that the rules laid down by Parliament for the deduction of past year's allowable losses are more generous than the rules laid down by the Board of Inland Revenue in the official instruction book for tax inspectors. This point has not yet been decided in the courts, unfortunately, because of the cost of fighting the Inland Revenue up to the House of Lords. In the case of a Mrs Schofield, for example, who sold antiques which she had inherited before 1965, the question arose as to whether time-appointment should be done before indexation (as most professional advisers and lawyers consider) or afterwards (as the Revenue instruction book says). Mrs Schofield won before a Special Commissioner, but lost in the High Court; she won in the Court of Appeal, but - even though the three judges in that Court were unanimous in dismissing the Revenue's arguments - the Board has insisted on taking the case to the House of Lords. One can scarcely be blamed for wondering sometimes whether the Board is incapable of accepting the idea that it is not infallible as an interpreter of the words approved by MPs in Acts of Parliament. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

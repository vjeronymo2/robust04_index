			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The bribery scandal  involving a major construction firm will deal additional damage  to the already tainted image of Japan's big contractors and  hence to their balance sheets, industry sources said Friday [11  March]. The sources said the arrest of former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura earlier in the day will further hurt  Kajima Corp., which allegedly bribed him, as well as other major  contractors.    The tarnished image of these dominant players in the sector,  involved in this and other scandals, has already driven many  customers away. Worse still, the revelation of the malpractices  comes at a time when construction orders had already sunk to a  nadir.    Some industry officials, however, saw at least one benefit  of  the scandal. An executive at a second-tier contractor said,  "because of this scandal, politicians will refrain from  demanding bribes from us in the future."    "So far, we could not but give them bribes because they  would  cause us troubles unless we did so," he said.</p>

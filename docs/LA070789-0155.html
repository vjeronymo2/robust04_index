			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FEW LOSERS MIGHT CLEAN UP ETHICS MESS  </P> <P> When Tony Coelho announced his plans to resign from the House of  Representatives, I spent a few days considering whether to run in the special  election to fill his post.  </P> <P> I decided not to, mainly because I figured I couldn't win. (It's not that I'm  all that unpopular. It's just that in a big part of the district I'm not known  well enough to be unpopular.) But there was another reason, one that continues  to trouble me: To get elected to Congress today, you have to play the game that  created this whole "ethics" mess.  </P> <P> There's a lot wrong with American politics right now. Here is the short list:  </P> <P>  -- The absolute dominance of money in the political world.  </P> <P>  -- The pervasiveness of career politicians, who are obsessed with survival and  lack the wisdom and independence that come from having experience and a source  of livelihood outside the world of politics.  </P> <P>  -- The superficiality of news coverage and the inability of the media to let  an issue take time to develop. The immediacy of television turns every problem,  from pit bulls to freeway shootings, into a crisis requiring an instant  solution.  </P> <P>  -- The emergence of special interest groups and one-issue constituencies.  </P> <P>  -- The end-justifies-the-means mentality of many political consultants,  leading to cheap-shot attacks and misleading advertising in campaigns.  </P> <P>  -- The virtual elimination of privacy for elected officials.  </P> <P> The most troublesome of these is the first one. Tony Coelho probably did as  much as any one person to marry up big money with the Democratic Party; in the  old days, Fat Cats gave primarily to the Republicans. But Coelho made the  rather compelling argument that if you really want bang for your political  bucks, it's not very wise to ignore the party that controls Congress.  </P> <P> This new arrangement did several things: It upped the ante in congressional  campaigns. Total spending on House and Senate races went from $72 million in  1974 to $471.4 million in 1986. Political action committee contributions rose  during the same period, $8.5 million to $132.2 million.  </P> <P> There were other results of the link between money and politics. Job security  of incumbent Democrats was enhanced; in the meantime, the idealism of the  Democratic Party was drained as the connection between contributions and public  policy tightened. Then congressional Democrats began to distance themselves  from everyday people and started running around with a wealthier crowd. All of  a sudden that $89,500 salary didn't seem like so much -- and taking honoraria  from special interests to augment the family income seemed more justifiable.  </P> <P> I've never felt comfortable with this new style of politics. So when Tony  Coelho resigned, I thought this might be an ideal opportunity for me, another  Democrat, to offer a new approach -- especially with all the national attention  focused on the issue of ethics.  </P> <P> But the problem is that if you want to change Congress, you first have to get  elected. And there's the rub: To get elected, you have to raise a ton of money  and then do a mass-merchandising-type campaign. (In the special primary  election to replace Coelho, if you were a candidate, you would need to hustle  about $200,000 in six weeks, which would be used on TV spots that say you're  not like those money-grubbers in Washington.)  </P> <P> You enter the system hoping to change it -- and then realize that the price of  entry was the compromise of the very ideals that motivated your candidacy in  the first place.  </P> <P> If you try to run a different kind of campaign (no contributions over $100 or  no TV ads, for instance), you lose -- and probably look silly in the process.  But that is what it may take to break down the money-game style of politics. It  may take people who are willing to lose a few for the cause -- and suffer the  embarrassment of being branded a "loser" or (and this is even worse in the  political world) a "nonplayer." After a few years out in the vineyard, their  message might get through to the voters.  </P> <P> In order to make ethics fever go away, the House of Representatives will  probably adopt new rules regarding honoraria and conflicts of interest. But the  real problem gets back to the voters themselves. Will they refuse to be taken  in by slick, superficial, misleading campaigns? And will they rebel against the  money-driven system that protects incumbents and rewards candidates who play  ball with special interests?  </P> <P> Until they do, they should know that new members of Congress will have made the  same compromises and gone through the same rite of initiation as the current  members.  </P></p>

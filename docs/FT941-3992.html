			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Algerian raid frees militants Algerian security forces at the weekend sought at least 900 prisoners, mostly Islamic militants, freed by a 150-strong commando in the most daring armed operation in the country's two years of internal violence, writes Francis Ghiles. The raid on the fortified Tazult prison, 400km south-east of Algiers, supports evidence that much of Algeria is beyond the control of the armed forces.</p>

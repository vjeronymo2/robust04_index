			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: PRYOR FINALLY GETS GO-AHEAD, KNOCKS OUT JONES IN 3  </P> <P> Aaron Pryor, the former junior welterweight champion, returned to boxing for  the first time in 17 months Wednesday night and knocked out Daryl Jones at 1:15  of the third round at Madison, Wis., ending a day which saw the fight canceled  and reinstated.  </P> <P> Pryor, who was a champion from 1980-85, knocked Jones down twice in the second  round.  </P> <P> He then finished off his former sparring partner with a four-punch combination,  ending it with a right hand. Jones tried to get up but was counted out.  </P> <P> Pryor, 34, in his first fight since knocking out Herminio Morales in December  1988, has been denied permission to box in four other states -- Nevada, New  York, New Jersey and California -- because of impaired vision in his left eye.  He underwent surgery on the eye in January 1988 to repair a detached retina and  remove a cataract and is legally blind in the eye.  </P> <P> Wisconsin gave him a tentative OK to box before a state licensing board on  Wednesday morning denied promoter Diana Lewis a permit to hold the exhibition.  </P> <P> The board denied the permit because Lewis' boxing company was not incorporated  when she first applied. But a judge overruled the board hours later.  </P></p>

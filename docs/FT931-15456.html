			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Further setback for gilts as Bank announces auction THE UK gilts market was dealt a further setback yesterday, when the Bank of England announced a gilt auction for January 27. Despite the fact that the auction was widely anticipated, the market fell back on the news, ending about  1/4 point lower. Dealers said that at recent auctions the margin by which bids have covered the gilts on offer had narrowed, exacerbating concern about the government's ability to meet its heavy funding needs. The amount and terms of the auction of stock maturing between 2005 and 2013 will be announced next Tuesday. Supply remains the main focus for the gilts market, which continued to underperform other European bond markets yesterday. However, prior to the auction news, the market had appeared more buoyant. The release of the December producer price index proved mildly positive for the market. The year-on-year rise of 3.5 per cent was broadly in line with inflation, while the 0.1 per increase in import prices in December was not as bad as had been feared. 'Inflation is not the problem at the moment. The market would rather see growth, even at cost of some inflation,' as it advances the prospect of an easing in the government's funding needs, according to Mr Michael Burke, economist at Yamaichi International. THE French market recovered some of Monday's losses in a largely technical rally, but the performance of the French bond market so far this year, widely tipped to be the strongest European market in the early 1993, remains rather disappointing. The spread between French government OAT and German bund yields is still above 90 basis points, defying expectations that it would narrow substantially. Dealers say nervousness over the forthcoming election accounts for the underperformance of the market. However, sentiment was slightly raised yesterday by news that in December inflation fell to 2 per cent year-on-year, and is widely expected to fall further. However, dealers said that good news on the inflation front would not be enough to support the market. THE bund market ended virtually unchanged, with prices caught in a narrow range due to uncertainty over interest rate movements. There was little comfort in news that average inflation for 1992 reached 4 per cent, the highest for 10 years, up from 3 1/2 per cent in 1991. THE pressures of fresh supply and reports of strong retail sales depressed US Treasury securities yesterday, with prices falling across the maturity range. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 101 3/4 , yielding 7.471 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also lower, down  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.456 per cent. Although dealers reported that the downward pressure from heavy issues of new corporate debt had eased somewhat from last week, prices remained restrained by supply concerns. In addition, securities sold by the Province of Ontario and North Carolina Easter Municipal Power, which together totalled Dollars 4.6bn in new fixed-income debt, have come to the market, weakening seven-year and 10-year paper as dealers sold the Treasury securities to hedge against long corporate positions.</p>

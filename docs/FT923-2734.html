			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Manufacturing side boosts Haggas A strong performance from its manufacturing side enabled John Haggas, West Yorkshire-based worsted spinner, to increase pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 by 58 per cent. However, an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.95m on the sale of the hand knitting wools retailer left attributable losses at Pounds 2.98m, against profits of Pounds 1.22m. The effect was a reduction of Pounds 580,000 in reserves after taking back Pounds 4.37m of goodwill previously written off. Manufacturing pre-tax profits increased 52 per cent to Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 2.07m) with the fabric division performing well and spinning making good progress. Retailing lost Pounds 263,000 (Pounds 249,000). Group turnover was Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 33.4m). Earnings per share were 9.02p (5.6p) and a final dividend of 2p is proposed for an unchanged total of 3p.</p>

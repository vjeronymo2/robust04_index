			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SAVINGS, THE BLACK-OWNED S&amp;L, APPEARS ON MEND  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Family Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the nation's third-largest  black-owned thrift institution, had many of the same problems that have led  other thrifts to fail.  </P> <P> It had money-losing real estate holdings and heavy operating expenses stacked  onto an under-funded capital base. It had strayed from its traditional  business, residential mortgages, to try its hand at commercial lending. It had  a leader, former Chairman Oliver A. Trigg Jr., who left his post under the  cloud of a federal investigation.  </P> <P> But perhaps the similarities end there.  </P> <P> Family so far has managed to survive. Under new ownership since January, the  Los Angeles-based thrift -- renamed Family Federal Savings Bank -- has taken  several dramatic steps to get back on its feet:  </P> <P> * It has switched its emphasis back to mortgage lending. For the first six  months of 1990, it has made $26 million in mortgage loans, versus $31 million  for all of last year.  </P> <P> * It has slashed operating expenses from more than $500,000 a month in 1987 to  about $360,000 a month now, through wage freezes, layoffs and other measures.  </P> <P> * It has sold off, and taken losses on, large chunks of real estate holdings  put on the books while Trigg was in charge.  </P> <P> The moves have produced some encouraging financial results. After losing more  than $3 million over the last three years, Family expects to eke out a small  operating profit this year, according to its chief financial officer, Ed  Wilson. The thrift, with a main office at 3683 Crenshaw Blvd. and a Pasadena  branch, has assets of about $140 million.  </P> <P> Family still faces major challenges. Late last year, regulators were poised to  push the thrift into receivership after determining that it was $4 million  short of federal capital requirements. The regulators placed Family under  restrictions that require it to provide the Office of Thrift Supervision with  frequent updates on its financial status. The monitoring has continued, even  after Family's new owners invested an additional $4 million to bring capital up  to the required levels.  </P> <P> The rescue effort began last January when Washington, D.C.-based OFC Inc., a  black-run venture capital firm, took control of Family by buying 51% of its  stock for $850,000.  </P> <P> OFC had hoped to address Family's $4-million capital shortfall by offering  stock to investors in a private placement, but there were no takers. So OFC  covered the entire shortfall -- investing $4 million last May in exchange for  more Family stock, which brought OFC's ownership level to 93%.  </P> <P> OFC inherited -- and kept -- a management team headed by President Wayne-Kent  Bradshaw. Bradshaw, a former Union Bank executive, was hired in July, 1989, to  stop the financial hemorrhaging.  </P> <P> "I knew it would take time to turn things around," Bradshaw said, recalling his  thoughts on his first few days in charge. "Family was headed in the wrong  direction. But an institution is like an aircraft carrier in the ocean -- you  can't simply spin it around in another direction. First, it takes time to stop.  Second, it takes time to gradually turn the ship around."  </P> <P> The Family ship followed an unusual course during the two years that Oliver  Trigg had the helm.  </P> <P> Trigg, a Los Angeles real estate investor, became heavily involved in the  day-to-day management of Family after joining the thrift's board in 1986, some  Family executives say. Under Trigg, Family stepped up its commercial lending  and made direct investments in real estate.  </P> <P> One such investment is the subject of a federal investigation into possible  fraud at the thrift. The grand jury probe, begun in 1988, was prompted by an  October, 1987, Times story that said a company formed by Trigg had sold land to  Family for a large profit while Trigg was on the thrift's board of directors.  </P> <P> In a 1989 lawsuit, Family accused Trigg of using $1.2 million in profit from  the land deal to buy his 51% stake in Family's stock in 1987. The suit also  charges that Trigg made financial deals without his fellow directors'  knowledge.  </P> <P> Trigg has denied making money on the land deal, which involved a residential  tract in Whittier.  </P> <P> His lawyer, Arthur Barens, also defends Trigg's performance at Family. Although  the thrift suffered a major loss in 1987, its earnings reached an all-time high  -- $1.6 million -- in 1986, Barens said.  </P> <P> "He (Trigg) did an exemplary job," Barens said.  </P> <P> Recently, attorneys for Trigg and Family have been negotiating to try to settle  their civil dispute out of court.  </P> <P> There have been no indictments by the grand jury, but its investigation  continues.  </P> <P> Family executives say they were unable to resell at a profit the land that  Trigg allegedly foisted on the thrift. Under terms of an agreement with federal  regulators, Trigg agreed in June, 1988, to place the stock in a trust fund and  allow proceeds from its sale to revert to Family to make up for its losses on  the Whittier land.  </P> <P> Under OFC, Family has finally begun to turn around, Bradshaw said.  </P> <P> According to unaudited financial reports, the thrift had earnings of about  $900,000 in the first six months of the year. However, $850,000 of that was a  non-recurring gain resulting from Trigg's agreement. When OFC bought the stock  for $850,000, regulators allowed Family to count the proceeds as income related  to the Whittier land.  </P> <P> Still, Family is on a financial track that will lead to second-half earnings  and year-end profits, said Wilson, the chief financial officer.  </P> <P> Including the $850,000 OFC investment, Wilson projects full-year earnings of $1  million. The thrift had a loss of about $825,000 in 1989.  </P> <P> "Family now has a different management style," Wilson said. "If we're going to  provide a better service to the community, we have to have the right resources  and we have to watch the bottom line and control our expenses."  </P> <P> Expenses have been cut dramatically since 1987, when Family registered a loss  of $1.1 million. Expenses dropped from $6.6 million in 1987 to $4.9 million at  the end of 1989. The cost-cutting has accelerated since OFC took control in  January.  </P> <P> The new owners reduced expenses through wage freezes, small staff cuts and  reductions in advertising, office and travel expenses. Monthly expenses totaled  $513,000 last December, but by June they had dropped to $360,000, Wilson said.  </P> <P> Interest expense -- the money paid on deposits -- has been another problem at  Family. Interest costs rose from $10.3 million in 1987 to $11.7 million in 1989  as Family offered higher returns on certificates of deposits to attract  much-needed cash.  </P> <P> However, Family executives say they are now steering away from the costliest  deposits -- $100,000 "jumbo" certificates of deposit. Instead, they plan to  emphasize long-term certificates of deposit in lower denominations and at lower  rates.  </P> <P> Family executives say the thrift suffered heavy losses primarily because large  sums that could have been used for mortgage loans were spent on real estate.  And many of the real estate investments went bad, as Family's attempts at land  development failed.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Family's interest income on mortgage loans was virtually flat  between 1987 and 1989 because the thrift wasn't generating many loan  applications, Wilson said. Loan-related interest income totaled $12.628 million  in 1987 and rose to only $12.684 million in 1989.  </P> <P> To obtain more cash and make more mortgage loans, Family has been rapidly  selling off its real estate. In 1987, the thrift's real estate portfolio had  holdings valued at $8.8 million and losses of about $3.4 million. By the end of  1989, the holdings were valued at $1.4 million and the losses had fallen to  $136,221. As of June, the portfolio was valued at about $500,000, Wilson said.  </P> <P> Family's unaudited reports from the first six months of 1990 show other major  changes. The thrift has made $26 million in loans during the first half of  1990, compared to only $31 million in all of 1989. And all of the 1990 loans  were mortgage-related. About 85% of Family's $140 million in assets are  mortgage loans, compared to 79% at the end of 1989.  </P> <P> Family's new orientation actually mirrors the philosophy of its founder -- M.  Earl Grant. Family has traditionally catered to the borrowing needs of black  home buyers in the Los Angeles area. An Altadena businessman, Grant founded  Family in 1948 because he -- like other blacks in that era -- had difficulty  getting mortgage loans from white-run banks and thrifts.  </P> <P> However, Family's neighborhood has changed as large numbers of Latinos have  moved in, in recent years. Family is now making marketing and personnel changes  to attract Latino depositors, said Ron Walker, president of OFC and the  recently installed chairman of Family Federal.  </P> <P> "We won't survive if we don't seek new markets and address the changing  demographics of the community," said Walker, a Harlem-born accountant. "Family  is African-American-owned, but its orientation will be multicultural."  </P> <P> Latinos already receive between 30% and 40% of Family's loans, but they account  for only about 10% of Family's depositors, Walker said. To lure more Latino  depositors, Family is now advertising in La Opinion, a Spanish-language  newspaper in Los Angeles. The thrift has also tried to accommodate current and  potential customers by hiring more Spanish-speaking tellers. It also hired a  chief lending officer who is of Mexican descent.  </P> <P> Family -- currently dependent on a customer base that is mainly over 40 years  of age -- is also trying to generate more deposits and loan applications from  people in the 25-to-40 age range, Walker said. He said he is trying to develop  services and programs to attract young professionals.  </P> <P> "We have a disproportionate number of senior citizens -- and they are very good  customers," Walker said. "But we need younger upscale black and Hispanic  customers."  </P></p>

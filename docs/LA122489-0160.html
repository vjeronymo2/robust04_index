			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LIVES IN CANADA  </P> <P> Christmas cards came to me at my office the past few days, from the Angels, the  Dodgers, the Raiders, the Rams . . . and the Calgary Flames. I kid you not.  </P> <P> I wasn't even sure they had Christmas in Canada. I thought maybe they  celebrated All Pucks Day, or the feast of St. Pauli Girl.  </P> <P> "This season brings a greater appreciation of old friendships and new  associations," the card read. Signed: the Calgary Flames Hockey Club.  </P> <P> Well, I was touched.  </P> <P> Frankly, I had never thought of myself as a new association of the Calgary  Flames, even after I visited their fine city to watch the 1988 Winter Olympics  and the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs. Had I known that I was going to be making  new associations up there, I'd have dressed better.  </P> <P> Anyhow, it turns out that Canadians are absolutely full of the Christmas  spirit. The spirit of sharing. The spirit of giving.  </P> <P> How do I know?  </P> <P> Because they just keep giving and giving and giving.  </P> <P> Here in Southern California, they have given us Wayne Gretzky and Larry  Robinson to play hockey for the Kings, they have given us Mervyn Fernandez to  catch passes for the Raiders, they have given us Mark Langston to pitch  baseballs for the Angels, and now they have given us Hubie Brooks to hit  baseballs for the Dodgers.  </P> <P> What a country!  </P> <P> Canadians just keep giving and giving, till it hurts. Our good friends north of  the border truly do believe that it is better to give than to receive. We in  America even gave them Jimmy Carson as payment for Gretzky, but they gave him  right back.  </P> <P> Canada is becoming America's farm club. It just keeps sending us foreign aid.  </P> <P> Can't we give something back? Can't we make a donation to these generous people  who provide us with so much? When the Toronto Blue Jays make a trade with the  New York Yankees, they are nice enough to send them Jesse Barfield. What do the  Yankees send back? Al Leiter. It was like bartering with the Indians again for  Manhattan.  </P> <P> Perhaps Canadians have been feeling generous, since hockey is the only sport  they truly care about.  </P> <P> Of course, Canada also is still stuck with the Quebec Nordiques, the NHL's  lousiest team, and the Vancouver Canucks, possibly the second-lousiest team,  and Harold Ballard, the dotty old goofus who has run the Toronto Maple Leafs  into the ice.  </P> <P> And Canada is still home to Ben (Better Running Through Chemistry) Johnson, the  Olympic sprinter, although plans have been made, generously, to give him back  to Jamaica.  </P> <P> Some of the athletes who leave Canada do so not because they dislike living  there, but because they dislike the way their $3-million-a-year contracts are  only worth about $2 million in U.S. currency.  </P> <P> They also leave because their wives want to be actresses. It isn't enough to  host "A.M. Edmonton." It isn't enough to act in off-off-off-off-Broadway shows.  Canadian actresses do have a sidewalk where they place their footprints in wet  cement, but unfortunately, the sidewalk has only six footprints so far.  </P> <P> Hubie Brooks is the latest to bolt Canada for better opportunities in the  States. He is a right fielder and third baseman who signed with a team that  already has a right fielder and a third baseman.  </P> <P> The Dodgers are unconcerned. They are going to start an outfield of Kal Daniels  in left, Juan Samuel in center, Kirk Gibson in right and Hubie Brooks in  between somewhere. The old four-man outfield.  </P> <P> Ten bucks says the ball still drops.  </P> <P> These guys can play the outfield every bit as well as the 1927 Yankees. Of  course, the outfielders of the 1927 Yankees are all dead.  </P> <P> Samuel doesn't even want to play the outfield. He wants to play second base. We  saw him play the outfield last season. He should play second base.  </P> <P> The Dodgers also got him to be a leadoff hitter. From 1984 through '87, Samuel  tied the major league record for most consecutive seasons leading a league in  strikeouts. Nice leadoff hitter.  </P> <P> But the Dodgers are not done dealing. Let's give them until April to see what  else they have up their sleeves besides Fernando Valenzuela at about a  quarter-million dollars a win.  </P> <P> Remember, the spirit of giving is not necessarily confined to Canadians. Look  at that big trade the Dodgers made with the St. Louis Cardinals, the big Pedro  Guerrero-for-Nobody trade. We don't have to worry, though, if we have any more  holes to fill in the lineup. One phone call to Canada and we can have anybody  the Expos or Blue Jays have got.  </P> <P> Canada is our friend.  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Major fuels forecasts of tax-cutting Budget MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday fuelled intense speculation at Westminster that the government is preparing a tax-cutting Budget as the platform for its general election campaign. His comments in the House of Commons came amid indications that new tax allowances for working mothers and further incentives to encourage saving might accompany a reduction in income tax if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, can find sufficient room for manoeuvre. They coincided also with indications from a new opinion poll that the Conservatives' onslaught early last week on Labour's tax plans has boosted their support among voters. The ICM poll for today's Guardian shows the Conservatives with a one-point lead over Labour after a three-point rise to 42 per cent in its support since December. Labour's support fell one point, while the Liberal Democrats dropped from 14 per cent to 12 per cent. The poll was taken at the end of last week. The prime minister's statement that 'when it is prudent to make tax reductions we will make them', was reinforced by a detailed exposition by Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, of the case for lower taxation. Delivering the annual Disraeli Lecture in London, Mr Patten identified taxation as the central difference between the two main parties. He added: 'Conservatives reduce taxes, whenever that is consistent with our unshakeable commitment to sound money.' Senior ministers stressed that the final judgment on the room for reductions would not be made until much nearer the Budget. Some of Mr Major's colleagues remain wary that charges of pre-election bribery might undermine the Conservatives' claim to responsible economic management. Mr Lamont will be anxious also not to risk upsetting confidence on financial markets. The ministers acknowledge, however, that Mr Major appears determined to seize the opportunity of reducing income tax - either through raising thresholds or by cutting the basic rate - if he can. He reinforced that view in his first Commons clash of the new year with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader. He rejected Mr Kinnock's claim that he had ruled out as 'fool's gold' any pre-election tax cuts in an interview last autumn. Responding that he had been 'misquoted', Mr Major said the government would cut taxes when it was prudent to do so because 'we believe that people are better able to look after their own interest than any government, however benevolent'. Conservative party officials said plans were now in place to call the election on either April 9 or May 7, following a Budget on March 3 or March 10. They said that the broad themes of the election manifesto had been established, with the focus on widening personal ownership and extending personal choice. The Budget measures would be designed to underpin that message. Parliament, Page 10 Lex, Page 20</p>

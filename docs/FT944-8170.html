			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (24): How Mannesmann got in first - Mobile phone users are increasing by 30,000 a month Jump in a taxi in Germany and D2 is often written in large blue lettering across the car. Leaf through the many weekly news magazines and you will find the same logo. 'It's my line,' is the English slogan that comes with it. D2 and the catchy jingle are the trademark of Mannesmann's mobile phone business, the first private telecoms operator in Germany which started operating commercially in mid-1992 and has signed up around 760,000 clients since then. About 30,000 clients a month are being won over to mobile phones and the network expects to report sizeable profits for 1994 following investments of around DM3bn. It has, so far, been an unexpected success story with Mannesmann pitting its skills against Deutsche Telekom, the soon-to-be privatised state-owned telecoms operator which operates D1, the other mobile phone net. Where Mannesmann led, others quickly followed. Veba, the energy-based industrial conglomerate also based in Dusseldorf, has taken a stake in the so-called E-plus network, alongside Thyssen which still makes a lot of its money in steel. Meanwhile RWE, the utility, has teamed up with Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, to develop a corporate network, a sort of alternative telecommunications network which would use the existing cables belonging to utilities and other large companies. Viag, the Munich-based industrial group, is also trying to work out how it can get into the market while Veba recently announced that it was working with Deutsche Bahn, the Federal railways, to use their rail infrastructure as a basis for a corporate network. In short, telecommunications has become flavour of the year in Germany, in no small way thanks to Mannesmann which first took on the Telekom's monopoly. But Mr Peter Mihatsch, head of Mannesmann's telecoms division, is not content with taking on one mobile phone monopoly. Over the summer Mannesmann and Mercury, the UK-based telecoms operator, joined forces to challenge a decision by the German postal ministry which wanted to award Germany's first in-flight mobile phone service to DeTeMobil, the Deutsche Telekom subsidiary which operates the D1 network. The court challenge is still in progress but Mr Mihatsch says it marks an important turning point on the German telecommunications market. 'For the first time Deutsche Telekom didn't get a service straight away,' he says with an audibly sterner tone in his voice, reflecting the resentment of constantly having to do battle with Telekom's monopoly. Alongside Mannesmann Mobilfunk (MMO), the unit which runs the mobile network, Mr Mihatsch has created Eurokom, a company which has amassed a series of holdings in telecoms ventures across Europe, including stakes in mobile phone networks in Spain and Italy and in companies specialising in data transmission. Mannesmann is now looking for partners across Europe with whom it can offer D2 clients services across the continent, enabling them, for instance, to have their phones repaired or exchanged. Most importantly Mr Mihatsch intends to use the mobile phone net to carry a variety of new services. 'You can buy more than just an Aspirin at the chemists,' he says in his office in Dusseldorf. 'In the same way there will be different suppliers offering different services.' He is currently working on plans to couple the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard with satellite technology and provide drivers across Germany - and eventually Europe - with an array of services including navigational aides and technology which would automatically pay motorway tolls. VDO, Mannesmann's automotive technology division, is working on the so-called black box which would give drivers access to this catalogue of new driving aides. How soon the technology is available depends in part on political decisions to privatise motorways but Mr Mihatsch is confident that within three years the services could be available. Alongside the new in-car services, Mannesmann is also lining up to take advantage of the expected liberalisation of the telephone network in Germany. The competition from Veba and others who are toying with the idea of corporate networks seems unlikely to pose much of a threat to Corporate Network International (CNI), a joint venture that Mannesmann has entered with RWE and Deutsche Bank, both leaders in their respective fields. 'In the end it is all about who has the customers,' says Alan Coats, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, pinpointing CNI's outstanding strength. Mr Mihatsch expects 'heated discussions' before Telekom can be made to relinquish its monopoly. Mannesmann may not want a sudden opening of the German networks - there are some suggestions that this should happen as soon as 1995 - before it and its CNI partners are ready. 'But you have to identify a milestone, and say that (liberalisation) would happen within two years. Those of us who want to invest - and not just DM2.5 but hefty sums - need security with which we can plan. Mr Mihatsch is loath to predict how many mobile clients MMO will pick up in future. So many previous forecasts have got it wrong, he says, quoting a 1987 study which predicted that there would be 1m mobile phone users in Germany by 2000, a slight misjudgment given that D1 and D2 alone already have about 1.6m clients. 'The people compiling these studies at that time could not possibly foresee the developments,' he says. 'Mobile phones were thought of as VIP products, to be used by a few very rich people. Today in Sweden you have more people signing up for mobile phones than for fixed lines.' Press him a bit and Mr Mihatsch admits there will be at least 10m mobile phone clients in Germany alone by the year 2000. By then, he says, MMO and Eurokom, which have so far consumed far more money than they have earned, will be making healthy contributions to Mannesmann's turnover and profit.  --------------------------------------------------------          WEST EUROPE: TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET  -------------------------------------------------------- BY COUNTRY  -------------------------------------------------------- Germany                                       26 percent France                                        15 percent Italy                                         13 percent United Kingdom                                15 percent Spain                                          8 percent Others                                        22 percent  -------------------------------------------------------- BY SERVICE SECTORS  -------------------------------------------------------- Telephones                                    68 percent Long-distance telephony                       12 percent Data communications                            9 percent Mobile telephones                              6 percent Others                                         5 percent  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: A&amp;R Market Research, Netherlands  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

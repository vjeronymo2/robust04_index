			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Business Traveller: Tunnel vision realised - Travel Update Hardened businessmen and journalists burst into spontaneous applause on Friday evening as the driver announced that we were travelling at 100mph 40 metres below the seabed of the Channel on the first public journey through the channel tunnel, writes Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent, who was with the group. The new Eurostar trains, which will not be operating commercially until next summer, will transport passengers in just three hours from the centre of London to the centre of Paris. The trains are still being tested. Friday's historic trip through the tunnel was made in a Thameslink Sprinter. It may have been historic but it was not spectacular. After 30 minutes one tunnel looks much like another. But the ride was exceptionally smooth. With the air-conditioning working, a guaranteed seat and a meal, it will be very comfortable. Return fares to Paris and Brussels will match those charged by airlines. The first consumer test suggests the tunnel will be a real alternative for the business traveller crossing the channel - that is if British Rail can sort out the journey from London to the tunnel.</p>

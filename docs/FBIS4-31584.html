			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> Dragan Colovic on the "An Argument More" program; place and date  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Colovic] Minister Jovanovic, our public received  with great trepidation the news from Washington that the U.S.  Congress House of Representatives had, by a great majority,  adopted the amendment demanding that President Clinton  unilaterally lift the arms embargo for the Bosnian Muslims. How  do you see this?    [Jovanovic] This is a continuation of the position in U.S.  policy, which from the beginning of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has been insisting on a so-called hard  solution, on pressure, on blackmailing the Serbian side in the  hope that this would yield maximum results. This line in the  U.S. policy is not always consistent; very often it is in  contradiction with the official line that has always been a lot  more considerate and has taken into account the repercussions of  such a position on other U.S. interests, on relations with the  allies, and finally, on the U.S. strategy of using sanctions on  a global scale, whenever U.S. state or national interests  warrant it. Therefore, a possible surrender to this hard line  could initially bring some advantages to immediate U.S. policy,  but, in the long run, it would threaten many other goals,  particularly the option of using sanctions as the most lethal,  albeit most inhuman and most undemocratic means in the current  policy of this great power.    On the other hand, the Islamic lobby -- which is very  powerful and which is just a herald of the monolithic political  bloc of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] -- is active  in all spheres, and it is particularly focused on the U.S.  decisionmaking centers, knowing that if it manages to win over  the United States, it will have an easier time dealing with the  other political factors. In this respect, President Clinton is  certainly exposed to immense pressure -- both internally and  externally -- which he has so far successfully resisted. The  assumption and the logical conclusion is that the President will  succeed in resisting this to the end, because all the pros and  cons of such an action -- the unilateral lifting of the arms  embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- imply that the cons would  prevail over the pros, and that the number one man of this great  power would have to be a great gambler to opt for this  voluntarily. The threat is nevertheless serious, this time it  comes from the united Congress -- both wings of Congress have  practically voted in favor of lifting the embargo -- and  President Clinton will need a lot of skill, strength, and time  to relativize this pressure and to maintain the peaceful option  as the general option in his country's policy toward the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I believe that he will look for strength  of argument for his position in the dynamics of the peace  process in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself or about Bosnia-Herzegovina  [sentence as heard]. I believe that this is the best way to  match this warmongering wing, which does not only come from  within -- from the U.S. Congress -- but also from an extremely  militant Islamic bloc that is on the offensive and is trying to  minimize the significance of the achievements -- modest as they  may be -- of the peace process so far, and is trying to  marginalize and diminish the process itself.    [Colovic] Minister, earlier you mentioned the sanctions. It  is interesting to note that this dangerous U.S. congressmen's  initiative comes at a time when the first hints of a change in  U.S. policy toward the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina are becoming  apparent in the sense that the U.S. President has announced the  possibility of relaxing the sanctions toward the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. How do you explain this?    [Jovanovic] Well, you see, it is probable that the [word  indistinct] Congress for the lifting of the embargo and the  announcement of the possibility of relaxing the sanctions are  part of the same policy -- the policy of a stick and a carrot.  On the one hand, the possibility of lifting the embargo is  intended to apply psychological and political pressure on the  Serbian side in Bosnia-Herzegovina so that it becomes frightened  and more yielding in the peace negotiations, while on the other  hand, the announcement of the possibility of relaxing or lifting  the sanctions should apply a similar pressure that would reflect  on, and as such be registered by the Muslim side in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. These two things are, after all, part of  the same whole, although each one has its own autonomy,  particularly the first one that concerns the embargo, of which I  have already spoken.    The important thing for us is that this positive evolution  in  the U.S. Administration's position toward the sanctions is, at  least verbally, continuing. Moreover, for a month and a half  now, we have had these new tones that imply that the policy of  this country toward the sanctions is not firm, but is also a  dynamic process that can be adjusted depending on the positive  changes in solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is  probably a reflection of the fact that the United States --  along with all of Europe, with the exception of Austria,  Albania, and Turkey -- is also becoming aware of the fact that  the sanctions have lost their raison d'etre, that they are  beginning to inflict losses on their initiators, and that they  are beginning to think about how to rid themselves of these  sanctions without losing face and particularly without losing  face on the ground. [sentence as heard] It is conceivable that  all this is part of a whole, and it would not surprise us if the  United States -- providing some undesirable turnabout does not  happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- were to give us a new, similar,  positive surprise in the coming weeks.    [Colovic] A pleasant surprise in any case. Mr. Jovanovic,  in recent days, the international factors have been trying to  speed up and intensify the peace process, particularly after the  one-month cease-fire was accepted. All this is aimed at urging  the acceptance of a territorial demarcation, and finally a  political solution. What developments can we expect after  Geneva? Are not perhaps certain pitfalls also present in this  speeding up of the process? One of the pitfalls could be that a  solution might be imposed which, instead of contributing to the  end of the war, could lead to its escalation?    [Jovanovic] First of all, this progress, the one-month  cease-fire -- which is very modest -- is nevertheless progress  because it maintains the momentum of both the negotiations and  the relative stabilization of the situation on the ground.  However, it is so minimal that to count on it in any way would  be to grossly deceive oneself. We need to urgently invest new  and essential efforts in order to prevent the Muslim side --  once the month is over -- from launching military operations, or  complicating both the negotiations and the situation and in this  way forcing the whole world to go with their variant rather than  the peace variant that is the current name of the game.  Therefore, there is a realistic chance of the Muslim side  setting traps, and it stems from both the Muslim side in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and from its friends and supporters on the  other side -- the Islamic bloc and friends in the U.S. Congress.    On the other hand, hints that the new division and the new  package of the peace solution could be placed on the table in  the form of take-it-or-leave-it, must not be lightly dismissed  because it is obvious that this type of activity at  international meetings is pretty familiar, particularly to  certain Western powers. The problem is that until now, this was  only employed on the Serbian side in Bosnia, and on Yugoslavia  in connection with the Yugoslav crisis, whereas it was never  employed on the other sides. Even if this time it was employed  against both, or all three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, there  would still be a realistic danger that this pressure -- in  respect to the Serbs in Bosnia -- would be overdone, more  pronounced than the possible pressure on the Muslims.    Finally, the fact that it has been implied that the Muslims,  in exchange for the lifting of the arms embargo, could be, so to  speak, punished by the relaxation of the sanctions against us,  is not proportional, because the lifting of the sanctions [as  heard] would be an introduction to a long war, while the  relaxation of the sanctions would be just a partial alleviation  of Yugoslavia's position under the burden of sanctions. We must  be careful and the international community must be reminded of  something it kept reiterating, which is that it would respect  the consensus of the warring factions and that it would not  impose the political solution of either side. If it were to  adhere to this, then there would be no danger of this happening.    However, we must not forget that a year ago, during the time  of the Vance-Owen plan, there was an attempt at imposing such a  solution on one side -- the Serbian side -- in Bosnia, and that  after it rejected this, the famous UN Security Council  Resolution 820 was passed. Therefore, all the cards are in the  game, nothing has been excluded in advance, and it is possible  that the international community -- under the pressure of an  ultimatum-like offer -- will aim it at only one, the Serbian  side, while the other side is faced only with a cosmetic  ultimatum [sentence as heard]. This unbalance, as a consequence  of the double standards applied so far in solving the Yugoslav  crisis, is still predominant in the policy and position of the  leading Western countries.</p>

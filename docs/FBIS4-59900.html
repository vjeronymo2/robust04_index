			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "That Israeli Storm"] </F>   [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has created a  serious political storm by claiming that a statement attributed  to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat on Jerusalem was a threat  to the peace agreements.    The world shook and judgments were passed after the  statements attributed to Yasir 'Arafat about jihad for  Jerusalem, a recording of which was broadcast by Israel radio  the day before yesterday.    We heard that the Palestinian president made the statements  attributed to him at a mosque in Johannesburg in South Africa.  Regardless of the circumstances in which the statements were  made, how accurately they were reported, and the timing of their  reporting, one week after the fact, Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin has insisted on exploiting the event and on  regarding it as "a serious violation of his ['Arafat's] written  undertakings which threatens the peace process." Rabin's  escalation got sympathy from U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher who directed his aides to investigate the statements.    All that despite the fact that there was no Palestinian  confirmation of the alleged statements and despite the fact that  a responsible U.S. source said that there should be no  exaggeration of what was alleged to have happened or what did  happen. Even [Israeli] Communication and Culture Minister  Shulamit Aloni -- of Meretz, which supports full withdrawal from  the occupied territories -- downplayed the "seriousness" of the  statements and said that 'Arafat perhaps wanted "to voice his  fear of the fait accompli and disappointment at having gotten  less than he had hoped for" in the negotiations with Israel.    Judgments have been passed with hints of jeopardizing the  withdrawal program and reneging on the agreements even though  the whole story is hearsay. Regardless of what 'Arafat did or  did not say, the fact remains that Jerusalem, the first qiblah  [to which Muslims used to turn in their prayers] and the third  holy place, belongs to the Muslims, and Israel should realize  this fact.    By contrast, and this is what is really strange, the charge  made by the UN observers in Hebron yesterday that the Israeli  Army was preventing them from carrying out their mission as  observers of Palestinian safety in the city, has passed  unnoticed, and the words and actions of Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud  Olmert (a former minister in the Likud government) and his call  for the confirmation of Jerusalem as "the unified and eternal  capital" of Israel, disregarding the feelings of Muslims and  Christians throughout the world, have fallen on deaf ears and  blind eyes.    We talk and are blamed, and they act and are acquitted.</p>

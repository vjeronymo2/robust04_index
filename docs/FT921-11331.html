			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / N-scientist denies experts will be lured abroad RUSSIA'S chief nuclear bomb scientist yesterday rejected western fears that his experts could sell their skills abroad en masse but called for international co-operation and higher pay to keep them contented. In an unprecedented interview clearly timed to coincide with Russian President Boris Yeltsin's mission to the United Nations, Professor V. Mikhailov revealed that 100,000 people produced atomic weapons in the former Soviet Union. The head of Russia's military nuclear programme said that 10,000-15,000 had access to classified information, with 2,000-3,000 people holding vital secrets. While it was possible 'a few adventurists' could go abroad, Prof Mikhailov said that the nuclear arsenal was built by 'patriots, responsible people.' He complained that their monthly salaries of around Rbs1,200 (Pounds 6 at the market rate) were 'not money' but said Russia did not need western help to pay them more. He also pointed out that legislation banning his people from leaving the country for between five to 10 years was still in force - even though the former Soviet Union's borders are no longer as tightly sealed as they were. Regardless of financial problems, Russia would have to find the money to dismantle excess nuclear weapons 'if we don't want to turn the country into one big Chernobyl.'</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (5): Self-employed instructors / Case Study of BSM IT WAS the type of incident every driving instructor fears; as Bob Gilchrist sat with his pupil at a red traffic light a car ploughed into his dual control vehicle, leaving him with whiplash injuries. Knowing that the accident was not his or his pupil's fault, and that there was nothing he could have done to avert it, was little comfort to Mr Gilchrist, who is self-employed; what did ease the pain was the Pounds 239 a week he received, for the month he was off work earlier this year, from the British School of Motoring. Although most people in Britain have heard of BSM, far fewer are aware that Mr Gilchrist and his 2,000 fellow BSM driving instructors are not employees of the company, but self-employed franchisees. Each week they give BSM a substantial chunk of the fees paid by their pupils; they also have to buy petrol for the lessons and pay their own National Insurance and tax. But, in exchange, the company provides them with a new dual control Rover Metro every 18,000 miles, services, repairs, taxes and insures the car, backs them up with training materials, shoulders the administrative burden and provides a flow of learners, attracted by the BSM name. Since last year it has also introduced a franchise fee repayment for up to 26 weeks in the event of injury or sickness, the arrangement from which Mr Gilchrist benefited. BSM, Britain's dominant motoring school, occupies a curious position in a sector in which lone operators take a substantial slice of the market. Each year it trains more than 1,000 instructors; many of those who qualify and are registered with the Driving Standards Agency, a wing of the Department of Transport, subsequently set up in competition to BSM. Mr Gilchrist, who has been with BSM since becoming an instructor eight years ago, has seen a number leave to go it alone. 'I've known people who think they're going to earn thousands and in six months they've disappeared. The grass is always greener on the other side, but it doesn't always work out like that.' BSM, which estimates it has an 18 per cent market share, operates 130 branches from Aberdeen to Plymouth. Acquired in a management buyout in 1990 for Pounds 40m from the Jacobs family, it has 450 employees. Of these, 300 man the branches, in clerical, administrative and sales roles, 50 give instructor training and 50 are based at the company's national vehicle preparation and repair complex in the Midlands. The 2,000 instructors, who between them give lessons to 200,000 people each year and drive 1m miles a week, can elect to pay BSM either a fixed fee or a variable, hourly fee. Mr Gilchrist has opted for the fixed fee, currently 16 hours tuition fees' a week; in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he is based, and other parts of Britain outside London and the Home Counties, that means 16 times Pounds 14.95 - Pounds 239 a week. On top, he calculates he spends about Pounds 50 a week on petrol for lessons and commuting from his home to work. Under the variable, hourly fee, an instructor in a Pounds 14.95 per lesson area, working 27 hours a week, would end up with Pounds 131.90, before petrol; on 35 hours it would be Pounds 201.85 before petrol. The recession has temporarily dented instructors' earnings; Mr Gilchrist would like to teach 40 hours a week, which would bring him about Pounds 300, net of the fixed fee and petrol, but at present he is working around 30 hours a week, leaving him with about Pounds 150 after fee and petrol. But even though he quite often recruits his own learners for BSM he still believes he is better off under the company umbrella. 'All the benefits I have here would be a lot to give up.' Richard Glover, BSM's managing director, says it has stuck to a franchise arrangement for its instructors both because of the flexible nature of the work and the ethos of a business dominated by the lone operator. But within the franchising terms, instructors' payments to the company are being gradually reduced, and their benefits enhanced, to persuade more to stay with BSM. To see the work at first hand, Mr Glover has sat in on some lessons. 'I have a healthy respect and admiration for driving instructors,' he says. 'It does require a certain type of person.' Mr Gilchrist is affable and calm. 'I don't shout, it's pointless.' The job has moments of great satisfaction, like the time a 72 year-old first-time learner, desperate to take his terminally ill wife out for rides, passed his test.</p>

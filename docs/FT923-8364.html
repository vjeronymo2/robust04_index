			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UBS P&amp;D warns head of research over book UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the leading City securities house, has asked the head of its UK research department to cancel publication of a book which is critical of the accounting techniques used by many of the UK's biggest companies. Mr Terry Smith, one of the best-known analysts in the City, has been told by senior P&amp;D executives that his future at the firm is in doubt if the book is published. P&amp;D did not comment on the dispute yesterday. Mr Smith yesterday met Mr Rudi Mueller, head of the UK operations of Union Bank of Switzerland, the biggest Swiss bank and owner of P&amp;D. The book, called 'Accounting for Growth', is an expanded version of research published by P&amp;D in January 1991, which highlighted a number of accounting techniques used by companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the level of borrowings shown on their balance sheets. In the book, due to be published in mid-September, Mr Smith highlights 12 commonly used accounting techniques with the following characteristics: They may allow a company to declare a profit, even though there is no cash being generated. They may allow a company to generate a profit at the expense of the strength of the balance sheet. They may tend to disguise the extent of a company's exposure to borrowings. Mr Smith examined the accounts of the UK's 200 biggest quoted companies to see which were using the techniques. He stresses in the book that there is no implication of any impropriety if a company uses any of the techniques. P&amp;D has been embarrassed by reports about the book, which appeared in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, and Accountancy Age, the specialist periodical. These articles highlighted Grand Metropolitan as the company which used more of these accounting techniques than any other. Grand Met, which has a banking relationship with UBS, was so annoyed that Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of the drinks and foods group, contacted Mr Mueller to complain about the articles. A spokesman for Grand Met said yesterday that P&amp;D had assured Grand Met that the book represented Mr Smith's private opinions and not those of P&amp;D. However, the draft dust-jacket of the book contains the UBS P&amp;D logo. Investment institutions, polled by the financial news group Extel, voted the original P&amp;D research as the best piece of analysis produced in 1991.</p>

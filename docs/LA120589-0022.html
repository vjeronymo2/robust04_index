			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Tyson-Givens Rematch: Boxing champ Mike Tyson and ex-wife Robin Givens are  still exchanging jabs six months after their divorce. The problem this time is  the 10 acres of land adjacent to the Bernardsville, N.J., mansion they bought  as newlyweds. Tyson is being sued by real estate developer Vincent Rasa Jr.,  who claims he is owed $95,000 in commissions for the sale of the $1.9 million  property. In return, Tyson filed a counterclaim, saying Rasa, Givens, her  mother Ruth Roper, the previous owner of the land and a real estate company all  engaged in conspiracy. Tyson claims the group worked together to inflate the  cost of the property, which he says should have cost about $160,000. DANIEL  CERONE and SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

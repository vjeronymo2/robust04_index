			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Salomon settles executives' claims WALL STREET securities house Salomon Brothers announced last night that it had settled employment-related compensation claims with two of the four top executives who resigned in August 1991 over the Treasury market scandal. The four executives were forced to step down after it was revealed that they had failed to inform the authorities immediately of false bids submitted by the firm's government bond trading desk. Under the terms of the settlements - which Salomon said had been reached in light of information about the executives' conduct in the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent report on the affair - Mr Thomas Strauss, the firm's former president and chief operating officer, has been allowed to exercise some of the stock options held by him when he left last August. Mr Strauss was also allowed to keep the benefits of compensation plans awarded before his resignation. Shares in his account in Salomon's equity partnership plan were bought from him at market prices. Mr John Meriwether, a former vice-chairman, was also allowed to receive payments from various compensation plans that pre-dated his resignation, and was awarded Dollars 8m extra compensation for his contribution to the firm's earnings in 1991. Additionally, Mr Meriwether surrendered his interest in the equity partnership plan in exchange for restricted stock and cash, and received about Dollars 1.7m to cover losses suffered when Salomon refused to allow him to exercise previously awarded stock options in November 1991, before all of the facts about the Treasury market scandal had been determined. Salomon said it had been unable to reach agreement with Mr John Gutfreund, its former chairman, and Mr Donald Feuerstein, the firm's former chief counsel, over their employment-related compensation claims.</p>

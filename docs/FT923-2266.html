			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Philips details plans for launch of digital compact cassette PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, said that its long-awaited new audio product, the digital compact cassette (DCC), will be launched in Japan next week and in four European countries in the second half of next month. The company had originally planned a worldwide launch for this month, but was forced to postpone due to what it described as minor problems in pilot production of the new DCC player. Philips said US sales of DCC will start in the first week of November. It confirmed earlier statements that the initial European launch in the second half of October will focus on Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany. The DCC player that is to go on sale in Japan on Monday will cost the equivalent of Dollars 799. This suggested retail price will also be adopted in the US and Europe. Philips, which is counting on the product to help revive its flagging consumer electronics business, will face head-on competition from a rival product, the Minidisc, which has been developed by Sony of Japan and which is scheduled to reach shops in key international markets in November. The DCC, unlike an earlier Philips invention, the compact disc (CD), is recordable. The company said yesterday that a 90-minute blank tape will cost Dollars 9.99.</p>

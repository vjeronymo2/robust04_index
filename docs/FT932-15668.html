			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wise words from a stock-picking guru - Philip Coggan reviews the investment wisdom of ex-Magellan boss Peter Lynch PETER LYNCH might not be a name that is familiar to private investors in the UK. But in the US, he is a stock market legend because of his success in running Fidelity's Magellan fund. When he started to manage the fund in 1977 it had Dollars 18m in assets. By the time he retired in 1990 it was worth Dollars 14bn. Much of the increase came from money raised from new investors; nevertheless Dollars 1,000 invested in the fund in 1977 was worth Dollars 28,000 by 1990. The benefit of Lynch's wisdom is now available in a new book* which will give a lot of encouragement to private investors. He sincerely believes that private investors can beat the market by doing the right kind of research. A bright and breezy writing style makes the book an easy read for anyone with an interest in stock market investment. Scattered through the pages are Lynch's one-liners, or Peter's principles, such as 'Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon', or 'All else being equal, invest in the company with the fewest colour photographs in the annual report.' But it would be wrong to suggest that the book is a succession of homilies. There are plenty of practical examples of how Lynch goes about selecting individual stocks. Some of the lessons are peculiar to the US - for example, his enthusiasm for shares in the frequently despised savings &amp; loans (the equivalent of the British building society). Ironically, the one stock he chooses from the UK - Body Shop - is one of his few mistakes. It has fallen by a third since he first recommended it in early 1991. Investment managers tend to be classed in two camps. The 'growth' investors are those who look for companies with good businesses and a long record of profit increases. A classic growth stock would be Glaxo, which until recently seemed to move only one way - up. Its shares may have looked expensive on a price-earnings ratio basis but that did not seem to matter. In the 1980s, it was always a good time to buy Glaxo shares. The opposite school is that of 'value' investment. These managers look for stocks which have fallen out of favour with the market and thus trade at very cheap prices. A good recent example of this in the UK was Next. It was one of the glamour retailers of the 1980s but its stock plunged following the departure of founder George Davies. New management has turned the company around - the shares have risen tenfold over the last 27 months. Both schools have their flaws. Even the best managed companies cannot grow at 30 per cent per year for ever. If a stock is trading on a high p/e, then the fall in the share price can be precipitate when the company starts to falter (Glaxo has fallen by a third since its peak in early 1992). And the market is often right when it hammers the shares of companies - the value investor can find that some of his picks go bust. Lynch takes an eclectic approach which uses both the value and growth philosophies. He is really searching for 'tenbaggers' - companies with the potential to give tenfold returns. But he can find those among restaurants and retailers as well as in fallen angels such as the early 1980s Chrysler. His biggest single profit came from the unglamorous Federal National Mortgage Association. He describes how, when he is looking for retailing stocks, he heads to his local shopping mall. 'I don't think of it as browsing,' he writes, 'I think of it as fundamental analysis on the intriguing lineup of potential investments, arranged side by side for the convenience of stock shoppers. If you like the store, chances are that you'll love the stock.' To give all amateur investors hope, he cites how a group of 12- to 13-year-olds at St Agnes School in Massachusetts produced a portfolio which rose 70 per cent over two years, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and 99 per cent of all equity mutual funds (the US equivalent of unit trusts) in the process. Those children picked the stocks in companies they knew such as Nike training shoes, Pepsi and the Gap (where most bought their clothes). At St Agnes, the pupils recite the lesson 'you should invest in several stocks because out of every five you pick one will be very great, one will be really bad and three will be OK.' Lynch argues that 'an amateur who devotes a small amount of study to companies in an industry he or she knows something about can outperform 95 per cent of the paid experts who manage the mutual funds, plus have fun in doing it.' The most useful section of the book is probably the part where he explains how he selected the 21 stocks which he recommended to readers of Barrons magazine in January 1992. Over the next 14 months, despite the odd dud such as Body Shop, those stocks rose by an average 61.7 per cent, according to USA Today. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up just 9 per cent over the same period. An example of his reasoning was his selection of General Motors, a company which seems to have had nothing but bad news over recent years. It reported a Dollars 23bn deficit for 1992, the largest loss in US corporate history. As Lynch writes, the general perception was 'powerful enterprise forgets how to make cars, loses the public's confidence, lays off thousands of workers, heads for the scrapheap of has-been corporations.' 'It was all this negativity about GM that attracted me in 1991' adds Lynch. After looking at the third quarter 1990 report, he noticed that GM's other divisions, such as Ross Perot's old company, EDS, were doing well. 'If the company can only break even on the US auto business' he reasoned 'it could earn Dollars 6 to Dollars 8 a share in 1993. Giving these earnings a p/e ratio of 8, the stock should sell for Dollars 48-Dollars 64, a big advance from the current price.' Since he made his selection, GM shares have risen 24 per cent to Dollars 38-plus, well ahead of the market. Simple, really. * Beating the Street by Peter Lynch with John Rothchild.

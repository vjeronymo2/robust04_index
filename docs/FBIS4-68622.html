			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Kuznechikov, LESNAYA GAZETA correspondent: </F> "The Ukrainian Government Is Threatened With... Legal Action"]    [Text] It is not the first time that the Cabinet of  Ministers of the republic has declined a Trade Union Federation  offer to work together to summarize the results of last year's  pay rate agreement. The Cabinet has cleverly unloaded this work  onto its commission, which has not been given any authority. It  is easy to understand this trick: Many of the provisions of the  agreement have not been honored yet. Among other things, double  pay for working overtime has not yet been introduced. It is true  that this issue is not particularly critical for people employed  by woodworking plants, as they are either idle now or working  shorter hours. But the fact remains. The mechanism for adjusting  the minimum pay (which is ridiculously low in Ukraine--just  60,000 karbovantsi, which is the price of one kilo of  bologna-type sausage) and pensions to the price index has not  been introduced either. Last year prices grew by a factor of 60,  but salaries only 24.    Neither was any mutual decision made concerning regulation  of  consumption funds. The Government of Ukraine also failed to  honor other obligations stipulated in the General Agreement on  pay rates. It does not wish to sign a new agreement for 1994  either, thus practically paralyzing the work of local trade  union organizations.    This is the reason leaders of associations of trade unions  representing the timber industry, railroads, Armed Forces,  Academy of Sciences, and others decided to conduct, together  with the Cabinet of Ministers, immediate confirmation of the  agreement results. If the government declines their proposal  once again, the trade unions will initiate two parallel legal  actions against it: for failure to implement the agreement and  for evading a discussion of its results. They will also appeal  to the International Labor Organization to analyze the actions  of the Ukrainian Government.</p>

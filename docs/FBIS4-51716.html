			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday  described the recent spate of bombings as a plot to bring down  the Chuan Likphai Government.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan has made similar  comments in recent days.    Gen Chavalit said the bombing of the Karon Royal Wing Hotel  in Phuket late Friday night was not politically motivated.    It was the result of a business conflict, while the blast at  Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station a week earlier was the work  of a jealous woman.    He said the authorities had to be careful because there  would  be attempts to mislead them.    The minister said opinions were divided over the crackdown  on  war weapons.    Some thought this could be done with even tougher penalties  while others believe the crackdown would be unjust if it is not  enforced equally in all cases. "Some people don't want to see  the death penalty for this crime. We still can't move to amend  the law " he said.    Chart Thai Party leader Pol Gen Praman Adireksan said it was  the Government's duty to apprehend those behind the bombings.    "I was a victim of a bomb attack at my house several years  ago and to this day no one has been arrested," he said.    Pol Gen Praman rejected the claims by Mr Banyat and Deputy  Commerce Minister Churin Laksanavisit that the bomb attacks were  an attempt to bring down the Government, and most people would  interpret this to mean the Opposition was responsible.    He asked how the Opposition could stage the attacks since it  had no MPs in the South.    "Those in Government always think there are people out to  get  them.    "Ousting the Government through illegal means it is an act  of  rebellion. Even if you only think it, it's rebellion," he said.    Some government MPs claim an opposition party is financing  sabotage in the South with the cooperation of those loyal to the  now defunct National Peace-keeping Council.    Pol Gen Praman said the Opposition could only file  interpellations or open a debate on the issue.    He made three observations:    That the South is rich in natural resources, both on land  and  at sea, that the bombings occur only in that region, and why are  government MPs in the South not making more noise about the  problem as it is harming their constituencies.    He also said it depended on each person's view if calls to  replace Gen Chavalit as Interior Minister would solve the  problem. As a former interior minister, he said, he did not know  what to say about why the Government was unable to apprehend  anyone in connection with the burning of 33 schools in the South  last year.    There has also been about 13 bombings with only one person  arrested in connection with the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway  station incident.    "Why is that so?" asked the Opposition leader.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said all government MPs in the  South were very concerned about what has been happening but they  had not been "raising hell" because there was no clear  information.    He said he did not have details to be able to say the  bombings were aimed at bringing down his Government.    "There is not enough evidence to arrest anyone. It's  difficult," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Kampala, 11 March (AFP) -- Ugandan Government  forces killed a rebel commander in a shootout that could signal  the end of a residual insurgency in the north-east, Radio Uganda  reported Friday [11 March]. The commander of the rebel Uganda  People's Army (UPA), known simply as Abwongoto, was killed at a  school in Kumi District on Wednesday where a handful of his  fighters were reportedly trying to use children as human  shields. His comrades, believed to number about a dozen,  surrendered.    The UPA's fighters had dwindled to a few score in recent  years, and it had degenerated into a bandit group, Western  diplomats said. It was no longer considered a serious threat to  the government of President Yoweri Museveni, which has largely  succeeded in stamping out rebel activity. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: Albee's 'Three Tall Women' - Theatre It's a poor sort of memory that only works backward,' the Queen remarked.' In the first half of Edward Albee's virtually plotless play Three Tall Women, memory works only backward. The play's three heroines are young (26), middle-aged (52), and old (92), and they represent potential, achievement, aftermath. Si la jeunesse savait . . . si la vieillesse pouvait. In Act Two, however, the play moves through the looking-glass, and memory works forward. The effect is original, contrived, witty, meandering, touching, impressive, specious. The play was new in 1991, has received several prizes since its New York City premiere this February, and now reaches London in an illustrious new production led by Maggie Smith and Frances de la Tour as Heroines A and B. It is the 92-year-old, a rich New England lady at death's door, who is the centre of the triptych. In Act One, her memory is sliding in and out of focus (other signs of old age are explicit; the onset of Alzheimer's disease is implicit); and the other two are her companion and a member of her lawyer's firm. In Act Two, however, she is nothing but memory; and the other two are herself at younger ages. The sense that she carries these younger alter egos inside her is clear, even though the 26-year-old repeatedly refuses to age into that. Maggie Smith's creation of the old lady is a marvel of daring and incisiveness. Early on, she starts to wail - for no very good reason, and not for the last time - and the accuracy with which her vocal tone and facial expression capture the peculiar misery of helpless old age is uncannily fine. Yet within seconds her mischievous wit bobs back, and moments later her malicious disdain also. She is more autocratic, more disturbed, more volatile, than Myra Carter in the same role in New York; she achieves serenity only gradually. On two or three occasions, she over-employs some comic devices - staccato, bird-like turns of the raised head, swivellings of the eyes, all as seen last year in The Importance of Being Earnest - but these are minor blots. In Act Two, she achieves a quiet and stillness that must rank among the finest hours of her great career. Frances de la Tour's performance is without blot, and complements Smith's with model generosity, dryness, and elegance. Anastasia Hille's performance, in the junior role, is altogether less accomplished: fussy, restless, silly. Anthony Page's direction is perfectly paced; Carl Toms's decor and Tom Rand's costumes are handsome. Wilde's line, 'The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is still young', explains part of the feeling that the play creates  - but only part. For the young woman is so evidently callow beside the older two. The 52-year-old has more compassion, more irony, more resignation; and the 92-year-old is moving towards the final resignation. They speak of family, losing virginity, marriage, sex, adultery, motherhood, illness - much of which has not yet happened to the 26-year-old. Interestingly, though the younger woman is most alarmed at the prospect of disillusion in marriage, the older women are most troubled by their son (who appears, albeit without speaking a word). The play is weaker and slighter than it has been proclaimed. (I confess that, at its NYC premiere this February, I nodded off more than once - but put that down to jet-lag. At the London premiere last night, however, I spotted others yawning or slumbering at the points I had faded before.) The writing is full of humour, grace, irony, edge; but too often a certain whimsical preciosity protrudes. Lines are repeated and echoed at times with a sub-Gertude-Stein effect; non sequiturs and stream-of-consciousness changes of subject abound as if Albee were imitating effects from Anton Chekhov, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and others. An evening both rewarding and frustrating. At Wyndham's Theatre, WC2</p>

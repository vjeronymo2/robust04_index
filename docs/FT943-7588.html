			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of attention - Currencies Traders are likely in the days ahead to test the downside for the dollar after the US currency's weak showing last week. A 50 basis point rise in US short-term rates did nothing to dissipate the bearishness surrounding the dollar. Economists at Swiss Bank Corporation in London argue that, 'it is quite conceivable that in the next three months the US dollar will be testing the low DM1.40's' Their Swiss counterparts at UBS, however, are more optimistic. They argue that diverging US and German interest rates, as the Fed tightens further in 1995 and the Bundesbank trims the discount rate to 4 per cent, will support the dollar. 'We believe these interest rate moves will cause the foreign exchange market to shift its focus. The shift will provide international investors with the incentive to increase their holdings of Treasuries and hedge international bond holdings.' UBS is forecasting the dollar at DM1.625 in three months. Traders will also be keeping a watchful eye on sterling, now that it has slipped below the DM2.40 level. Although the trade weighted index, at 78.5, has not fallen dramatically, some analysts fear that the pound is vulnerable to speculative selling, should the market conclude that the Bank of England has been insufficiently vigilant in combatting inflationary pressures. While many observers believe that there is no case now for higher rates in the UK, the evidence of Sweden, Italy, the US and Australia all raising rates - the latter two against a benign inflationary backdrop - has clearly unsettled market nerves. Three currencies in Europe that warrant attention are the lira, Swedish krona and Spanish peseta. The former two remain weak, but they have stabilised since the initial sell-off after interest rates were raised. The peseta, on the other hand, is vulnerable to a post-summer correction as the market anticipates the end of the seasonal tourism boom.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Hope for small companies? - The Bottom Line IT MUST be that time of year again. Followers of small companies are beginning to mutter about recovery - much as they did at the beginning of last year. This time, however, there may be better grounds for optimism. Trading volumes at the lowest end of the market have been noticeably higher in December and January. This contrasts with 1991 when prices shot up but volume was absent. 'We have noticed the buzz,' says John Houlihan, of the small companies team at Hoare Govett. 'Lots of people who haven't said 'good morning' for three years are now coming over to my desk]' There is also evidence that the rate of collapse of small companies - as measured by the Hoare Govett Small Companies (HGSC) index - appears to have peaked. Just 43 companies became valueless over the course of the year against a record 50 in 1991. Professors Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh, who prepare the index, suggest that 'surviving small companies are a stronger breed. They are now better able to survive the recession.' Yet, the biggest reason for optimism must be the recent cut in interest rates. The government's decision to quit the exchange rate mechanism offered the one real boost to the depressed small companies' sector last year. 'The difference between last year and this year is that this time we know growth is going to happen,' says Richard Hickinbotham, small companies' analyst at SG Warburg. 'If there is not enough evidence to sustain that view, then rates will go lower.' As rates decline, investors will be tempted increasingly away from saving and into the equity market. Houlihan maintains that the small company sector is sitting on the brink of a recovery. 'If only a small proportion of funds on deposit even attempts to go to small companies, you have a quantum change,' he says. Such change would be welcome to the sector, which has had an unprecedented fourth year of underperformance compared with the FTA All Share. The statistics for 1992 make gloomy reading: earnings have declined and dividends fallen for the third successive year in real terms. Small companies offered a capital gain of just 3.9 per cent and a total return, including reinvested dividends, of only 8.5 per cent. This compares with 14.8 and 20.5 per cent respectively for the FT-A All Share. The real performers last year seem to have been medium-sized companies. Despite the bad news, Dimson and Marsh have found some cause for celebration. Small company investment trusts outperformed the HGSC as a whole, with a return of 15 per cent. Yet, even this is subject to a caveat: investment trusts tend to be weighted more heavily in the top end of the small company sector - ie, the medium-sized stocks. The long-term outperformance of smaller companies continues. Just Pounds 1 invested in the HGSC in 1955 would have returned Pounds 556 today - including the reinvestment of dividends - against Pounds 151 for the All Share. Since 1955, Dimson and Marsh argue, the total return on the HGSC has been more than 18 per cent - a 4 per cent premium relative to the All Share. Dividend growth over 38 years continues to progress at a higher rate than on the All Share. But the number of investors prepared to stick it out for 38 years are few. Recovery for small stocks may be overdue, but enthusiasm should be tempered with realism. Smaller companies are likely to depend more on the UK economy than their larger colleagues. So, any market recovery must be tied to an upturn in the economy. The chart above shows how closely the relative performance of the HGSC follows swings in gross domestic product. On a five-year pattern, say Dimson and Marsh, annualised rates of return from the HGSC are likely to lag behind the All Share for several years. Such warnings aside, the bulls remain insistent on an 18-month view. 'The sector has taken costs out and is highly operationally geared,' says Hickinbotham. Hoare Govett agrees: 'Investors are likely to be pleasantly surprised by the recovery in earnings in 1993 and 1994.'</p>

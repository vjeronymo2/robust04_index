			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMELESS GAIN ANOTHER ADVOCATE  </P> <P> The homeless were invited to join celebrities Wednesday night as guests  converged at the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park for the  inaugural event of a new group calling itself Artists Against Homelessness.  After a reception that showcased artworks by the homeless, an entertainment  program followed, featuring skits, poetry, speeches, songs and dramatic  readings.  </P> <P> AAH is the latest Hollywood-based organization to declare that homelessness is  not good. How does it differ from other groups? "We include homeless people on  our board of directors," said co-founder Tom Boyd. "We are not a political  organization, but a consciousness-raising organization," added Bill Duke, who  directed the show.  </P> <P> Among the crowd: Danny Glover, Louis Gossett Jr., Kate Mulgrew, Katey Sagal,  Ana Alicia, Rita Coolidge, Beverly Todd, Taurean Blacque, Rain Pryor and Bonnie  Bramlett.  </P> <P> "If you want to know what's going on with the homeless, ask me," said D. J.  Walker, a homeless man who addressed the crowd, adding, "When you all leave  here, you're going home."  </P> <P> Organizers claimed that, unlike other groups, they were welcoming the homeless.  They backed it up by taking donations instead of selling tickets and by not  serving an embarrassingly lavish buffet. Limousines were conspicuously absent  as well.  </P> <P> Everyone may be equal, but there was still a separate celebrity entrance, and  guest Gerry Power complained of being asked to move when he tried to sit down  in an unmarked seat -- seems he strayed into a celebrity-only area.  </P></p>

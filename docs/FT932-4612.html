			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (11): Airport expansion takes off to cope with traffic growth - Environmental factors now loom large NEARLY ALL airports are undergoing some form of modernisation and expansion to enable them to cope with the anticipated growth in passenger and cargo traffic over the rest of this decade. The Gulf War in 1991 severely depressed passenger traffic. The International Civil Aviation Organisation's statistics showed 1991 scheduled (domestic and international) passenger numbers down 3 per cent from 1.16bn in 1990 to 1.13bn. The subsequent recovery, albeit slowed by the recession, has been steady. In 1992, airlines carried 1.17bn passengers. The ICAO scheduled passenger forecast is for average annual growth up to 2001 of 5 per cent a year worldwide, with total passenger numbers reaching 1.8bn and freight 29m tonnes a year by that year. In Europe, that forecast means that the 1990s passenger total of 394m will reach 653m by the year 2000 and more than 1bn by 2010, even allowing for competition from the Channel Tunnel which is due to enter service in 1994. The tunnel may siphon off several million passengers a year from direct air services between the south-east of England and the near-Continent (Paris in particular). However, there will be less diversion from air to rail services the further into western Europe or to the north and west UK that intra-European passengers wish to travel. Airport authorities are thus obliged to think now about how they will cope with that anticipated traffic growth. They know it can take many years for airport expansion projects to move from conception to operational status. This is not only because such projects are among the biggest - and most expensive - individual civil engineering tasks, but also because increasingly their design and development are governed by environmental factors which did not affect airport developments in the early commercial aviation era. In the UK, the average time for an airport development to pass through all its planning, design, and construction phases is about 10 years. In some parts of Europe, it can take much longer - it took 30 years of political, financial and environmental wrangling before the Franz-Joseph Strauss airport at Munich emerged last year. Overall, it is estimated by the ICAO that between now and 2010, as much as Dollars 350bn will have to be spent worldwide on airport projects to meet traffic growth. That figure represents construction costs alone - terminal buildings, runways, aprons, and immediate direct access roads. It does not include fitting out for full operational status - radars, landing systems, furniture, internal decoration, and equipment costs such as fire equipment and information systems. Nor does it include ancillary costs that may be required, such as external road and raid links or external urban infrastructure costs to cover such supplies as gas, water, electricity, and aircraft fuel. If these costs are included, the total world airport development bill for the next 15 to 20 years could run closer to Dollars 400bn. The figure may seem high but becomes more understandable when one considers that the projected Terminal Five at Heathrow, London, is likely to cost Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m. It will cater for up to 30m passengers a year, bringing Heathrow's total to 80m passengers a year). The first phase of the new Terminal Two at Manchester, which opened earlier this year, has cost Pounds 265m. It will raise capacity from 12m to 18m passengers - a second phase will lift it to about 24m. A new terminal and associated facilities at Frankfurt is costing about Pounds 588m (DM1.5bn). Schiphol is well down the road on a Dollars 2.2m (Fl 3.5bn) expansion programme including a big new passenger terminal. Kansai Airport on reclaimed land in Osaka Bay, Japan, has cost more than Pounds 500m and Chek Lap Kok off Lantau Island, to replace Hong Kong's saturated Kai Tak, is likely to have cost even more when completed by 1997 with further outlays required for road links with the mainland. The latter developments - for offshore airports - illustrate what may become a trend in the light of increasing pressures on land and environmental constraints on noise and pollutant emissions, especially in congested areas, such as western Europe and south-east Asia. Only a few places in Europe have room for new runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle already has two and is destined to have a third by 1997, with additional terminals now available and more planned, to enable the airport to handle 80m passengers a year by the end of this decade. Space is available for another two runways on the Roissy site. Collectively, this makes Paris the biggest European rival to Heathrow for international air passenger and cargo traffic. Elsewhere in Europe, lack of space dictates that the expansion of facilities in anticipation of traffic growth is largely being met by extensions to terminals or the construction of new ones within existing airport boundaries. BAA, the former British Airports Authority, is planning Terminal Five at Heathrow to fight competition from nearby continental airports such as Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, and thus preserve London's pre-eminent position in European commercial aviation. The additional capacity will be achieved without additional runways. This will mean greater use of existing and new wide-bodied aircraft and possibly, within the next few years, 600-seat aircraft. The increase is within the current runway capacity at Heathrow, with no growth anticipated in night flights or the maximum hourly rate of movements. Many argue that this expansion at Heathrow is unacceptable, and that consideration should be given to alternative solutions before any government decision on Terminal Five is taken in 1997 after a public planning inquiry which is expected to start later this year. One alternative is the private-venture Marinair plan for an offshore two-runway airport on an artificial island in shallow water in the Thames Estuary near Sheerness, with passengers being conveyed by high-speed rail link from a main terminal at Tilbury on the north side of the Thames. Marinair, although imaginative, is not without precedent - the UK planned an offshore airport at Maplin off Essex in the early 1970s, but abandoned it at the time of the first oil crisis in 1974. The Marinair plan has been submitted to the government's special airports study group, Rucatse - Runway Capacity in the South-East. The project has begun to win considerable support, especially from environmental groups around Heathrow, and much is likely to be heard about it at the planning inquiry. Even so, its promoters know they will have to work hard to win its acceptance over the Terminal Five concept, which is being pressed strongly not only by BAA but also British Airways and other airlines using Heathrow. Whatever happens about Terminal Five, it is clear that the spate of airport improvements and developments will gather pace through the rest of this decade. Indeed, a continuously rolling programme of expansion is likely to emerge to meet the inexorable growth in passenger and cargo traffic. Even if offshore airports are currently the least favoured option for new developments in the crowded European environment, they may be more seriously considered early in the next century when planners will have to prepare for traffic growth beyond 2025.</p>

Attention should be  focused primarily on what is happening in the CIA, not on Russia  -- this, in rough terms, is the leitmotiv of statements heard in  recent days from a number of American politicians and  intelligence experts. Ames should have been exposed during lie  detector tests, THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER writes. Apparently  Ames underwent two such tests -- in 1986 and in 1991 -- during  which he was asked whether he had unauthorized contacts with  foreign intelligence services.    It is not impossible that the slight sobering of public  opinion in the United States is connected with the fragility of  the accusation. In the opinion of the influential WALL STREET  JOURNAL, it will be quite difficult to reach a guilty verdict  insofar as all evidence of the Ames' guilt is circumstantial.  The only weak link in the Ames' defense is their financial  position, William Cummings, legal adviser for the accused,  believes.    However, even here things are not so bad for the Ames. For  instance, the house which cost them over $500,000 was bought  back in 1987. Our experts consider it unlikely that Ames could  have obtained such a sum at that time, even taking account of  the value of the information he may have obtained and sold.  Provided, of course, it was indeed in 1985 that he started to  work for a foreign intelligence service, and not before.    A highly original version was put forward by the American  newspaper DAILY NEWS. Its journalists concluded that Ames was  an agent for the Cuban intelligence services since his time in  Mexico at the start of the 1980's coincided with a series of  failures by American agents working against Havana.</p>

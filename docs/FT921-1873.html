			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Life group suspends agents for retraining WINDSOR LIFE, a life assurance company, has 'voluntarily suspended' its 350 sales agents after a compliance review by Lautro, the industry's self-regulatory body. A spokesman for Windsor Life, based in Telford, Shropshire, said the agents had been suspended on Thursday. They would not be allowed to write new business until they had been retrained and adequate testing procedures had been put in place. 'It is a request, not a disciplinary proceeding,' he said. The spokesman acknowledged, however, that if sales had not ceased, the regulator was likely to have taken action. 'The issue is about weakness in compliance,' the spokesman said. It is not clear how long the suspension would last. 'The company wants to make sure they get it right,' he said. It may be weeks before the sales force will be allowed to seek new business. Lautro declined to comment on its talks with Windsor Life, which is wholly owned by New York Life, the US's fourth largest insurance company. It is believed, however, to have conducted a regularly scheduled compliance review in December and discovered that sales agents did not know enough about the design or cost of their own products, among other things. Failure to train sales agents properly goes to the heart of regulators' concerns about what is known as mis-selling: inducing consumers to purchase insurance policies which are inappropriate for their needs. Such policies are too frequently cancelled in the first few years of their life, causing consumers to lose a large portion of premiums paid. Sales agents who do not know enough about each client's circumstances or the costs and features of the products they recommend cannot meet regulatory requirements to offer 'best advice' and are likely to mis-sell. Lautro has only twice before sought a voluntary cessation of sales by a life insurance company and only once, just over a month ago, suspended a life insurance company's sales force for failure to comply with its rules. The sales agents involved are all either directly employed by Windsor Life or are 'tied agents' who work for an independent agency selling Windsor products exclusively. The spokesman said sales agents receive no salary, and are paid only by commissions earned on each policy sold. Windsor Life sells unit-linked policies. In 1991, its new business rose 22 per cent to Pounds 4m. As of December 31, it had Pounds 130m under management, but it has since bought Gresham Life, which had Pounds 490m under management.</p>

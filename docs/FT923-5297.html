			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: US set for showdown with China - Nancy Dunne and Laurie Morse on a lunge at Beijing's trade wall THE BUSH administration is girding for a high-stakes showdown of 'constructive engagement' in an attempt to force China to remove its import barriers. If it succeeds, China will promise to publish its rules, laws and regulations and agree to end product bans and quotas, import licensing and technical barriers to trade, such as phytosanitary (health and safety) standards, which present illegitimate impediments. Success would also mean critics of Beijing will have lost an excuse for attacking the growing US trade deficit with China, which is heading for over Dollars 15bn (Pounds 7.5bn) this year, and probably precipitate another collapse of the drive in Congress to place conditions on China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status. Failure will mean President Bush will have to lose face or impose billions of dollars in sanctions against the country for which he claims a special affinity, having been the first US envoy there in the 1970s. The deadline is October 10, one year from the day the US formally filed a Section 301 complaint against China for denial of market access. In preparation, the US has released a list of products, worth Dollars 3.9bn, which could be targeted for 100 per cent tariffs. Similar threats of retaliation, stemming from China's failure to protect patents, softwear, trademarks and other intellectual property from pirates, produced an agreement in January. But the whole exercise had to be endured: deadlines, threats, a list of potential sanctions, pleas by importers to keep sanctions off their products, and a last-minute settlement hailed by one and all. Most analysts see a similar conclusion to the current imbroglio. US officials argue the administration is helping China prepare for the day it may return to Gatt. The Chinese know a breakdown in talks could embolden congressmen to step up their criticism of China's MFN status. The Senate soon will vote on legislation, passed by the House of Representatives, which would require the president to accompany his yearly extension of China's MFN status by a report showing progress on human rights. China would be required every year to free more political prisoners, stop exporting 'slave labour' goods and abide by treaties governing export of missile technology and nuclear materials. Should China not meet these conditions, tariffs would be increased on exports from state-controlled Chinese industries, a feat the administration argues would be impossible to accomplish. Mr Ira Wolf, assistant US trade representative, told the Senate Finance Committee last month: 'Targeting exports of state enterprises, while appealing in theory, is unworkable in practice'. Suggestions have been made that failure to obtain a new accord and subsequent sanctions would spur China to hit back through its US wheat purchases. Beijing has been notably absent from the wheat market since November, 1991, leaving a gaping hole in the US export picture. China is the second largest US wheat customer; the former Soviet Union is the first, and it can now only buy when the US agriculture department extends credit. But China continues to receive regular shipments of US wheat, which it bought in a few large purchases last autumn. Wheat traders are confident China will return as a buyer once it has assessed the size of its own crop and is convinced US wheat prices have fallen to their harvest lows. China can use its wheat imports as a trump card. In the 1980s, it abstained from the US wheat market until the US agreed to keep China's textiles exports flowing. The longer it waits, the lower US prices will drift. But China was successful in playing its wheat card before the Tiananmen Square incident, and before most in the US Congress became convinced trade sanctions should be used over its human rights violations. That was also before the Soviet Union collapsed, when China seemed the more benign communist superpower. The current climate might give Congress more resolve in a trade stand-off. Failure by Beijing to buy wheat before the November elections could hurt Mr Bush in the US farm belt, where he is tarnished by his failure to make progress in disputes with the EC. But the Chinese would be more likely to time a purchase to help him: despite his recent stand against Beijing, he has been an ally for years. Mr Bush's opponent in the presidential election campaign, Mr Bill Clinton, threatens a tougher human rights line.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today expressed  the hope that the road to normalizing relations between Athens  and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  would open but stressed that it is risky to seek a timeframe for  achieving a solution. Papoulias said the time available for  reaching a solution is diminishing, and the delay, due to  Skopje's continuing intransigence, benefits no one. The foreign  minister did not rule out meeting with UN mediator Cyrus Vance  in New York, not next Monday, but later within the framework of  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's visit to the United States.  In the talks Vance will hold next Monday [11 April], Greece  will be represented by Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, director  general of the Foreign Ministry.    In his statement, the foreign minister also referred to  Greek-Albanian relations, which he described as good, because  the Greek side starts from the basic principle that relations  must be good for the sake of peace and stability in the region.  Answering a correspondent's questions seeking information on  the settlement of Albanians in Greek-speaking areas, Papoulias  said the wrong impressions are being created. He added that the  Greek Government follows any move by the Albanian side  carefully, especially with regard to inviolable minority rights.</p>

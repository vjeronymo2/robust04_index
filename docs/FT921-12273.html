			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch unveils record full-year earnings of Dollars 696m AN OUTSTANDING 1991 for Wall Street was sealed yesterday when the biggest US securities house, Merrill Lynch, unveiled full-year profits of Dollars 696.1m, the highest in the company's history. In 1990, profits totalled Dollars 191.9m. Merrill's record performance was achieved in the wake of a spectacular fourth quarter, when earnings raced up 463 per cent to Dollars 170.7m on the back of buoyant stock markets and heavy equity and bond underwriting activity. The improvement in revenues during the final quarter from all the company's businesses was mirrored in the full-year figures. The steady fall in interest rates over the year attracted many investors back to the stock market and, as a result, revenues from commissions over the year jumped 22 per cent to Dollars 2.1bn. In the last quarter, commissions rose 36 per cent to Dollars 556.1m. Earnings from principal transactions also soared in the wake of lower interest rates, a trend which favours broking houses with a big presence in equity and fixed-income markets. Merrill's revenues from trading on its own account reached Dollars 396m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 1.9bn in the year, well up on 1990. The company singled out its strong performance in trading high-yield securities and international equities, while trading in money markets, derivative products (especially swaps), and over-the-counter stocks also made a significant contribution to trading revenues. The most spectacular improvement came from investment banking, where earnings doubled in the last quarter to Dollars 374.8m and rose nearly 50 per cent in the full year to Dollars 1.175bn. Merrill benefited from a rush of new corporate stock and bond offerings as companies took advantage of lower interest rates and high stock prices. For the fourth consecutive year, the company was ranked the leading underwriter of debt and equity securities both in the US and worldwide.</p>

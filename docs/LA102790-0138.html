			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVERS FIND NO PAKISTAN VOTE FRAUD;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: THE INTERNATIONAL TEAM SAYS IT FOUND NO PROOF OF WIDESPREAD BALLOT  RIGGING, AS CHARGED BY OUSTED PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO.  </P> <P> An international observer team gave its tentative seal of approval Friday to  Pakistan's disputed national elections, saying it found no proof of widespread  ballot rigging or fraud.  </P> <P> Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has repeatedly charged that the  military-backed caretaker government used "massive fraud" to crush her populist  party in Wednesday's parliamentary elections.  </P> <P> Scattered "abuse and manipulation" and violence did occur, the team reported,  including the abduction and arrest of local party officials and the assaulting  and killing of several candidates and party workers.  </P> <P> But the elections "were generally open, orderly and well-administered,"  according to the 40-member delegation, led by the Washington-based National  Democratic Institute for International Affairs.  </P> <P> The group's verdict was probably Bhutto's best and last hope of challenging the  legitimacy of her political rivals in the right-wing Islamic Democratic  Alliance, who appear to be headed for a two-thirds majority in the National  Assembly.  </P> <P> The observer team said it "saw no evidence on election night" to back Bhutto's  charges that ballot boxes were switched and polling agents illegally expelled  from booths, according to a three-page preliminary report.  </P> <P> Ken Wollack, executive director of the National Democratic Institute, said  ballot tampering on a scale sufficient to cause the anti-Bhutto landslide  "would be very difficult but not impossible."  </P> <P> "But we do not believe it was (sufficient)," he told reporters at a briefing  here.  </P> <P> The team's co-leader, former Turkish Foreign Minister Vahit Halefoglu, agreed.  "This is not enough to alter the balloting or the vote," he said.  </P> <P> Gross disparities in local vote margins, compared to the 1988 election that put  Bhutto in power, appeared suspect because no one, including the winners, had  predicted the virtual rout of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party.  </P> <P> The National Democratic Institute will further analyze election returns before  preparing its final report, especially the returns from former Bhutto  strongholds in Sind and Punjab provinces, where her opponents won by  suspiciously lopsided margins. For now, no evidence "substantiates allegations  concerning irregular vote totals," the report said.  </P> <P> Aides said Bhutto was in tears after the unexpected defeat. Her campaign had  drawn huge, enthusiastic crowds, and she had predicted a strong comeback  victory 11 weeks after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed her 20-month-old  government for alleged corruption and misrule.  </P> <P> Despite Bhutto's confident election day prediction of winning 110 to 120 of the  217 seats in the Assembly, her party won only 45, losing more than half its  strength.  </P> <P> Her opponents in the Islamic Democratic Alliance won 105 seats overall. In  Punjab, which has 63% of Pakistan's people, they won 91 of the 114 seats at  stake. Bhutto's party won only 14.  </P> <P> Other parties and independents quickly offered support to the winners, giving  the anti-Bhutto coalition enough strength to amend the constitution and enact  laws.  </P> <P> The observer team was made up of representatives from 17 countries. They  visited about 500 polling booths in 30 constituencies on election day, Wollack  said.  </P> <P> The United States is eager to reach an agreement with the new government on  curbing Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. Continuing work on the program  caused the Bush Administration to suspend all economic and military aid to  Pakistan on Oct. 1, pending the outcome of the elections.  </P> <P> At a news conference, interim Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi insisted that  there is no change in Pakistan's nuclear program compared to 1989.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said the freeze is under review.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In his traditional Monday interview to the  Lithuanian radio, President Brazauskas has expressed indignation  over Western media-made accusations of Jewish genocide against  the whole Lithuanian nation. Mr. Brazauskas said that every  nation had its own criminals, but nobody can accuse and describe  a whole nation as a criminal entity. This was the underlying  principle of international law and everyone must keep to it,  said the Lithuanian president.    Mr. Brazauskas stressed that the Jewish genocide was  organized and carried out by Nazi Germany on occupied  territories. Therefore, Mr. Brazauskas did not see the  Lithuanian nation as the initiator of the mass murder of the  Jews. It is true that 8,000 Lithuanians had participated in the  mass killing of Jews, but compared to the Lithuanian population  of 3 million in those times, the total percentage of war  criminals was very small. Mr. Brazauskas pointed out that 700  out of 50,000 persons were refused rehabilitation papers, while  five rehabilitations were annulled after additional information  had been received by the prosecutor's office.</p>

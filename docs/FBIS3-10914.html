Presidency Minister  Andres Caldera Pietri said that the austerity program began on  inaugural day because the 50 million [currency not specified]  earmarked for the inauguration were not spent. The objectives  of this reorganization are to modernize and revamp the  secretariat as an organization that will help the head of state  do his work, to increase the efficiency of government  expenditures, to fully utilize management control systems, and  to restructure most functional areas.    After an arduous analysis, it was concluded that the best  thing to do was to eliminate the Ministry of the Secretariat of  the Presidency altogether and change it once more to the  Secretariat General of the Presidency, as it used to be before  the Public Administration Basic Law was reformed in 1976.    [Begin Caldera recording] We decided to decrease the fleet  of  vehicles serving the Presidency Secretariat by 50 percent, thus  reducing insurance costs as well as expenses on spare parts,  repairs, and so on. During the first month of the current  administration the Presidency Secretariat decreased its fuel  costs by 43.3 percent, per diem and travel expenses by 43.7  percent, office equipment expenses by 46.3 percent, kitchen and  butler service expenses by 26.8 percent, and newspaper and  magazine expenses by 77 percent. In addition, the number of  telephone lines with access to international and national long  distance calls was decreased by 62 and 30 percent, respectively.  These cuts will undoubtedly cause reductions in telephone bills.    The second part, which is essential to this reorganization,  will consist of reassignments at 14 institutions that are under  the Presidency Secretariat. They make the administration more  burdensome, and their work is unrelated to that of the  secretariat's. Some of these institutions will be reassigned to  organizations whose activities are more related to the works of  said institutions. This will be achieved by amending the law,  as is the case with autonomous institutions, and by issuing  presidential decrees in meetings with the Council of Ministers,  as is the case with foundations. [end recording]    Minister Caldera announced that from now on, the Miraflores  Bicentennial Square will be open to the public on Sundays.  There will be entertainment for children in the mornings and  concerts for adults in the afternoons.</p>

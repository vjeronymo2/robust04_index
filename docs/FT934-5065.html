			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Saint Augustine rides again The Budget should please the most fiercely opposed schools of fiscal commentators. Those most intent on balancing the Budget will be pleased to see a faster path for reducing the deficit than the one projected by Norman Lamont. A borrowing requirement of Pounds 38bn is projected for next year, compared with an original projection of Pounds 44bn; and for 1996-97 the projection has been reduced from Pounds 35bn to Pounds 21bn. Indeed the projections have now been pushed out to 1998-99, showing a virtually balanced Budget. And as a percentage of GDP the public sector borrowing requirement is expected to fall from 7 3/4 per cent this year to 5 1/2 per cent next year, and 2 3/4 per cent in 1996-97. The picture could have been made to look better still if Kenneth Clarke had been more interested in the separate estimate of net capital spending which now appears prominently for the first time in the Budget Red Book. If this is taken off the public spending total, the public sector emerges with a current deficit of 4 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 and 1 1/4 per cent in 1996-97. This is well within the limits of safe borrowing according to almost any theory of the permissible Budget deficit. If we continue the same projection, there is a current balance the following year and a current surplus of 1 1/4 per cent of GDP by 1998-99. Let us please have no sneers at the Treasury for projecting trends towards the end of the century. It is commonplace that the full effects of decisions taken now are felt several years ahead. The Treasury used to be criticised for short termism when it put all the emphasis on the immediately coming fiscal year. So let us not criticise it for trying to look a little further ahead. On the other hand, those of us who regard the national Budget as a matter of economic policy, and who distrust the analogy between the government's finances and those of a household or corporation, can also find some cheer. For there is very little in the Budget that will reduce demand or slow down the recovery in the next year and a half. For those who accepted Norman Lamont's last Budget, with its deferred tax increases, as a reasonable compromise between the two schools of thought, there is little more to swallow. For like his predecessor, the present chancellor has been an apt pupil of St Augustine, who asked God to make him chaste, but not yet. Looking further ahead, the Treasury is obviously relying on world economic recovery and a self-generated upturn to offset the fiscal tightening in the pipeline. Nevertheless Mr Clarke has planned to reduce public sector borrowing by Pounds 6 1/2 bn even in 1994-95, an amount corresponding to 1 per cent of GDP. How has he managed to do this? The table shows that he has done this overwhelmingly by curbing general government expenditure, which is to be reduced by Pounds 5 1/2 bn below that planned by Mr Lamont. By the later 1990s the proportions will be reversed. In 1997-98, for example, some Pounds 11bn of the planned Pounds 18bn tightening will come from higher taxes and contributions. How has the chancellor managed his 1994-95 feat? My gut view is that the forward projections were always too pessimistic and that economic recovery and lower inflation have done the rest. But readers have a right to know the Treasury arithmetic and not just my instincts. The detail of this may surprise people. For, of the Pounds 5 1/2 bn reduction in planned spending next year, some Pounds 2bn comes from lower debt interest and reduced spending on social security due, not to any of the new measures, but to economic recovery. The whole of the remaining Pounds 3 1/2 bn comes from a reduction in the reserve (previously called, more informatively, contingency reserve) planned for next year. An unscrupulous official Opposition spokesman could here cry 'foul', and hardly more than two or three Conservative MPs, if that, would be able to answer. But if we are interested not in point scoring but in the logic of programme planning, it makes complete sense to reduce the reserve in this way. For the Treasury has, quite sensibly, a reserve which increases in size the further ahead one goes. As the coming financial year approaches, it reduces the reserve for that year by Pounds 3 1/2 bn and pushes the whole series out a year further. If there are any virtuous public spending economies, it is in holding down the demands of the spending departments, so that the Treasury did not feel obliged to allocate the reserve among spending programmes but has left it in at a normal figure. On the tax side the interest lies not in the extra burden next year, but in how the chancellor expects to raise more revenue by the middle and later 1990s. The most important single item is higher excise duties on road fuels; the second most important is the reduction in the married couple's allowance to 15 per cent; and the third is a similar reduction in mortgage interest relief. The fourth most important item is an insurance premium tax, which is a slight step towards reducing privileges and gaps in the tax base. It is only when it comes to the fifth most important item, higher taxes on tobacco, that one sees the hand of the Virginia Bottomley nanny state. The Treasury's economic forecasts have become a little more cheerful. Next year's bulge in the underlying RPI is expected to stay well below the upper 4 per cent government inflation range. For once this projection and that of continuing further reductions in inflation seems credible so long as the government avoids a pre-election dash for growth, 'benign neglect' of sterling and all the other temptations. Non-North Sea real GDP is now expected to rise by 1 3/4 per cent this year, and 2 1/4 per cent in 1994-95. But it is not until 1995 onwards that output will be rising by something near the 3 per cent rate required to make serious inroads into the gap between actual and potential output, which is the real measure of economic depression. Looking at the bare numbers, the growth projections still seem too low to make many inroads into the margin of unused capacity until well into 1995. On the other hand, the actual behaviour of unemployment, the CBI Survey of unused capacity and the government's own social security projections suggest that the margin of slack is already declining. There is a consistency problem to sort out in the economic indicators. Of course, a market-oriented government cannot plan growth directly. But it can have a policy for the growth of spending in cash terms, which is approximated by nominal GDP. The projections here are 6 per cent plus growth for the next couple of years, then declining to the 5 to 6 per cent range, These seem adequate to finance non-inflationary growth. But the trouble is that they are only projections, and there is no sign of a government commitment to make it happen, even roughly as a trend. To make this serious, an international rather than a merely parochial medium-term financial strategy is required. It is all too easy to blame the Bundesbank for not being keen on the idea. But there is not the slightest sign that the Treasury or the Bank is doing anything to push it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Changes from March 1993 projections, Pounds bn           1993-94   1994-95   1995-96   1996-97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Expenditure New control total                   -1/2     3 1/2    -1 1/2    -3 Other                               -1/2    -2 1/2    -2        -3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government expenditure   -1         -5 1/2    -3 1/2    -6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Taxes and National Insurance   contributions                     -1/2     2         5        -7 1/2 Debt interest, etc                   -      -1 1/2      -1/2    -1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government receipts      -1            -      -4 1/2    -6 1/2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Public corporations' market and   overseas borrowing                 -        -1/2      -1/2    -1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PSBR                                -1/2    -6 1/2    -8       -13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Red Book  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

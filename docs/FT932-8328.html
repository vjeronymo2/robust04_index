			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bombardier to issue new class of stock BOMBARDIER, the Canadian international aerospace and transit equipment maker, plans to raise funds later this year by issuing a new class of convertible preferred stock. Details will be made public after the creation of the new stock comes up for shareholder approval at the annual meeting in Montreal on June 22. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, confirmed in Toronto that the dividend rate on the stock will be geared to Bombardier's common share dividend policy. An increase in common dividends will mean a higher preferred share payout, but he refused to give further details. Mr Beaudoin said the company plans the preferred issue partly to avoid further dilution of its common stock. Also, Bombardier shares have been depressed in the market by the company's CDollars 450m (USDollars 353m) claim against Trans-Manche Link to cover additional work on its CDollars 750m Channel Tunnel wagon contract. He said Bombardier has already accounted for 'an important portion' of the estimated losses on the contract.</p>

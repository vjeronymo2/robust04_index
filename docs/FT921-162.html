			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Allianz/Dresdner There is something peculiar about the attempt by Germany's cartel office to force Allianz to cut its stake in Dresdner Bank. The office's interest in life insurance is natural, since Europe-wide efforts at liberalisation will not work without effective competition at national level. But it is hard to see why the Dresdner Bank stake should be the focus of attack, even though Allianz may exercise influence on the bank through indirect holdings over and above its declared interest of 22 per cent. Allianz's complex relationships within the insurance sector itself ought to be a much more fruitful avenue of investigation. That said, the Allianz-Dresdner connection is all the more powerful because both have wide-ranging investments in German industry. Were the cartel office to win, it would have created a precedent that could weaken the grip of the financial sector on the broader economy. Ultimately, that would imply greater scope for the development of merger and acquisition activity. Of the two, Dresdner has more to lose. It distributes only a small proportion of Allianz's products, and its share price will be held back by uncertainty over the outcome of what could be a protracted affair. Yesterday's 5 per cent fall in Allianz appeared a more dramatic response than Dresdner's 2 per cent loss. But this reflected the insurer's current rights issue, without which the paper would barely have moved at all.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Oil companies to sign Azerbaijan extraction deal Partners in a British Petroleum-led consortium of western oil companies expect to sign a Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) extraction deal with the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan tomorrow The contract will represent a breakthrough after four years of hard negotiations. It is the first big western oil deal signed in the energy-rich region since Russia asserted its right to a primary role on the Caspian Sea about a year ago. Delegations from most of the eight western oil companies involved flew to the Azeri capital of Baku last night. The two offshore fields, known as Azeri and Chirag, contain an estimated 4bn barrels of oil; the extraction deal is estimated to be worth an eventual Dollars 118bn. Azerbaijan is to receive 80 per cent of the proceeds, and the consortium the remainder, sources said. The contract comes after setbacks in the consortium's attempt to extract oil from Azerbaijan, including a seemingly solid agreement which fell through in June last year when Azerbaijan's government was ousted in a coup. The deal includes a strong Russian involvement in Azerbaijan; the Caspian republic grudgingly returned to Moscow's fold during the coup's aftermath. The Russian firm Lukoil will have a 10 per cent stake in the foreign consortium and has also been granted a primary role in developing a third, adjacent oilfield called Guneshli. 'Everybody is very pleased with the contract,' said Mr Steve Remp, chairman of Ramco Energy, one of the western partners. Two other major contracts have been signed on the inland sea, both in Kazakhstan, one being Chevron's agreement to exploit the Tengiz oilfield, the ex-Soviet Union's biggest single western oil deal. However, no drilling or new oil flow has begun, largely because of obstacles thrown up by Moscow, which argues that it deserves a big part in the deals because Russian engineers found and developed the fields during the Soviet period. Western analysts, meanwhile, have asserted that Russian government and military officials are also intent on retaining a strong political influence in the region by restructuring its energy development and resulting economic independence. The current contract is the product of six weeks of final negotiation in Houston which finished last Thursday. The consortium partners were notified almost immediately that Mr Heydar Aliyev, the Azerbaijan president, had approved it subject to parliamentary ratification. Other members of the consortium include Statoil, Pennzoil, McDermott and Turkish Petroleum. The two sides did not resolve a dispute over how the oil will be transported out of the region, and negotiation on a pipeline were to begin almost immediately after the signing. Moscow has insisted that the consortium use the existing pipeline route through Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossisk. But some western analysts have seen this as a Russian attempt to maintain its economic control over ex-Soviet energy and that a proposed alternate route ending at the Turkish port of Ceyhan would be more economical, as well as wiser politically for Azerbaijan.</p>

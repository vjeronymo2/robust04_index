			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Thorn EMI's lighting business has been on the auction block so long that it comes as something of a relief that the hammer has finally fallen. Whether it is worth another 3 per cent on the share price, though, is a moot point. The Pounds 162m consideration is fair for a capital intensive business with a big exposure to flickering European markets, but it is nothing to get excited about. Thorn should receive some additional gain from retaining a 12 per cent stake. Nevertheless, the deal will marginally dilute earnings this year. The market, though, prefers to focus on the 'clean' rentals and music business that is emerging from Thorn's once-sprawling empire. Rental and music will have increased their share of Thorn's operating profits from some 57 per cent four years ago to perhaps 95 per cent this year. The process will effectively be complete once the security and electronics businesses are sold - although this may take some time given their complexity. Certainly, it is hard to argue there was ever much industrial logic in bundling together light bulbs, sonar systems and CDs. But applying separate ratings to Thorn's music and rental arms gives a total market worth little different from where its stands today. It is not yet clear that Thorn's long march towards demerger will greatly enhance shareholder value.</p>

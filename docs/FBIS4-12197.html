			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] First to 'Afula where a car bomb exploded three  meters from a bus. Latest reports say five people were killed,  another 35 at least wounded. The incident occurred near a  cultural center. Apparently there was a suicide bomber in the  car. Neil Samba has the story. Neil:    [Samba] The explosion occurred at around 1230 near the  cultural center of 'Afula not far from the town's ... er, in the  center of the 'Afula, not far from the town's main auditorium.  Latest reports speak of five dead and 35 injured, but these  figures are changing and constantly being updated. Reports from  [words indistinct] say that the injuries range from light to  serious. Some of the injured were on the bus and others were  waiting at a nearby bus station. All of the injured are being  taken to the (?Haemic) hospital. The evacuation continues at  this hour. We've just heard though that two of those seriously  injured were taken to Haifa, Haifa's Rambam hospital. Northern  district police commander Jacob Grenel was the first to confirm  that it was in fact a car bomb that exploded near an Egged bus,  but he said it's not clear whether it was a suicide bomber or  whether the bomb was set off by remote control.    The explosion took place three to four meters from a bus  stop. [passage omitted]. Dozens of ambulances arrived on the  scene within minutes after the explosion and the police closed  off the area. Police reinforcements were sent into the town and  engineers are combing the area. The center of 'Afula has been  closed off. [passage omitted] A lot of details are still  unclear at this time.</p>

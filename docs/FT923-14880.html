			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Thames group says it will bid for Channel 5 likely to be the minimum of Pounds 1,000 a year - for the Channel 5 franchise to the Independent Television Commission on Tuesday. It will almost certainly be the only mainstream bid for the commercial television franchise capable of reaching 75 per cent of the UK population with conventional transmitters. The Channel 5 Holdings consortium - which, apart from Thames, includes Sony Pictures International, the Hollywood studios group, and Canwest Global Communications, a Canadian international broadcaster - yesterday decided to go ahead with the project. The decision was taken even though virtually every other known potential applicant has pulled out. 'If anyone bids Pounds 3,000 then they're overbidding by Pounds 2,000,' said Mr Jeremy Fox, chief executive of The Entertainment Channel, a potential rival for the franchise, which produced a bid application but decided this week that the risk was too great. The Channel 5 Holdings bid is being put together by Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, the largest ITV company. Thames lost its ITV franchise in last year's competitive tenders. Thames would have a 15 per cent stake in the venture - the maximum allowed if it is to have the status of an independent producer. Channel 5 Holdings is not a fully funded venture - so a significant part of its equity would have to be raised if it won the licence. There is no guarantee, however, that the commission will award the licence for what is one of the last opportunities in western Europe for a new channel using conventional broadcasting technology. The factor that has helped to frighten off most of the potential bidders is that the eventual operator will have a legal requirement to pay for the retuning of several million home video recorders - the Channel 5 signal will cause some interference. Sir George Russell, chairman of the commission, has called this obligation a potential nightmare and made it clear that if he thought the commission might be overwhelmed by complaints from video owners, he would not award the licence. The Thames-led bid will draw on the expertise of the TV rental business of its parent Thorn-EMI to tackle the retuning, although it is still expected to cost around Pounds 50m. Even if the retuning can be dealt with successfully, a Channel 5 operator will have to pay for its own transmitters and, in most parts of the country, persuade viewers to buy a new aerial. Channel 5 will then have to compete with the existing four terrestrial channels and against the increasing choice offered by satellite television. The service proposed by Channel 5 Holdings would begin in London and move gradually to the rest of the country. In addition to a national service each city would have a segment of local programmes. One other less conventional bid is possible. Dr Stephen Castell, a telecommunications specialist, said yesterday that he had not ruled out making a bid which would exploit digital technology, enabling four or five channels to be squeezed into the single Channel 5. There would be no interference problem, but viewers would need decoders to convert the digital signal. Dr Castell said yesterday that Channel 5 would be worth a bid of 'tens of millions of pounds.' and that he would finance the venture by a share offering to the public. However, it is doubtful whether Dr Castell will be able to convince the ITC that he can launch a Channel 5 service by the commission's final deadline of January 1 1995.</p>

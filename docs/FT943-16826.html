			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / KPMG to invite outside directors KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second-largest accountancy firm, is poised to appoint non-executive directors to its governing board as part of a restructuring. Mr Colin Sharman, senior partner, plans to add a number of non-accountants with outside experience - including senior business executives to help advise the firm - over the next few months. The plan emerged as the senior partners met yesterday to debate whether to incorporate the firm in some form. The 25 'general partners' discussed possible re-organisation models that might help limit their liability in the event of litigation. The plans could be implemented by the beginning of October, the start of KPMG's new financial year. Some of its competitor firms have expressed doubts whether incorporation would be either cheaper or protect partners' assets. KPMG may ultimately consider restructuring the existing dozen individual partnerships that comprise the UK firm and modifying the status of the general partners who receive profits from across all the individual practices. It also emerged yesterday that KPMG's affiliate in the Netherlands is considering changing its structure from partnership to a corporate entity, while the US firm is preparing to register as a limited partnership in Delaware in an effort to provide partial protection to the personal assets of its partners.</p>

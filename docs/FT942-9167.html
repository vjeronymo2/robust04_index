			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sandvik sees improvement continuing Sandvik, the Swedish cemented carbide and speciality steel group, said yesterday it expected a 'significant' improvement in its 1994 result after lifting first-quarter profits by 29 per cent. Like other Swedish exporters, the group is benefiting from a weak currency and cost-cutting, assisted by recovering demand in many important markets and the improved business climate in Europe. Profits after financial items for the quarter rose to SKr626m (Dollars 80.8m) from SKr486m as sales expanded to SKr5.79bn from SKr5.3bn. The group said six percentage points of the 10 per cent sales rise was due to price and volume increases, and the rest to currency and structural changes. Operating profit was 46 per cent higher at SKr566m. Improved demand was shown in a 19 per cent rise in orders to SKr6.73bn. Mr Per-Olof Eriksson, presenting his last report as group president, said: 'Order intake is increasing in most European countries. The already strong demand in the US and Canada continues unabated, as well as in South America and southeast Asia.' The two weak markets were Japan and Germany.</p>

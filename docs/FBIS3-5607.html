"The action does not represent a significant meaning for  Japan," he said.    The comment came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor said Tuesday that the office of the United States Trade  Representative (USTR) is considering eight trade areas in which  Japan may be the target of retaliation under Super 301.    The official from the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI), who declined to be identified, said the eight  areas must have been chosen from findings in an annual USTR  survey on global trading practices released a year ago.    Under the revived Super 301 law, the U.S. will list trade  practices deemed unfair to U.S. products, using findings from  the national trade estimate report set for release at the end of  March. Washington would then have until September 30 to single  out priority countries engaged in unfair trading.    Trade categories being named in the upcoming USTR report are  not automatically subject to sanctions under Super 301, the  official said.    The eight named are the insurance, lumber, paper products,  flat glass, computers, supercomputers, telecommunications  equipment and medical products markets.    On four-point market-opening measures to be released by  Japan  at the end of March, the MITI official said the package will be  divided into two areas -- one ready for immediate enforcement  and the other coming under further study for implementation.    The package will feature deregulation, import and investment  promotion, competition policy and reforms in the government  procurement process. He declined to give further details such  as which areas would be given immediate enforcement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has pledged  to develop a new type of "vegetable basket" within the coming  three years.    The Shanghai Municipal Government has formed a special  committee for the project headed by Mayor Huang Ju and leaders  of departments such as the agriculture commission, finance and  trade office and financial bureau.    With the development of the urban economy the land in the  suburbs is sure to be developed. To ensure sufficient land for  planting vegetables Shanghai has allocated 200 million yuan for  the development of 5,000 ha of vegetable land on the city  outskirts. Some bases for breeding of pigs, chickens and ducks  have also been removed.    At present, annually 10,000 tons of high-quality vegetables  are supplied to the markets of Shanghai. The scale of livestock  raising is growing.    The continuous raising of prices through market circulation  used to be the main problem for vegetable projects. The city is  now taking measures to develop direct sales. Many large  enterprises and higher learning institutions are provided with  vegetables directly by the vegetable bases. This year the  municipal government has invested in the construction of 13  secondary agricultural product wholesale markets.    The Shanghai Municipal Government has made a rule that in  every district and street, within 300 m to 500 m, there must be  at least one vegetable market.    The mayor said that the new "vegetable basket project" must  be completed within three years.</p>

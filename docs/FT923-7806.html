			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Major Major Major I FIND John Major puzzling. Nothing ever daunts him. The British prime minister has backed himself into a shockingly tight corner on the UK economy and the European exchange rate mechanism, yet he just keeps smiling. Bullets bounce off him. He is unmarked by criticism. No foe can vanquish him. He continues to watch cricket and to enjoy simple food. He is obviously a happy man, loved by the people. He smiles like a saint. I think I have found the reason. I stumbled on it this week when reading Barry Gifford's novel, The Wild Life of Sailor and Lula, in which Gifford, en passant, recounts the story of the five Chinese brothers. The five Chinese brothers were identical and lived with their mother. One brother could swallow the sea; another had an iron neck; another could stretch his legs an unlimited distance; another could not be burned; the fifth could hold his breath for ever. The Chinese brother who could swallow the sea went fishing one morning with a small boy who had begged to accompany him. The Chinese brother allowed the small boy to go with him on condition that he obey the brother's orders promptly. The boy promised he would do so. At the shore, the Chinese brother swallowed the sea and gathered some fish while holding the water in his mouth. The boy ran out and started to collect items of treasure. The Chinese brother signalled for his companion to return but the boy did not pay any attention. The brother motioned frantically for the boy to come back, for he knew he would burst unless he released the sea. But his friend did not respond. The brother let the sea go and the boy disappeared. The Chinese brother was arrested and condemned to have his head severed. On the day of execution he asked the judge if he could be allowed to go home and say goodbye to his mother. The judge agreed, and the Chinese brother who could swallow the sea went home. The brother who returned was the brother with an iron neck. All the people in the town gathered in the square to see the sentence carried out, but when the executioner brought his sword down, it bent, and the head was not severed. The crowd became angry and demanded that he be drowned. On the day of execution this brother asked if he could go home and bid his mother farewell. The judge permitted it. The brother who returned was the one capable of stretching his legs. When he was thrown overboard in the middle of the ocean he rested his feet on the bottom and kept his head above water. The people were furious and decided he should be burned. On the day of execution the Chinese brother asked permission to go home and say goodbye to his mother. The judge said: 'It is only fair,' and agreed to it. The brother who returned was the one who could not catch on fire. He was tied to a stake and stacks of wood were lit, but the Chinese brother remained unscathed. The people became so infuriated that they decided he should be smothered to death. On the day of execution, the Chinese brother asked to be allowed to go home to see his mother. The judge agreed. 'It is only fair,' he said. The brother who returned was the fifth brother, the one who could hold his breath indefinitely. He was pushed into a brick oven filled with whipped cream and the door was locked tight until the next morning. When the door was opened and the Chinese brother emerged unharmed, the judge declared that since they had attempted to execute him four different ways, to no avail, he must be innocent, and ordered the Chinese brother released, a decision supported by all the people. The fifth Chinese brother then went home to his mother and he and his brothers lived happily ever after. I read this story with mounting excitement. Later, I dialled No 10 Downing Street and asked to speak to the first John Major. You can do this if you have the special codes and if they know you. I was connected at once. 'How extremely nice of you to telephone me,' said the first John Major. Ten minutes later I dialled again and asked to speak to the second John Major. I was connected at once. 'How extremely nice . . .' he said. I dialled three times more. There are five John Majors living in Downing Street. I believe they are there for good.</p>

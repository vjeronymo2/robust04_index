			<p>BFN     [Text] The Presidium of the Sixth Crimean Supreme Council  today adopted a law of the Crimean Republic on restoring the  constitutional foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood.  Thus, the fundamental law of the Crimean Republic from 6 May  1992 was restored on the territory of the peninsula.    In this way, the deputies ignored an appeal by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk, asking them not to take such a  dangerous step aimed at encroaching upon Ukraine's territorial  integrity. (?As early as yesterday), Crimean President Meshkov  asked the deputies to temporarily suspend the debate on this  issue. Deputies, however, did not listen.    Arguments in favor of restoring the constitution in its  previous form were voiced at the session, mainly referring to  the Crimean people's [word indistinct] and will expressed during  a presidential poll. It was emphasized that a return to the  previous constitution does not mean Crimea's secession from  Ukraine. Article (?11) of the constitution from 6 May 1992  states that the Crimean Republic is a part of Ukraine, and that  its relations with Ukraine are based on agreements and treaties.  The law of the Crimean Republic on restoring the constitutional  foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood was adopted  without including it on the agenda; 69 out of 83 deputies  present at the session voted for adopting it. The session also  appointed a delegation for talks with the Ukrainian Supreme  Council.</p>

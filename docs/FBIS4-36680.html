			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lakhdar Brahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary  general, arrived in al-Mukalla at 1800 today on his mission to  establish the facts surrounding the war being fought in Yemen  and with the objective of bringing about implementation of the  UN Security Council cease-fire resolution. In a statement to  the Yemeni News Agency, Aden, he said his presence here was to  continue talks with the brother officials on the same issues as  discussed in Sanaa. He went on to say: I believe that the  sides concerned are those in the north and south of Yemen. What  we have heard is that they all want a cease-fire, which is what  we want and want to implement.    Brahimi stressed that first and foremost was the  substantiation of the cease-fire. We shall be talking with the  brothers about this matter; everything has to be talked about.  He expressed regret over the violation of the cease-fire,  saying he hoped it would finally be implemented. [passage  omitted]</p>

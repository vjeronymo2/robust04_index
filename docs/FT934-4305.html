			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Focused fight on wage rises urged Unions should not mount a national campaign of action against the government's planned three-year freeze of public-sector wages, Mr John Edmonds, head of the GMB general union, said yesterday. Instead, he said, unions should use workers with political muscle to set a fair 'going rate' for others to follow. 'In the early 1980s cash limits were made unworkable thanks to an effective going-rate strategy,' he said. He said the freeze, with flexibility for special groups, was 'power bargaining at its most naked'. But he also said he detected a pragmatic, opportunistic stance in the way it was likely to be implemented. TUC officials say that a sector-by-sector approach is likely to be more fruitful than a national campaign. However Unison, the biggest public-service union, may still push for co-ordinated action between local-government workers and civil servants, especially in the light of the relatively successful one-day stoppage against market testing on November 5. The unions will be hoping for a lead from the independent pay review bodies, covering 2m public-sector work-ers, due to report in January. The government's own evidence to the nurses review body calls for a phasing-out of the right of workers in hospital trusts to hold their nationally negotiated pay terms. 'The intention is to enable trusts to implement schemes for all their staff irrespective of whether they had opted for new locally determined employment contracts,' the Department of Health said.</p>

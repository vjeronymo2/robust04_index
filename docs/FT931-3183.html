			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Few gains and some new pain - With its focus on business, the package involves little change for individuals The chancellor's focus on reviving the business sector meant that this was largely a 'so what?' Budget for the individual. Such measures as were announced were bad for most people - in particular, the introduction of VAT on fuel and power, which will be particularly felt by the poor. On the direct taxation side, the main impact will be the restriction to 20 per cent of reliefs on mortgage interest, the married couple's allowance and company dividends. A lot of the other direct tax announcements involved 'no change' - to personal allowances, the higher rate band, the annual capital gains tax allowance and the inheritance tax threshold. Given the steady drag of inflation, this effectively (but surreptitiously) leaves individuals worse off. Apart from fuel, the main indirect tax changes - on petrol, alcohol, tobacco and others - were the sort of clobbering consumers have come to expect from Budgets. For the personal saver, there was little change, apart from the restriction on BES plans involving loans. The 'dogs that did not bark' included the inclusion of gilts within personal equity plans, a change widely expected in the industry but which the chancellor, despite his need to sell government securities, decided not to deliver. However, some good news emerged. National Savings is relaunching its First Option Bond, which proved so attractive to savers last year that the building societies bitterly complained. The new bond will pay 6.34 per cent gross, if held for one year. Furthermore, there were increases in the amount of other certificates savers can hold - from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000 for both the 40th fixed and the 6th index-linked issues.</p>

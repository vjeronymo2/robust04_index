			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Smiths' shares lifted by medical growth SMITHS Industries' shares gained more than 10 per cent yesterday after the UK group reported better than expected results, confirming that growth in its medical systems business was more than offsetting the decline in civil and military aerospace. Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 rose to Pounds 104.6m, against Pounds 102.2m. Sales, boosted Pounds 57m by acquisitions, increased from Pounds 635m to Pounds 726m. The shares gained 39p to close at 394p, matching this year's high. Medical systems, which increased trading profits by more than 40 per cent to Pounds 41.3m, for the first time contributed more to the group's annual results than the aerospace division, which saw trading profits fall 8 per cent to Pounds 40.5m. The industrial division increased trading profits from Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 21m, helped by an eight-month contribution from Vent-Axia, the fans maker bought for Pounds 58m last December. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said the group had shed 1,000 aerospace jobs, evenly split between the UK and US, over the 12 months. In the past three years the number of employees in aerospace has fallen by a third, from 8,800 to 5,800, and now comprises little more than half the total workforce of 11,200. Mr Hurn said the downturn in the production of commercial jets and defence cuts meant restructuring and job cuts would continue in aerospace. 'The process must continue because the downturn has not yet bottomed out.' The chairman believed there would eventually be a recovery in aerospace  - particularly on the civil side, when a return to profitability by the US domestic airlines would enable them to invest in bigger, more efficient and quieter aircraft. He said: 'I am confident there will be an upturn in the second half of the 1990s - my problem is knowing when it will start.' The improved performance by medical systems was evenly split between organic growth and the effect of acquisitions - in particular the Pounds 66m purchase last October of Intertech Resources, a US disposable medical products company. The group's net cash balances fell to Pounds 34m from Pounds 120m last year, following the purchases of Vent-Axia and Intertech. Operating cashflow increased from Pounds 110m to Pounds 121m. Spending on research and development reached a new peak of Pounds 118m (Pounds 115m), of which Smiths funded Pounds 49m (Pounds 46m) and customers the rest. Mr Hurn said: 'We have made significant acquisitions while generating an excellent cash-flow from operations. 'Looking ahead, I am confident that our medical and industrial businesses will continue to increase their contribution to profits.' Although earnings rose by only 2.6 per cent to 23.9p (23.3p), a final dividend of 7.55p (7.15p) gives a total for the year of 11.85p (11.25p), an increase of 5.3 per cent. Lex, Page 24</p>

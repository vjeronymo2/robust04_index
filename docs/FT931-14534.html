			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Opportunity lost through ACT system Sir, As a UK tax adviser working in the Netherlands, I often walk into the brick wall that the ACT system erects on the use of the UK as a holding company jurisdiction ('Failure to act on surplus distorts companies' behaviour', January 12). While my European colleagues are able to expound the virtues of their tax systems in an attempt to create additional investment in their countries, the best advice I can give is normally to move investments from the UK. Every day I therefore witness lost business opportunities to other European countries directly caused by the UK's ACT system. The Department of Trade and Industry is right to be concerned. I would whole-heartedly support an 'international holding company' regime. Not only would that play to the strength of the professional service and banking sectors in the UK, it should also cause an increase of revenue for the government on the basis that the well-advised company would not come to the UK at present. Such a regime could be successful. There would be a willing 'sales force' in the professional community. Persuading the tax authorities to support their efforts would undoubtedly be more difficult. This could turn out to be a case for intervention before afternoon tea at the Inland Revenue. Michael Townsend, Noorderstraat 101, 1017 TT Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p>

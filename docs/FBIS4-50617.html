			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843)] </F>   [Text] Stockholm, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, met with Swedish Foreign Trade Minister  Dinkelspiel here this afternoon. The two firmly believe that  there are broad prospects for mutually beneficial economic  cooperation and trade between China and Sweden.    Li Ruihuan said: Sweden is up to the world's highest  standards in the fields of transport, telecommunications,  energy, and medicine. Over the last decade and more, many  Swedish enterprises have actively entered the market in China,  and a number of new Sino- Swedish joint ventures are being set  up. "We welcome more Swedish enterprises to take an active part  in competition in the Chinese market. We are glad to see that  the Swedish Government takes a positive attitude toward the  development of Sino-Swedish economic relations and trade."    Dinkelspiel said: At present, Swedish enterprises are  greatly interested in the Chinese market and both their trade  volume and investment in China are increasing. The Swedish  Government is making efforts to promote the economic cooperation  and trade between the two countries. He said that the Swedish  Government supports the restoration of China's signatory status  in the GATT because it helps promote global trade and conforms  to the interests of the Swedish people.</p>

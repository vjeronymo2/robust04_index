			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 8 Feb (EFE) -- Dozens of peasant and  Indian organizations in several Mexican states are backing the  rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) movement and  threatening to join the armed struggle in a demand for economic  and political reforms.    Since the EZLN revolted in Chiapas on 1 January, dozens of  human rights, political, religious, Indian, and peasant  organizations have expressed their "moral support" for the  rebels' demands, especially the fight against poverty. In past  weeks, however, many of those organizations have taken more  radical positions by demanding immediate solutions to their  economic problems and threatening to join the EZLN ranks.    Approximately 400 peasants who grow sugar cane in the  eastern  state of Michoacan threatened today to take up arms and join the  EZLN if the government does not reopen its sugar mill, which was  closed one year ago. The peasants are former workers of the  Puruaran sugar mill, which is located 120 km from the Morelia,  the capital of Michoacan. The peasants asserted that they will  muster hundreds of Purepecha Indians in the area to join an  armed revolt to continue the neo-Zapatist movement.    Confronted with this situation, the 21st Military Zone  troops  are currently guarding the region to forestall any rebel  movement. The Michoacan rebel leaders have agreed to meet on  Wednesday with Jaime Serra Puche, commerce and industrial  development secretary, to negotiate the reopening of the sugar  mill. Meanwhile, five rebel leaders have gone to Chiapas to  deliver a letter to the EZLN asking to be allowed to join its  ranks.    Furthermore, 1,000 members of the Democratic Peasant Union  (UCD) [Union Campesina Democratica] in Torreon city in the  northern state of Coahuila expressed their support for the  EZLN's demands and demanded that the local government provide  immediate solutions to the agrarian problems in the area. "The  Torreon peasants will initiate an offensive in defense of the  ejido (community land). We demand the suspension of Banco  Rural's land seizures and the cancellation of the expired  portfolio," which amounts to approximately $233.3 million, their  communique stated.    In the southern state of Guerrero, authorities have warned  that several people are distributing leaflets to the Indians  calling them to an armed revolt against the government.  Authorities are currently investigating those reports.    One week ago approximately 300,000 members of the "Guerrero  500 Years of Indian Resistance Council" [Consejo Guerrerense 500  Anos de Resistencia Indigena] asked to be accepted in the EZLN  ranks and requested that they be allowed to support the armed  movement from the mountains of the southern state of Guerrero.  The Zapatists accepted the request. The Guerrero Indians have  started collecting food, clothing, and medicine to support their  "war brothers" in Chiapas and will send the provisions to  Chiapas in the next weeks.    A dozen religious and human rights organizations in the  northern state of Chihuahua, which borders the United States,  have formed the "Peace and Justice in Chiapas Coordinator"  [Coordinadora por la Paz y la Justicia en Chiapas] that demands  that the EZLN be accepted as a belligerent force. The  coordinator demands a halt to the repression against the Indians  in Chiapas and to the "manipulation of information" by the  television media. It has warned that it will support the rebels  in all their demands to the government.    In the southern state of Oaxaca, neighboring with Chiapas,  many residents in the mountain areas have warned authorities of  the alleged presence of armed groups that are preparing to rise  up against the local government. The authorities, however, have  repeatedly denied those reports.    At least 108 people were killed and approximately 500  injured  in the armed clashes between the EZLN and the Armed Forces  during the first 10 days of the conflict.</p>

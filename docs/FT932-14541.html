			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Nato calls in UK and Turkish fighter jets NATO yesterday called on British and Turkish fighter jets to join the force which this week began policing the Bosnian no-fly zone. The UK is due to send six Tornado F3 fighters on Monday to Gioia del Colle in southeast Italy. They will be backed up by two VC-10 tankers for air-to-air refuelling. The Tornados, based at Leeming in Yorkshire, were not included in the initial enforcement plan involving US, French and Dutch aircraft. Britain has offered a further six fighters if necessary. Turkey is to send a squadron of 18 F-16 fighters over the weekend.</p>

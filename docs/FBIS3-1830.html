			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Gao </F> Jianxin (7559 1696 2450)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The political affairs  group of the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]  held its fifth meeting here 24-25 February. The meeting  discussed and studied the relationship between the  administrative and legislative organs of the Hong Kong SAR, the  method of forming the first government -- including the method  and timing of the election of the administrative commissioner  and how to form the administrative council and its functions --  and the establishment of a consultative committee and its  functions after 1997.    After the meeting, the group's leaders Liang Zhenying and  Xiao Weiyun gave briefings to reporters. Xiao Weiyun said: The  administrative organ shall be the leading component of Hong  Kong's future political system. The Basic Law provides explicit  stipulations that the administrative and legislative organs  should check and balance while coordinating with each other.  Only by keeping the administrative organ as the leading  component will the government operate efficiently, society  remain stable, the economy prosper, and living standards be  improved. This is the principle we will adhere to at all times.  If anyone, by playing small or big tricks, tries to change the  system which upholds the administrative organ's leading position  before 1997, such changes will certainly be rescinded after 1  July 1997 because they are not in line with the interests of the  people in Hong Kong and are not conducive to its long-term  stability and prosperity.    Responding to a reporter's question on how China could  "start  a new stove," Xiao Weiyun said, Patten's "constitutional reform  package" [zheng gai fang an -- 2398 2395 2455 2714] violates the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the  agreements reached between China and Britain. Now Britain,  doggedly going its own way, has submitted the package for  adoption by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council. This  means that the door to Sino-British negotiations has been shut  by Britain's disruption. Needless to say, the Chinese Government  will "start a new stove" according to the provisions of the  Basic Law. To this end, the preliminary working committee will  step up efforts and do solid work to ensure a smooth transition  of power and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.</p>

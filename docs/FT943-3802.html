			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (8): Tested to the limit - The stock exchange's latest challenge Officials at the Philippine Stock Exchange did not try to conceal their nervousness over the impending market debut of Petron, the country's largest oil refining and marketing company. The shares started trading last Wednesday. The 10bn pesos (USDollars 380m) initial public offering, involving 20 per cent of the group's equity, had prompted unprecedented demand from private investors, with a record number of individuals getting share allotments. Going into the Petron launch, Mr Eduardo de Los Angeles, president of the PSE, warned that trading facilities would be tested to their limit. He was correct; and heavy trading in the Petron stock drew attention away from other blue-chips, leaving the market lower overall. The price rose 136 per cent on the first day, above the offer price of 9 pesos, to 21.25; and continued up to 22 pesos on the second day of trading. Up to that point, the PSE could handle around 20,000 trades a day. Mr de Los Angeles reckoned that around 600,000 individuals would end up with entitlements to Petron shares, and that perhaps 10 per cent would seek to trade on, or shortly after the launch. The PSE was forced to upgrade systems to handle the volume. The Petron experience says much about the Philippines' stock market, which promises much but only partially delivers. Yet the extent to which the share market has already developed should not be underestimated. A few years ago, trading was split between two exchanges - the old-established Manila stock exchange, which began life in 1927, and the upstart Makati stock exchange, based in Manila's main business district and formed in 1965. Rivalry between the exchanges meant that turnover was low on both and, with different trading floors, there was plenty of scope for rather dubious arbitrage between the two markets. This, coupled with the nation's political turmoil, was enough to deter foreigners from using either. Much of the trading in larger Filipino stocks  -like Philippine Long-Distance Telephone (PLDT) or San Miguel, the brewery group - took place on overseas exchanges, such as New York's Nasdaq or the American Stock Exchange. It took a heavy political pressure to unify the two exchanges. But in 1992, agreement on a single structure was reached, and in March 1994 the two separate licences for the Manila and Makati Exchanges were withdrawn. In part, the unification problem has been technical. The two exchanges had installed different computer systems, and there was difficulty in interfacing them, so that orders could be sent from one to another and a common price for all stocks established. Mr de Los Angeles admits that, even now, the communication links do occasionally break down, with the result that different prices can still emerge. However, he says that PLDT has promised to install a fibre-optical cable, if possible before the end of the year, which should solve this problem. Even so, the stock market's infrastructure difficulties will not be at an end. The clearing system, and brokers' back-office administration facilities, are woefully inadequate. They were hard-pressed to cope with the boom in business which occured in the last quarter of 1993, and events like the Petron offering will renew the pressure. Plans to install a new, computerised clearing system have already been laid, and grant funding is due to come from the US Agency for International Development. The aim is to have the new system up and running by mid-1995. Regulation is another problem. The PSE plans to bolster its own surveillance systems this autumn. Advice, it says, is coming from the New York Stock Exchange. Already, in a market which tends to be driven by rumour, there are regulations which allow the PSE to halt trading in any stock which rises by more than 50 per cent in a day, or falls by 40 per cent in the same time period - powers which it has been exercising recently, to the surprise of some observers. However, while supervision is the responsibility of the PSE, prosecution of offenders falls to Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and this remains one the least respected of Filipino regulators. These caveats notwithstanding, there are clear signs that the Philippine stock market is growing up. Privatisations have widened the range of stocks available. The sudden surge in share prices in late 1993, which caused the Philippines to become the region's best-performing exchange last year, also encouraged a number of local companies, often family-owned, to float in pursuit of new capital. Although the market's retreat earlier this year caused a few prospective issuers to back off, few observers think this will be a permanent retreat. 'It's probably more of a postponment,' says Mr George Uy-Tioco, president of Philippine Asia Equity Securities. 'Why sell at nine or 10 times earnings, when you may get 15 times if you wait ?' Indeed, the SEC calculates that the 13 initial public offerings which were launched last year, raising 15.8bn pesos, were easily topped by the 17 issues which occured during the first six months of 1994. These, it says, raised 19.1m pesos, or 120.9 per cent of last year's amount. That, moreover, was before Petron. Perhaps the biggest question-mark is whether international interest in Filipino stocks will persist if political or electoral pressures mean that Ramos regime is obliged to adopt a 'holding pattern' on the economic front, and western countries pull out of recession, causing their own stock markets to rise. It has been calculated that around USDollars 2bn of international fund-management money may have poured into the Philippines in past 18 months. But local brokers are aware that this could quickly be attracted by higher or safer returns elsewhere. One factor which may have some bearing on the strength of overseas interest is the issue of 'A' and 'B' shares. In an effort to retain local control of key assets, the Philippines constitution requires that at least 60 per cent of certain companies, especially in the natural resources area, be held by Filipinos. In the past, companies satisfied this restriction by dividing their ordinary share capital into 'A' shares, to be held exclusively by Filipinos, and 'B' shares, open to both Filipinos and foreigners. The problem has been that 'B' shares have tended to see more demand, relative to the tighter supply, and have traded at higher prices. Ms Rosario Lopez, chairman of the SEC, is emphatic that her organisation would like to see this distinction disappear. It is not approving any new issues which incorporate this two-class share structure, she says. According to Ms Lopez, companies can still meet their constitutional obligations by monitoring their share registers, and barring foreign buying when the 40 per cent level is about to be breached. However, Mr de Los Angeles is not so confident. 'It's very difficult to monitor,' he warns, 'and only possible with the right equipment'.</p>

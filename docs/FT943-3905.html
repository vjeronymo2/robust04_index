			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Arts: Terfel rules on the last night - The Proms The Proms are an equal-opportunities employer. In a splendid break with tradition, the solo singer invited to deliver the classic anthem for the Last Night of this hundredth Prom year was not a woman, but a man. And not just any male opera singer, but the marvellous Bryn Terfel. Music is not the main point of the Last Night, and the excited Prom audience had been loud with coughs and popping balloons through the opening Bach and Vaughan Williams items - but from the moment Terfel began his first solo in Walton's Belshazzar's Feast he commanded hushed attention from the entire Albert Hall. His diction alone is compelling; and then there is the vibrant firmness of his bass-baritone voice, even finer when singing quietly than in full volume; plus the fact that you never see, or hear, him breathe. All this had the Prommers in thrall; Terfel tamed the beast. For Rule, Britannia], he returned in Welsh rugby fan uniform. Within this mighty young lion, there is an impish boy; just as within his rhetorical sternness there is a contemplative lyricist, and within his life-giving openness there is a brooding darkness. All these contrasts make him fascinating. The conductor, Andrew Davis, handled this loaded occasion - including his speech - with a perfect blend of concentration, humour, and panache. There is a sense of conspiracy for these events that makes the standing Prommers, with their chanted messages, part of a special community with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Singers, and the BBC Symphony Chorus. That everyone playing the music well matters not quite so much as the way everyone joins in the unison ritual sways and bounces. Still, I must record that two other soloists deservedly won the Prommers' cheers and respect: Evelyn Glennie, the ebullient soloist in Paul Creston's Concertino for Marimba, and Michael Davis (the BBCSO's leader) whose solo violin led the famous Meditation from Massenet's Thais. Flags of all nations were waved; and 'Care For the World' T-shirts were worn as well as boaters, helmets, and Union Jack bowlers. This year's chutzpah prize must go to the group who waved - during 'Rule Britannia", can you believe? - a banner reading 'Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival'. But the musicality prize goes to the standee who held a heart-shaped balloon aloft during the Thais Meditation. During the final phrase, exactly as the solo violin took another ascent into the empyrean, he let his balloon rise another yard towards the dome above.</p>

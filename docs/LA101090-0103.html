			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER SERVICE RESTORED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY  </P> <P> Water service to 400,000 residents of south and east San Diego County was  restored to normal Tuesday after 11 days of severe restrictions prompted by the  rupture of a major water pipeline.  </P> <P> Voluntary restrictions on outdoor watering were continued Tuesday evening and  early today to avoid a large drop in water pressure in the new pipeline, which  carries 140 million gallons a day to the Padre Dam, Helix, Riverview, Lakeside  and Otay water districts.  </P> <P> The Stage 4 alert, the county's first, reverted to a Stage 2 level, which was  adopted in May by the San Diego County Water Authority in an effort to reduce  the county's water usage by 10%.  </P> <P> Residents in the five affected water districts responded to conservation  requests by reducing water usage by up to two-thirds in some areas and at least  half in the remaining areas.  </P></p>

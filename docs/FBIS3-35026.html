			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali </F> by Philip Finnigan of Washington DEFENSE NEWS; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Finnigan] What was your reaction when you learned  that the United States will allow Israel to purchase the  advanced F-15E aircraft?    [Al-Majali] Very regrettably and unfortunately Israel has  succeeded in convincing the U.S. decisionmakers that the only  road to peace lies in giving it the upper hand. This is wrong.  When you give people more power they become obstinate in the  quest for peace. The balance is currently largely tilted in  favor of Israel. We feel uneasy when Israel obtains  sophisticated weapons at a time when we do not have even the  basic requirements to defend ourselves. Peace is for all and  not for one single state.    [Finnigan] Do you think Israel is still the main danger  threatening Jordan?    [Al-Majali] Yes, indeed, only because it forced out all  those  Palestinian refugees and evacuees and imposed them on us.  Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have not at all felt that way.    [Finnigan] You mean that Israel's threat to Jordan stems  from  the activities which might lead to instability in Jordan rather  than from a direct attack on Jordan.    [Al-Majali] Quite right. I do not think the world will allow  any state to attack Jordan, but there are no guarantees and you  do not know everything.    [Finnigan] I know that Israel raised one issue at the peace  talks, that is, holding joint exercises with Jordan.    [Al-Majali] How can we hold joint exercises with them while  they are still occupying our land? What shall I do if I have  problems regarding water resources that were seized by Israel?  This is premature. You have to be very friendly with another  state before you can conduct exercises, and exercises with  Israel against who, Saudi Arabia or Egypt? One has to be  realistic. Time will come, as was the case with France and  Germany, when we can work together for the creation of one army.  However, one should not jump to this subject all of a sudden.    [Finnigan] What about confidence-building measures like  aerial reconnaissance sorties?    [Al-Majali] Why should we fly over Israel or vice versa?  Trust should come first. When the basic problems are solved,  normalization will follow. The basic problems should first be  solved.    [Finnigan] What will peace mean for Jordan militarily?    [Al-Majali] The number of our Armed Forces personnel,  compared with the population, is one of the highest in the world  due to our location. This creates financial problems and  burdens. This is partly due to the fact that we have not only  protected Jordan, but maintained stability in the region for a  long time. Peace does not mean that you get rid of the army;  peace requires guards and people to protect it.    [Finnigan] Obviously you will need to purchase or procure  new  capabilities designed specifically to improve your ability to  combat terrorism. Does this mean you will be forced to spend  more on armament?    [Al-Majali] Dangers after peace are not less than the  post-war dangers. People's expectations will rise and will have  an impact on security. Therefore, you have to have a strong and  well-trained army to deal with this situation. Some tasks  should be changed as necessary, and this does not last for ever.  When peace prevails and is firmly entrenched in the region,  there will be no need for large armed forces.    [Finnigan] What should the United States do to support your  armed forces?    [Al-Majali] I hope the United States will care for us as it  does for other states and create a sound balance of power. We  need the United States' assistance to refurbish the armed forces  and provide training as it is doing for other states.    [Finnigan] What sort of military hardware does Jordan need  from the United States?    [Al-Majali] Basic things to defend ourselves like ammunition  for training and spare parts.    [Finnigan] What is the importance of relieving Jordan of  its debts, particularly the military debts?    [Al-Majali] We owe debts, mostly military, to the United  States, Britain, France, and other European countries. We hope  to be treated in the same way as other states. We expect a  balanced consideration of these matters in order to write off  these debts. We do not conceive a stable peace between Israel  and Jordan or Israel and the neighboring states in the presence  of debts.    [Finnigan] Should Jordan be treated the way Israel and Egypt  are treated?    [Al-Majali] I think so. We are peace partners. The matter  is not one of size, but geographic location. It is a matter of  confidence. Jordan has built confidence throughout the past  years.    [Finnigan] How can the U.S. reponse be described thus far?    [Al-Majali] Unfortunately, what is given to Jordan is a drop  in the ocean when compared with what is given to Israel. It is  very little, less than 5 percent of what is given to Israel.    [Finnigan] Is there a relaxation in ties with some Gulf  states?    [Al-Majali] Yes, there has been a change in ties with the  United Arab Emirates and Qatar although such a change is still  difficult with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We still say we were  misunderstood during the Gulf crisis. We are against occupation  by any party, but we sought to end this occupation through the  Arabs themselves without any foreign assistance. We were  misunderstood and were depicted as if we stood beside the  attacking forces although we did not do so.    [Finnigan] Saudi Arabia has asked for a public apology. Is  this acceptable to Jordan?    [Al-Majali] The Jordanian Government would have to make a  mistake before it could apologize. We did not undertake any  action to harm Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf states.    [Finnigan] The Kuwaiti officials say Jordan has not accepted  the Kuwait-Iraq borders as delineated by the United Nations.    [Al-Majali] We have not at all accepted borders between any  other two states. The issue of borders is their own affair.  Have we recognized the old borders? This is an issue between  two neighbors.    [Finnigan] Do the cool relations with Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait  place considerable hurdles in the way of creating Jordanian  rapid deployment forces?    [Al-Majali] Yes, indeed. How can rapid deployment forces  operate if these two states are closed to them. We believe that  Arab reconciliation should come as soon as possible. The  absence of reconciliation will harm us all. If Jordan was  unstable, the entire region would be unstable.    [Finnigan] This means the formation of Jordanian rapid  forces  will need more years?    [Al-Majali] Yes, we are prepared and we continue to train  our  forces. We hope that these forces will be formed in good time  once reconciliation is realized.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: UK attaches conditions to biodiversity treaty THE UK is to sign the Earth Summit's convention on biological diversity, or species protection, but with a declaration on its own interpretation of the question of financial commitments, Prime Minister John Major said yesterday. In a written statement at Westminster, Mr Major told MPs that signing the convention would be subject 'to satisfactory arrangements that take full account of our concern about financial commitments'. His comment that it would provide 'an initial step in protecting natural habitats and the range of species throughout the world' was less enthusiastic than the comments about the climate change convention which the UK has joined other European Community members in urging other countries to sign. The UK's decision to sign leaves the US as the only significant country refusing to initial the treaty, with no change in its position in view. Japan, which also had worries, is expected to sign. US administration officials said they saw no hope of winning changes to the biodiversity convention that would persuade them to sign. They said the convention's provisions on intellectual property would undo two years of painful negotiations on the same subject in the Uruguay Round of Gatt. The UK's worries centred on the possibility that aid commitments to developing countries contained in the treaty could amount to richer countries signing a blank cheque. However, Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment secretary, said in Rio: 'We believe we have found a way round these difficulties.' The US also repeated yesterday that it had problems with the Rio Declaration, the summit centrepiece due to be signed by all leaders on Saturday. The US said it might not subscribe to this statement of environmental principles. Side declarations have provided a useful way out for countries which want to sign the treaties, but need to express reservations. The EC countries announced yesterday they would make an accompanying statement to the climate change convention which restates their determination to reduce carbon emissions to their 1990 levels by 2000.

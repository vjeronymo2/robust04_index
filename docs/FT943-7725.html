			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / China tightens credit for projects to curb inflation China will clamp down on lending for capital spending, following the release of figures that showed an alarming 73 per cent rise in fixed asset investment in July compared with the same month last year. Central Bank officials have made clear that credit ceilings would be tightened in the third quarter after an easing in the past few months to accommodate the demands of state enterprises for working capital. Mr Zhou Zhengqing, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, was quoted as saying that 'banks must strictly adhere to credit ceilings in order to control lending for fixed asset investments.' Beijing has announced that it will review all new capital spending projects under the state plan, and those that 'do not enjoy good prospects' will be cancelled. The official Xinhua news agency quoted government officials as emphasising the need to 'check excessive capital construction in order to avoid economic disorder.' Government attempts to curb fixed asset investment by state enterprises reflects continuing concern over inflation, which began to climb again in June and July after falling back in previous months. Consumer prices in China's 35 main cities in July rose by 22.7 per cent in July compared with the same month last year. This was the same as the June figure, but higher than May. The authorities blamed a capital spending binge last year for inflationary pressures. A stabilisation plan, introduced in July 1993, was aimed at calming an overheating economy and curbing investment in fixed assets. A western economist in Beijing described July's capital spending surge as a 'warning signal', while cautioning against reading too much into one month's statistics. But senior Chinese officials, including Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice premier in charge of the economy, who have been meeting at the beach resort of Beidaihe near Beijing to review economic developments, are clearly concerned about latest trends. Central bank officials said that among targets in the latest crackdown on unauthorised lending would be illegal interbank transactions. Non-bank financial institutions would also come under greater scrutiny. Adding to official concern is the fact that capital spending normally grows faster in the second half of the year, with the third quarter the peak period for starting new projects. Chinese economists attributed the jump in capital spending in July to projects launched by state enterprises whose financial position had improved, and to the government appropriating more funds for infrastructure. It has earmarked Yn520bn (Pounds 39bn) for capital spending in its credit plan this year. By the end of June Yn175bn had been outlayed.</p>

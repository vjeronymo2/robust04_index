			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Gooda loss probe finds no dishonesty MANAGEMENT deficiencies and poor underwriting rather than dishonesty were at the heart of the difficulties of the Gooda Walker syndicates, which produced some of the worst losses ever suffered by Names at Lloyd's, a loss review investigation by the London market has concluded. The report - marked 'private and confidential' - was prepared by a team chaired by Mr Kieran Poynter, a partner at Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and sent to Names yesterday. Between 1988 and 1990, syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 299, managed by agencies in the Gooda Walker group, lost more than Pounds 550m for about 4,000 Names  -the individuals whose assets support the insurance market's capital base. The syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance, in which Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies reinsured each other's exposures to catastrophe risks. The 1,500-page report says they were overwhelmed by disasters such as Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 because underwriters 'failed to recognise' the scale of the risks to which they were exposed. They were also caught out by underwriters' 'willingness to run a high degree of risk for high profit'. Risk was also concentrated among relatively few Names. Each Gooda syndicate under review 'wrote a substantial volume of excess of loss spiral business such that there was a high probability they would all be affected by the same loss events'. Matters were made worse because Gooda syndicates frequently reinsured each other, while the Gooda members' agency placed many of 250 Names whose affairs it handled on Gooda syndicates. Moreover, 'deficiencies in the managing agency control environment' contributed to losses. Managing agents failed to give members' agents and Names all relevant information. 'In particular it seems that relevant information was available in November 1988 which (if passed on) may have caused Names to reconsider participating in the 1989 year,' the report says. 'The members' agents failed to appreciate the high-risk nature of the Gooda syndicates. 'This was summed up by Anthony Gooda's often quoted remark to many new Names that 'We won't make you a fortune but we won't lose you one either'.' The report did not 'encounter any evidence of impropriety of a dishonest nature' and it concludes that Lloyd's had properly administered the regulatory requirements relating to Gooda. However, it says the affair raises a number of regulatory issues that should be addressed by Lloyd's. It says syndicate prospectuses were inadequate and suggests that too much of Gooda Walker's reinsurance was placed inside Lloyd's. The report echoes the findings of a wider-ranging investigation by Sir David Walker this year when it argues that simply monitoring premium income is an inadequate means of controlling the high-risk exposures of syndicates. It also questions the use by Gooda Walker of time and distance policies, a financial reinsurance that had the effect of improving its reported results.</p>

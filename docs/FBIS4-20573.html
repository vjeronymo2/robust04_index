			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Shigeki Gunji and Hiroshi </F> Kamimura, Department of Applied Physics, Science University of  Tokyo]    [Text] Twelve boron (B) atoms form an icosahedral cluster  B[.sub]12[/], and these icosahedra form a pseudo-fcc crystal  that is called _a_-B. Motivated by the recent discovery of new  superconducting materials A[.sub]x[/]C[.sub]60[/], we have  theoretically explored new intercalation compounds based on  _a_-B to find out a possibility of superconductivity. In this  talk we investigate three kinds of boron intercalation  compounds, and show the features of their electronic structures  calculated by the first principle calculations. As the positions  of intercalated sites, we consider 1) an octahedral site, 2)  tetrahedral sites and 3) both ends of an interstitial chain  along the body diagonal, which correspond to phosphorous  positions of B[.sub]12[/]P[.sub]2[/] structure. Since  there is not enough space to accommodate large atoms between  icosahedra, we chose lithium (Li) atom as an intercalant, due to  the smallest ionic radius of 0.68 A among all the alkali-metal  atoms.    In cases where Li's are intercalated into octahedral and  tetrahedral sites, an energy band of Li character appears above  the lowest conduction band of B character, and thus the Li 2s  electrons are transferred into lower conduction bands with B  character. As a result, the Fermi level crosses the lowest  conduction band in the former and the two lower conduction bands  in the latter, respectively.    In the cases where Li's are intercalated into interstitial  sites, the charge density calculations show that Li-B hybridized  bands newly appear in the higher valence band region of B. As a  result, the Fermi level crosses two higher valence bands, and  hole-like carriers appear in this case. We call this  intercalation compound ``acceptor-type metal.''    The present results show that both donor-type and  acceptor-type metallic materials call be obtained by  intercalating the same species of intercalant atoms. In this  respect ``boron'' is different from C[.sub]60[/] fullerides  and graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). By calculating the  total energies of these compounds, we show that the compound of  octahedral intercalation sites, B[.sub]12[/]Li(O), has the  lowest energy. Thus this donor-type compound is expected to  appear as the first step of intercalation.    In order to investigate a possibility of superconductivity  especially in the case where Li's are intercalated into  octahedral sites, we have calculated the density of states for  this compound. Its value at the Fermi energy is 0.26/eV x atom,  which is very close to that of K[.sub]3[/]C[.sub]60[/]  calculated by Saito and Oshiyama.[.sup]1[/]  References    1. S. Saito and A. Oshiyama, PHYS.

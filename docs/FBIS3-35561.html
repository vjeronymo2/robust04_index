Rohani termed the killing and wounding of hundreds of  Palestinians at the shrine of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon  him) in al-Khalil [Hebron] Friday as an "unprecedented crime".    "The crime indicates that the U.N. cannot fulfil its duties  this way and that the time has come to amend the United Nations  Charter," the vice speaker said.    In case such amendments are made to the U.N. Charter, not  only Third World countries can play their role in the world  organization but the organization would be free from big powers'  monopoly, he said.    "Otherwise," Rohani warned, "world nations can no longer  trust this organization and they will have no other alternative  but to rise up."    Elsewhere in his remarks, Rohani expressed hope that  relations between the two countries would expand in various  fields particularly in economic, trade, scientific, research,  transport, oil, tourism and agricultural areas.    The Kazakh ambassador, too, called for promotion of  bilateral  relations in cultural, social, political and economic areas.</p>

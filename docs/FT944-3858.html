			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: Footsie driven below 3,000 level Talk of big switching activity by a number of UK pension funds and general investment portfolios out of equities and into gilt-edged stocks drove the UK equity market sharply lower yesterday, pushing the FT-SE 100 index firmly below the 3,000 level. The Footsie closed 36.5 lower at 2,977.3 and 40 points down on the week. London stocks, Page 15; World stocks, Page 17, Lex, Page 20; Markets, Weekend Money 2</p>

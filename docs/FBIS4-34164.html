			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief of the Joint Staff Division General Pedro  Concepcion de la Cruz Ocampos on 13 June denied that on 9 June  during an unexpected meeting that was held at Armed Forces  Headquarters members of the military had pressured the President  and Commander in Chief Juan Carlos Wasmosy or handed him an  ultimatum asking that he persuade congressmen and politicians to  stop the "offenses" that are being hurled at the Armed Forces.  "It is absolutely not true," he stressed. He also indicated that  there is absolutely nothing to Wasmosy allegedly granting  military men permission to take legal action against the law  that bans servicemen on active duty from joining a political  party.    Ocampos denied that influential generals are pressuring  Wasmosy, demanding that he prevent the attacks that are being  made against the institution by politicians and congressmen.  "Those rumors are absolutely not true. They are totally false,"  he said firmly, when referring to the matter.    Asked about the rumors that some generals want to dissolve  Congress, Ocampos stated that they are hot air. "They are just  rumors. No one is thinking of doing that at this point. The  people who start these rumors want to frighten or create an  atmosphere of psychosis. The intention just does not exist," he  said.    He added that he did not believe that Wasmosy could dissolve  Congress because "all of us want to get the country off the  ground. To do the contrary would be a step backward and it would  have internal and external repercussions," he stressed.    He also indicated that he knew nothing at all about  allegations that Wasmosy has granted permission to officers who  want to take legal action against the law that temporarily bans  servicemen on active duty from joining a political party. "This  has been put on hold and there is nothing, absolutely nothing on  this matter," he said.    Asked whether it was necessary for the officers to obtain  permission from the commander in chief in order to take legal  action, Ocampos answered: "I do not know. I do not have any  grounds to answer that and I do not want to say something that  is not true and thus compromise myself. I am not mixed up in  this matter of politics and I do not want to discuss it because  it is not something to my liking," he said.    Ocampos also indicated that it is very dangerous for the  Armed Forces if servicemen on active duty take part in the  activities of political parties. "In order to stop this  situation cold, the commander in chief could issue a special  edict that no one can meddle in party politics. I believe that  all of us understand this and therefore we do not exceed the  boundaries," he said.</p>

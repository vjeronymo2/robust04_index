			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 10 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government's  decision to submit the 1994 economic program agreed upon between  the government and the IMF to decision was backed today by all  Peruvian entrepreneurial and political circles.    On 9 May, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori indicated that  his government would wait at least 10 days for experts to raise  their proposals to improve the draft of the letter of intent  before sending it to the IMF.    Economist Alejandro Indacochea, an Advanced Business School  board member, noted that Fujimori's proposal was positive  "because the publication of such documents had been considered  taboo by former governments, which guarded them as if they were  top state secrets."    Indacochea pointed out, however, that it would be impossible  to voice an opinion on the letter of intent unless the annexes  on the committed economic targets become known, and he asked the  government to publish them as soon as possible.    The economist added that there is a point missing in the  document "involving the overvaluation of soles against dollars  and its negative impact on the trade deficit, which has not been  overcome in four years and must be reversed."

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEPS LIMITING SOVIET FORCES WOULD REASSURE REFORMERS  </P> <P> The Warsaw Pact, it is commonly observed, is the only alliance in history whose  military forces have been used solely to invade its own members.  </P> <P> No doubt this is why Poland's new Solidarity-led government has taken pains to  reassure Moscow that it will not withdraw from the pact. It also explains why  Solidarity promptly yielded the defense and interior ministries to the  Communist Party: Reform in Eastern Europe cannot exceed the Soviet Union's  tolerance for change, a lesson imprinted on the memories of Hungarians and  Czechoslovakians whose hopes were dashed under the treads of Soviet tanks in  1956 and 1968.  </P> <P> However, the Warsaw Pact's past suppression of reform also reveals an  opportunity to be grasped in the ongoing conventional force reduction talks,  the third round of which commenced in Vienna earlier this month. Those  negotiations are designed to reduce the threat posed to the West by the Warsaw  Pact. However, the talks can also be utilized to reduce the threat that the  Warsaw Pact poses to its own members.  </P> <P> Specifically, the Vienna talks could be used to reduce and restrict Soviet  forces in Eastern Europe so as to limit Moscow's ability to pressure East Bloc  governments that experiment with democratic reform.  </P> <P> Admittedly, no conventional arms-control agreement can neutralize the Soviet  Union's inherent geographic advantage when it comes to moving forces across its  borders to Budapest, Prague or Warsaw. Still, in an era when Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev is attempting to persuade the West of his "new thinking"  (not to mention his desire for Western credits and technology),  across-the-border invasion is no longer an attractive option for the Soviets.  Indeed, the unambiguous suppression of political dissent in, say, Warsaw would  undermine Gorbachev's policy of glasnost in Moscow. His credibility, his  program and thus his leadership would be a likely casualty of such an attack.  </P> <P> If Moscow wishes to place pressure on a neighbor, then indirect aggression --  e.g., "military exercises" by Warsaw Pact troops already stationed in Eastern  Europe -- is a more subtle and thus a more viable option. The more ambiguous  the aggression, the less liable it is to provoke a major Western response.  Contrast the worldwide condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in  December, 1979, (open aggression) with Europe's muted response to the more  ambiguous Soviet troop mobilization on the Polish border in 1981 to pressure  the Warsaw government to crack down on Solidarity.  </P> <P> Hence, the reduction and restriction of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe  eliminates Soviet options, leaving Moscow with the undesirable alternatives of  invasion or acquiescence. Advance notice of, and time limits on, military  exercises in Eastern Europe could further restrict Soviet options.  </P> <P> But how can the West encourage force reductions that limit Soviet options? By  placing the public relations spotlight on the conventional force reduction  talks, just as Gorbachev previously focused world attention on the  intermediate-range nuclear missile talks, which ultimately resulted in an  agreement during President Ronald Reagan's second term. The Soviet leader  maintained world attention on the negotiations until the political need to  reach an agreement was irresistible.  </P> <P> President Bush's conventional arms-control proposal to reduce U.S. armed forces  in Europe by 20% (if the Soviets do the same) was a step in the right  direction. The dramatic gesture, made last May in Brussels, focused attention  on the talks. Further, by offering to reduce U.S. forces, the President  symbolically demonstrated to Europeans his peaceful intentions and challenged  the Soviets to match them. By requiring that an agreement on conventional arms  reductions be implemented before talks on European-based, short-range nuclear  missiles were commenced, the President gave the Soviets an incentive to consent  to the West's conventional arms proposals. The Soviets have long placed greater  priority on reducing European-based nuclear weapons, the elimination of which  would make Europe more vulnerable to the Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority in  conventional forces.  </P> <P> Of course, the West German public is impatient with any delay in commencing  talks on battlefield nuclear weapons. President Bush temporarily smoothed over  the simmering dispute by proposing that the conventional arms reduction talks  be completed in a year, thus giving Bonn hope of early nuclear weapon-reduction  talks.  </P> <P> But this only emphasizes that Eastern Europe's future is just as dependent on  Western will as it is on Soviet tolerance. The path to Eastern Eurpean  self-determination may very well begin in Bonn and lead to Vienna so that it  can bypass Moscow.  </P></p>

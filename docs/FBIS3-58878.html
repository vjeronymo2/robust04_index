Weizman arrived in Turkey earlier today for a four-day  official visit, the highest-level visit by Israel to Turkey so  far.    Speaking at the official welcoming ceremony at the  presidential palace of Cankaya, President Demirel said that the  visit of Weizman coincided with the emergence of hopes for peace  in the Middle East and "we want this gate of peace to be opened  thoroughly and our country will do whatever it can to this end."    Demirel said that the two countries had great opportunities  to cooperate on trade, contracting services, tourism and  technological exchange and that all levels of contacts will be  held between Turkey and the Israeli delegation.    "Our relations with Israel continue uninterruptedly since  1948. Recently these have been accelerated," Demirel said.    "Our efforts are aimed at laying the foundations of a Middle  East which, all the energy and money spent for militarization  will be spent for development," Demirel added.    On his part, Weizman said his country was doing more than it  can for peace.    He recalled that his country was holding talks with  Palestine  for peace and "I hope that we begin talking for peace with  Syria, with President al-Asad."    He recalled that his first visit abroad as president has  been  to Turkey and "I regard this visit also as a great step because  of the changes taking place in our region."    He went on to say that both countries were desiring to  establish a peaceful order in the region and "relations between  Turkey and Israel could be a catalyst for peaceful relations in  our region."    After the tete-a-tete meeting between Weizman and Demirel,  delegations of the two countries began official talks.</p>

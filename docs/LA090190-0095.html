			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> WILSON TRIES TO STEER TO MIDDLE OF ROAD WITH POSITIVE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> Pete Wilson dramatically changed the tone of his television advertising Friday  with the announcement that next week he will begin airing a positive  commercial, a marketing approach nearly extinct this political season.  </P> <P> The commercial touts Wilson's general plans for programs to help coming  generations of Californians -- more science teachers, early childhood  education, prenatal health care -- and does not mention Democrat Dianne  Feinstein, with whom Wilson is engaged in a tight battle for the governorship.  </P> <P> "When we invest in our schools, when we invest in our children, we invest in  our future," the Republican senator tells voters.  </P> <P> The commercial will air across the state. On Monday, Wilson and Feinstein will  quicken their campaigning pace with traditional Labor Day appearances that mark  the beginning of the sprint to Election Day.  </P> <P> In the ad, Wilson talks with a schoolteacher, sits with students, walks through  a computer lab and visits a neonatal nursery. Spliced into the mix are pictures  of favorable newspaper accounts of Wilson proposals.  </P> <P> The commercial presents a broad outline of Wilson's priorities, without delving  into how much money he will commit to the programs he mentions or where he  would get the funds.  </P> <P> The first Wilson commercial since June that does not seek to tar his Democratic  adversary, it comes as the two candidates find themselves running dead even,  according to a Los Angeles Times Poll released last week.  </P> <P> In contrast to earlier days, when Feinstein found high approval among women and  Wilson among men, the race seems to have settled into a more partisan division,  with Democrats favoring Feinstein and Republicans attracted to Wilson.  </P> <P> To win, either candidate will have to attract moderates of both parties, and  the commercial underscores Wilson's effort to set himself apart from the more  socially conservative Republicans who have held past governorships.  </P> <P> As comparisons go, Wilson's ad presents a candidate closer in feel to moderate  George Bush than conservative Gov. George Deukmejian and his ideological soul  mate, Ronald Reagan. Indeed, just as Bush campaigned as the "education  President," a press release issued by Wilson's campaign Friday said he wishes  to be the "education governor."  </P> <P> On issues such as drug abuse, prenatal care, education and social welfare,  Wilson tends to inhabit very moderate turf. There, he is meeting Feinstein, who  is trying to one-up the senator with her own pleas for an increased emphasis on  early childhood education and health care.  </P> <P> Each has proposed increasing the availability of preschool for 4-year-olds in  the state, citing education experts who say that children who attend preschools  are less likely to drop out and more likely to get a job after graduation.  </P> <P> Feinstein has pledged to restore $462 million in cuts to education slashed from  the state budget by Deukmejian in this year's dicey round of budget cutting.  Wilson has yet to take a position on the specific programs cut by the governor,  his press aide Bill Livingstone said.  </P> <P> Wilson has won considerable acclaim from educators by calling for the  systematic integration of social welfare services into the state's school  system. The senator said that placement of mental health counselors and social  workers in schools would help protect endangered children before their problems  lead them to drop out.  </P> <P> While his commercial advocates an activist role -- "What happens here in the  classrooms of California is too important for the governor to be on the  sidelines," it says -- Wilson has refused to attach specific financial sources  for some of his programs, including the social integration plan.  </P> <P> For example, the commercial said Wilson advocates "more teachers from the  fields of science, math and computers." His campaign's research director, Loren  Kaye, said Wilson has not determined how to pay for that. The funding, Kaye  said, hinges on whether Wilson opts to encourage corporations to loan employees  to schools to serve as teachers -- and assume the financial burden -- or  whether school districts would have to foot some or all of the bill.  </P> <P> The funding sources Wilson is considering are likely to provoke some argument  from advocates of other cash-strapped programs. The senator has stipulated that  his early childhood education program for the state's 4-year-olds would be  phased in with increments from Proposition 98, which provides money to  education. Legislators and Deukmejian have had longstanding battles over how to  spend that money, with each side opting for different programs.  </P> <P> Wilson also plans to finance a prenatal care program for women without medical  coverage by taking money from the state's tobacco tax. That money already goes  to education and health programs that would need to be cut back if Wilson's  program skims off some of the money.  </P> <P> "It gives us an opportunity to put our priorities into the mix," research  director Kaye said.  </P></p>

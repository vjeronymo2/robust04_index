			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter: Correction of an imbalance in industrial legislation is overdue Sir, Re David Goodhart's article 'Stewards shop for new members', may I put a hypothetical question?: 'How do you market an excellent product when the retailers have told the potential consumers that it is 'forbidden fruit'?' For the problem facing potential trade union members is 'fear'. I have been involved in a recruitment campaign at a company based at Bathgate, near Edinburgh, and I can readily understand any employee being apprehensive about joining a trade union if their employer is 'anti-union' (in most companies this is the case). It has to be recognised that the alleged union 'barons' of the 1960s and 1970s have been replaced in the 1980s and 1990s by the employers' 'boot boys' - oblivious to the seeds of conflict and destruction that they sow. If an employee joins a trade union and is victimised as a consequence (an unheard-of situation, of course?), it is extremely difficult to take successful legal action against the employer. The present legislation totally supports the employee who chooses to remain a non-member. Trade unions have learned to live with this situation. What is unacceptable, however, is that when 60 per cent, 70 per cent or even 80 per cent of a work force join the same trade union and ask for recognition, and are refused, they have no legal redress in this regard. There is a need for legislation based on former section 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975, which gave trade unions an avenue to claim recognition on behalf of a group of work people who had been taken into membership and meaning to the legal right 'to belong to a trade union'. Potential trade union membership is, in my opinion, substantial, and work people of today are not driven by ideals of egalitarianism. They want support and assistance to negotiate 'the basics', ie personal contacts, pensions, performance-related pay, shift working/pay, health and safety etc, all of which feature to a considerable extent in their working life. Trade unions are by far the best vehicle for maintaining the 'checks and balances' necessary for an efficient and harmonious industrial society. The need to correct the existing imbalance in industrial legislation is long overdue.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / AB Foods declines 11% to Pounds 297m ASSOCIATED British Foods, owner of the UK's largest baker, and British Sugar, yesterday reported an 11 per cent drop in profits and its first fall in earnings per share since 1978, mainly because of lower investment income and price cutting in the wholesale bread market. Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said: 'It's not too happy, but it's been a very tough year.' Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 332m to Pounds 297m in the year to September 12, in line with market expectations. Earnings per share fell from 49p to 43.7p. Turnover increased 12.7 per cent to Pounds 3.95bn, helped by the first full contribution from British Sugar. British Sugar, acquired in January last year for Pounds 880m from Berisford International, reported trading profits of Pounds 139m on sales of Pounds 699m. This helped lift European profits 15.5 per cent to Pounds 238m. Mr Weston said ABF had spent more than Pounds 70m improving British Sugar's cost structure, including the closure of two plants. Benefits would begin to show this year, he said. Net investment income fell from Pounds 89m to Pounds 26m, partly reflecting a full year of acquisition costs for British Sugar and lower interest rates. However, net cash was almost unchanged at Pounds 409m because of strong cash generation. ABF was forced to cut bread prices for the second year running, by 2 per cent to 3 per cent because of overcapacity and the buying power of large retailers. 'The situation has not stabilised going into the new year,' Mr Weston said. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 15m in baking were taken above the line. Property profits fell Pounds 6m to Pounds 1m and adverse currency movements cost a further Pounds 7m. Non-baking European operations, which include Twinings tea and Ryvita, performed well. Retailing, which includes two supermarket chains in Ireland, was affected by price cutting by competitors. Trading profits were unchanged at Pounds 45m helped by currency factors. At the interim stage, ABF reported a 5.4 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 175.2m. The company made extraordinary charges of Pounds 30m (Pounds 112m) to cover further write-downs on its 19.7 per cent stake in Berisford and 1.2 per cent stake in Hillsdown Holdings. A second interim dividend of 5.5p (4.5p) is declared to give a total of 14p (13p), a 7.7 per cent increase. ABF shares were unchanged at 443p. Lex, Page 20</p>

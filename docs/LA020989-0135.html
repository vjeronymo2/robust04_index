			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: COOK DOESN'T MEASURE SUCCESS IN SPOONFULS  </P> <P> Precision in measurements is normally sacred to Jeremy Davis.  </P> <P> The accuracy of gauging even micromilligrams of substances can be crucial in  his job as supervising chemist of the Orange County Water District.  </P> <P> But get him into his Mission Viejo kitchen and he doesn't even want to see a  measuring cup, let alone worry about the level of liquid in it. Instead, he  prefers to guess at amounts, using soup spoons to ladle ingredients into bowls  for dishes he's preparing. Improvisation takes the place of precision.  </P> <P> That made it a little difficult for him to share with Guys &amp; Galleys his  no-explanation-necessary-for-the-name No-Measure Chicken.  </P> <P> "It's something I literally threw together one evening when we decided to have  chicken and then couldn't decide what to do with it," said Davis, 35. "We  enjoyed it, and I still make it, but the ingredients do change."  </P> <P> The dish is patterned, he said, after some foods he and his wife, Bernadette,  have enjoyed in trips to Europe. "In the south of France in particular, you  will see a lot of dishes using fresh tomatoes and onions."  </P> <P> His wife, a history teacher at Saddleback College, "does the bulk of the  cooking for the family," he said, "but we share the kitchen except for Sunday  breakfasts and Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners; then it's exclusively mine."  </P> <P> Davis began cooking at a young age (he even took a cooking class in junior high  school) with the encouragement and assistance of his mother. "She was Italian,"  he said, "and loved to cook. Her kitchen was what I would call traditional but  open-minded. She encouraged experimentation.  </P> <P> "So, I know and enjoy cooking Italian foods, but I also do a lot of Polish  cooking because of my wife's background (she's half Polish). As a matter of  fact, I've gotten so much into Polish food that it's the only thing I make for  our annual Christmas potluck at the office."  </P> <P> Each week, Orange County Life will feature a man who enjoys cooking and a  favorite recipe.

Mix well. In a separate  bowl, mix equal amounts of flour and bread crumbs. Place 8 to 10 pats of  margarine on bottom of baking pan. Dip each chicken breast in egg-milk mixture  and roll in flour-bread crumb mixture. Place each breast skin side up in pan.  Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 30 minutes, turning once. While the  chicken is baking, slice tomatoes and pearl onions, allowing 3 tomato slices  and 4 halved onions per breast. Turn breasts skin side up, garnish with  tomatoes and onions and dampen each with lemon juice. Crumble dill between  fingers and sprinkle over each breast. Return to oven until tomatoes begin to  wrinkle (about 5 minutes). Serve over a bed of rice made with chicken broth  instead of water. (Serves 4 to 6.)  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Nurdin &amp; Peacock Nurdin &amp; Peacock's 9 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits represented a better performance than the market expected. But the company's bold departure this year in investing Pounds 20m in opening two US-style warehouse clubs either suggests a high degree of fear about the future of its cash-and-carry business or unaccustomed aggression about opportunities in retailing. Although well-trailed, N&amp;P's move is likely to be seen as a further blow to sentiment in the ravaged food retailing sector. Warehouse clubs, selling a narrow range of heavily discounted goods, will not quickly win huge slices of market share. Mainstream retailers will not worry greatly about N&amp;P given its unproven retailing skills - although the arrival of Costco of the US is a more serious proposition. The broader worry is that the warehouses will lead to greater consumer fixation with price, lowering the margin structure throughout the industry.</p>

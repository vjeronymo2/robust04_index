			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Tereza Khayutina for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk 25 April TASS -- The agreement on the merger  of monetary systems signed with Russia will help Byelorussia  [Belarus] stabilise and improve the situation in the republic by  the end of the year, Byelorussian Prime minister Vyacheslav  Kebich said.    Speaking at a meeting with law enforcers in Minsk on Monday,  Kebich said that the fist part of the agreement reducing customs  tariffs will enter into force on May 1 and allow enterprises to  sell their products and receive orders.    "Additionally, the prices of basic goods and communal  services will be frozen in May. People's well-being will begin  to grow due to increases in wages and salaries and  implementation of targeted social programmes," he said.    Kebich believes that one of the factors that has allowed the  Byelorussian economy to survive is that it has preserved "even  relations with Russia. They have remained unchanged even in  conditions when our local nationalist reformers celebrated their  `victory' over `Muscovites' near Orsha or unwind in their absurd  articles a new spiral of Russophobia."    Kebich also pointed to the "conscientious rejection of shock  therapy" and "populism, adventurism and nationalism" as major  factors that helped preserve stability in Byelorussia.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Higher tax hits Armitage earnings Armitage Brothers, the pet foods and products manufacturer, marginally increased sales and profits in the year to May 30. Profit before tax was Pounds 875,000 (Pounds 851,000), but a rise in the tax charge reduced earnings per share to 14.6p (16.4p). The dividend is stepped up to 6.2p (6p) with a final of 3.6p. Turnover came to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 21.8m) following an 11 per cent rise in exports and similar growth in dried dog food. Gross margin deficit was more than recovered by further reductions in overheads. In the current year sales were showing a slight upturn and Christmas orders were ahead. Margins were still under extreme pressure.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Joaquim Chissano said today that public  opinion in the provinces of Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Sofala, Tete,  Manica, and Gaza encourages him to say that the forthcoming  multiparty elections will be won by the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo] Party and its presidential candidate. The  Mozambican head of state was addressing about 15,000 people at a  mass rally in Pemba to mark the end of his working visit to Cabo  Delgado Province. Chissano requested Cabo Delgado residents to  vote with confidence and responsibility.    President Chissano also said that demobilized and  war-disabled troops, as well as Mozambicans who returned from  the former GDR and other countries, should demonstrate their  initiative so that the Mozambican state and the international  community can grant them assistance. The head of state said  this in reply to the demands by these people's associations that  the government should give them jobs and funds for their  wellbeing.    President Chissano returns to Maputo today.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: S American giants on target for final Brazil and Argentina have never met in a World Cup final, but their form indicates that they may be on course for a meeting in Pasadena on July 17. Both won their first two games convincingly. If they continue to win, they will avoid each other during the three knock-out stages that stand between first-round qualifiers and the final. Diego Maradona, Argentina's born-again star, is producing his best form since guiding Argentina to World Cup victory eight years ago. Argentina meet Bulgaria in their final Group D game on Thursday. Tomorrow, Brazil - who have already thumped Russia (2-0) and Cameroon (3-0)  -play Sweden in Group B.</p>

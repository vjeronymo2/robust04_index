			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crans Montana Forum has ended proceedings in  Switzerland. Here's our reporter Reis Cico:    [Cico] A delegation from our country attended the Crans  Montana Forum in Switzerland. Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi,  who heads the Albanian delegation, took the floor today. In his  speech Meksi made a summarizing overview of the changes and  developments in Albania, pointing out achievements in political,  institutional, legislative, and economic reform.    Prime Minister Meksi said that the results achieved in these  two years of democratic government encourage us to go quicker  toward the road of transformations and the country's  democratization. The changes and transformations toward the  construction of a new democratic society in former socialist  countries, Meksi stressed, require above all a favorable climate  of international relations and an increase in technical and  economic assistance on the part of relevant bodies.    Dwelling on Balkan problems, Prime Minister Meksi said that  Albania thinks that the United Nations and the Western countries  should contribute more to the establishment and preservation of  peace in our region. After condemning the aggression in Bosnia,  Meksi stressed the danger that the spread of the conflict to the  south of the Balkans would include many regional countries in a  direct war. Meksi continued to say that Albania considers it  compulsory to preserve stability in the Balkans and maintains  that problems should be solved through dialogue, he concluded.    All the Crans Montana Forum participants addressed an appeal  to the Western countries to contribute more to the democratic  transformations of former socialist countries, considering this  an investment for Europe.</p>

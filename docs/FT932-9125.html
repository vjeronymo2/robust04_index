			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Indian students cry foul in the exam hall SOME students will go to almost any lengths to secure a university degree in modern India, such is their importance. Stealing examination papers, bribing invigilators and copying are endemic in many of the country's 206 universities. However, Indians have this week been shocked to discover that even Delhi University, one of the country's most prestigious, is not immune to allegations of foul play in the examination hall. Last Saturday, the university authorities were forced to cancel a commercial studies paper after a former student produced a copy before the examination started, claiming he had bought it for Rs10,000 (Pounds 206). On Tuesday, a second commercial studies paper suffered the same fate after a journalist bought a leaked copy for Rs5,000. The leaks followed a host of complaints about misprints in Delhi University exam papers, the poor translation of questions from English into Hindi and the delivery of wrong papers to examination halls. The protests culminated in a sit-in on Thursday by scores of lecturers outside the offices of the vice-chancellor, Professor Upendra Baxi, demanding action to restore the university's damaged reputation. 'What we have earned in 71 years, we now stand to lose because of this failure in the examination system,' says Mr S S Rathi, a physicist and one of the organisers of the demonstration. Professor Baxi has responded by condemning the leaks of papers as an attempt to 'sabotage' the university examination system and calling in the police to investigate the alleged leaks. The number of students enrolled at Indian universities has risen by 75 per cent since 1980 to 4.5m. Delhi University alone has 180,000 students, including thousands doing correspondence courses who sit their examinations in centres throughout the country. The credibility of some smaller institutions has already been destroyed by the weight of student numbers. Mr Rathi says that some universities have been forced to postpone examinations for a year or more because of student unrest and other problems. Now he fears for the future of Delhi University. 'The sanctity of the examination is under threat,' he says. That is a frightening thought for thousands of Indian students and for their prospective employers who have long regarded unversity examination results as the main measure of the worth of potential recruits.</p>

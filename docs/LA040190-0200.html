			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELERS COUNT TOO AS CENSUS GOES TO CAMP;  </P> <P> DEMOGRAPHICS: WORKERS FROM THE SANTA ANA BUREAU CANVASS THE CENTRAL COUNTY FOR  UNTALLIED TOURISTS.  </P> <P> Dan and Edna Barnes travel around the country in their 3-year-old silver camper  for about six months of the year.  </P> <P> They enjoy constantly moving, but the retired Illinois couple ran the danger  this year of going uncounted because they were away from home when their census  form arrived.  </P> <P> The U.S. Census Bureau foresaw that.  </P> <P> The Barneses were among vacationers and travelers counted by more than two  dozen census workers who roamed eight recreational vehicle and mobile home lots  in central Orange County on Saturday evening -- hours before the dawn of  official Census Day. The effort by the bureau's Santa Ana office was part of  the statewide "T-day" -- Transient Day -- count Saturday.  </P> <P> Today is the deadline for people who received census forms to return them by  mail.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good idea for them to come to us," Dan Barnes said, sitting in  his camper parked in an RV lot in Anaheim. "We knew the count was going on with  all the advertising and whatnot. But we've been on the road for about the last  month and didn't get the form."  </P> <P> Census workers said that although T-Day also was held in 1980, this year's  effort was much more advanced.  </P> <P> "We put much more emphasis on making sure we find these people," said Fernando  Tafoyo, district manager. "With the increasing popularity of mobile home parks  with short-term leases and campers, many Americans are moving around a great  deal. And because areas like Anaheim have Disneyland and other attractions, you  get a lot of extra people who might have been on the road for a while."  </P> <P> Aside from campgrounds and mobile home parks, the census workers also surveyed  YMCAs and YWCAs that rent rooms on a short-term basis.  </P> <P> "California is unique in that here the YMCA and YWCA rent to more people on  long-term periods than short-term," said Frank Fletcher, crew leader. "That  made it difficult because we didn't want to recount the same people that were  counted on homeless night." Census workers recently attempted to count the  homeless by going to shelters and other gathering places.  </P> <P> To avoid counting people Saturday who might have already returned their census  forms, workers asked the travelers if they have permanent homes and, if so,  told them to mark a certain box on the form. The computer automatically throws  out two forms from the same address.  </P> <P> Fletcher added that most of the time, people who move from spot to spot are not  homeless or poor, just mobile.  </P> <P> "These people, for the most part, have resources unavailable to the majority of  the homeless," Fletcher said. "Today more people are just seeming to travel  more."  </P> <P> Lloyd and Dorthy Jones said they, too, would have been missed in the count if  the census workers hadn't come to them. They live in a RV with their three  children and move from one trailer park to another every month or so, while  they save enough money to buy a home.  </P> <P> "We haven't had a permanent address for about a year now," Dorthy Jones said  from her camper, now parked in Anaheim, "so we knew they probably couldn't find  us to send a form. And I've been so busy I didn't think much about trying to  get one sent to us. But I know it's important because it means better schools."  </P> <P> Census officials said that determining how many people might occupy a  particular spot is the toughest part of estimating the count.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CENSUS Q&amp;A:  </P> <P> Some answers to questions about those questionnaires.

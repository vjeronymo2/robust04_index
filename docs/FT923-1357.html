			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (6): Clinton is in with a chance - State's moderate voters can make or break a presidential bid FOR more than three decades, the only Democratic presidential candidate that has won the backing of Georgia's voters was its native son, Mr Jimmy Carter. But this year Georgia is up for grabs. It is considered a crucial swing state for both candidates because its moderate-to-conservative Democratic voters are the kind that can make or break a presidential bid. And despite its inclinations toward Republican presidents in the past, many political observers believe that Mr Bill Clinton, who is leading in the polls, has a chance to win it this year . An all-Southern Democratic ticket and an economy still in the doldrums help. 'Clinton goes into this with the solid support, perhaps 80-90 per cent, of the black vote,' says Mr Charles Bulloch, professor of political science at the University of Georgia. 'If Clinton gets 40 per cent of the white vote, he can carry the state.' Some 77 per cent of Georgia's registered voters are white, and voter turnout has generally run about equal for blacks and whites. Complicating matters for the Republicans, Mr Ross Perot is on the ballot in Georgia. Although the effect of his presence is not clear, white conservative Democratic support for Mr George Bush could be diluted. Mr Clinton is also benefiting from the enthusiastic support of Georgia's Democratic governor, Mr Zell Miller. Governor Miller gave a keynote address for Mr Clinton at the Democratic National Convention, and since then has campaigned energetically in Georgia and, on occasion, stood in for Mr Clinton at campaign events in other southern states. As elsewhere, the faltering economy appears to be working against Mr Bush. A recent Atlanta Constitution opinion survey indicated that the economy was considered the most important issue and that 70 per cent of those polled disapproved of the way Mr Bush was handling it. This economic discontent could help bring a shift in some state contests, too. Republicans, always a small minority in the Gerogia state assembly and senate, are not expected to increase their presence greatly, and a number of more liberal Democrats may be elected - thanks in part to redistricting. Yet, like many states where one large city dominates, the traditional split in Georgia has been the more rural state in opposition to Atlanta. In recent years, the division has also taken on a racial aspect as more black legislators have been elected from Atlanta. Blacks dominate the political leadership of the city and this contributes to the feeling, according to Mr Bulloch, that 'Atlanta is a different breed of cat from the rest of the state'. But leading legislators from rural areas, such as Mr Tom Murphy, the Speaker of the House, realise that the economic health of the state depends on the robustness of Atlanta. Finding money for the 1996 Olympics, however, is likely to put this understanding to the test. Atlanta has had a black mayor since Mr Maynard Jackson won election in 1973. He served two four-year terms and was succeeded by Mr Andrew Young, the former US congressman and ambassador to the United Nations, who also served the limit of two consecutive terms. Mr Jackson was then re-elected in 1989. But blacks' political ascendancy in Atlanta has not meant (with a few exceptions) alienation of the city's white power structure. Rather, black political leaders and white business leaders have forged an unusually strong and workable alliance. This has been the product in part of a tradition of white liberalism in Atlanta dating back to the turn of the century and partly, more recently, the pragmatic attitude of business towards a largely black labour market. Other factors have been the presence of top black universities, the existence of a strong black middle class and the fact that Atlanta was the cradle of the civil rights movement, with its prominent leader Rev Martin Luther King, an Atlanta native. The city's remarkably amicable race relations are rooted in this alliance of the black and white elites. According to Mr Young, for the past 30 years leaders of the black community and the chief executives of Atlanta's most important companies have been meeting privately once a month in a group called Atlanta Action Forum. Mr Young says that racial problems still exist, but 'we have a tradition of sitting down and working them out' . Nonetheless, Mr Michael Lomax, the influential black chairman of the Fulton County commission, says the dominant cultural divide remains between blacks and whites. When affluent blacks can choose to live anywhere, they still form black enclaves, he says. 'There's a kind of civility here that doesn't admit a lot of acrimony. The problem with civility is that it hides substantial problems.' But Mr Lomax, like other top black politicians, has support from white voters and white businessmen. And, in a city whose ethic is primarily commercial, the goal - colour aside - is to get ahead. In Atlanta, he says, 'there is no idea that's so dear that it can't be compromised for a good deal'. More deals of all kinds may have to be cut as the city of Atlanta, with just 394,000 people, is becoming swamped by the more populous, wealthier and conservative suburbs. Metropolitan Atlanta is now considered 18 counties with about 3m people and many believe that the political challenge of the futures is the welding together of a new unified regional government. When that idea, now widely discussed, is put on the political agenda, it is expected to ruffle the city's racial harmony. Blacks oppose it because, while it could make economic sense, their political influence would be diminished. However, some larger governing amalgation - short of the full 18 counties - may yet arise. Mr Lomax, who chairs the Atlanta Regional Commission's committee now considering the region's future, says of the city (which lies within his county): 'It's got the name and it has a symbolic role, But in terms of defining the direction of the economic engine called Atlanta, it does not.'</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: European steel plant for Japan - Contracts and ventures Kobe Steel, one of Japan's leading integrated steelmakers, has set up its first European production facility in the Netherlands. The new facility in the De Beitel industrial park will be Europe's largest producer of material for welding stainless steel, and is expected to be completed in May 1995, with commercial production starting in October next year. The new facility will enable Kobe to avoid the impact of the yen's rapid appreciation, high delivery costs and import duties. Kobe plans to supply Europe and the US from its new facility. By 2000, it hopes to expand product lines to become a comprehensive producer of welding materials to supply the shipbuilding, construction and machinery industries. The European market for advanced welding materials is expected to grow to 1,400 tonnes by 2000 from an estimated 1,000 tonnes this year. Kobe Steel has a 40 per cent share of the Japanese market for welding materials.</p>

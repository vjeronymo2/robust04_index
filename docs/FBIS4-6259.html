			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang-visiting  group of former heads of state and government and politicians of  different countries, after going round various places of Korea,  refuted the false propaganda of Western countries and South  Korean rulers about the DPRK.    The former governor-general of Canada, Edward Schreyer,  after  visiting the Panmunjom cooperative farm in the demilitarized  zone along the military demarcation line said he has learned at  first hand there that the DPRK does not build arms, contrary to  so many false reports about it in the West now.    He further said: Here on the spot, I found every house is  occupied, unlike I was told in Seoul. Today I called at any  house I wanted and saw it is occupied. It is a sheer lie to say  that nobody lives in this place.    The executive director of the Summit Council for World  Peace,  Antonio Betancourt, said after going round the farm that they  were told in the South that nobody except army soldiers lives in  this place. "But what I have seen here is quite contrary to what  I heard there," he said.    He said those who don't want peace are now making distorted  reports about the reality of Korea. "The looks of Pyongyang will  be introduced as it is to many countries by the journalists of  different countries included in the visiting group," he added.    Vice-president of the Summit Council for World Strategy of  Japan, Togashi Takayoshi, said he has clearly learned through  the current Korea visit that the Korean people earnestly desire  peace.    Ex-president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Carazo Odio, who is  heading the visiting group, said after inspecting the West Sea  barrage that he didn't think the Korean people built this great  structure to destroy something.</p>

The Tanga zonal customs controller, Ndugu Chris Koroso, told  reporters that the driver, believed to have links with the  consignment, ran away leaving their [as heard] car and passports  behind. The driver told the Horohoro customs official that they  had run short of money and requested to go to neighboring Lunga  Lunga border post on the Kenyan side to make a telephone call to  someone in Mombasa to seek assistance. Ndugu Koroso said that  the two were allowed to go, on condition that they should leave  behind their passports. But they never turned up and the car  was towed to Tanga.    The Tanga regional commissioner, Honorable Azzan Aljabri,  who  witnessed the hoardings of the consignment, commended the  customs officials for the job and called on them to enhance the  campaign.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Consumer optimism hit by Budget Confidence among consumers that the economy will improve has increased but Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget has added to fears that they will be worse off next year, says Gallup, the market research group. Gallup's latest survey of consumer confidence, carried out just after the Budget, showed that people were more concerned about household finances than at any time in the past 3 1/2 years. The poll of 1,986 adults between December 2 and December 14 found that 37 per cent expected their own financial position to worsen next year compared with 19 per cent anticipating an improvement. The resulting balance of minus 18 per cent was 3 percentage points worse than in November and the lowest since April 1990. The survey registered less pessimism about unemployment and the economy in general, however. Although those expecting the economy to improve in the next 12 months were still in a minority, December's negative balance of 9 per cent was less than November's 14 per cent. Just over half those polled (54 per cent) expected unemployment would rise next year, compared with 19 per cent expecting a fall. But the resulting negative balance of 35 per cent was 8 points less than in November. Consumers thought by a slim margin that now was a good time for making a big purchase. However the poll suggested people would spend less on big items next year than during this year. Political Notebook, Page 6</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Cheerful Tories do their sums: The tide may be turning against Labour in Birmingham for local elections Birmingham Conservatives look remarkably cheerful. Not for them the discomfort of rhetorical twists on 'back to basics', paternal confessions about love children, Iraq amnesia and allegations of gerrymandering. They scent power. The campaign for May's local elections in the UK's largest metropolitan authority has already started. Mathematically, the Conservative position is promising. The party needs a gain of four seats to break Labour control, a gain of 10 to become the largest party on the city council and a gain of 16 to win overall control. The party hopes for an election decided on local issues. One of the three main priorities on the Conservative local election platform is what Mr Bernard Zissman, the Tory leader, calls 'waste in the Birmingham council'. Certainly Mrs Theresa Stewart, who came to the Labour leadership from the left of the party, has had three difficult months. There have been rows, and some have been serious, such as those about spending priorities and whether more should be spent on education and less on prestige civil projects such as the International Convention Centre. Some have been trivial, attracting ridicule: for example, the accusation that the council tried to ban Christmas by having Christmas lights without Christian symbols. Labour tightened its grip on the council in 1990, but lost ground at the last local election. At the 1992 elections, the Conservatives won 11 seats, taking their total to 43. Labour was left with 61 and the Liberal Democrats 13, with one held by an independent. This shifting political balance is not unknown in the city. 'Birmingham is untypical in that, historically, there is an even balance between the parties,' said Dr Carl Chinn, Birmingham University's community historian. Labour has had a majority since 1984. Dr Chinn said: 'Labour has been in control longer this time than the normal cycle of six to eight years. It takes three or four years to build up the vote and then three or four years to lose it again.' So there are two contradictory trends. The cyclical trend favours the Tories. However, disillusion with central government favours Labour on the assumption that there is no surge of popularity for Mr John Major's government over the next four months. Mrs Stewart, who has been Labour leader of the council since last autumn, relates control in Birmingham to control of the national government. 'The real pattern in Birmingham is a vote against the government. The only break was 1982 after the Falklands war.' She dismissed Labour losses in 1992 because they happened just after the general election. 'People were carried along on that tide, Labour people were despondent,' she said. In fact, the Tories won local government seats although they lost three parliamentary constituencies in the city. Mr Zissman sees it differently. 'This is a very parochial city,' he said. 'People are interested in what's happening. Even if you think the Conservative government is lacking in popularity, the Labour council is no more popular.' Once the question of management is stripped out, there are similarities between the Conservative and Labour approaches to future policy. Both put education as their top priority. The Conservatives have put forward a plan to offer free development land to companies willing to undertake the refurbishment or new construction of schools. Mrs Stewart said: 'My top priority is to get more money into the schools, trying to do it within the budget process.' After that, Mrs Stewart puts priority on social services and housing, and Mr Zissman on law and order. Now that big spending projects for the city centre, with the building of the International Convention Centre and the amelioration of the traffic system, have been either completed or are under way, the parties' attention is directed to the suburbs - where the votes are. But the burning local issue is one which the political parties can do very little about: the shutting of old hospitals and the plans for new medical complexes. Conservative and Labour alike oppose the plans. Dr Chinn remarked: 'Any party which came out in favour would be massacred.'</p>

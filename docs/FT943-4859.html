			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Straw accuses 'sleazy' Tories A stench of 'sleaze, cronyism, insider dealing, waste and corruption' was enveloping the Conservative party, Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said last night. Mr Straw, speaking in Nottingham, saw no likelihood that the Conservatives' political fortunes would improve with the help of continuing economic growth and falling unemployment. Mr Straw said the Conservatives were in such bad odour because they had reduced the scope of democratic institutions and replaced them with an unaccountable and un-elected 'quango state'. He said a Labour government would establish an elected regional council for the east Midlands, where Pounds 2.4m of taxpayers' money was being spent by 169 quangos and un-elected boards. It would also 'clean up the rules on insider trading, party political funding and the honours system'.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Last significant US asset of MCC sold Price Waterhouse, joint administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, yesterday agreed the sale of Standard Rate &amp; Data Service, the last of MCC's significant assets in the US. Standard Rate &amp; Data, which has annual turnover of between Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m) and Dollars 35m, is the market leader for finding and pricing advertising space in US newspapers and magazines and on radio. The price is thought to be between Dollars 50m and Dollars 70m. Price Waterhouse has signed a letter of intent with a group of private investors, who will be financed in part by Continental Illinois Venture Corporation. They hope to complete the deal by the end of March. The sale will bring the total realised from MCC's US assets to more than Dollars 1.5bn. Mr Alan Jamieson, one of the joint administrators, said Price Waterhouse would be writing to all MCC creditors setting out the detailed realisations and dividend prospects. He said the latest sale had helped to knock the bottom off the 22p-43p in the pound range estimated last year. An additional 9p could emerge from successful litigation.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 ON EPA SAFETY PANEL TIED TO CHEMICAL FIRMS  </P> <P> Two senators said today that members of an Environmental Protection Agency  advisory panel that advised on the use of the chemical Alar on apples had been  receiving income from the chemical industry at the time.  </P> <P> The senators, Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) called on  the EPA to investigate the apparent conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The use of Alar, made by Uniroyal, on apples has sparked a controversy with  disclosure that the chemical has caused cancer in laboratory animals.  </P> <P> Reid and Lieberman said in a letter to the EPA that one member of the EPA's  Scientific Advisory Panel accepted a consulting job with Uniroyal soon after  leaving SAP, where he had been responsible for reviewing the safety of the  chemical.  </P> <P> They said a second member of the panel that reviewed Alar was paid to testify  on behalf of another Uniroyal chemical that the panel had reviewed.  </P> <P> The letter to EPA Administrator William Reilly said the senators "are concerned  that seven of the eight SAP members appear to have been employed as consultants  for the chemical industry while they were members of the SAP."  </P> <P> They added, "Although this information was disclosed, and direct conflicts  avoided, we are concerned that there is a serious appearance problem created  when so many members of an 'independent' scientific panel derive a substantial  portion of their income from the industries they regulate."  </P> <P> Also today, consumer advocate Ralph Nader won a warm response from a Senate  panel when he called for legislation to immediately ban use of Alar on apples.  </P> <P> Nader said Congress "should ban Alar by name, unilaterally and immediately."  </P> <P> He told the Senate subcommittee on toxic substances that there is now "a  convergence" of interest between consumers who do not want Alar on apples and  apple growers hurt by plummeting apple sales.  </P> <P> Nader maintained that the only opposition to an immediate ban comes from  suppliers of Alar.  </P></p>

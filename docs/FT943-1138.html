			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Sweet move for Schapiro Over the years, Robert Schapiro has won a reputation for boldness at Monsanto, writes Richard Waters. The man behind NutraSweet for most of the 1980s, Schapiro embarked on an ambitious marketing plan for the artificial sweetener: he persuaded the makers of food products that contained NutraSweet to carry his product's logo on their packaging, creating a direct bond with consumers. Sales of the sweetener soared. Now 56, Schapiro has just been named the next chairman and chief executive of the chemicals and drugs group, a job he takes on at the start of next year. He follows Richard Mahoney who, at the age of 60 and after 12 years at the top, has decided the time has come to step aside. Wall Street will be looking for some more boldness from Schapiro in future. In particular, a growing band of analysts and investors is looking for Monsanto to sell the Searle drugs business, bought by Monsanto for Dollars 2.5bn in 1985. Without the range of drugs or the economies of scale of its bigger competitors, Searle is seen as a weak competitor in a market which is becoming increasingly dominated by big, institutional buyers. Schapiro, himself a former boss of Searle, has yet to show his hand - though he has said that the company may consider joint ventures or other alliances with other drugs companies. Meanwhile, the stock market greeted news of his promotion with an immediate 5 per cent rise in Monsanto's share price - partly because it suggested that Mahoney believes this year the company would reach his target return on equity of 20 per cent.</p>

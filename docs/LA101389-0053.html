			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 ACCUSED OF KILLING 2 MEN THEY TOOK FOR DEA AGENTS  </P> <P> In a major spinoff of the investigation into the slaying of U.S. Drug  Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, an American citizen and four  Mexican nationals have been indicted in the 1985 torture-murders of two  Americans in Mexico who had been mistaken for narcotics agents, a DEA spokesman  said Thursday.  </P> <P> In addition, the sealed indictment, returned Wednesday by a federal grand jury  in Los Angeles, names a new individual as a defendant in the Camarena slaying,  which took place about a month after the other two murders.  </P> <P> The new defendant is Juan Gilberto Hernandez-Parra, described by DEA officials  as "a federal judicial police officer" from Mexico. He is a fugitive believed  to be at large in his homeland.  </P> <P> Another individual named in the new indictment, Javier Vasquez-Velasco of  Mexico, was arrested without incident in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday  afternoon by members of the DEA's "Operation Leyenda Task Force," according to  agency spokesman Ralph B. Lochridge. The task force was formed to investigate  the Camarena murder.  </P> <P> "It's a major step and a major culmination of the Camarena investigation,"  Lochridge said of the naming of defendants in the January, 1985, murders in  Guadalajara, Mexico, of John Walker, 38, of St. Paul, Minn., and his friend,  Albert Radelat, 32, of Ft. Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> Walker, a Vietnam veteran who had been writing a book about the Mexican Mafia,  and Radelat, a college student, apparently were the victims of mistaken  identity, according to Mexican investigators.  </P> <P> On the evening of Jan. 30, 1985, they went to a restaurant called La Langosta  (The Lobster), which was the scene of a private party hosted by Mexican drug  lord Rafael Caro-Quintero and his sidekick, Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo.  </P> <P> Caro-Quintero and Fonseca-Carrillo, both currently in prison in Mexico on  drug-trafficking convictions, were previously indicted on charges of conspiracy  to kidnap and kill Camarena. In Wednesday's indictment, they both also were  charged in the murders of Walker and Radelat.  </P> <P> According to Mexican authorities, when the two Americans attempted to leave the  restaurant, they were stopped by Caro-Quintero's bodyguards when someone  identified them as "DEA spies." Both protested to no avail.  </P> <P> Mexican investigators said the two were forced into separate rooms in the  restaurant where they were tortured with knives and ice picks for more than an  hour. Investigators believed Walker died from the torture and that Radelat was  shot to death at a nearby park, where both were buried.  </P> <P> "The killers believed they were DEA agents," recounted Lochridge. "So we  believe the killers felt very macho" when the DEA took no immediate action in  the case.  </P> <P> "Since they were not DEA agents, we weren't immediately aware of their  murders," the DEA spokesman said.  </P> <P> A month later, Camarena, 37, was kidnaped as he left the U.S. Consulate in  Guadalajara to meet his wife for lunch. His severely beaten body and that of  his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were found several weeks later on a remote  ranch 70 miles north of that city.  </P> <P> In the new indictment returned Wednesday, five individuals in all were indicted  in the murders of Walker and Radelat.  </P> <P> They are: Hernandez-Parra; Vasquez-Velasco; Caro-Quintero, described by drug  investigators as the mastermind of the murder of Camarena; Fonseca-Carrillo;  and Ezequiel Godinez-Cervantes, a U.S. citizen who escaped from Lompoc Federal  Penitentiary, where he was serving a prison term on drug charges. He was  subsequently captured in Mexico and is in prison term there on a drug  trafficking conviction.  </P> <P> Two of the five indicted on Wednesday, Vasquez-Velasco and Godinez-Cervantes,  have not been charged in the Camarena murder.  </P> <P> Two other Mexican nationals, Rene Verdugo Urquidez, one of Caro-Quintero's top  lieutenants, and Raul Alvarez-Lopez, a Mexican state police officer, were each  sentenced in Los Angeles federal court in October, 1988, to life plus 240 years  in prison for their roles in the Camarena murder.  </P> <P> Another Mexican national, Jesus Felix Gutierrez, received a maximum of 10 years  when he was sentenced in federal court in Los Angeles in September, 1988, for  helping Caro-Quintero flee to Costa Rica in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid  prosecution in the Camareno murder.  </P> <P> Yet another defendant, Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, a state police homicide  investigator from Guadalajara, is awaiting trial in Los Angeles in the Camarena  slaying.  </P> <P> DEA spokesman Lochridge said the Camarena investigation has not concluded.  </P> <P> "We anticipate additional arrests and prosecutions," he said. "The DEA will not  rest until everyone involved is captured and prosecuted."  </P></p>

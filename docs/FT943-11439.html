			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Chilean growth seen as rising to more than 4% Chile's main business federation has revised upwards its estimate of economic growth in 1994 to between 4 and 4.5 per cent. At the start of the year many business leaders were forecasting growth in the range of 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent after the economy had cooled rapidly in the second half of 1993. 'The difficulties that we foresaw at the beginning of the year are dispersing and it is becoming increasingly clear that the economy will grow by roughly 4-4.5 per cent,' said Mr Jose Antonio Guzman, president of the CPC. 'I am more optimistic than I was in January,' he said. Mr Guzman attributed the improved prospects to the higher prices being fetched by Chile's principal exports - copper, cellulose and fish meal  - which were depressed for most of last year. Exports in the first half of 1994 rose by 9.3 per cent over the same period last year to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.4bn), with non-traditional exports up 18 per cent. Imports rose by only 5.3 per cent, although those of capital goods increased by 16 per cent, encouraging hopes of future productivity gains. Mr Guzman's statements follow the release of several other encouraging economic indicators, most recently a sharp rise in the monthly economic activity index for May, bringing the growth rate over the first five months of 1994 to 3.8 per cent. May's rise in the index of 6.8 per cent was the highest since last June. The strong export performance, which has produced a balance of trade surplus of Dollars 237m for the first six months (in spite of a deficit in June) has prompted the central bank to revise its trade estimates for the second time this year. The bank now expects a trade deficit of only Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m, compared with the near Dollars 1bn deficit predicted at the start of the year.</p>

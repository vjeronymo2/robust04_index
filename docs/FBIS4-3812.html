			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the  Nanchang new and high-tech development zone in this capital of  Jiangxi Province is going full steam ahead.    One of the state's new- and high-tech development zones, the  zone located in the eastern suburbs of Nanchang covers 6.8 sq km.    Three sq km are being developed in the first phase.    A local official said that the zone has already spent 80  million yuan on building infrastructure facilities.

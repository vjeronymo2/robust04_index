			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mirian Lebanidze article: "The Liberal-Democrats Have </F> Joined the Opposition"]    [Text] A year and a half has passed since the second  national elections in Georgia. The fall of Gagra [in Abkhazia]  was the first serious blow to Eduard Shevardnadze's prestige.  Since then, the head of state's popularity has been on the  decline. He has bequeathed the return of Abkhazia and the  restoration of [Georgia's] statehood to "grateful generations"  and united a fragmented Georgia to the CIS.    Joining the CIS has thinned out the parliamentary majority.  On 5 May, the Liberal-Democratic National Party [LDNP] declared  itself as [part of] the opposition. Party leader Batoni Mikheil  Naneishvili delivered a report to Parliament in which he exposed  the incorrectness of the political course chosen by Shevardnadze.    Joining the CIS became the main reason for the Liberals'  dissatisfaction. Their first protest followed the statement  made by Speaker of Parliament Goguadze [on the necessity of  Georgia joining the CIS]. "We felt that this idea was not  implanted in him by the Holy Ghost," stated Batoni Naneishvili  (in a speech delivered in Parliament, he assessed such an action  by a deputy as a "minor prank").    The Liberal-Democrats had earlier been united with the  Greens  Party in an alliance of "liberals" and were viewed as supporters  of the head of state, although, as Naneishvili said, they had  often criticized Shevardnadze in private. Following the events  connected with joining the CIS, their party was completely  ignored. In spite of Naneishvili's statements, no one paid any  attention to them. They, however, continued to wait and are  still waiting for the government to see the results of the  mistakes that have been made.    The LDNP previously kept in the background. On 5 May, they  decided to emerge from the shadows.    In Naneishvili's statement of 5 May it is stated that the  personnel policy chosen by the head of state is unable to  satisfy the demands of the state. The Cabinet of Ministers  approved by him is unable to conduct reforms. It is made up of  old appointees who are used to "doing nothing." Shevardnadze  and his government are demanding the restoration and expansion  of "old ties," which the LDNP views as absurd: They are  creating an association of enslaving ties characteristic of the  Soviet period. Naneishvili called the policy being conducted by  the head of state and his supporters as "reactionary."    Following such a non-liberal statement, the LDNP is  demanding, first and foremost, that Georgia leaves the CIS.  They believe that it is necessary to follow a completely  different political course, one that will be totally dissociated  from the CIS. It is Mikheil Naneishvili's belief that it will  be possible for Georgia to free itself completely from Russia's  influence if the government shows itself to be resolute and if  it orients itself toward the West.    The LDNP has distanced itself from those supporting the  government but it has also been unable to side with the  opposition. According to Naneishvili, they have found themselves  between the devil and the deep blue sea: They criticize  Shevardnadze but do not demand his resignation. They are hoping  to see something undone that cannot be undone. The Liberals  remain liberals.</p>

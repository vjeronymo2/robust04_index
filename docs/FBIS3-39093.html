With the first stage of Maastricht's "Europol" due to be  formally opened in The Hague on Feb 16, disagreements have  broken out over the detail of the body's convention, due to be  signed this October.    But as the new, powerful and secretive K4 committee of  national interior ministry officials meets in Brussels, Britain  is preparing to enter vehement reservations.    Mr Anthony Langdon, Britain's representative, will tell his  colleagues Europol should remain strictly an  intelligence-swapping operation, similar to Interpol.    The prospect of "federal agents" from Germany or France  being  deployed in Britain is likely to cause uproar among Tory  Eurosceptics .    British sources last night said they did not want "people in  uniforms" being attached to Europol, let alone sent on missions.    Since its home was agreed at last October's Brussels summit,  the organisation has consisted of about 40 officers of different  EC nationalities, occupying rooms in the Dutch information  ministry. The total will rise to about 70 by the end of the year.    At present, Europol's sole task is to pool intelligence on  drug traffickers. Each of the seconded police and customs  officers remains primarily loyal to his own government, with  full discretion over whether to give out data to colleagues from  other EC countries.    The question now is whether to create a more fully federal  body, allowing all Europol operatives equal access to all  national data.    This would especially enrage the Danish government, which  has  strong secrecy laws, and almost certainly the British as well.    But the Germans and the EC Commission want to go further,  drafting the convention so that it allows for more direct action  by Europol.    "If you are operating in a world where the police are not  stopped at the frontier, the best way to do it is to have a  Europolice force," said an EC source last night.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (p) Arises from the activities of the Panama Canal Commission (28 U.S.C. 2680(m)). (See 76A Stat. 22 through 25, and 22 U.S.C. 3761.) Claims accruing after the effective date of the Panama Canal Treaty (1 October 1979) may be cognizable under either the FCA or the MCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (q) Arises from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or bank for cooperatives (28 U.S.C. 2680(n)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (r) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States incurred incident to service, or for damage to a member's property incurred incident to service (Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950)). (See &sect;536.25 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;26 through 8&hyph;28.) Currently the most significant justification for the incident to service doctrine is the availability of alternative compensation systems, and the fear of disrupting the military command relationship. Other supportive factors often cited by the courts are the service member's duty status, location, and receipt of military benefits at the time of the incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The exception applies to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces. (See 10 U.S.C. 261.) The exception also applies to service members on the Temporary Disability Retired List, on convalescent leave, and on the extended enlistment program; to service academy cadets; and to members of visiting forces in the United States under the SOFA between the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty or similar international agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The incident to service doctrine has been extended to derivative claims where the directly injured party is a service member. Third party indemnity claims are barred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (s) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C. 8101&hyph;8150). (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) Who is a Government employee under the Act is defined in the Act itself (5 U.S.C. 8101), but the term is not limited to Federal Civil Service employees. The term ``Government employee'' can include certain ROTC cadets (5 U.S.C. 8140) and State or local law enforcement officers engaged in apprehending a person for committing a crime against the United States (5 U.S.C. 8191), certain nurses, interns, or other health care personnel, for example, student nurses, (5 U.S.C. 5351, 8144), and certain Army Community Service Volunteers (10 U.S.C. 1588; AR 608&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) This Act provides that benefits paid under this Act are exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States, including that under a Federal tort liability statute (5 U.S.C. 8116(c)). It extends to derivative claims, subsequent malpractice for treatment of a covered injury, injuries for which there is no scheduled compensation, and employee harassment claims for which other remedies are available (42 U.S.C. 2000e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is from a federal civilian employee based on a allegation of a violation of some employment right or is otherwise one for which the rules governing federal civilian employment provide a comprehensive remedy. Such claims often allege emotional distress or psychological injury as a result of the alleged misconduct. Administrative remedies under the civil service regulations are the employee's exclusive remedy. Bush v. Lucas 462 U.S. 367 (1983). This exception does not bar third party indemnity claims. When there is doubt as to whether or not this exception applies, the claim should be forwarded through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, for an opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (t) Is for the personal injury or death of an employee including nonappropriated fund employees, for whom benefits are provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950). An employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality is covered by the Act (5 U.S.C. 8171). This is exclusive for covered employees, similar to that under the FECA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (u) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under any workmen's compensation law if the premiums of the workmen's compensation insurance are retrospectively rated and charged as an allowable, allocable expense to a cost-type contract. (See &sect;536.28 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) If, in the opinion of an approval or settlement authority the claim should be considered payable (for example, the injuries did not result from a normal risk of employment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation laws), the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS who may authorize payment of an appropriate award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Is for taking of property as by technical trespass or overflight of aircraft and of a type contemplated by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or otherwise constitutes ataking. (See paragraph 2c of AR 405&hyph;15 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;46, 8&hyph;74, and 8&hyph;75.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in part ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims for takings without just compensation are action-able under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) and 1491, Appendix. A., 24 Stat. 505 (1887)). Prior to referring a claimant to a Tucker Act remedy, the applicability of the procedures under AR 405&hyph;15 should be considered by referral to appropriate Corps of Engineers authorities. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;75.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (w) Is for damage from or by flood or flood waters at any place (33 U.S.C. 702c). This exception is broadly construed and includes multipurpose projects and all phases of construction and operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury occurring directly or indirectly as a result of the exercise of performance of, or failure to exercise or perform, any function or duty by any Federal agency or employee of the Government to carry out the provisions of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 during the existence of a civil defense emergency (50 U.S.C. Appendix 2291&hyph;2297). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (y) Is based solely upon a theory of absolute liability or liability without fault. Either a negligent or wrongful act is required by the FTCA, and some type of malfeasance or nonfeasance is required (Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15 (1953); Laird v. Nelms, 406 U.S. 797 (1972)). Thus, liability does not arise by virtue either of United States ownership of an inherently dangerous commodity or of engaging in extra-hazardous activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

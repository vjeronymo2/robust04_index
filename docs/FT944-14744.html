Not an excuse often heard by school heads, but one that Christopher Barnett of Croydon's Whitgift School had to accept on Monday night when his star turn, Ivan Stancioff, former Bulgarian ambassador in London, pulled out at the last minute. However Aglika Markova, the embassy's cultural attache, filled the slot admirably. She informed pupils that Bulgarian education has come a long way from the days when teachers were forced to tell their pupils that aeroplanes and steam engines were invented in Russia in the 16th century.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- The African National  Congress said it was "outraged" that Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel had shredded official documents, and asked what  dark secrets he was so eager to keep from the public. "We have  no doubt that the documents that are being destroyed contains  evidence of how the National Party abused the South African  Police for their own petty party political aims," the ANC said  in a statement on Sunday [24 April] in reaction to reports that  Mr Kriel had shredded the documents on leaving his office.    The ANC asked whether the documents were related to Third  Force activities. It said Mr Kriel was trying to rob South  Africans of their right to know what happened during the  apartheid years. The ANC said Mr Kriel would continue abusing  power if he gained any position of seniority in the race for the  Western Cape premiership.    Mr Kriel has said the papers were personal and party  political.</p>

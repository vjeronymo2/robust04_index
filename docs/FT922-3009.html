			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / How to Spend It: Chaps and chukkas and polo pin-ups - Lucia van der Post finds how best to dress for sporting success off the field, and discovers a new lease of life at Dunhill except more expensive. Chaps on ponies tore round fields, wielding sticks and playing chukkas while their womenfolk and assorted hangers-on used it as a fine excuse for quaffing Krug and eyeing both the ponies and the chaps. Then the marketing men began to realise that all that manliness, that heady mix of outdoorsiness, of skill and derring-do and the glamorous groupies it attracted, offered a heaven-sent opportunity to promote their wares. Thus was ushered in the sponsored polo event, which turns the Guards Polo Club's Smith's Lawn at Windsor into a passable imitation of an Indian durbar, without the heatstroke. The marquees billow, the flags fly, the champagne flows and the glitterati turn up in their hundreds. The sartorial problem this poses is that an invitation to one of the great sponsored days at Smiths' Lawn, which even now many of you may be contemplating, is no longer just an invitation to a sporting event - it is also a social one, where the purpose of the exercise is no longer just to count the goals, tread in the divots and marvel at the skills but also to see and be seen, and possibly be photographed. What, then, does one wear? Last Sunday saw the first of the great sponsored days when Alfred Dunhill entertained some 400 guests, polo names, glamorati, journalists and marketing men to lunch and tea. Notions of appropriate dress varied from chic little cocktail numbers, glittery jewels and dinky handbags to laid-back jeans and blazers. If in doubt it is, of course, not much use taking one's lead from the Queen, who has that endearing habit of looking as if she has just nipped out into her own back garden - which, of course, she has. Habituees of the polo grounds can be easily spotted - they wear well-cut jeans, crisp white shirts, navy-blue blazers, Gucci loafers, good scarves, Alice bands and chain-handled bags. On anybody young, long-legged and long-maned the look is great - a bit stereotyped maybe, but classy and appropriate. Of those lunching in the smart marquees the most successful outfits seemed the simplest. The American contingent is usually band-box smart - hats, designer suits, lots of jewellery - but at Smiths' Lawn it tends to look a little overdone. Dunhill warns its guests. 'This is an English outdoor sporting event. Please bring sensible shoes and a raincoat.' And just in case their guests fail to get the message about the peculiarities of the English summer, it hands out umbrellas and blankets at the door. Of the Americans, Christina Ford, in a striking but simple black and wool suit, looked warm (often essential), comfortable and at ease - always a good start. Navy wool or linen blazers over a silky vest and teamed with simple skirts, either long or short, looked good. Really good loafers or other flat shoes somehow looked more appropriate (treading in the divots between chukkas is part of the ritual) than high heels. Miriam Francome, estranged wife of the jockey John Francome, looked wonderfully relaxed and at ease in soft, trousers, a check jacket by Victor Edelstein and a simple vest, all in sophisticated neutral shades. Dawn Mello, design supremo at Gucci and responsible for breathing new life, wit and vitality into the brand, was Gucci-clad from head to toe - warm three-quarters jacket over a shortish skirt in a soft peachy shade, simple creamy vest, pale tights, taupe court shoes and. of course, one of those bamboo-handled handbags. Opinion on hats is divided. They are probably de rigueur if you hope to catch a paparazzi's lens or are in the serious glamour business, like Anouska Hempel and Joan Collins. Otherwise I incline to the view that they look a little bit too dressy, as if their wearers are trying too hard. Apart from anything else, they impede other people's view. As for the men, there were plenty of suits, all looking perfectly appropriate if a little formal, but somehow a navy blazer, grey flannels and loafers looked that much more relaxed. Lord Patrick Beresford, in navy-blue blazer, stone wool gaberdine trousers with turn-ups, and loafers, got it absolutely right. THERE IS something peculiarly piquant about the future Duke of Wellington setting out to woo and win one of the jewels in the crown of the Parisian Haut Monde - the tres, tres chic house of Karl Lagerfeld. When Dunhill Holdings (of which Lord Douro, the future Duke of Wellington, is chairman) felt in need of some heady feminine charm to provide some pizzaz to its image, in the hallowed tradition of 19th century English mi'lords, Lord Douro cast his eye across the Channel, where it alighted on Karl Lagerfeld. Not that buying the talents of the eccentric 'Kaiser Karl' is a mere aristocratic faiblesse or folie. It is all part of a hard-headed, carefully worked-out strategy - building up Dunhill Holdings into a leader in quality brands. Dunhill until recently has seemed to outsiders almost like a sleeping giant  -a splendid brand name, but where were the products to match? Dunhill's long-term strategy is clearly to build a luxury prestige group that will appeal to the Japanese and the rest of the hugely lucrative Far Eastern market, one that will compete with the best in the world. When it comes to menswear, in which the company is very strong, most of what it needs - an old and traditional presence in London (the Jermyn Street flagship store) and a clutch of instantly recognisable and desirable products - it already has. But to cash in on the vast amounts of feminine cash that currently finds its way into names like Yves St. Laurent, Chanel, Hermes and the like it needed a much stronger feminine brand - which is where Karl Lagerfeld and Chloe (bought by Dunhill in 1985) come in. Dunhill is one of those essentially British brands: sound, solid, (and VERY VERY profitable) but lacking a certain elan. Think Dunhill and what comes to mind? Navy-blue blazer, pipes, tobacco, and watches - all very understated and fine quality, but a little short on true allure. If short on allure, Dunhill has not been short of profits. Cash rich and solidly profitable it has come an enormous distance since the 1970s when annual profits were languishing in single figures (about Pounds 3m) and the core of the business was smokers' accessories. Today, profits stand at Pounds 48m (after tax) and smokers' accessories account for just 3 per cent of the business. The product range has been carefully and greatly extended,but the brand has never been debased. Distribution and outlets have been carefully controlled. Acquisitions such as Mont Blanc (which was turning in losses when Dunhill bought it and has since become a money-spinner) and Hackett, the oh-so-pukka menswear business with the slightly fogeyish air, are all fine quality businesses. Dunhill's big problem, however, is that it is rather like the prophet lacking honour and recognition in its own country. Its image is far stronger in the Far East (where it is right up there with Chanel, Vuitton, Hermes and Cartier) than it is here in Britain and Europe. For the moment much of its efforts are being channelled into consolidating itself in Europe - which, of course, is essential if it is to go on selling sell well in the Far East, as an image of old European tradition is primarily what the Japanese are buying. In Europe there are still too few Dunhill shops - just nine (five in the UK, three in Germany, one in France) - so plans are afoot to open at least two more this year, one in Madrid and one in Geneva. The addition of the ebullient Lagerfeld to the stable offers a great opportunity for profile-raising. It is still early days to see exactly what all this will mean to the British consumer. There can hardly be a more exciting designer in the world than Lagerfeld, and if the Dunhill connection means that his abundant talents will be made more accessible then we may all have cause to celebrate. Mounir Moufarrige, the Paris-based Dunhill Holdings director responsible for developing both the Chloe and the Lagerfeld labels, has every intention of making both labels more accessible, not just in Britain but all over the world. 'They will be two distinct entirely different lines, each competing with the other. The Lagerfeld label will be strong, pointed, forward-looking, while the Chloe line will be softer, rounded, lighter, more feminine, very sensual. More shops - both for the Chloe and the Karl Lagerfeld label - are certainly planned, but also we are already working on a much expanded range of products for both labels.' In couture-house speak, 'expanded range of products' means accessories - the real route to riches. Couture houses are not, of course, about couture - they are about selling silk scarves, gilded belts, must-have jewellery, definitive shoes, heady perfumes at loadsa dollars a time. It is not lost on anybody that at Chanel (where, eight years ago, Karl Lagerfeld was brought in to revitalise the dying brand and in so doing doubled the fortune of its owner, Alain Wertheimer) five out of every six sales are in accessories. It is not just that the product range will be expanded - the shops are to be given a much more striking and more consistent look, and early next year we should begin to see the first fruits of these efforts. As to the question of whether 'Kaiser Karl's' talent can encompass both labels (as well as what he already does for Chanel and Fendi) Mounir Moufarrige has no doubts. 'It has been like an engagement - we have been talking for well over a year, discussing these questions before we, so to speak, made the marriage. Lagerfeld designed for Chloe for twenty years before so he feels as if he were coming home. The two sides of his personality - the sharp and the soft - need different outlets.' Flag-waving is out of fashion these days but nonetheless it would be good to see a British luxury goods company of the stature of Dunhill give the French-based LVMH a real run for its money.</p>

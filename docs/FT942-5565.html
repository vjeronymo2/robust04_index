			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bridge urges shareholders to reject bid Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company which is the subject of a ADollars 295m (USDollars 226.9m) unsolicited bid from Texas-based Parker &amp; Parsley, said yesterday that independent valuations had suggested that Bridge shares were worth between ADollars 0.95 and ADollars 1.13. It noted that this was substantially higher than the current 70 cents-a-share cash offer from the US oil independent, and urged shareholders to reject the bid. 'The offer is a blatantly opportunistic attempt to get you to sell your shares at a price well below their true value,' commented Bridge directors.</p>

A UN delegation headed by Gustav  Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special envoy in  Cyprus, met with a Turkish Cypriot delegation headed by  President Rauf Denktas at the President's Office this afternoon.  The meeting attended by Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy  prime minister; Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense  minister; presidential advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Onur  Olgun; and Ozer Koray, Foreign Ministry under secretary from the  Turkish Cypriot side and Feissel's aide John Paul Cavanaugh and  other UN experts lasted for two and a half hours.    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said the views and  ideas that emerged as a result of the cabinet meeting this  morning, taking into consideration the draft document, were  explained to Feissel. Pointing out that views were exchanged on  the draft, Denktas added that the UN delegation will be holding  a meeting with Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis this afternoon.  He noted that he will hold another meeting with the UN  delegation on Friday morning [18 March]. Denktas noted that the  necessary messages were relayed to the UN delegation, adding  that it is out of the question to have a single gate at the  Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport and that the agreement  pertained to the inside of the airport. He said: We will  naturally have a separate gate. If we want a separate customs  check that is what we will have. In reply to another question,  Denktas said procedures concerning the Turkish Cypriot side will  be handled by Turkish Cypriots at the Lefkosa International  Airport, and the procedures that will be performed by the others  will be to stamp the passports of foreign tourists with the UN  airport seal. In reply to a question by a Bayrak Radio and  television correspondent on whether one could say that we are on  the right track, Denktas said: We will meet again on Friday.

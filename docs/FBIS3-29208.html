As stated by a source concerned  with a major automaker, the automobile industry appreciates the  Japanese Government's attitude, saying: "Establishing numerical  targets, which was our concern, has been avoided." However,  according to the same source, while observing that "the U.S.  stance of not understanding Japan's position has not changed,"  the industry is concerned the U.S. Government and Congress may  stiffen their attitude.    What the automobile industry is afraid of is the government  will ask it to work out a voluntary purchase plan for U.S.-made  automobiles and auto parts in order to break the deadlock in  negotiations, just as the government did when (then) President  Bush visited Japan in 1992. Although the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] actually sounded out the  auto industry concerning the purchase plan, every automaker  expressed opposition, saying: "(Since business activities have  now been aggravated,) the situation is different from in 1992."  Eventually, MITI's goal was not achieved.    The electrical appliance industry also highly approves of  the  government stance on the telecommunications issue, a focal point  within the government procurement sector under the framework  talks. According to Tadashi Sekizawa, president of Fujitsu Ltd.,  the industry stated: "The government has consistently  maintained that establishing numerical targets would lead to  managed trade, and as a result, the failure to reach an  agreement was unavoidable." Life insurance and nonlife  insurance circles issued statements approving of the breakdown  in the framework talks. According to Takashi Onoda, chairman of  the Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Association of Japan,  Incorporated,  they said "the failure to reach an agreement was inevitable."  In negotiations in the insurance sector, the United States  demanded that the share of business of foreign-affiliated  companies on the Japanese market be increased to a two-digit  percent to reach the same level as other members of the G-7  (Group of Seven). Meanwhile, according to a top executive of a  major nonlife insurance company, Japan opposed the U.S. demand,  maintaining "the attitude of shutting their eyes to the lack of  their own efforts has proved to be managed trade." Therefore,  as stated by a top executive of a major life insurance company,  the industry is relieved, saying that "failure is better than an  agreement which includes numerical targets."</p>

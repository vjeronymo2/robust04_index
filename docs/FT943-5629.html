			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Big livestock cuts needed' to meet EU pollution targets Livestock numbers in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark would have to be cut dramatically if the European Union was to reach its targets for reducing nitrate concentrations in drinking water, Mr Bob Crabtree, from the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, told a conference in Aberdeen yesterday. He cited a report from the US Department of Agriculture forecasting that livestock herds would have to be cut in the Netherlands by 65 per cent, in Belgium by 28 per cent and in Denmark by 9 per cent over eight years. The cuts would have to occur if producers, particularly in intensive farming regions, were unable to dispose of their slurry and animal manure in an environmentally acceptable way. 'Concern with water pollution from chemicals, nitrates and phosphates has increased during the last decade, particularly in the more intensively-farmed areas of Europe,' Mr Crabtree said. The EU's nitrates directive, which was published in 1991, advocated setting up nitrate vulnerable zones where restrictions would be placed on the timing and quantity of organic manure disposal. The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed 74 zones for the UK. Mr Crabtree said the creation of the zones would place a heavy and expensive burden on many livestock farmers. 'Some intensive units will need to invest in increased storage facilities for slurry and manure while seeking ways to dispose of waste over a wider area than has been necessary in the past,' he said. He also called for increased research into technical solutions to the use of farm waste, other than the traditional spreading of slurry and manure on the land. In countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, where intensive farming was more widespread, the impact of the nitrates directive could erode some competitiveness, Mr Crabtree suggested. But he questions whether that would be politically feasible. 'There will undoubtedly be an erosion in the competitive position of designated areas and a progressive transfer of production to less vulnerable areas as fixed investments depreciate and need replacement,' he said.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Foreign exchange tax to be more equitable COMPANIES will be subject to more equitable taxation on foreign exchange gains and losses, under long-awaited and radical draft legislation circulated yesterday by the Inland Revenue. The changes will principally affect any UK companies that take out finance in foreign currencies and those with assets held in foreign currencies subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations. The rules will permit them to offset losses on exchange fluctuations against tax for the first time. Previously they have been taxed on any exchange gains without being allowed to take any corresponding allowances for losses. The Revenue said the legislation would not be retrospective, so it will not help companies which suffered heavy exchange losses after the depreciation of sterling when Britain withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism last autumn. Tax practitioners generally welcomed the proposals as a change that would bring the UK into line with tax regimes in other countries. Mr Derek Jenkins, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This gives British companies more of a level playing field with the rest of the world. They will be taxed on their trading transactions in foreign currencies in the same way as they are accounted for in economic terms.' Ms Emma Lubbock of Price Waterhouse said: 'Companies will welcome the certainty of tax treatment and the removal of anomalies.' She said they would find the 40 pages of regulations and notes daunting. The Revenue said the effect of the changes would be broadly tax neutral, with any losses from the introduction of allowances being offset by new taxes on gains which were outside the remit of previous legislation. The draft regulations have been circulated for comment before the end of March following a previous consultation document in 1991. The legislation is unlikely to be enacted until next year at the earliest. Practitioners said the new version reflected the comments made during consultations with organisations, including the so-called 'Group of Nine' professional bodies and corporate representatives. Mr Jenkins said there were still concerns about the apparent exclusion from the new rules of allowances for foreign exchange losses of holding companies, and for foreign companies with a series of UK operations. He also expressed doubts about the fairness of some of the provisions for anti-avoidance on loans between related parties and on inconsistent taxes and allowances on unrealised gains. Ms Lubbock said that in the short term companies that had structured their operations to accomodate exisiting tax arrangements would be concerned about the implications of the new system and how it would be implemented. She said the new arrangements would treat all exchange movements on monetary balances as part of ordinary taxable income, removing the tax distinction between long-term and short-term balances.</p>

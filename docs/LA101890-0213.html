			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK;  </P> <P> PLAN TO MOVE CIVIC CENTER ABANDONED  </P> <P> The City Council has abandoned a proposal to move the civic center to a new  site in a residential area, a plan that led to a contentious debate in this  normally tranquil city.  </P> <P> After a short public hearing Tuesday, the council voted 3 to 1 against moving  the city offices to a new site at the corner of Center Drive and Villa Park  Road.  </P> <P> In opposing the move, council members cited the results of a citizens' advisory  committee survey that showed 90% of 950 respondents were opposed.  </P> <P> The move would have provided enough space to triple the size of the existing  civic center, but many residents criticized the plan as an attempt to build a  "Taj Mahal."  </P> <P> Although Mayor John Frackelton said he accepted the advisory committee's  recommendation, he added that he would vote to drop consideration of the new  site "with a heavy heart."  </P> <P> Only Councilman Harold H. Saldarini voted to save the proposal, saying  afterward that he thought the council had "missed a golden opportunity" to move  the offices and library to the only other viable site in the city.  </P> <P> Still, some residents are angry that consideration of the new site was not  dropped earlier.  </P> <P> "They've known for months that the citizens are not in favor of the massive  things they're proposing. But they continued to prolong this agony," said  resident Don Ebrite.  </P> <P> City officials have said that some form of expansion is necessary to relieve  crowding at the current offices and to add a conference room and library space.  The council will now pursue plans to expand the city's offices in the Villa  Park Shopping Center.  </P> <P> Although most residents agree the civic center offices are too crowded, they  are divided on how much additional space is enough.

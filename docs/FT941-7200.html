			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong last term gives AIG record year with Dollars 1.94bn American International Group, the US property/casualty insurer, yesterday unveiled an 11 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 510.2m, or Dollars 1.61 a share. The strong final quarter lifted full-year earnings to a record Dollars 1.94bn, or Dollars 6.11. In 1992, the group earned Dollars 1.66bn, or Dollars 5.20. The figures include net realised capital gains and the impact of accounting changes, which were reported as Dollars 11.5m for the quarter and Dollars 89m for the year. AIG said group revenues rose 10.2 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 5.36bn, and 9.5 per cent in the year to Dollars 20.13bn. Mr Maurice Greenberg, chairman, said the strong quarterly and annual results reflected the increase in operating income reported by all of AIG's three main businesses - general insurance, life insurance and financial services. He singled out the performance of the group's Asian operations, particularly its new life and non-life insurance operations in China, which he said had an 'outstanding' debut. The annual results were boosted by significantly lower catastrophe losses last year than in 1992 when the insurance industry paid out large sums following Hurricane Andrew and other big disasters. Catastrophe losses for 1993 were Dollars 69.5m, down from Dollars 191.7m the year before. One positive side-effect of the 1992 disasters was that it led to a strengthening in the reinsurance market in the form of higher premiums and new capital. Also, AIG said insurance rates had risen in several overseas markets. General insurance premiums written by the group climbed almost 10 per cent to more than Dollars 10bn last year, which helped lift operating income from the general insurance business 28 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn. In the quarter, income climbed 21 per cent to Dollars 356.4m. AIG's financial services group prospered, with operating income rising 12.6 per cent to Dollars 390m.</p>

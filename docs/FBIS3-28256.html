The 50-meter, two-stage rocket is the first major space  vehicle developed and manufactured entirely in Japan, freeing  Japan's aerospace industry after decades of heavy dependence on  U.S. technology.    Previous Japanese rockets used U.S. technology under a  licensing agreement that bans launches of third-nation  satellites.    The orange and yellow H-2 rocket blasted off early Friday at  Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan after a three-day  delay due to bad weather and technical snags.    As scheduled, the rocket released a dish-shaped payload  called the Orbital Reentry Experiment (OREX) about 15 minutes  after blastoff, successfully having it reenter the atmosphere to  gather data for developing a Japanese version of the U.S. space  shuttle.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a statement hailing  the successful launch of the H-2 rocket as "creating new  prospects for the 21th century."    Tomifumi Godai, chief of the National Space Development  Agency of Japan (NASDA), said the successful liftoff of the H-2  rocket put an end to "a quarter-century approach run" to catch  up with the United States and other aerospace leaders.    "Now we mark the beginning of activity to lead the world,"  Godai told a press conference.    Masato Yamano, NASDA director in charge of the launch of the  H-2 rocket, described the two-hour space mission as a great step  forward toward space development.    "The successful launch of the H-2 rocket demonstrates the  practicality of our technologies developed to date and is a  great achievement toward developing a transport system to  promote diversified space activities," Yamano said.    The H-2 rocket, Japan's first rocket capable of launching  large communications and earth observation satellites, was  developed by Rocket Systems Corp. (RSC), a consortium of more  than 70 companies led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., at a  cost of 270 billion yen.    The technological centerpiece of the rocket is the  first-stage engine, the LE7, modeled on the U.S. space shuttle  engine and considered one of the world's most sophisticated  rocket power drives.    But due to the complexity of the LE7 engine that runs on  liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the first launch of the H-2 rocket  was two years behind schedule as a series of accidents delayed  the project, including an explosion in 1991 that killed an  engineer and a fuel leak in 1992 that burned an engine in test  running.    People involved in the H-2 rocket development said the  launch  was a complete success, but acknowledged there are many problems  to be overcome before Japan can get a foothold in the  satellite-launching business.    The biggest problem is to make the H-2 competitive in the  international satellite-launching market, currently dominated by  the European consortium Arianespace and General Dynamics Corp.  of the United States.    The H-2 rocket costs some 19 billion yen, including  launching  expenses, which makes it 1.5 to two times more expensive than  its U.S. and European counterparts.    But NASDA and RSC officials are looking to make up for the  price disadvantage with a reputation for reliability.    "We could offset such a price gap if we increase  reliability," an RSC official said.    There are still nontechnical hurdles, such as a pact with  fishermen around Tanegashima Island.    The agreement allows launches only in the January-February  and August-September periods, because the launches disrupt  fishing activity, meaning only two rockets can be launched a  year.    "I wonder if we could have rocket launches in better seasons  such as spring and autumn," one NASDA official said.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXING PENSIONS  </P> <P> The letter from Vernon W. Latshaw (Feb. 8) doesn't tell the whole story. There  are 13 states that tax pensions of people who have moved to other states.  </P> <P> An additional 31 states have the mechanism in place to begin this practice. A  retiree could very likely be taxed in two states (or possibly more) on his  pension income!  </P> <P> Two members of Congress have introduced bills to prohibit this practice. Sen.  Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has introduced SB 434, which has three co-sponsors and Rep.  Barbara Vucanovich (R-Nev.) has introduced HR 1227, which has 33 co-sponsors.  </P> <P> Perhaps Latshaw and other retirees (or about-to-be retirees) might wish to  write their representatives to urge their support of these bills.  </P> <P> MYRTLE W.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Kaohsiung, May 23 (CNA) -- The Kaohsiung-based  Taiwan Cuttlefish Association confirmed Monday [23 May] that the  fishing vessel attacked by the Argentine Navy on Friday off  Argentina's east coast was the Kaohsiung-based Chin Yuan Hsing.    The 800-ton boat was reportedly sunk off the coast of San  Julian after being hit by machine-gun and cannon fire. The  Argentine Navy had been trying to get the Chin Yuan Hsing to  stop so that it could be inspected after it was caught illegally  poaching within Argentine waters.    The 30-odd crewmembers were rescued by another Taiwan  fishing  vessel, the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was also operating off the  coast of San Julian when the incident occurred.    The full story behind the attack is still under  investigation, the association said, adding that the current  situation of the crewmembers was unclear because of  communication difficulties resulting from poor weather  conditions in the Southwest Atlantic.    Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture and Taiwan Fishery  Representatives called on local fishing boats to respect  relevant laws and regulatons set by foreign governments when  fishing in foreign waters to prevent the recurrence of such  incidents.</p>

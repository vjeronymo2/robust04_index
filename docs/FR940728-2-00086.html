			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;A system that monitors vaccine distribution and usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The distribution of grant funds has been systematic. Funds were provided in FY 1993 for each project area to conduct a needs assessment. In FY 1994, funds were available to each grantee to develop short- and long-range plans using the data acquired from the needs assessment. Funds are now available for the next step_the installation of the core or central portion of the SIIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This grant announcement is divided into two components:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To implement a core or central computerized immunization information system and communications interfaces that will allow transfer of immunization information on an intra- and interstate network between heterogenous systems (Component One).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To develop and implement statewide telecommunications networks that will eventually connect CDC, State, and local health agencies. These networks (local area networks and wide area networks) will directly link with and support the National Immunization Program (NIP) immunization information system goals and objectives (Component Two).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, applicants may apply for funding for one of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Component One only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Component Two only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Components One and Two.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To receive funds, each applicant must satisfactorily address the following program elements for funding Component One.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Complete and submit a satisfactory needs assessment and plan for implementing an immunization information system(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Develop and implement an initial immunization record in the SIIS database using an electronic birth registry interface or an appropriate alternative method which would capture all infants in the State's annual birth cohort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide evidence of cooperation, coordination, and collaboration between the State health department and the various local public and private health care agencies that will be involved in the planning, development, and implementation of SIIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Demonstrate the capability to expand the number of other systems that are able to interface effectively with SIIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Provide assistance and the physical space for the installation of the communications lines, hardware and software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Prepare to coordinate demonstration activities among State and local data processing units, State immunization program, and major immunization health care providers, e.g., health department clinics, health maintenance organizations, hospital outpatient clinics, community health centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Seek support from the health community and professional organizations in promoting acceptance and participation in the SIIS activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Demonstrate the use of other funding resources to include redirecting existing funds, unobligated funds, IAP funds, funds from other Federal, State, or private sources and the like.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Provide an estimate of State, local, or other funds spent to date on the development of a statewide immunization system or an integrated system of which immunization is a part. Also provide an estimate of the amount of State, local, or other funds that will be needed to complete the statewide system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Describe hardware and software requirements and estimated costs. Growth and flexibility of the system must be considered in the purchase of hardware and software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> State immunization information systems must meet or exceed the System Fault Tolerance Level II standard described in Novell operating systems manuals, including disk mirroring, differential backups, off-site storage of backups, continuous and non-interrupted power and power surge protection. The system(s) should potentially be capable of 24-hour operation. Downtime episodes must not exceed 30 minutes and must not occur more than once a month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Describe personnel requirements and estimated costs. There will not be enough funds from this grant to support all the personnel the grantee may believe are required. If additional personnel are needed, the grantee can apply for funds under the Immunization Action Plan or through local or State funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Describe training requirements and estimated costs. Personnel will receive support for technical and programmatic training. The development of an automated system of this magnitude with the number of interfaces that will be necessary will require close collaboration with CDC staff in conjunction with appropriate training. Training may occur within the State, at CDC in Atlanta, or at a designated conference site. Project personnel may obtain training on- or off-site from private vendors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Describe travel requirements and estimated costs. Close collaboration with CDC and other applicants is essential for the development of SIIS. Funds for periodic training and CDC meetings for the purpose of information sharing will be supported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To receive funds for Component Two, grantees must satisfactorily address the following program elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The grantee should develop a plan that addresses three phases: (1) electronic linkage via computer networks among State and local public health agencies, (2) rapid and efficient access to local, State and Federal information needed by public health practitioners, and (3) electronic data exchange. The plan addressing each of these three phases should address planning, implementation, and evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Linkage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of this element is to establish computer network linkages with and among the various component agencies within the State public health system and also to investigate or establish linkages with primary care providers, especially large organizations, such as managed care organizations. The plan for this element should include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> i. Planning Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

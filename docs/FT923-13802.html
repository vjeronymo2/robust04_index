			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Audit regulators debar two members TWO CERTIFIED accountants were debarred from conducting audit work during the first six months of the new self-regulatory mechanisms established by the government last year, it emerged yesterday. Officials at the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants have restricted the practising certificate of two of their members since audit regulation work began in October. The figures emerge in the first submission to the Department of Trade and Industry on audit regulation until the end of March, during which 94 visits took place among the 3,000 certified accountants registered to conduct audits. Separately, the joint monitoring unit, which scrutinises auditors registered with the three Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland, has made no disqualifications. Its more up-to-date figures show that the unit has refused to register as auditors 1,108 accountants from the 10,509 who had applied up until last week. The unit has carried out 44 visits to determine whether to register accountants as auditors, and 80 visits to those already registered. That includes 13 in response to complaints and 49 that were routine. It has pledged to visit all the auditors of listed companies every five years. There are 163 such auditors. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants yesterday refused to give the names of the two accountants who were debarred. The DTI launched the new mechanism of regulated auditors through the professional accountancy bodies in October. Some critics have said it is impossible for the bodies to regulate their own members, but the officials have called for time to prove their effectiveness.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW-STYLE ELECTION ALTERING SOVIET POLITICAL LANDSCAPE  </P> <P> Profound political changes are under way in the Soviet Union as the country  prepares this month for its first contested parliamentary elections since the  earliest days of the Soviet state.  </P> <P> A dramatic upsurge in political activism at the grass-roots level has followed  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pledge that the Communist Party will end its  70-year monopoly on power and seek instead to play a leading -- but no longer  all-controlling -- role in the government.  </P> <P> New constitutional structures -- a powerful national parliament, an executive  presidency, strengthened regional and local governments -- should be in place  within months of the March 26 elections, and Gorbachev has declared his  determination to use them to push through further reforms.  </P> <P> A new political culture is being created at the same time, one that fosters  popular participation, encourages debate, permits dissent and is already  challenging the party.  </P> <P> Gorbachev calls the process "a vast school of democracy" for the country and  sees it as the key to his overall effort to transform the entire Soviet  political and economic system.  </P> <P> "It is already clear that we are not dealing with merely a formal procedure but  with genuine elections of people's representatives to the highest organs of  power," Gorbachev said as the country entered a month of formal campaigning.  "This is an enormous step forward from the practice of previous years."  </P> <P> The changes are not aimed at turning the Soviet Union into a liberal Western  democracy but at reshaping and redefining socialism. The Communist Party has  made it clear that its interest is in sharing power, not forsaking it.  </P> <P> The election process has not been smooth. These are the Soviet Union's first  multi-candidate, nationwide elections in memory. Most of the procedures have  never been used before, and confusion has been widespread.  </P> <P> Those who fear the loss of power frequently have been ruthless in dealing with  their opponents to ensure that they win -- effectively demonstrating that real  power is at stake.  </P> <P> Although the difficulties have discouraged many liberals who had hoped the  elections would be "the dawn of democracy," as one writer put it, most of the  country's senior political analysts rank the changes, in terms of potential,  second only to the 1917 Revolution, which overthrew the czarist regime and  brought the Bolsheviks to power.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huge Impact on Country  </P> <P> "We are witnessing very great shifts in political consciousness, which the  elections have awakened and brought to a high level," Prof. Boris Grushin,  deputy director of the Center for Public Opinion Research, said last week in an  interview. "There has been a huge impact across the country. Many things that  once were so certain no longer are. The scale of change is hard to predict, and  it is not irreversible.  </P> <P> "There have been procedural difficulties, to be sure, but we are also  accumulating important experience, which I believe will expand and accelerate  the process of change."  </P> <P> Extraordinary scenes, all the more dramatic after years of political passivity,  have unfolded across the nation in the last two months of preliminary  campaigning for the new Congress of People's Deputies.  </P> <P> Veteran party officials, whose word has virtually been law, have been cast  aside in dozens of constituencies in favor of determined reformers -- also  party members but from the rank and file -- as they stand for election to the  congress.  </P> <P> Meetings that even three years ago would have been broken up by police as  illegal "anti-Soviet agitation" now fill community centers, labor union halls  and school auditoriums almost every night, drawing overflow crowds and  continuing for 12 hours or more.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Party Policies Under Attack  </P> <P> Party policies, unchallengeable for so long as "the will of the working class,"  are under unprecedented attack -- from workers, farmers and intellectuals alike  and from within the party as much as from outside.  </P> <P> Even V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik revolutionary who founded the Soviet state and  who has been revered here as politically infallible, is being criticized.  Lenin, it is said, pushed the party into its long monopoly on power, now  regarded as the root of the country's problems.  </P> <P> "The most zealous optimist could not have imagined such an outburst of public  activity," the Communist Party newspaper Pravda commented last week, expressing  amazement at the upsurge in the country's new, participatory politics. "Today,  public activity is the main factor determining the political atmosphere across  the country."  </P> <P> At times, the Soviet Union's emboldened people appear ready to storm the  citadels of power with their new energy and excitement -- and yet it is the  Communist Party, under Gorbachev, that deliberately set all these events in  motion.  </P> <P> The elections are a first step toward the redistribution of power that is at  the heart of perestroika, or restructuring, as Gorbachev's program of  political, economic and social reforms is known.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lethargy and Paralysis  </P> <P> In proposing major constitutional changes last year, Gorbachev argued that the  concentration of political, economic and social decision-making in the  Communist Party had led to national lethargy and paralysis. The party had to be  subordinated to the state, he said, and it had to share power at all levels of  the government and step back from the day-to-day management of the economy and  society.  </P> <P> "We have to create a system that makes decisions democratically and with full  public participation," Otto Latsis, deputy chief editor of the party journal  Kommunist, commented in an interview last week. "Otherwise, there not only will  be no fundamental restructuring but only a reversion to the repression of the  past. . . . And that, we know, does not work."  </P> <P> Under changes to the constitution, proposed by Gorbachev at a special party  conference last June and enacted in December, three houses of 750 deputies each  will be elected to the Congress of People's Deputies this month.  </P> <P> One house of this "super-parliament" is being elected on the basis of  territorial constituencies, another will be elected on the basis of regional  and ethnic representation and the third will be chosen from "public  organizations," including the Communist Party, labor unions, the Soviet Women's  Committee, veterans' groups and academic bodies.  </P> <P> Although this congress will exercise what the Soviet constitution calls supreme  power, it will meet perhaps only once a year. From among its own members it  will elect the Supreme Soviet, a parliamentary body with broad authority to  enact legislation and to supervise government operations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus of Political Action  </P> <P> This will make the Supreme Soviet the focus of political action, many here  believe, and Gorbachev clearly intends to use its popular mandate to overcome  bureaucratic opposition to his reforms and to broaden and accelerate them.  </P> <P> "If Gorbachev has five more years with hostile people, if he cannot get people  into the Supreme Soviet who support change, he will not survive," said Vitaly  A. Korotich, the crusading editor of the popular weekly magazine Ogonyok,  explaining the importance to Gorbachev's reform effort of both the elections  and the constitutional changes they implement.  </P> <P> With about 450 members and sitting for three or four months twice a year, the  new Supreme Soviet is supposed to have real debates on legislation and to  exercise a controlling influence on the power of the party -- in contrast to  the old Supreme Soviet, which amounted to a parliamentary rubber stamp,  approving everything put before it during its semiannual meetings of two days  each.  </P> <P> The chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet -- certain to be Gorbachev  -- will have executive authority, act as the country's president and be  responsible to the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies.  </P> <P> "The work of deputies will change immensely," Guri Marchuk, president of the  Soviet Academy of Sciences and a member of the old Supreme Soviet for more than  a decade, predicted as he campaigned last week for the new congress. "We took  formal decisions on proposals that had been previously 'approved' by some  (party or government) departments and other bodies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Principled Decisions'  </P> <P> "The election campaign has shown that members of Parliament will both table  questions (directed to government ministers) and will openly discuss problems  and take independent and principled decisions on them."  </P> <P> Over the past 50 years, members of the Supreme Soviet have been elected on  ballots with only a single name -- that of the candidate chosen by party  officials -- and the result was usually an approval rate of 98% or 99%. The  Soviet Union last held contested elections in the 1920s.  </P> <P> "When you consider how we used to justify those old, one-candidate elections as  expressions of the 'people's approval' for party policy, then you will realize  how fundamental a change multi-candidate elections are for us," Fyodor  Burlatsky, a leading political scientist, said while campaigning for the  congress.  </P> <P> "The new structure, though still a one-party system, is based on pluralism, not  the political monotheism of the past. Now, candidates must put forward their  own programs, party policies will be judged on their merits against other  alternatives and party members must compete with everyone else. That is the  starting point, and it can make the Supreme Soviet our central political  institution where all trends, all opinions and alternative programs converge."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hundreds of New Faces  </P> <P> As he presses forward with his reform program, Gorbachev clearly intends to  work as much through the new governmental structures as through the party  organization. With hundreds of new faces, the new parliamentary bodies should  be more committed to reform than the bureaucracy has been, and the majority of  their members will have campaigned on platforms of active reform.  </P> <P> "With elections, deputies for the first time will feel the pressure of popular  dissatisfaction," Mikhail Poltoranin, a leading political commentator and a  candidate to represent the Union of Journalists in the new congress, said in an  interview. "They will come not just with a vaguish mandate for change but with  a real feeling that if changes don't come quickly, this country will explode."  </P> <P> As he campaigns, Poltoranin tells voters: "Send me there to fight. As a deputy,  I would work to include my program, the one that you elected me on, in the  government's policies and directly in legislation, along with your directives  -- and then I would follow up."  </P> <P> He said in the interview, "It seems so obvious, but never has a candidate for  the Supreme Soviet been able to say that and mean it."  </P> <P> Competition has been intense in most places, first for nominations and now for  the elections themselves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7,531 Candidates Nominated  </P> <P> According to the Central Electoral Commission, 7,531 candidates were nominated  by workers' collectives, groups of residents and other organizations for the  1,500 territorial and regional constituencies -- an average of five per seat.  But in some districts, as many as 20 candidates were fielded, while only one  was nominated in about 180 places.  </P> <P> In a complex, often controversial second stage, the number of candidates was  reduced to two in nearly 1,000 constituencies under rules taken by some  officials as intended to ensure a clear winner March 26, rather than a runoff  election two weeks later.  </P> <P> Many anti-establishment candidates, most of them liberals, appear to have been  squeezed out in this process. Party bosses in many districts packed the  meetings with supporters to ensure their candidates' selection. In some places,  police reportedly blocked streets leading to the meetings or admitted only  those with special tickets.  </P> <P> Some of those selection meetings nearly degenerated into riots -- the Soviet  press called them "stormy," "tumultuous" and "volcanic" -- as competing  candidates' supporters battled for the right to speak.  </P> <P> The Soviet press, freed from many past restrictions, has engaged in some of the  roughest polemics of all, bringing charges from candidates, again largely from  the left, of distortion and libel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Things Can Get Pretty Nasty'  </P> <P> "We are discovering there are a lot of ways to 'steal an election,' as  Americans put it, but they are all new to us," Anatoly Rubinov, a veteran  journalist who enjoys his reputation as a muckraker, said after being defeated  by the "party machine" in a district northeast of Moscow. "Things can get  pretty nasty."  </P> <P> Now, in a quarter of the constituencies -- many of them in the Ukraine, where  the conservative party machine sought to eliminate any opposition -- there will  be only a single name on the ballot.  </P> <P> Korotich, who stalked out to protest what he called the "rigging" of the Moscow  meeting where his nomination was being considered, spoke for many disappointed  liberals when he called the election process a "regulated democracy."  </P> <P> In more than 200 districts, however, there will be three or more candidates,  including 12 in a Moscow constituency.  </P> <P> A preliminary analysis by the Central Electoral Commission shows there will  probably be shifts in the composition of the new legislature: more  professionals, fewer workers and farmers, fewer women and young people, and  fewer party and government workers, but more party members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rank-and-File Members  </P> <P> "Party members -- those from the rank and file, not the bosses -- are winning  significant support because they have thought-through positions, they are  better organized and show political maturity," Rubinov said. "And I am talking  about those nomination meetings that have been fair."  </P> <P> One Moscow newspaper complained last week that it could not distinguish the  candidates' programs one from another. But the heated debates among candidates  and their supporters, along with citizens' questions at the election meetings,  made it clear that the key issue of the election is not perestroika and its  goals but how it can be speeded up.  </P> <P> "Perestroika is simply marching in place," Boris Bondarev, a candidate in  Moscow's Kuntsevo district, told a rally. "How do we move on? How do we go  faster? How do we get results? Those are the central questions."  </P> <P> And on those questions there is wide debate, varying with the candidates and  their backgrounds, with the voters, with localities, according to press  accounts and people who have attended many meetings.  </P> <P> "For issues to narrow, to coalesce, people have to be speaking the same  language, and we don't," Grushin said. "We are just developing a political  language to express our own ideas, rather than the thoughts that we have been  given. So, when a person says one thing, others understand another."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inflation, Low Pensions  </P> <P> Besides the pace of perestroika, certain other common concerns are also clear  -- inflation, low pensions, undiminished government bureaucracy, defense  spending and the environment.  </P> <P> "It used to be said that people were afraid to speak, to raise problems, to  criticize, but I never thought so," Grushin said. "It was either that they did  not have anything to say that differed with whatever had been decreed from on  high, or they lacked the language to articulate their positions.  </P> <P> "This is what is changing, and that change will have greater ramifications than  the results of the election itself . . . because it means a new political  culture here, really a new way of doing things."  </P> <P> Other analysts, in fact, are already looking beyond these elections toward  those for local and regional governments in the autumn.  </P> <P> "There is much more room to maneuver at lower levels, and the changes will come  even faster there," Latsis said. "People will have more experience, they will  be able to organize themselves more effectively and the issues will be closer  to home."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact on People's Lives  </P> <P> Those elections, journalist Rubinov says, will have "an even deeper impact on  people's lives. At the national level, big decisions are made, but at the local  level is where they make or break people.  </P> <P> "This political process is not going to stop with these elections," he added.  "It is going to grow and grow. A lot of new people are coming into politics  now, and they will run in those local elections. Then the new people will be  agitating from below, while the old ones, who may make it through to the  Supreme Soviet, try to retain their hold from above. And it won't work."  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOVERNMENTAL OVERHAUL  </P> <P> Soviet voters go to the polls March 26 in the first contested parliamentary  elections since the 1920s. The elections are the initial step in a fundamental  redistribution of constitutional authority that will strip the Communist Party  of its monopoly on power. The Soviet Union will remain a one-party state but  the new governmental structure is designed to encourage greater public  participation and debate. The new structure:  </P> <P> Congress of People's Deputies: This new "super-parliament" will, under the  constitution, exercise supreme power. It will meet perhaps once a year and will  consist of three houses of 750 delegates each. One house will represent  territorial constituencies, the second ethnic and regional constituencies and  the third "public organizations," such as the party, labor unions, women's and  veterans' groups and academic bodies.  </P> <P> Supreme Soviet: This parliament will be composed of 450 members chosen by the  members of the Congress of People's Deputies, and it is expected to be the  focus of political action with broad authority to enact legislation and to  supervise government operations. It will meet three or four times a year in  contrast to the existing Supreme Soviet, which met semiannually for two days  each to "rubber stamp" directives of the party leadership.  </P> <P> Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: The executive body of the Supreme Soviet is to  be composed of the chairman and a number of vice chairmen and other officials.  </P> <P> Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: In effect, this leader will be  the national president and top executive authority, elected by the Supreme  Soviet and responsible to it and to the Congress of People's Deputies. The post  almost certainly will go to the current Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev,  champion of the reforms.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Great courses: a great curse - Golf / Resorts and designers are setting ordinary players too much of a challenge It is not often you play a course on holiday and then get the chance a couple of weeks later to ask the architect what he thought he was doing. The course is situated on the beautiful Hawaiian island of Kauai. Hanalei Bay curves behind it. The imposing Mt Makana, or Bali Hai, as it was known in South Pacific, which was filmed there, rises above. The Prince course is usually said to be the best in Hawaii, and it is not hard to see why. There are some breathtaking holes. The par four first is surrounded by the Anini stream. The par five second requires a carry of at least 100 yards across a hazard. The fourth has water all down the right hand side. They are the easy holes. By the time you have reached the 12th you are in a tropical jungle and on no account should your drive stray from the straight and narrow by more than 20 yards. The last three holes are among the hardest. It was, unquestionably, one of most daunting, and exhilarating courses that I have ever played. And that was the problem. I am a seven handicap player, who once played off one, and by the end it had proved too tough for me, even on a day when I had played reasonably well. Now it is not being immodest to say that if this course was too tough for me, then 90 per cent of the people who venture on to it will not be able to cope. When I played, the course became clogged with people hitting shots into bushes or streams. As they lost balls and spent ages in the process, the better players lost patience and the result was a masterpiece of a course that hardly anyone enjoyed playing. Two of the three people with whom I was playing abandoned their rounds in spite of having paid the high fee. Such difficulties may be encountered on many of the world's great golf courses. They result from the owners' desire to create a notable golf course, which will attract favourable press comment and so bring in fee-paying customers. But putting a 28 handicap golfer on the Prince course is like asking an apprentice to play for Manchester United's first team. One of the great things about golf is supposed to be that anyone can walk in the footsteps of the top players, and play the shots from where they played them, and marvel at their skills. But half these courses are either very private or very expensive; and the other half are so full of golfers without the skills to play them that the round becomes very long and tedious. So, when I asked the architect of the Prince course, Robert Trent Jones jnr, why he made it so difficult, I knew what he would offer as an opening gambit: 'Well, first you have to remember that I design courses to a client's instructions. The Princeville resort, where the Prince course is situated, already has one, what you might term, playable golf course, and what they wanted was an alternative, more challenging layout. Which is what I built.' Jones is an amiable, intelligent man who loves golf and has designed many such courses. He was aware of the question's implication: 'I agree, it is a great problem,' he said. Why not introduce a handicap limit: limiting the more challenging courses to players with a proven handicap of 18? 'In America? The owners would be swamped with lawsuits before the first day was out. But I think there is a way of alleviating the difficulty. The solution would be to make sure that for the first couple of hours of each day, the better players get a chance to go out, and so set the pace of play for the day.' 'But the trouble with many resort courses is that they need the money from the green fees, and that is of more importance to them than any question about the pace of play.' This, to a great extent, is what happened in Spain in the late 1980s, as the courses became flooded with people and the prices went up and many British golfers, tired of five hour rounds and exorbitant prices, went in search of new pastures, such as South Carolina and Florida. Spain has tried hard to make up for past mistakes. What about forward tees, you might ask? Surely the more modest players could play off these tees and so play a shorter course? True, but it still would not help them overcome the intimidating factor of trying to carry water hazards or ravines, or drive down an avenue with jungle on either side. As Jones said, the game has a problem. Suggestions, please, to all the world's great resort courses.</p>

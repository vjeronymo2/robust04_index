			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT TO STOP DRUG SUSPECTS WIDENED;  </P> <P> AGENTS MAY SEARCH AIR TRAVELERS WHO ACT LIKE COURIERS, HIGH COURT HOLDS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, giving the government another weapon in the war on drugs,  ruled Monday that agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and  act like drug couriers.  </P> <P> If agents have a "reasonable suspicion" that a traveler is carrying drugs, they  may question him and search his bags without violating his privacy rights under  the Fourth Amendment, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in 7-2 ruling.  </P> <P> In a separate opinion, the court ruled that a city may set up separate dance  halls for teen-agers to protect them from the "corrupting influences" of older  customers of such establishments.  </P> <P> In the drug case (U.S. vs. Sokolow, 87-1295), the court upheld the airport  arrest of a Honolulu man who was returning home from a quick trip to Miami.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paid for Ticket With Cash  </P> <P> Rehnquist said that the combined weight of several pieces of evidence can give  agents sufficient reason to detain a suspect. Agents saw the passenger, Andrew  Sokolow, pay for his $2,100 ticket with a wad of $20 bills. His ticket called  for a two-day round trip to a city known for its drug trafficking. He was  traveling under an assumed name. He did not check any baggage. He was said to  be "very nervous" when seen by agents on a stopover at Los Angeles  International Airport. And he was wearing a black jump suit with a gold chain.  </P> <P> "Any one of these factors is not by itself proof of any illegal conduct and is  quite consistent with innocent travel," Rehnquist said. "But we think, taken  together, they amount to reasonable suspicion."  </P> <P> U.S. narcotics agents found 1,063 grams of cocaine in a shoulder bag when they  stopped Sokolow outside the Honolulu airport on July 25, 1984. But the U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco threw out Sokolow's conviction and  five-year prison sentence, ruling that drug agents may not stop passengers  simply because they look or act like criminals.  </P> <P> Since 1974, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has operated a  surveillance program in the nation's major airports in an effort to spot and  apprehend drug traffickers. Agents rely in part on a "drug courier profile" of  suspicious characteristics to choose their targets.  </P> <P> If the 9th Circuit standard were followed, it "would outlaw a large percentage  of the stops of suspected narcotics traffickers who pass through the nation's  airports," government attorneys had told the justices.  </P> <P> The ruling goes further than previous Supreme Court decisions toward upholding  the detention and subsequent search of a person based on evidence that is not  criminal in itself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Didn't Endorse Profile  </P> <P> The high court did not specifically endorse the DEA's use of a drug courier  profile. Instead, Rehnquist said that the evidence gathered by agents gave them  sufficient reason to detain Sokolow.  </P> <P> In two splintered decisions in the early 1980s, the court was unable to achieve  a consensus on whether drug agents may stop and search an airline passenger  whose behavior was suspicious.  </P> <P> However, in more than a dozen rulings over the last three years, the justices  have given government officials more leeway to pursue drug suspects. The court  has not ruled that government agents violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on  unreasonable searches and seizures in any drug case considered since Rehnquist  became chief justice in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Check Garbage Cans  </P> <P> In the last year, the court has ruled that police officers may inspect garbage  cans left at curb side, that low-flying helicopters may be used to spot  marijuana plants, that policemen may pursue a person who flees on seeing a  squad car and that government employees may be required to take drug tests on  the job.  </P> <P> University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar, a criminal law expert,  criticized the Rehnquist court for "down-sizing the Fourth Amendment" to allow  law enforcement to fight the drug war.  </P> <P> "I think they feel pressure because of the horrors of drug trafficking, so they  are trying to bring into line the few liberal courts we have left," he said.  </P> <P> Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. dissented in the drug  courier case, arguing that drug agents should not be permitted to seize a  suspect unless they have "at least some evidence of criminal conduct."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the court overturned a Texas decision that said that young people  have a right of "social association" that bars the creation of separate dance  halls for teen-agers.  </P> <P> Two years ago, a Texas appellate court struck down a Dallas ordinance creating  special dance halls for people 14 to 18 years old on the grounds that the law  restricted their freedom of association under the First Amendment.  </P> <P> There is no constitutionally protected right of social association for  teen-agers or anyone else, Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous court. If Dallas  city officials believe it would be beneficial to segregate teen-agers from  older persons, they are free to do so without running afoul of the U.S.  Constitution, he said in the case (Dallas vs. Stanglin, 87-1848).  </P> <P> The Constitution makes no mention of freedom of association, but the Supreme  Court has said that protecting the free speech of political groups requires  that their members be free to associate with anyone they choose. In other  cases, the court has referred to a freedom of "intimate association" among  members of a family.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1,000 Youths in Dance Hall  </P> <P> Neither has anything to do with dance halls, Rehnquist said. Of the more than  1,000 young people who gather at the Twilight Skating Rink and dance hall in  Dallas, many are strangers to one another, he said, and those young people  certainly do not "take positions on public questions."  </P> <P> In recent years, members of all-male private clubs have argued that their right  to freedom of association permitted them to exclude women, but they have fared  no better before the high court than the Dallas teen-agers.  </P> <P> In other actions, the court:  </P> <P>  -- Ruled 6 to 3 that Indian tribal courts have jurisdiction over the custody  of Indian babies, even if the parents leave a reservation to give up their  children for adoption. Citing a 1978 law, Justice Brennan said that Congress  intended to keep Indian children on reservations.  </P> <P> "Tribal jurisdiction under (the 1978) law was not meant to be defeated by the  actions of individual members of the tribe," Brennan said in the case  (Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians vs. Holyfield, 87-980). Rehnquist and  Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Takes Up Boeing Case  </P> <P>  -- Agreed to decide whether the Boeing Co. violated a federal  conflict-of-interest law by giving large severance payments to five employees  who were leaving to take top jobs in the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> One of the five, Melvin R. Paisley, was awarded $183,000 before becoming  assistant secretary of the Navy for research. Since leaving the Defense  Department, Paisley has become a subject of the government's investigation of  fraud in defense procurement.  </P> <P> Boeing said that its payments were intended to "encourage public service," but  a federal appeals court in Richmond said that they appeared designed to give  extra compensation to influential government officials. The case (Boeing vs.  United States, 88-938) will be heard in the fall.  </P> <P>  -- Agreed to decide whether a Baltimore mother may be kept in jail until she  tells where her abused child is being kept (Baltimore Department of Social  Services vs. Bouknight, 88-1182). Authorities suspect that the woman may have  killed her baby, but a Maryland appellate court ruled that she has a right to  remain silent and may not be held in jail for refusing to talk. In December,  acting on an emergency appeal by city officials, Rehnquist had ordered the  woman held.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PRODUCER SUES GARCIA MARQUEZ  </P> <P> Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez faces a breach-of-agreement  lawsuit filed by a movie producer who contends that the author broke a deal  with him to film "Love in the Time of Cholera."  </P> <P> Richard Roth, producer of the film "Julia," claims in the suit filed Monday  that he had a deal with Garcia Marquez to pay $400,000 for film rights to the  Colombian-born author's latest international bestseller. But the deal went sour  when Garcia Marquez allegedly demanded Roth hire a Latin American director to  produce the film set in South America, said Roth's attorney, Max Blecher.  Roth's financing arrangements fell through after Garcia Marquez imposed the  condition, Blecher said.  </P></p>

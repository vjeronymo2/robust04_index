			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Finance Bill puts the first parts of Lamont's Budget in place / A look at details of financial measures passed yesterday THE FINANCE Bill enacting part of the Budget statement was published and passed in the Commons yesterday before dissolution of Parliament on Monday. Some of the announcements made in the Budget on Tuesday are not included, such as the move to limit the rise in the uniform business rate to the rate of inflation and the 100 per cent exemption on inheritance tax for small businesses. These will be enacted in legislation if the Conservative Party wins the general election. Many of the provisions in the 11-clause bill come into operation automatically. These include the new levels of personal and age-related income tax allowances, the capital gains tax annual exemption and the pensions earnings cap for 1992-93, all of which were indexed in line with inflation. Other changes which do not require legislation include the changes in personal equity plans (PEPs) to remove the Pounds 3,000 limit on on investment in unit or investment trusts and the changes to the income tax car-benefit scale. Provisions requiring legislation include the introduction of the 20 per cent income tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income for 1992-93 and the freezing of the level of the married couple's allowance and the basic rate limit. The second two measures override statutory indexation and so require legislation. The bill confirmed the changes in the rates of excise duties, car tax and value added tax penalties. It also gave the Treasury powers to order the biggest VAT payers to make monthly payments on account. Among other VAT changes were the rise in the registration threshold, small extensions to relief for charities and recovery of the tax on cars bought for certain businesses. Two Budget measures will be enacted only in part. The inheritance tax threshold will rise to Pounds 147,000 from April 6, in line with inflation - but legislation will be required to raise it to Pounds 150,000 from March 10. Scale charges on car fuel will rise only in line with inflation. Legislation will be required to introduce a separate scale with lower charges for diesel fuel. The bill is made up as follows: Clause 1 increases by 4.5 per cent the rates of excise duty on spirits, beer, wine, made-wine and cider. The changes have effect from 6pm on March 10, the day of the Budget. Clause 2 increases the rates of duty on tobacco products by 10.4 per cent for cigarettes, 4.5 per cent for pipe and chewing tobacco and 10 per cent for cigars and hand-rolling tobacco. The changes have effect from 6pm on March 10. Clause 3 increases the rates of excise duty on hydrocarbon oils by 7.5 per cent on leaded petrol and other light oils and 4.5 per cent on unleaded petrol, DERV, fuel oil, gas oil, other heavy oils and light oil used as furnace fuel. The changes have effect from 6pm on March 10. Clause 4 raises to Pounds 110 the rate of vehicle excise duty for private cars, light goods vehicles, taxis and all other vehicles currently licensed at Pounds 100 a year. It also introduces a rate of Pounds 15 for tricycles under 150cc. These changes apply to licences taken out after March 10 next year. Clause 5 provides for a reduction in the rate of general betting duty from 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent, for bets placed on or after April 1. Clause 6 enables the Treasury to make an order in the interests of the national economy to require payments of VAT on account in advance of the normal quarterly payment. Clause 7 reduces the rate of serious misdeclaration penalty from 20 per cent to 15 per cent for a penalty assessed on or after March 11. The reduction does not apply to a supplementary assessment (a recalculation) when the original penalty assessment was made before March 11. The clause also reduces the maximum rate of default surcharge from 30 per cent to 20 per cent with effect from April 1. Other rates of surcharge are unchanged. Clause 8 reduces the rate of car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent with effect from March 11. Clause 9 provides for the introduction of a lower rate of income tax, at 20 per cent on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Clause 10 imposes income tax for 1992-93 and sets the rates at 20 per cent for the lower rate, 25 per cent for the basic rate and 40 per cent for the higher rate. It overrides statutory indexation to keep unchanged the levels of the married couple's allowance for those under 65 and the basic rate limit. It also maintains at Pounds 30,000 the limit on mortgage interest relief. Clause 11 specifies the short title of the bill and deals with interpretation. Treasury orders which have been made to implement Budget changes are: The Income Tax (Indexation) Order 1992, the Capital Gains Tax (Annual Exempt Amount) Order 1992, the Retirement Benefits Schemes (Indexation of Earnings Cap) Order 1992, the Income Tax (Cash Equivalents of Car Benefits) Order 1992, the Personal Equity Plan (Amendment) Regulations 1992, the Value Added Tax (Increase of Registration Limits) Order 1992, the Value Added Tax (Charities and Aids for Handicapped Persons) Order 1992, the Value Added Tax (Cars) Order 1992, the Value Added Tax (Treatment of Transactions) Order 1992, Value Added Tax (Increase of Consideration for Fuel) Order 1992, the Inheritance Tax (Indexation) Order 1992, the Income Tax (Cash Equivalents of Car Fuel Benefits) Order 1992.</p>

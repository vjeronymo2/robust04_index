			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on 13 January Bundestag meeting: "In </F> Favor of Equal Conditions for Competition and Export Within the  European Union"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]. Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel addresses the three great goals of arms export policy and  discusses the specific problems of arms exports that make  efforts at harmonizing by the countries concerned so complicated:    "German arms export policy has to fit in with German foreign  and security policy, which aims at securing peace. This  corresponds to values that have been firmly anchored in our  country, throughout all political parties, ever since our  constitution was proclaimed.    "We do not want to, and we will not give up this all-party  consensus on our restrictive export policy principles of 1982.    "The Federal Government pursues three great objectives in  its  arms export policy:     -  "safeguarding national and European  security interests;    -  "taking into account the justified interests  of industry;    -  "preventing an unrestrained spread of mass  destruction weapons, but also of conventional arms.    "On the other hand, I am well aware of the economic problems  this involves for a highly specialized industry in our country.  The answer to these problems -- which are not restricted to  Germany -- cannot be an export offensive for weapons. But we  also need industrial capacities that guarantee our ability to  defend ourselves, to form alliances and to cooperate within the  alliance -- also as a basis for codetermination and influence.  This means that German industry must remain able to cooperate  in these areas. We want to contribute to this -- by simplifying  procedures." [passage omitted]</p>

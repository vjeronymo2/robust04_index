			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Recent fizz evaporates from Milan bourse - The interest in privatisation candidates has largely petered out After regaining some speculative fizz in October on privatisation euphoria, Milan's battered bourse looks set to end the year well below the opening levels of 1992. The burst of interest in possible privatisation candidates, which helped to drive the Comit (BCI) index up to almost 480 in October, has now largely petered out. Though occasional tit-bits of news or gossip are enough to set individual stocks such as Credito Italiano or the Nuovo Pignone engineering group in motion, such movements have not been enough to enliven the overall market, now 17 per cent down from its opening levels of last January. Brokers take heart that the index has at least recovered from the depths of late summer, when it sank to 354.93, and that daily turnover has recovered from the lows of around L50bn to three or four times as much. However, a new shadow has loomed following this week's regional election results, involving around 1m voters, and the news that Mr Bettino Craxi, leader of the Socialist party and a former prime minister, is under investigation by magistrates involved in the country's spiralling political corruption scandal. Neither development was entirely unexpected. At the polls, the autonomist Lombard League was the big winner, consolidating its position in the north and stretching its tentacles into central Italy. La Rete, the clean government party headed by a former mayor of Palermo, was the other big victor, capturing a limited, but surprisingly high, share of the votes. The investigation into Mr Craxi, whose Milan powerbase is the focus of magistrates' attention, further weakens the Socialist party. Mr Gianni De Michelis, its deputy chairman, is already under the magisterial microscope for alleged misdemeanours in the Veneto region. Some analysts suggest the poll results and growing troubles for the Socialists could perversely help, rather than hinder, the bourse by playing into the hands of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's reform-minded government. Although himself a senior Socialist, Mr Amato could benefit from the growing disarray to push through further unappealing, but essential, legislation cov-ering spending cuts and privatisation. The argument has its merits. Not even the victors from this week's polls are threatening to topple the government, in expectation of new electoral laws. That gives Mr Amato more time to push ahead with essential changes to cut the budget deficit and loosen the state's grip on the economy. Speaking to MPs yesterday, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said he hoped for parliamentary approval for his privatisation plan before the end of this year. The upbeat political message has not yet penetrated the financial markets, however. Instead, uncertainties about the government's stability have fed through to the exchange rate, weakening the lira against the D-Mark. In the absence of any good news on the corporate front, share prices look vulnerable. Yesterday's 13.97 rise in the Comit to 420.35 was not fully sustained in London after-hours' trading, and the outlook for corporate earnings remains gloomy. While the lira devaluation, now running at almost 18 per cent against the D-Mark, should help Italian exporters, recession at home and in major export markets such as Germany will depress sales and margins. Recent weeks have seen a dearth of upbeat corporate news. Announcements of more job losses at IBM have refocused attention on the problems at Olivetti. Its unions fear that the company, which they claim is now losing L2bn a day, plans a further 6,000 redundancies in 1993. An 11 per cent fall in the Italian car market in November - the first double-digit drop for some years - has also put an unwelcome spotlight on Fiat. Although the group has managed to arrest the decline in its share of the domestic market to around 44 per cent, a shrinking overall cake means production is set to fall further. Meanwhile, worries continue to surround Ferruzzi, Italy's other private-sector industrial giant, which controls the Montedison chemicals and agro-industrial group. Analysts find it hard to imagine how the group can talk about possible acquisitions of state assets, such as the Sme foods and retailing concern, when it is swimming in a sea of debt. Some special situations, such as Fiat's Rinascente and Cogefar-Impresit subsidiaries, remain. Both are potential sale candidates as Fiat's bosses turn their attention to possible one-off gains to boost profits. Failing such spectacular events, the market looks set to mark time in the weeks ahead, waiting for clearer information on privatisations to emerge, perhaps by the second quarter of next year.</p>

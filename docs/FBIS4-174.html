			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports indicate that preparations are in full swing  for the inauguration of the new state president on 9 May and  that invitations are to be sent to heads of state all over the  world. Among the guests of honor are leaders of terrorist  countries and sworn enemies of South Africa and the West, such  as Fidel Castro, Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and Saddam Husayn.  Western leaders mentioned include President Bill Clinton, Mr.  John Major, and Dr. Helmut Kohl. Political observers believe  this could be a protocol and diplomatic hot potato that might  leave organizers of the event with red faces, as Western leaders  distance themselves from the leaders of the terrorist countries.</p>

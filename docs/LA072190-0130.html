			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / WORLD BEAT: N'DOUR SHOWS THE WEALTH OF AFRICA IN HIS SONG;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE HIGH-PROFILE SENEGALESE SINGER WILL APPEAR IN CONCERT AT IRVINE  MEADOWS AMPHITHEATRE ON SUNDAY.  </P> <P> Ladysmith Black Mambazo isn't the only African artist making big strides toward  escaping cult status.  </P> <P> Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour, who appears with his 11-piece band in a free  concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Sunday, received widespread exposure  to Western audiences through his collaborations with Peter Gabriel. N'Dour also  got a big visibility boost when he participated in the 1988 Amnesty  International tour, where he performed with Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy  Chapman and Sting.  </P> <P> Many international artists would be happy with that kind of high profile, but  N'Dour isn't satisfied with his career progress yet.  </P> <P> "I haven't now achieved what I really want to achieve," he said by phone from  his home in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. N'Dour, 30, was enjoying a short  break with his two children after finishing work on his third Virgin album,  "Set," which is due to be released in September.  </P> <P> "My career has to be made little by little, by experience, and now I'm feeling  stronger and more sure of myself," he continued, speaking in French with his  sister Nigone serving as interpreter. "I know someday I will get what I want."  </P> <P> "I want people to know that Africa has its own culture, because American people  used to think that everything that comes from Africa is from the bush. But  African people have some new ideas, and I want my music to show people the  wealth of Africa."  </P> <P> Born into a musical family, N'Dour was the leading force in a wave of younger  bands -- including Toure Kunda and Super Diamono -- that ushered in a new era  in Senegalese pop music during the late '70s. The mbalax style (pronounced  MAH-la and meaning "rhythmic accompaniment") melded modal Islamic singing and  lyrics sung in the Wolof language with indigenous rhythms and the Latin music  that was an integral influence on early Senegalese (and most West African) pop.  </P> <P> N'Dour moved to Paris in the mid-'80s and recorded a series of albums,  highlighted by "Immigres," a 1984 release that became his first record for a  major Western pop label when Virgin reissued it here in 1988. By then, N'Dour  had worked with Herbie Hancock and sung a duet with Gabriel on the latter's  1986 breakthrough album, "So." He and Gabriel continued their collaboration  last year when he co-wrote and sang a song with N'Dour on the Senegalese  artist's "The Lion" album.  </P> <P> That album found N'Dour relying too much on slick Euro-pop touches, but he said  the new album would take a different slant. He was optimistic over his future  prospects as American audiences become more aware of the range of styles in  African music.  </P> <P> "A long time ago, what we were playing in Dakar was different from what we were  playing in the U.S.A.," said N'Dour, who has moved back to the Senegalese city.  "But nowadays we are playing the same thing because I realized that what people  like here in Dakar, people in New York love it.  </P> <P> "Everything you see in New York you can see here in Dakar, and my music is just  like that. I'm an open-minded person -- I can get the inspiration to write a  song from anywhere -- but I will never throw away my culture." DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The Scene: An invitational screening of "Music Box," TriStar Pictures' new film  about the trial of a suspected Hungarian war criminal (actor Armin  Mueller-Stahl) and the defense presented by his lawyer daughter (Jessica  Lange). Afterward, a group of 150 guests or so repaired to producer Irwin  Winkler's home in Beverly Hills for a late supper.  </P> <P> The Buzz: When a movie screens at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and  Sciences in December, it usually means one thing: The producers hope that it  will collect an Oscar or two in March. Guests at the event last weekend chatted  about the possibility, and about the four different films with Holocaust themes  that Hollywood will be putting in the Christmas stockings of theater  exhibitors.  </P> <P> Who Was There: "Music Box" stars Jessica Lange, Lucas Haas, Armin  Mueller-Stahl, writer/executive producer Joe Eszterhas, and director Constantin  Costa-Gavras; studio figures Dawn Steel, Alan Ladd Jr., John Landis, Mark  Rydell, and Tony Thomopoulos; and actors Jacqueline Bisset, Tess Harper, Amy  Irving, Shirley MacLaine, Martin Sheen, and Barbra Streisand.  </P> <P> Dress Code: A general rule of thumb at these affairs: The more important one  is, the more one can dress down. Guests wore everything from natty suits to  jeans.  </P> <P> Chow: Ambrosia provided a pre-screening buffet, but the real dinner was served  at Winkler's house by Spago's Wolfgang Puck: salmon, herb salad, lamb chops,  lobster curry and dessert. A Hungarian string quartet played on the tented  patio.  </P> <P> Noted: Screenwriter Eszterhas, whose high-profile feud with agent Mike Ovitz  has been the subject of intense Hollywood gossip for months, got the biggest  hand of anyone when his credit flashed on screen at the beginning of the movie.  Hollywood folks are so brave in the dark.  </P> <P> Quoted: So how will TriStar market a movie that opens on Christmas Day and  doesn't feature aliens, ghostbusters, or Michael J. Fox? "Reviews," says  producer Winkler. "We think we've got a chance to get some excellent reviews  and hopefully some Academy Award nominations before we open wider around the  country."  </P> <P> Triumphs: "This is really an A party," guests kept saying at the Winkler house,  happily surveying the number of powerful executives among them. It was indeed  one of those lavish affairs that prove that author Jackie Collins isn't a  novelist, but a documentarian.  </P> <P> Glitches: Some of the Winkler's neighbors were having a party of their own  complete with tented back yard, band, and valet parking, and a few confused  guests pulled up to the wrong house. Just another Friday night in Beverly  Hills. KEVIN ALLMAN  </P></p>

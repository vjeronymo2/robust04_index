			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: After imposing a military siege on the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli Government  decided to do without the Palestinian work force and bring in  foreign labor from outside. It is noteworthy that nearly  100,000 Palestinians worked in various Israeli economic  installations, especially in tedious fields of work, in return  for low wages that are not tantamount to the Israelis' wages.    Officials in Rabin's government hinted that these measures  reflect the accelerating deterioration of security conditions  and the impossibility of coexistence between Palestinians and  Israelis. Many believed that this reality could prompt Rabin's  government to continue on the road to a sound peace. However,  this has not happened. Closing the occupied territories is a  clear admission that Israel's previous proposals have failed,  that the agreements it concluded with the Palestinian side did  not change anything on the ground, and that tension could  increase.    Israeli officials are fully aware that the occupation  contradicts peace and security and that the Oslo agreement and  the following agreements and arrangements did not meet the  minimum demands and ambitions of the Palestinian people.    These agreements retained the settlers and the settlements,  thus keeping the Palestinians in danger. The settlers are  preparing for new massacres and are not hiding this fact. It is  natural for the Palestinians to defend themselves and to raise  their voices to demand real freedom and dignity. Indeed, there  can be no freedom and dignity with the continuation of the  occupation and settlements. There can be no freedom and dignity  under an administrative rule in which the final say is for the  occupying authority. Moreover, this contradicts the UN Security  Council's resolutions that stipulate a full Israeli withdrawal  and the removal of the settlements.    If, according to its officials, Israel is first concerned  about Israelis' security, then the separate Oslo agreement will  never achieve security for Israel. This is because occupation  contradicts security and the Oslo agreement did not remove the  occupation and the settlements.    A real, just, and comprehensive peace that uproots  oppression  and removes all manifestations of occupation and coercion is the  only peace that can achieve security. Israel is building new  walls and high racist barriers by imposing a siege on the  Palestinian people, by turning the occupied territories into a  detention center, and by ordering its army to raid houses and  districts and arrest Arab citizens in a manner that only means  further security deterioration for Israel. Instead of doing  this, Israel should confront the roots of the problem and admit  facts and realities. It should accept the UN Security Council  resolutions and adhere to the bases and requirements of a just  and comprehensive peace.    Is it not appropriate for Israel to exchange land for peace  and grant the Palestinian people freedom of self-determination?  How long will Israel continue to disavow the UN resolutions and  ignore the fact that the Palestinian people cannot remain the  prisoners of its tools of repression, that is, its soldiers,  policemen, and settlers.    If Israel is using the impossibility of coexistence and the  absence of security as a justification for its new repressive  measures, then why doesn't it withdraw from the occupied  territories and grant the Palestinians their right to  self-determination and allow them to build their own future?    Do Israeli officials think the struggling Palestinian people  will submit for one moment to the schemes of occupation,  Judaization, and settlements? Israel knows the answer, despite  all its efforts to ignore it -- an answer confirmed by daily  developments. Unless Israel submits to what developments  dictate and admits that its first obligation, according to  international legitimacy, is to withdraw and remove the  settlements, then we do not think the blessings of peace will  prevail over this region, which is plagued by the mentality of  Zionist expansion, aggression, and hegemony.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Artificial look into the real world - Virtual reality is taking off in the games field, but its impact on industry has so far been limited. That is now set to change To most people, virtual reality means video games and entertainment arcades. The idea of using the technique - in which three-dimensional surroundings are created by computers for viewing on headsets or desk-top terminals - has hardly penetrated beyond the leisure industry. But manufacturers are turning increasingly to this artificial, 3-D world for help with the design and development of new products. The virtual reality research programmes run by universities and other research centres have attracted a number of companies, including Caterpillar, the US manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, and two UK groups, Rolls-Royce and VSEL (formerly Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering). The potential of VR for helping business and cutting costs was demonstrated in the Netherlands earlier this year when the Calibre Institute at the University of Eindhoven developed a system for construction companies. It enabled prospective house buyers to 'walk through' new homes at a greenfield site before they had even been built. An increase in sales was reported while VR was in use there. Caterpillar has based its research work at the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. Much of the work is experimental, but the company is using stereo glasses and full-immersion headsets to develop operator cabs for backhoe loaders and wheeled shovels. 'We use the system as a design tool to check operator visibility and evaluate performance of design,' explains Richard Ingram, Caterpillar's manager of university relations. He is guarded about the financial savings that Caterpillar expects, but compares VR's possible impact with the way spreadsheets and personal computers revolutionised the accountancy profession. 'It can take from six months to a year to design and build a prototype vehicle. With virtual reality, we can put a new design into the lab in a week,' he says. Caterpillar invites digger operators to the centre's laboratory where they sit in a conventional cab seat wearing a headset. Immersed in a virtual world, they can glance outside the virtual cab and watch the machine's bucket rise and fall as they control it with real levers. Functions, however, are kept simple, dictated by the speed at which computers can display the movements in real time. If the operator dislikes one cab, an alternative design can be called up. In the UK, a close-knit community of universities and small research companies is now starting to attract support from industry. 'Virtual reality is not yet a finished production tool. And even though basic systems cost around Pounds 40,000, companies will initially prefer to work with centres of excellence,' says Seamus Morley, sales manager of Division Group, a leading UK-based supplier of VR systems for industrial applications. Division has sold more than 50 fully immersive systems worldwide and a few weeks ago shipped what it describes as the world's largest commercial VR system to Matsushita Electric in Japan. Valued at some Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 331,000), the system will enable three people to share the same virtual world. Coventry School of Art and Design, part of Coventry University, purchased a VR system in March. It is now collaborating with companies such as Ford, Rover and Motor Panels, the truck cab specialist. 'We're using virtual reality for design evaluation and interaction,' explains David Pryce-Evans, project researcher. The aim is to enable vehicle designers to see and interact with a full-sized car without going to the expense of building one. The next step is to expand the breadth of interaction, says Pryce-Evans, and move into consumer products such as kettles and cameras. Rolls-Royce and VSEL are among a number of companies which have joined a research programme run by Advanced Robotics Research, a company based at Salford University. Rolls-Royce, which joined the programme in July, wants to convert computer-aided design models of its Trent high-thrust aero-engine into real-time VR images. 'The aim is to put engineers next to a virtual rather than real model of the engine,' explains Robert Stone, technical manager of Advanced Robotics. Rolls-Royce says it has been interested in VR for a year and believes there will be a 'clear financial pay-off' if the system proves to be a practical tool. VSEL has been using advanced three-dimensional Cad modelling with full-sized and one-fifth scale models of submarines for eight years. Now, it wants to eliminate the real models and allow engineers to 'enter' virtual submarines for design verification. Despite an impressive membership list which also includes ICI and British Nuclear Fuels, Stone says he is concerned at the 'apathy' shown by much of industry. 'The UK is leading the way in VR research, but people still see it as a computer game; there's too much hype from the leisure industry,' he says. He admits that introducing VR to manufacturing industries will not be easy. The technology is still relatively expensive and the clarity of images comparatively poor. A new convert to virtual reality is the supermarket sector. Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society recently joined the programme run by Advanced Robotics. Its corporate technology department is keen to have a virtual supermarket so it can study customer flows and space planning. Presumably, though, it will stop short of virtual customers and virtual profits.</p>

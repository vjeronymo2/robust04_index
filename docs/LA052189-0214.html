			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> COPING WITH COMMUTING;  </P> <P> MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING AT HOME  </P> <P> It all started quietly enough in a rambling old house on Harper Street in West  Hollywood in 1980.  </P> <P> Felice and Boyd Willat needed a part-time business that would keep the cash  rolling in while they were between movie and television production jobs. Felice  came up with an idea for a "personal organizer," a sort of super-duper  calender/to-do list. Boyd, whose art directing credits include "Ordinary  People," designed a distinctive vinyl binder. And thus was born the first Day  Runner.  </P> <P> Some five years later, the Day Runner was hardly a hobby. Annual revenue was  $10 million, and there were 65 employees, 34 telephones and six computers  operating the business. But the Willats were still running their Harper House  business out of their two-story, 3,000-square-foot house on Harper Street.  </P> <P> "It was pretty wild," recalled Felice, who has since moved the business into  corporate quarters in Culver City.  </P> <P> Although she still cringes at memories of the zoning enforcement official who  outlawed the late-night deliveries and the safety inspector who found the  gerry-rigged telephone and electrical wiring, Felice would not trade in her  days of running an at-home business.  </P> <P> "We liked being at home. Both our children were born at home," she explained.  "We are home people."  </P> <P> And so are an increasing number of other workers.  </P> <P> According to the American Home Business Assn., some 27 million Americans now  work out of their homes on at least a part-time basis. The figure, researchers  say, includes about 13 million home-based business owners, about 3 million  employees who are allowed to work from their home instead of the traditional  office and about 11 million workers who use a home office to supplement their  at-work activities.  </P> <P> The reasons for choosing to work at home vary, but not a lot.  </P> <P> Most at-home entrepreneurs cite the need to keep overhead low and the  convenience of a nearby office during the early stages of a new business. Other  important reasons for choosing the home hearth over the corporate office  include the obvious benefits of avoiding a lengthy and hassling commute and the  inevitable office distractions, such as ringing phones and coffee klatch  gossiping. Still others say they want to spend more time with their families.  </P> <P> But the bottom line to all the reasons, explained Jack M. Nilles, a former  researcher at USC, is that at-home workers want more control over their time.  </P> <P> "These people want to fit their work life into the rest of their life, not the  other way around," said Nilles, who recently opened a consulting firm that  helps companies create at-home work opportunities for their employees from his  own Los Angeles home. "Everyone likes to be in control of their life."  </P> <P> In addition to becoming more popular, working at home has become a whole lot  easier, thanks to a wide range of technological advances, such as personal  computers, fax machines, modems, scanners and call-holding telephone features.  These advances not only give the home office many of the conveniences of the  corporate environment, but they allow the at-home worker to remain in easy  communication with the outside world.  </P> <P> Still, despite its obvious benefits and growing ease, working at home is not  for everyone.  </P> <P> Many workers need and want the hubbub of the office and the face-to-face  exchange of high-minded ideas and down-and-dirty gossip. Others need the  discipline of regular hours and direct supervision from a boss. Still others  need a regular change of environment.  </P> <P> Who has the temperament to work at home?  </P> <P> Paul Edwards, a Santa Monica writer and co-author of "Working at Home," called  the ideal at-home worker a "self-managed person."  </P> <P> "These are people who take initiative, people who are extroverted," he  explains. "These are people who use home as a base, rather than a resting  place. These are people who don't -- and won't -- feel isolated. These are  people who want to be in charge of their own destiny and have the capacity to  do just that."  </P> <P> Least likely candidates for at-home work assignments are people who need  regular social interaction with their colleagues and hands-on supervision and  approval from their bosses. This type of person includes the insecure and the  immature, as well as someone relatively new to a particular assignment who  needs on-site direction to understand his duties.  </P> <P> It also includes the person who expects to climb the corporate ladder, since  "out of sight, out of mind" often applies when promotions are being  contemplated. Furthermore, experts say single people who live alone do not like  to work at home because, more so than married people, they get a great deal of  social contact from the office.  </P> <P> However glorious and liberating it sounds, working at home comes with some  obligations.  </P> <P> At-home workers, particularly home-based entrepreneurs, must be able to set a  daily agenda for themselves -- and stick to it. No hanging around the  television or refrigerator. No long breaks in the garden, or at the kitchen  stove. There has to be a routine.  </P> <P> "If I don't stick to my routine, then I'm always rushing around and I never get  any real time off from the job," observed Trish Hawthorne, a private college  admissions counselor who has been working out of her Berkeley home for the past  three years. "That's a sure way for the job not to be fun anymore."  </P> <P> Although goofing off is an obvious pitfall, so is becoming a workaholic. With a  desk full of chores awaiting completion just a few steps away from the rest of  life, many at-home workers become consumed by the job.  </P> <P> "I could work a lot more," said Jeff Thompson, a Riverside general contractor.  "The real problem is knowing that work is just one step away from the family  room television. But finally I've had to cut my work day off at a certain time  and be done with it."  </P> <P> At-home workers must also be willing, and able, to handle the inevitable  feelings of isolation that a remote office inevitably generates. Many offset  the disconnected state with regular outings or telephone calls just to stay in  touch with the outside world. Others bring employees into their home to enliven  the working scene.  </P> <P> Sunny Bernstein, who has operated a full-service public relations firm from her  Los Angeles home for more than a decade, recalled that it only took her a month  to realize that she needed a co-worker in the house to keep her happy and  motivated. In the years since, the staff has grown to six and has gradually  taken over the wing of the house that was once home to Bernstein's three sons,  who are now grown.  </P> <P> "I always say I never lost a son, I just gained another office," Bernstein  said.  </P> <P> Full-time at-home work may be fine for the entrepreneur who has more control  over his business opportunities. But most experts recommend that corporate  employees spend no more than four days a week at home. "Otherwise you lose  touch," said Gil Gordon, a telecommuting consultant from Monmouth Junction,  N.J. "You need to get into the office and press the flesh, and let others see  that you still exist."  </P> <P> Added Nilles: "There's a real danger in becoming a tele-hermit."  </P></p>

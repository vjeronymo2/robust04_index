			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring investments A friend made some assured-tenancy business expansion scheme investments in February and March 1989. Her total investment was Pounds 5,500. She wants to transfer all these to me in return for a sum of money to be agreed mutually. Can you tell me: 1. Is a special form required (eg, a stock transfer form)? 2. After which date can this be done without affecting her tax relief? 1. Yes. Stock transfer forms are obtainable from business stationers. Stamp duty will be payable at 0.5 per cent (in multiples of 50p). 2. After the fifth anniversary of the issue of the shares (check the dates on the share certificates), by virtue of sections 299 and 289(12)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. There must be no agreement or option before then. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

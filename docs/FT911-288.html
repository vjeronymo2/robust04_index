			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Israel mars superpower tete-a-tete: Baker and Bessmertnykh seek to 'kick start' Mideast peace process MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, and his Soviet counterpart, Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, met over a 'working dinner' on the banks of the Nile last night in an against-the-odds attempt to 'kick start' the Middle East peace process. The deepening dilemma facing the two men is how to persuade Israel to take even the first tentative steps towards an historic compromise with the Arabs, based on key UN resolutions 242 and 338 requiring Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war. As they sat down for their repast the news from Israel could hardly have been less promising. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli premier, again insisted at the weekend that Israel would not withdraw from the occupied territories. Mr Baker would also not have been encouraged by the negative Israeli reaction to his announcement on Saturday that Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia had agreed to send an observer to the proposed regional Middle East peace conference. Mr Shamir's senior adviser dismissed the announcement as unimportant. He said such countries had to go much further, ending hostile relations and the Arab economic boycott of Israel and taking a full part in any peace negotiations. 'We don't need observers as far as the Arab states are concerned, we need participants,' Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, the director of the prime ministry, said. However, there was one small chink of light from Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, who adopted a less strident tone, offering the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) a cautious welcome and expressing hope that a peace process could be started. Mr Shamir also repeated a somewhat softened line on the key issue of the settlements by saying they would eventually be a subject for negotiation, but not at this stage. This fits with the position Mr Shamir has consistently adopted when confronting the demand that a peace conference be based on a 'land for peace' formula. He says this would pre-ordain an outcome unacceptable to his government. But he has left open the possibility that all such demands could be negotiated at a second stage of a two-step peace process. Mr Baker, whose fourth mission to the Middle East in two months has been variously described as 'do-or-die' and 'make-or-break', is in danger of seeing his efforts running into the sand unless he can produce a formula to narrow what appear to be almost irreconcilable differences between the two sides. With Israel insisting that any regional gathering must be limited to a more or less ceremonial introductory session hosted jointly by the US and the Soviet Union, and the Arabs demanding UN involvement in a conference with real powers, Mr Baker and Mr Bessmertnykh have their work cut out for them. Perhaps the most promising development in the absence of any sign of real progress is that for the first time in more than a generation Washington and Moscow are actively co-operating in an attempt to break the Arab-Israeli impasse. The idea that the foreign ministers of the two superpowers would be dining in Cairo in an effort to resolve one of the world's most intractable problems would have been unthinkable until recently. Whether the fact that it took place in the only Arab capital to have recognised Israel will budge the hardline Israeli government is another matter.</p>

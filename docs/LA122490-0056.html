			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CROWD PLEASING SOUL BAND HAS A LOT OF HEART;  </P> <P> MUSIC: IN A SHOW AT THE BELLY UP, JACK MACK AND THE HEART ATTACK AGAIN  DEMONSTRATE WHY THEY ARE A TOP DRAW IN SOUTHLAND NIGHTCLUBS.  </P> <P> It started out as a fun band, a group of Los Angeles songwriters and musicians  who wanted to let loose and play the style of music they had all been weaned  on: the good-time Memphis soul of the 1960s.  </P> <P> And today, 10 years later, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack is still a fun band,  a band you'd want to have play your party, a band that can shake, rattle and  roll with the best of 'em.  </P> <P> That was evident from their Friday night concert at the Belly Up Tavern in  Solana Beach, where they've been appearing periodically for the last five or so  years.  </P> <P> It was essentially the diner scene from the movie, "The Blues Brothers," played  over and over again -- a whimsical retrospective of the glorious Stax-Volt era  rather than a serious documentary. Jack Mack and the Heart Attack aren't out to  resurrect the past, just remember it. And remember it they did, paying homage  to the likes of Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and James Brown by building up  from the foundation instead of merely rummaging through the ruins. To be sure,  they played a few covers, including faithful renditions of Pickett's "Funky  Broadway" and Brown's "Cold Sweat." But there were many more originals written  in the same style and delivered with the same sense of passion and urgency. If  these guys are reviving anything, it's the sass and the style rather than the  actual tunes.  </P> <P> The band opened with the infectious "It's A Beautiful Thing," off their latest  album, "Jack It Up." It's a monster of a song, rife with majestic horn  punctuations and celebratory organ swirls. Then came a few older songs,  including such crowd pleasers as "Wonderful Girl" and "True Lovin' Woman" that  have helped make Jack Mack and the Heart Attack a consistent top draw on the  Southern California nightclub circuit.  </P> <P> Particularly compelling was the group's interpretation of Procol Harum's  classic "A Whiter Shade of Pale," also off their new album. By slowing down the  tempo and heating up the passion, they effectively transformed a cool rock song  into a sweltering soul masterpiece, much like Joe Cocker's brilliant reading of  the Animals' "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."  </P> <P> Singer Mark Campbell may look like a cross between Roy Clark and Sam Kinison,  but he's got a deliciously throaty voice that sounds remarkably like that of  the late Sam Cooke. And the four-member Heart Attack Horns, led by tenor  saxophonist Billy Bergman, are a bundle of energy and intensity. They make the  much-ballyhooed Tower of Power horn section seem almost wimpy by comparison.  </P> <P> From the first song until the final encore, the dance floor was a throbbing,  sweating mass of bodies. Even after the encore, it took awhile for the crowd to  disperse, as though no one wanted to accept the fact that the concert was,  indeed, over.  </P> <P> Opening the show was a local rock band, Jerry McCann and the Band of Giants,  who sadly failed to live up to their name. McCann is an excellent guitarist who  rendered some remarkably fluid, bluesy lead work, but that's about the only  good thing that can be said about their performance.  </P> <P> Their rhythm section was weak, their material was mediocre, and too often they  fell into gimmicky arrangements -- from pseudo- reggae to pseudo-country --  that made the whole thing sound even worse.  </P></p>

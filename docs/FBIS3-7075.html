			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The Telecommunications  Council on Thursday [24 March] advised Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki to take steps to  encourage free competition among three Japanese long-distance  telecommunications service companies. The panel gave its advice  to Kanzaki in granting charge cut applications by Japan Telecom  Co., DDI Corp. and Teleway Japan Corp., as the three companies  all planned the same reduction and sought approval for their  plans.    At the moment, conditions are not ripe for free competition  among the firms because of continued quasimonopolistic control  by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), the council said.    The three firms all proposed an average 12.3 percent cut in  the general leased circuit charge for new medium-distance  categories. The three companies also sought approval for an  average 10.3 percent cut in their high-speed digital  transmission service charges.    However, the council recommended to the minister that the  proposed charge reduction plans be approved without revision.  The rate cuts will be put into effect on April 1.</p>

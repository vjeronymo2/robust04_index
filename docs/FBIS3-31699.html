			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  advises that the presence of the Russian arms has been  increasing on the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields. Beside some  modified dated types of arms, some very modern arms have been  arriving on this battlefield recently. At the end of January, a  convoy consisting of eight trailers sent from Russia crossed  onto Bosnia-Herzegovina territory near Raca, carrying arms for  the needs of the aggressor's chetnik army. The trailers  contained Elipton bombs -- most likely the arms that  Zhirinovskiy referred to during his visit to the so-called  Srpska republic, alleging that this was the new secret weapon of  great destructive power -- a surface-to-air missile of unknown  type, and antiaircraft guns of Russian manufacture.    When the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started in April 1992,  the  former Yugoslav Peoples' Army disposed of three missile  surface-to- air systems, namely: SA-2 [Guideline], SA-3 [GOA],  and SA-6 [Gainful]. We have received confirmation from several  sources that the aggressor has strengthened its antiaircraft  defense over Bosnia-Herzegovina considerably and introduced  missile systems that not even the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army  had before the war. All these systems are of Russian  manufacture, namely: SA-8 [Gecko], SA-9 [Gaskin], and SA-14  [NATO code name not known]. The SA-13 (Gopher] and SA-11  [Gadfly] also form part of the aggressor's antiaircraft defense.  These systems are supported from the territory of the so-called  Yugoslavia by SA-12 [Gladiator] missiles.    A new missile antiaircraft system has appeared on Mount  Bjelasnica and Mount Igman last year that was not identified.    The presence of a giant (Cumen) 240-mm caliber mortar, whose  bombs weight 130 kg, has been observed at several places  throughout the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefield. The (Cumen)  fires destructive chemical and nuclear bombs, which means that  it does not use classic mortar grenades. Its barrel is 5.5 m  long and its range is 9.5 kilometers. The giant weapon weighs 4  tonnes. This mortar was also spotted in positions around  Sarajevo.    Bearing in mind the number of destroyed tanks on this  battlefield and the number of tanks held by the army of the  so-called Srpska republic, it is evident that their hardware is  regularly replenished. Tanks that had earlier not even formed  part of the armament of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, for  example, T-72 tanks, have appeared on this battlefield on  several occasions. These tanks, which carried the colors, the  markings, and the numbers of the Russian Army have also taken  part in some of the battles, the press center of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports.    Together with these arms, large contingents of men have been  arriving who are servicing them and training members of the  chetnik artillery units. It is also well known that contingents  of fully armed and equipped mercenaries are arriving on the  territory of the so-called Srpska republic at regular intervals.  They are not stopped on the Russian border, nor are their  equipment and arms seized, the press center of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports.</p>

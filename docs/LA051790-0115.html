			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> $34 MILLION WILL KEEP BATTLEFIELD FREE OF MALLS  </P> <P> The federal government will pay two Virginia builders $34.1 million for a  150-acre tract that was condemned 18 months ago to save the Manassas Civil War  battlefield from encroaching development.  </P> <P> Under the negotiated settlement, the government will pay William Center Limited  Partnership and NVHomes Limited Partnership for land near the Manassas  Battlefield Park that the two groups owned jointly.  </P> <P> Still to be decided is the price to be paid developers John T. (Til) Hazel Jr.  and Milton V. Peterson for a parcel of more than 350 acres condemned at the  same time.  </P> <P> A nationwide "Save the Battlefield" campaign headed off plans to build a  regional shopping mall and more than 500 houses on the tracts, off Route I-66  near Manassas about 30 miles west of Washington.  </P> <P> Two battles were fought in the fields, in 1861 and 1862, with Confederate  forces winning both.  </P> <P> When Congress enacted a so-called legislative taking, which was signed into law  on Nov. 10, 1988, the government gained title to the entire tract with  compensation to be negotiated.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Economic slowdown hits confidence in Taiwan - The outlook for equity investment for the rest of the year remains depressed Along with other marginal investors in an economically depressed world, Taiwan's housewives and taxi-drivers appear to be finding better things to do with their savings nowadays than investing in the island's dull equity market. Since the government quashed a rally last February with action on money supply and a squeeze on the inflow of foreign investment, the weighted index has recorded a steady downward trend. This culminated with three new 1992 lows in the last eight days of July, and a half-hearted recovery since then before subsiding to yet another new low yesterday of 3,893.34. Following the Nikkei's plunge to a six-year low and the threat of renewed war in the Gulf, investor confidence bottomed out on July 23 in an already bearish market, sending the index plummeting by 4.2 per cent in one day. Although it later recovered to break through the 4,000 level, analysts expect little remission in the next quarter. 'There are fewer people participating now, and they are putting their money in other places,' says Mr Jeffrey Toder, of Jardine Fleming Securities. Property and the new B shares in mainland China are rapidly finding favour with individuals who still form the majority of the island's equity investors. A series of minor blows has further dampened enthusiasm. Evergreen Securities, one of Taiwan's biggest brokerages, announced its closure due to depressed trade, heralding further possible casualties as a consequence of the market's decline. Furthermore, the central bank's failure to follow Japan and the US in cutting interest rates renewed fears of a tight credit policy. The bearish sentiment of the first half of the year, with the exception of a rally in January, is seen by some as a legacy of the 1990 crash, when the speculative bubble burst on the property and stock markets. It is difficult to see how an economy which is expected to make 7 per cent GNP growth this year could sustain such pessimism for long. But a slowdown in export growth brought on by a strong Taiwan dollar, extensive media coverage about the economic slowdown and problems with the Dollars 303bn infrastructure plan have taken their toll on investor confidence. The market did brighten recently on news of a relaxation in credit control by the central bank and lower inflation figures for July. The index rose to 4,134.91, although buying was cautious and turnover thin, and sentiment recovered only to slide again. A meeting scheduled for the end of the month to address problems concerned with relations with Beijing is expected to boost activity but there is little else to encourage buyers. There is a sense, say observers, that the good news has been heard already, and that as the economy matures, fortunes may no longer be made overnight. Mr Peter Kurz, chief representative of Baring Securities, sees a prolonged dull period as a necessary stage in the market's evolution. 'It's part of a typical bull-bear cycle, but at the same time (the market is) becoming more mature,' he says. Analysts say that equities are likely to remain in the doldrums for most of the remainder of 1992. The first full parliament will be elected on December 19, and although the main opposition party is taking a more moderate line, its pro-independence stance caused panic selling when it was announced last year. Caution seems likely to be the watchword. 'Investors on the whole are being more careful. Everyone realises now that stocks can go down as well as up,' says Mr Toder.</p>

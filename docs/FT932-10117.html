			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Customs acts on excise evasion CUSTOMS and Excise officers uncovered 230 cases of illegal trade in tobacco and drinks by cross-Channel shoppers during the first three months of the year. Eleven people have been charged with offences and prosecution of a further 113 is under consideration. Since January 1 travellers have been able to bring unlimited supplies of drink and tobacco from the Continent into the UK for personal consumption. But selling the goods without paying higher UK excise rates is illegal. Customs and Excise said yesterday that the 230 cases involved evasion of about Pounds 324,000 in duty, of which Pounds 249,000 was accounted for by 2,500 kilos of tobacco.</p>

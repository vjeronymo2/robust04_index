			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank move fails to cheer bourses European equity markets gave a muted response to the Bundesbank's decision to cut rates last Thursday, and the week saw declines in virtually all the senior bourses. The UBS global research team comments that the less than euphoric response to the German move reflected not just the cautious nature of the easing, but also the restrained action of the Bank of France in lowering only its five to 10-day repo rate. Morgan Stanley's European strategists believe there is likely to be a 5 to 8 per cent correction in the Continental markets, caused by two factors: 'First . . . it is not that the markets have gone too far, they have just gone too fast in August. Second, it is worrying that enthusiasm for equity markets in Europe depends solely on bullishness about interest rates.' Italy was a big loser last week on the FT-Actuaries World index, in spite of seeing a rate cut of its own. The bourse, consolidating after its strong summer run, was overcome by worries about the prospect of imminent capital increases from a number of companies, most notably Fiat, although the group denied that it had any such plans. Mr William Cowan of James Capel expects the current consolidation to continue in coming weeks, as the market begins to focus on a forth-coming stream of six-month figures. He sees little room for a further reduction in Italian interest rates until the budget overcomes potential political hurdles and wins full parliamentary approval. Norway was another large loser as it continued the consolidation that started in mid-August and business was restrained ahead of yesterday's general election. However, Bikuben Securities forecasts that further cuts in interest rates will strengthen Norwegian equities in the longer term.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change    % change                 % change in local currency *     sterling*   in US dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of   Start of    Start of                                           1993        1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -3.14    -0.86   +28.42   +24.51     +22.50     +25.34 Belgium       -1.89    -2.92   +24.60   +18.21     +12.00     +14.58 Denmark       -0.85    +1.78   +30.45   +30.91     +21.69     +24.51 Finland       +2.49    -3.29  +162.29   +74.86     +57.71     +61.37 France        -1.76    -1.34   +21.30   +16.91     +12.54     +15.14 Germany       -3.02    -2.31   +22.50   +20.25     +19.12     +21.87 Ireland       -1.30    -1.31   +43.51   +42.27     +24.50     +27.37 Italy         -5.55    -0.28   +80.14   +44.19     +34.93     +38.04 Netherlands   -1.30    -0.50   +27.51   +21.25     +20.12     +22.90 Norway        -3.94    -7.64   +50.88   +26.75     +22.69     +25.53 Spain         -2.33    +2.15   +41.22   +34.66     +17.75     +20.48 Sweden        -1.06    -1.72   +70.13   +27.26     +12.10     +14.69 Switzerland   -3.21    -3.91   +31.25   +15.33     +18.47     +21.20 UK            -0.62    +0.75   +34.34    +8.71      +8.71     +11.22 EUROPE        -1.75    -0.69   +33.00   +16.67     +14.30     +16.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     -0.74    +3.96   +25.52   +20.15     +10.77     +13.32 Hong Kong     +1.58    +2.61   +30.32   +36.07     +33.07     +36.14 Japan         -1.35    -0.42   +17.34   +26.94     +45.79     +49.17 Malaysia      -2.26    +9.51   +69.34   +47.95     +48.64     +52.08 New Zealand   -0.49    +7.73   +43.89   +33.04     +39.40     +42.62 Singapore     -1.37    +5.38   +49.53   +31.15     +31.59     +34.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -3.11    -0.82    +7.01   +11.17      +5.10      +7.53 USA           +0.04    +2.46   +10.28    +5.92      +3.53      +5.92 Mexico        -0.31    +8.39   +43.06    +6.34      +4.20      +6.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -2.70    -4.33   +27.48   +20.96     +18.71     +21.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   -0.91    +0.78   +19.00   +15.32     +18.02     +20.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on September 10th 1993.

The national debt is fast approaching the 1800 trillion lire  (1.13 trillion dollar) mark, according to the Bank figures which  do not take account of the state railways, monopolies or  telephones, which have recently been turned into joint stock  companies. Were these included, the total would come to 1825  trillion lire (1.14 trillion dollars).    Efforts by successive governments to bring the PSBR into  check, thus improving the debt/gross national product ratio,  seem to be bearing fruit, however, the Bank said, with the  borrowing requirement for the first three months of this year  standing at 41.690 trillion lire (26.2 billion dollars), nine  trillion lire (5.6 billion dollars) down on the same period of  1993.

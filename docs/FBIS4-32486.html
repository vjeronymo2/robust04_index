			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "gyarmath": "The Escalation of Internal </F> Disputes"]    [Text] Since countless events, statements, and press  releases have, for quite some time, signaled and reminded the  public, it is no secret that diverse views causing tensions  within the Kiralyhagomelleki [Pasul Craiului (Oradea)] Reformed  Church District, and between the bishoprics of Nagyvarad  [Oradea] and Kolozsvar [Cluj-Napoca] have arisen, and that an  increasingly poisonous debate has been evolving, in the course  of which the "parties" have not shrunk from going so far as to  accuse each other. Except for a few extreme nationalist Romanian  language newspapers, the Romanian political press has stayed  away from the conflict until now, primarily because they felt  that autonomous governing bodies of the church, not the press,  were supposed to resolve conflicts within the church, and  because disputed issues did not require unsolicited--and,  additionally, incompetent--advocates. As we already reported  briefly, the practice followed by newspapers unexpectedly  changed last week, when an anonymous article appeared in the  opposition weekly TINERAMA. Its title: "Laszlo Tokes Is Not a  Real Bishop." From a practical standpoint, the article  summarizes all of several years of accusations leveled by the  "interested parties" against Kiralyhagomelleki Reformed Church  District Bishop Laszlo Tokes, which have become known to the  greater public, one way or another.    The TINERAMA article is based on a letter addressed to  Presidential Counselor Victor Opaschi--with a facsimile of the  letter printed and signed by Lugos [Lugoj] parochial Minister  Istvan Higyed, Chief Trustee Balint B. Kiss, and Trustee Istvan  Csaszar. The alleged intent of the letter is "to clarify things  that happened in the Reformed Church in 1989." The letter  contains a request to Opaschi "to forward to the signatories a  copy of the document in which Mr. Ion Iliescu appointed Mr.  Laszlo Tokes to the Temesvar [Timisoara] Reformed Church  District--showing the date of the appointment and the capacity  of the appointee," "because disagreements have surfaced within  the Reformed Church in this regard; moreover, certain documents  questioning Mr. Tokes's capacity as a high priest have been  submitted to the highest legislative forum of the Reformed  Church (the Synod)."    Using this letter as his starting point, the anonymous  author  of the TINERAMA article states that the December 1989  appointment of Laszlo Tokes was based only on a public statement  by Ion Iliescu; this, in turn, confronted the Reformed Church of  Romania with the accomplished fact (because the legitimate  procedure had been circumvented) of having a bishop as its  leader, who had never been nominated by the Synod for that post.  Moreover, the author also suggests that presently the Palace of  Cotroceni is seeking a solution to overcome this difficulty by  giving legal force to the appointment, because "it does not want  to let the bishop act on his own, a bishop, who, incidentally,  is also attempting to unify the two Reformed Church bishoprics  presently in Romania, under his own leadership, of course."    What motivates the Office of the President to support Laszlo  Tokes in this regard, the weekly newspaper asks. "In order to  provide an appropriate answer to this question, we must, above  all, keep in mind the `catalyzing' role Laszlo Tokes had played  in the revolution (whose first beneficiary was President  Iliescu), as well as the fact that Virgil Magureanu was Tokes's  neighbor during his brief exile (17-22 December 1989) to the  Zilah [Zalau] area!", the newspaper explains. "And we must not  forget," the author argues, "that whenever the Power `emanating'  from December 1989 experienced problems, Laszlo Tokes always  made some forceful anti-Romanian statements (some of these  aiming for the dissection of the country), thus diverting public  attention from the real problems, providing a pretext for  extreme nationalist groups to endlessly recount the watchword  `Hungarian threat.' And indeed, one or two parties--the Romanian  National Unity Party [RNEP in Hungarian; PUNR] and the Greater  Romania (Romania Mare) Party [NRP in Hungarian; PRM]--were  formed, whose existence is based exclusively on the `Hungarian  threat,' and which, by no coincidence, support the Power. In  this context, certain assumptions certainly acquire a different  meaning: assumptions, according to which Laszlo Tokes's peculiar  car accident in Hungary was, in reality, a warning to Tokes by  the Hungarian secret service, an organization that had figured  out the real game played by Tokes, in support of the Iliescu  regime. No doubt, in the opinion of the Bucharest regime, Tokes  has fully deserved the bishop's shoulder trimming, even if those  may be regarded as illegal," the 13-19 May issue of TINERAMA  concludes.    Let us disregard the absurd insinuations made, and  conclusions drawn by TINERAMA, the obvious attempt to hammer a  wedge between Tokes and the opposition, and Tokes and the  revolution, because the answer to these matters is already  attached [as published], as provided to this newspaper by the  Office of the Bishop, Kiralyhagomelleki Reformed Church  District. On the other hand, we must not remain silent regarding  our concern about the fact that disputes that disrupt unity, and  which, by all means, damage the Reformed Church of Romania, have  transcended their normal boundaries; once outside the limits of  the church and its forums, the disputes have become  uncontrollable, and could produce unpredictable consequences.  Once the greater public becomes aware of these disputes, the  mutual accusations may rekindle some passions, may become  divisive, and therefore may perpetuate the conflict, instead of  producing a fortunate ending. We state in advance that for this  reason we would not like to become a "forum" for this dispute,  and that we are not inclined to publish possible and probable  replies, denials, and explanations. But since journalistic  practice obligates us to do so, we obviously will publish these  things anyway. But only under two conditions. First, we will be  strict about publishing the replies of only those personally and  directly affected by this issue. Second, replies and denials  must not exceed acceptable limitations on length. After all, it  would be more fortunate for the already opposed parties to  exclude the public which, in essence, has nothing to do with  this matter, and to make Christian peace through negotiations.  We convey our best wishes for accomplishing this!</p>

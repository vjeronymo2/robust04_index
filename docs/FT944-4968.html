			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Intermediaries find role under threat in Asia / A look at the challenge posed to traditional bank lending by growing debt markets International banks have grown used to regarding Asia as one of the last regions of the world where they can still lend money for a good return. The process of securitisation which has seen their best customers in the US and Europe drift away to the bond markets has been slow to take hold. Now, however, even Asia is starting to catch up with the times. Thailand's introduction last month of new arrangements for trading domestic bonds and the recent launch by Wharf (Holdings) of a HKDollars 2.3bn (Pounds 190m) floating rate note issue in the Hong Kong market are signs of the way debt markets are growing in importance around the region. The latter broke new ground as the first issue by a commercial borrower eligible for discount by the Hong Kong's Monetary Authority. According to Mr Andre Lee of Peregrine Securities, the Hong Kong investment bank, the value of paper outstanding in Asian debt markets outside Japan has doubled to more than USDollars 500bn (Pounds 330bn) in the last five years. Mr Lee says it could easily double again in the next five years. No one pretends that such rapid growth is an immediate threat to bank lending business, but there is now a growing awareness among banks themselves that their business is facing a serious long-term challenge. 'Hongkong Bank and its ilk will find the going a great deal tougher than they have traditionally found it. Looking ahead five years, bank balance sheets will look quite different. Straight debt will be a much smaller component,' says Mr John Mulcahy of UBS Securities. Driving the development of bond markets is the need in many countries to mobilise private sector finance for infrastructure development. The requirement to use domestic savings more efficiently is prompting governments to deregulate financial markets and establish alternatives to traditional bank finance. Mr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary-general of Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission, says local banks currently earn handsome margins of about 4 per cent on average. Together with finance companies they provide about 80 per cent of the funds needed by business. 'From an efficiency point of view we don't wish any institution to have a dominating role.' As competition grows, banks will see a fall in their interest margins, says Mr Graham Catterwell of Crosby Research, 'probably not a dramatic fall, but a progressive erosion over time'. But margins on lending to smaller companies will remain high and, with affluence increasing, Thai banks will be able to make up lost income by developing retail business. Some leading banks remain relaxed about the impact of the changes. Mr Tom Dunton, head of corporate banking at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, says the scope for borrowers to securitise their debt is limited. 'There's only a handful of investment grade companies that can do what Wharf did.' But Hongkong and Shanghai Bank admits to the need for change. Mr Paul Selway-Swift, executive director, says it is putting more resources into investment banking precisely because it believes securitisation will take lending business away from banks, a process known to bankers as disintermediation. 'If we want to do the volume of business we think is desirable, we are going to have to be somebody who disintermediates, rather than somebody is disintermediated against,' he says. Stock market analysts worry about balance sheet growth, but in the medium term, says Mr Selway-Swift, borrowers' requirements will become so large - he puts China's infrastructure needs at Dollars 300bn between now and the end of the century - that even Hongkong Bank cannot satisfy them with its own balance sheet. 'We are just going to have to take a lot of our clients to the capital markets,' he says. Mr Selway-Swift is relaxed about the impact of this change on his bank's lending business. There are so many fast-growing companies in Asia that new corporate borrowers will emerge for the banks as fast as the established ones move over to the securities markets. Not surprisingly, Peregrine, which took a strategic decision to strengthen its bond department this year, takes a different view. 'We feel the Asian debt market is going to absolutely explode in terms of volumes,' says Mr Philip Tose, its chairman. Asian companies are still often family controlled, but when they are expanding rapidly, they need more new capital than their owners are willing to provide. So they are pushed towards debt markets, rather than dilute their ownership, he says. None the less, there are some serious obstacles in the way of the development of debt markets and their use to finance infrastructure. One is the fact that a securitised structure is often inappropriate for a project in, say, transport or power, which will take years to generate any cash. Another, more general, difficulty lies in developing secondary market trading. Bankers regard Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia as particularly well-placed to develop domestic debt markets because they have fully convertible currencies. Yet all three countries lack liquid government issues which can act as a pricing benchmark. Indeed, says, Mr Mohamad Munir, chairman of Malaysia's Securities Commission, the stock of government bond paper in his country is steadily depleting. In Indonesia, worries about the authenticity of certificates have slowed secondary market dealing. But Mr Bacelius Ruru, Jakarta's top securities regulator, says this is being tackled by the introduction of book entry trading. Indonesia wants to wean institutional investors away from fixed-time deposits at banks, he says. Like Malaysia it is establishing a domestic credit rating agency to help build confidence in its bond market. Bankers say the scope for securitisation is large even in countries which do not have fully convertible currencies, witness the flourishing commercial paper market in Taiwan with outstanding issues equivalent to more than Dollars 10bn. China's bond market is relatively small but it still offers investors a return much higher than they can receive from bank deposits. To some extent, the speed at which domestic debt markets grow will also depend on the readiness of governments to open them to foreign investment banks. Even if they are slow to do so, however, most bankers assume that regional debt issuance in US international currencies will continue to grow apace. 'Nothing will stop it,' says Mr Tose. 'The demand for funding is going to be so great.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gerhard Schroeder, Lower Saxony's minister </F> president, by Reinhard Hesse; place and date not given: "`Most  Superfluous'"]    [Text] [Hesse] In Spring 1993, you said that submarines  for Taiwan should be built at shipyards in Lower Saxony to  preserve jobs. The current discussion about relaxing arms  export guidelines should suit you very well.    [Schroeder] I am definitely the wrong person to talk to  about this matter. I have never called for relaxing arms export  guidelines. In my opinion, the current discussion is most  superfluous. If statistics are right, Germany ranks third among  arms exporters. The existing law says that the Federal Security  Council has to examine whether exceptions should be made in  individual cases -- and we are only talking about arms exports  outside NATO. Changing this procedure would be politically  wrong and economically unnecessary.    [Hesse] But it sounded quite different before. Or did we  misunderstand your interventions?    [Schroeder] I am one of the people who occasionally speak  out for utilizing the full resources of the existing arms  industry. However, I am opposed to misunderstanding arms  production as a means of economic control. You can see the  results of this approach in Bavaria: I get the impression that  Franz Josef Strauss' successors would rather not have inherited  the military-industrial structures with which the late  minister-president attempted his Bavarian economic miracle.    [Hesse] And yet, in connection with closing down the  Daimler-Benz daughter company Dasa, you demanded that the  Eurofighter project be reassessed, a project that had been  rejected by the Social Democratic Party of Germany for years.    [Schroeder] I said that one must understand the Bavarian  minister-president demanding that production be set out and  predictable. I never said that this should mean establishing  new resources. This would be very problematic. Just how  problematic this would be, can be seen in the United States at  the moment: They have even more excess resources in the arms  industry, and thus greater problems.    [Hesse] Meanwhile, Daimler-Benz Chief Edzard Reuter has  threatened that he would close down more resources at the  Lemwerder Dasa works, or even transfer the entire production  abroad, unless the export guidelines are relaxed. Could you be  blackmailed into something there?    [Schroeder] Leaving the fuss aside, what Reuter demands are  clear conditions. But these can only be had in Bonn.    [Hesse] Those advocating a more offensive arms export policy  argue that Germany would not be sufficiently able to act in  foreign policy matters otherwise.    [Schroeder] I cannot follow this line. On the contrary: It  would make sense to apply the obviously right, peace-oriented  German regulations to all of Europe. Following the experience  of two World Wars instigated by Germany, it would be appropriate  for Germany to lead a movement for arms export control.    [Hesse] Have you -- for the sake of jobs in our country --  completely abandoned the idea of converting arms production into  civilian production?    [Schroeder] Nonsense. Of course, I am in favor of  conversion. But this is a medium- to long-term objective. It is  of no use in the short term, if existing resources are not  utilized, as is the case in Lemwerder.    [Hesse] Does this mean: Schroeder is against arms exports,  but in favor of armament if it secures jobs?    [Schroeder] No. Schroeder is in favor of facts that can be  kept, that one can rely on. Lemwerder has nothing to do with  exports. Helmut Kohl recently told the minister presidents of  the laender that he is opposed to arms exports as an instrument  of economic policy. If this now becomes a topic in the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU], I wonder whether there are  people within the CDU who are out to get Kohl.    [Hesse] But your submarines for Taiwan would not have been  compatible with German export guidelines, either.    [Schroeder] That is wrong. Such a contract would have been  in line with the guidelines. The Federal Security Council made  a different decision in this matter because it thought it had to  make concessions to the government of the People's Republic of  China. Shortly afterwards, supplying warships to Indonesia did  not pose any problem. This means, it is a question of specific  political decisions. It does not require any legal changes.</p>

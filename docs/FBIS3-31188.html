			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 11 (CTK) -- Thursday's [10 February]  decision of the Slovak customs authorities not to allow food  products without a quality certificate to enter the country as  of today is the first major mistake in the functioning of the  Czech-Slovak customs union, Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir  Dlouhy told CTK today. Dlouhy said he would ask for the Customs  Union Council to be called.    Slovakia was attempting to protect the balance of payments  by  misusing technical obstacles to trade in a situation where such  steps were indefensible, he said.    The Czech Republic was informed of the measure only 24 hours  before it came into effect, he said. Slovakia had merely  carried out its formal obligations, but usually in similar cases  the supplier is given more time to adapt to the new conditions,  Dlouhy said.    The Customs Union Agreement allows either country to take  such a measure if it is essential for "the protection of life or  health of people, animals or plants," he pointed out, but in his  view this was not the case. The measure is directed against all  countries not just the Czech Republic, he added.</p>

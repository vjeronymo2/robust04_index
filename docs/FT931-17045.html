			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: New stock account YORKSHIRE Building Society is offering a second version of its guaranteed stock market account, Stock Index Plus. The account has a five-year term, but is slightly unusual in that it allows investors to benefit from a partial guarantee in the intermediate years. After one year, investors will receive their money back or 50 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index (whichever is the higher); after two years, 105 per cent of their original investment, or 60 per cent of Footsie's rise, and so on, building up to the five year guarantee of 125 per cent of the original investment, or 100 per cent of the Footsie's rise. There are two caveats, however - gains will be taxed as income, so taxpayers who have not used up their Capital Gains Tax allowance would do better to choose an indexed unit trust. The investor benefits only from the capital rise in the Footsie, not from any dividend yield. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000 and the issue is open for investment between January 2 and February 25.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Interesting request ON LEAVING, one of my furnished tenants is not only claiming the return of the deposit but also interest thereon. There is no mention of interest being paid in the agreement. Can he claim it? The claim for interest is not justified by law. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

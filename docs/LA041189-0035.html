			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Navy veteran and peace activist Scott Rutherford ended a 49-day water-only fast  aimed at protesting U.S. military aid to the government of El Salvador. "My  heart and the gracious spirit guided me in the beginning of this fast," he  said. "They are now telling me that it is time to end it." The fast ended in a  ceremony outside the gates of the Concord Naval Weapons Station, the longtime  target of peace activists who charge that it is an embarkation point for U.S.  weapons headed for Central America. Rutherford, a member of the Nuremberg  Actions anti-war group, said: "I feel I have done so little for my Salvadoran  brothers and sisters when so much is called for. Their situation is very  grave."  </P></p>

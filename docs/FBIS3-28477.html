Saying that this suppression fully reveals the shamelessness  of the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors and its fascist nature  more truculent than the preceding military fascist groups, an  analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says:    This time, the South Korean farmers and public figures held  a  peasants' rally and a daring demonstration. They were an  entirely just struggle to defend the sovereignty of the nation  and the vital interests of the South Korean farmers. They could  not be a target of suppression at all.    If there is one blamable, he is none other than the traitor  Kim Yong-sam who threw away his "promise" to "defend" the rice  market by staking his "presidency" and sold off the South Korean  rice market to the U.S. masters for "an international  cooperation system" intended to do harm to the fellow countrymen  in the North.    However, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, the very criminal,  is brandishing the sword, incriminating the demonstrators who  are out to defend the interests of the nation. It is a group of  traitors without parallel in history and a gang of ignorant  fascist hooligans.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must step down, discontinuing  the foolish gamble to bridge over the "government" crisis and  prolong its remaining days at the point of the fascist bayonet.</p>

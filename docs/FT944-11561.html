			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: TBI Pounds 2.4m in black midway TBI, the property investment and development company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m in its first interim results since the reverse takeover of Markheath, the indebted property company, in March. The profit in the six months to September 30 compared with a restated loss of Pounds 2.4m in the same period last year. TBI said both businesses had been successfully integrated and there were already cost savings. Management changes are being made to facilitate TBI's intended rapid growth through active portfolio management. Mr Michael Rendle will step down as non-executive chairman on January 1 and be succeeded by Mr Stanley Thomas. Mr Thomas was one of the principal backers of TBI when, before the reverse takeover, it was the privately-owned Thomas Bailey Invest-ments. Mr Keith Brooks, formerly a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, became chief executive on November 1. Mr Paul Guy, who was chief executive, becomes his deputy and finance director, replacing Mr Ian Creber who has resigned. Mr Creber was one of two Markheath directors on the TBI board. Turnover advanced to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 1.7m) and operating profits were up Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2m. Net debt fell by Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 39.4m, compared with March 31, and gearing dropped to 84 per cent from 113 per cent at the start of the year. Net assets rose to Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 41.7m) in that period. No dividend will be paid but TBI said it expected a nominal final dividend to be recommended for the full year if sufficient distributable profits had been earned.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet today decided to warn the PLO against  cooperating with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], in the  wake of reports on possible cooperation between the two  organizations. This was reported at the close of the weekly  cabinet session. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports  that the cabinet approved the issuance of 20,000 work permits  for Palestinians, mainly in farming. The laborers will be 35  years old, or above. The cabinet also approved the allocation  of 30 million shekels for government-initiated projects and  social welfare payments for the Palestinians in the territories.  For the time being, the closure will continue indefinitely.    Knesset Member Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee, said today that the cooperation  announced by Hamas and Fatah in the territories is not an  agreement between the leadership of the two organizations.  These are understandings made by local Gaza activists. The  understandings were made because some Hamas members are hoping  for jobs in the autonomy administration, and in view of the  interest shared by both organizations to prevent bloodshed in  Gaza. Ori Or further said that there are serious difference  among Hamas members. Activists in the territories claim that  they should take part in the PLO administration in order to  survive when autonomy is established. At the same time, some of  the organization leaders believe that terror is the only path to  be pursued.    Likud has called on the prime minister to stop negotiations  with the PLO if it does not immediately stop cooperating with  Hamas. Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav stated it is now  clear that the working assumption of the Oslo agreement,  according to which the PLO would fight Hamas, is silly.</p>

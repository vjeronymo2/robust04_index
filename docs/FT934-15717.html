			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Special report on Arts Sponsorship: Recession puts damper on corporate aid - Companies are being courted as never before, but money is not easy to come by THE BRITISH government is threatening to cut back on its financial support for the arts; hard-pressed local authorities are finding it difficult to maintain their funding; and box office receipts have been hit by the recession. In this triple whammy for the administrators of the nation's arts companies and venues, there seems one possible saviour - the corporate sponsor. Sponsors are being courted as never before but, unfortunately, business is none too prosperous. Companies which are closing factories, reducing staff levels, freezing dividends and fighting to re-build profits are not in the strongest position to increase their commitment to arts' sponsorship. Colin Tweedy, director-general of the Association of Business Sponsors of the Arts (ABSA), expects that its annual audit, to be released in November, will reveal a standstill in sponsorship spending for 1993. A year ago, sponsorship in the UK was estimated at Pounds 64.4m, showing a 14 per cent rise in the year. The figures disguised a remarkable switch in funding: direct sponsorship had leapt by 28 per cent to Pounds 57.5m, while money invested in corporate membership schemes had fallen by 37 per cent to Pounds 7.8m. Obviously, companies cut back on entertaining - on the seats at opera houses, theatres and concert halls that were not always used efficiently - while still believing that funding arts events was worthwhile, despite a recession. Few companies wished to endure the embarrassment of withdrawing from sponsorship commitments; and while certain traditional supporters - prominent among them the banks, insurance companies and oil multinationals (with NatWest, Royal Insurance and BP as representative cases) - froze or reduced their arts budgets, there were enough new sponsors, or committed backers, to keep up the good work. Companies sponsor the arts for three, not necessarily compatible, reasons: as straightforward patronage, with Marks &amp; Spencer an obvious example; for entertainment opportunities (an area where Digital has succeeded wonderfully, making contact with most of its earmarked prospective customers, usually at sponsored dance events); and as part of a public relations and marketing exercise (most typically, in brands like Becks Bier, Haagan-Daz and Levi which want to improve their appeal to an affluent youth market by sponsoring trendy arts events). The balance between the differing motivations is changing, though. Old-fashioned patronage is declining as a prime factor: even M&amp;S is not averse to some public appreciation of its generosity. Entertainment will always be important (look how easy it was for Glyndebourne to raise Pounds 33m, mainly from business, for its new theatre) but the driving force behind sponsorship in the past year has been the marketing man. To justify spending the money to boards, shareholders and workers, arts sponsors have to make out a case - and sponsorship as a means of improving corporate or brand image, or actually boosting sales, is the most effective case. Of course, many sponsorships still are determined by the enthusiasm of the company chairman for a particular art form, but the power of the marketing men is growing. Even the UK's biggest sponsor, BT, watches closely the media coverage of the events it fructifies with its Pounds 1.8m. annual spending. When the South Bank's national touring exhibitions of art, a Pounds 1m investment over three years, failed to get the publicity expected, BT paid for extra PR help. Its sponsorship is community-based and anti-elitist - it supports amateur theatrical and music societies - but BT needs its credits. The marketing thrust of arts sponsorship is more visible through the increasing interest shown in promoting brands, and the evaluation of the event concerned. In the past, advertising agencies have failed to get to grips with sponsorship. But it was a leading agency, Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty, which suggested that its Whitbread brand, Boddingtons beer, should back an annual Manchester arts and television festival, and that the advertising should revolve around the sponsorship. BMW sponsored a Rouault show at the Royal Academy through its BMW-8 series, with a model of the car displayed in the courtyard; Unilever backed Royal Shakespeare Company productions at the Barbican through its Persil, Comfort and Flora brands; and the Faberge exhibition coming soon to the Victoria &amp; Albert will promote both Faberge and Brut toiletries. Crosse &amp; Blackwell, a Nestle brand, has just signed a Pounds 2.2m, 30-month deal to sponsor the weekly Masterclass programme on Classic FM, a national radio channel. It is true that one attraction of sponsoring through a brand, rather than under the corporate name, is that the event can be credited to a first-time sponsor and, thus, qualify for some of the Pounds 4.5m that the government finds each year for the business sponsorship incentive scheme (which is designed to encourage new sponsorships). But, even without the BSIS, branding is a growing force in sponsorship. It is encouraged by the development of another pre-requisite of modern marketing: evaluation. One insurance company, Clerical Medical &amp; General, decided that it would invest more heavily in arts sponsorship. Before it committed a Pounds 100,000-plus budget, it undertook a Pounds 15,000 evaluation study of the audience for the arts and its reaction to sponsors. The results were encouraging, and the company will continue to switch money to the arts. It is also selling the findings, through ABSA, to other cautious sponsors. Hill &amp; Knowlton, one of the PR companies now eyeing the money in arts' sponsorship, also has an evaluation package on offer to sponsors. Clerical Medical also is involved in another of the new trends in its sponsorship of a Channel 4 television series, The Concerto. This development is a double-edged sword. If companies decide to sponsor the arts through broadcast programmes, it could reduce the money available for the living arts. Classic FM attracted more than Pounds 4m in sponsorship money in its first year through programmes like the British Gas-backed Classical Gas. In the past few weeks, Prudential has invested Pounds 100,000 in the station to advertise its annual Prudential Award for the Arts, an annual Pounds 300,000 package which remains the largest corporate-sponsored prize in the field. Nestle exemplifies neatly the way the business is going through its Pounds 2.2m Masterclass deal. This also manages to fulfil one of the perennial attractions to sponsors of arts sponsorship in being educational and aimed at youth. Many companies still help the arts through their charity budgets (the size of which is linked to their profitability), syphoning money into educational activities. Perhaps the biggest sponsorship announced in the past year was the Pounds 5m Hanson has committed over many years to the National Youth Theatre. Some predictions about arts sponsorship have failed to develop. After the great splurge for the Japan Festival in 1991-92, which attracted Pounds 12m in direct sponsorship from Japanese companies in the UK, Japanese business has held fire (largely because of economic problems at home). The whole area of payroll giving and private patronage, the main way of funding the arts in the US, also has marked time because the government's tax incentives were just not large enough. The past year has placed great strains on the increasingly professional development managers of the UK's arts companies, whose task is to bring in ever-higher levels of sponsorship to keep their organisations going. They are being forced to offer more in terms of publicity and back-up to keep existing sponsors faithful, and to attract new backers. Often, they have to accept lower sums in return for a sponsorship or to put together packages of sponsors, sharing the cost. Media coverage - or, rather, the lack of it - remains a key restraint on sponsorship. ABSA reckons that 62 per cent of sponsors now get credits, which is an improvement but still not a convincing figure. The lack of support from the BBC when it broadcasts sponsored events is a particular cause for concern. Arts' sponsorship remains a self-contained industry. In spending terms, it might be only a fifth the size of sports' sponsorship, but it is growing more rapidly because it offers sponsors an affluent, opinion-forming audience as well as the chance to be hospitable and feel a warm glow. It has attracted remarkably few parasites: there are still only five established consultancies - Kallaway, Crowcroft, Spero, Anthony Fawcett, and Arts and Industry - on hand to offer clients advice and organisational skills. They have been joined by ABSA, which is adding a commercial consultancy service to its successful lobbying role. Sponsorship will struggle to grow in 1994 as long-term commitments come to an end and are not renewed. (Few think a sponsorship should last forever). But its blend of altruism and commercial advantage are getting known better  -and appreciated - and there are still thousands of potential corporate sponsors in the wings. Perhaps the most encouraging feature of the industry's development is that the fears of the more puritanical arts administrators - that sponsors would interfere with artistic choice, or encourage presentation of the bland and the commercial - have not come true. In the main, sponsors feel it is a privilege to be associated with the arts, although harder times are forcing them to assert their financial muscle. That means the arts can expect more searching assessments from their sponsors.</p>

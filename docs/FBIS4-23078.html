			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Prikhodko, deputy science director of </F> Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of Molecular  Electronics and the ``Mikron'' Plant, Anatoliy Skvirya, director  of ``Silikon'' Scientific Production Enterprise, and Aleksandr  Sokolov, vice president of ``Sikikon'' by Nataliya Lazareva,  DELOVOY MIR correspondent; place and date not given:  ``Micro-electronics--A Spark of Hope'']    [Text] Many people are now concerned about the situation at  industrial micro-electronics enterprises, among other places at  plants and scientific research institutes of Zelenograd  (Russia's ``Silicon Valley''). It is here that a host of  problems have arisen associated with defense conversion,  high-tech advances, development of a market for  information-related products, and of course, these problems are  becoming especially acute in connection with the privatization  of these businesses. It seems that enterprises of this kind are  tottering on the edge of extinction due to the comparatively  intense influx of Western information technology into Russia and  bordering nations, which is quite natural, given that we are so  dreadfully far behind in this area. Bankruptcy, outside leasing,  or sale of premises and hands to foreign companies--is this the  end?    Our correspondent Nataliya Lazareva talks with the deputy  science director of Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of  Molecular Electronics and the ``Mikron'' Plant, Pavel Prikhodko.  Also taking part in the discussion were representatives of the  small scientific production enterprise ``Silikon'': its director  Anatoliy Skvirya and vice president Aleksandr Sokolov.    [Prikhodko] Heretofore, most of the output of  our enterprise was produced for the defense industry. Today this  is no longer a secret. Nor is it a secret that our economic  situation and development has been stable and secure: state  orders, government support, priority funding. We have developed  in conformity with long-term ideas and plans. In the period of  1984-1985, in my opinion, we were minimally behind the world  level of the electronics industry, probably only about 3-4  years. We were being used by as many as 18 Soviet ministries:  ultrapure materials, electronic equipment and precision machine  tools, nonferrous metals, chemistry. Everything was clear and  comprehensible for people, and salary was guaranteed. Moreover,  the standard of living in Zelenograd was much better than that  in other regions of the country. We could pick the best college  graduates for our plants and institutes, engineers and workers  were in competition for jobs.    [Lazareva]And was everything really so tranquil?    [Prikhodko] In reality, not at all. The main  creeping danger was that people who had a comparatively high  wage for those times were making no effort to improve quality  and increase productivity of their labor.    [Lazareva]Indeed, that was no small danger for  this kind of production. And when did the situation change  drastically?    [Prikhodko]Our main troubles started in 1991.  There was a dramatic reduction of state orders and budget  funding, the Soviet-wide division of labor disappeared, and we  were left without suppliers. Figuratively speaking, we were in a  potential well. The simplest thing to do in such a situation is  to let the buildings be used for commercial warehouses, and  start making knickknacks, but that is not what was done. It  ought to be mentioned that a microelectronics enterprise can't  be shut down, something like an open-hearth furnace:  purification of water and air, preparation of energy carriers,  everything has to operate continuously. Besides, we knew that if  people were laid off for very long without pay, we would not get  them back. Therefore, simultaneously with curtailment of our  usual production, we began to retool and set our sights on  conquering our sectors on the international market.    [Lazareva]That was tough for sure; there  wouldn't be many outside our country who could believe that we  were in any condition to compete on the world level in  microelectronics.    [Prikhodko] That's right. We were hard put to  find foreign partners. A lot of times we took part in several  delegations in a day. At first we were unable to make contacts;  at that time we didn't have a handle on the way things were  done. But it was explained to us by a representative of a  Japanese company that according to their lights it is considered  normal to make a little headway in one out of 200 talks. We had  our first success with representatives of the Samsung Company.  We agreed to produce on franchise a small clock chip for sale on  their market. This is where the switch began from the Soviet to  the Western style of production. We were well aware that this  switch would take enormous capital investments: a different  production structure would have to be set up. And incidentally,  it cannot be said that this would have been beyond our reach.  The level of production and quality control at our plants was  still the highest in the nation: items went directly to outfit  special facilities and space vehicles. In 1991, we experienced  some decline in facilities for production development. In 1992,  they began to arrive, and were mainly put to use in elevating  the technical level of production. Samsung was followed by  agreements with companies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some  European companies. Now more than 40% of the volume of our  production output is exported by agreements. For businesses like  ours, there has been a sharp decline in the number of previously  planned state defense orders. We need a lot of money to acquire  new equipment operating on the level of the latest technologies.  Construction has now started on two new shops for producing LSI  chips with micron design standards. A conglomerate of state  structures is investing money in construction of one of these,  and the ``Korona'' Joint Enterprise that operates in contact  with a Hong Kong company is investing in construction of the  other shop.    [Lazareva]And what have been the results?    [Prikhodko]The Russian production line is now in  its third year of construction. The production cycle is totally  dependent on the dynamics of incoming budgetary finances.  ``Korona'' has promised to complete construction in 20 months.  Right now, 49 percent of the investment in this enterprise is  foreign, and 51 percent is ours. We, of course, will have the  controlling block of shares.    [Lazareva]But you can see that this is not a  very productive way. The production manager is engaged in lots  of talks, looking for partners... the next thing to hustling.    [Skvirya] We realized long ago that a new  approach is needed here. And we are best suited for it: a small  mobile enterprise where scientists work together who have a lot  of contacts in their fields throughout the world. We know the  directions of promising research, the interests of partners, and  a host of foreign companies where talks will lead to the desired  outcome. Many Western specialists and managers prefer to deal  first with a small non-governmental company. So it is just this  scientific-technical ``pimping'' that we are taking as one of  the areas of our operations. It is convenient, effective, and  mobile. On the other hand, we are the very ones who are  concerned about Zelenograd enterprises. After all, they are like  our children. ``Silikon'' originated at one time in the bowels  of the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology. Graduates of  that institute are now working in the research institutes and  plants of Zelenograd. Even Pavel Prikhodko and the director of  ``Mikron,'' Gennadiy Krasnikov, are former MIET students. So our  specialists are well aware of the industry in Zelenograd, its  needs and specifics.    [Lazareva]And who else is ``Mikron'' involved  with?    [Prikhodko] The mainland Chinese are very much  interested in our technical advances. They are now marshalling  considerable efforts and state funds for development in  microelectronics; but Western franchises are too expensive, and  therefore they are giving a lot of attention to markets of  Russian microelectronic technologies. Contacts with the People's  Republic of China may be quite profitable. I have been in China,  and have had a lot of talks with their managers. Although it is  well known that they are the oldest traders in the world, many  of them are seriously studying marketing in Japan. Talks with  representatives of Chinese companies always necessitate  carefully reasoned strategy and tactics, bordering on art.  Within the scope of this cooperation, we are also hoping to  penetrate into the remaining markets of China and other  Southeast Asian nations. You know, to all appearances, Western  European nations are in no hurry to deal with us. And the  situation with the U.S. is even more ambiguous. It looks like  things are getting easier with regard to KOKOM organizations,  but in connection with defense conversion--and they are involved  in that, too--there are now already about 65,000 unemployed in  their ``Silicon Valley''. So it is unlikely that there would be  any profit from selling them franchises to the Russian market.    [Sokolov] According to some information,  recently ``Silicon Valley'' companies that have been trying to  establish relations with Russian businesses are having a tough  time, and even being fined. But on the other hand, they won't be  able to get by without contacts with Russia. The  microelectronics industry is really quite hazardous. The U.S. is  desperate to get it out of their country. Up until now, they  have got by on contacts with Southeast Asian nations. And they  are extending these contacts to us, as well--labor is cheap  here, too. We would rise up against ecologically unsafe  production, but that would put an end to our hopes for the  future. Russia has to go through the stage of production by  franchises, working to some extent for the Western market. In  doing so, we must not fail to give some thought to the ones with  whom we make contact. It would not be in our best interests to  acquire technologies that are outdated (for them), going nowhere  from the engineering standpoint, and ecologically dirty; and so  far, that is what we are being offered. We have to look for the  most promising franchises: comparatively new, competitive, and  with opportunities for further independent development. This is  the direction that our company is trying to take.    [Lazareva] But by your own words, the  implication is that this is scarcely possible under present  conditions.    [Sokolov]The main thing is to understand with  whom we can deal. For example, we have been well aware that  specialists of the well known U.S. company ``Sun Microsystems''  are working with Russian scientists, with the Moscow center of  SPARC technologies, and with the largest Russian developer of  supercomputers, Associate Member of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Boris Babayan. We have understood that these are the  contacts that are needed. We have not procrastinated in starting  talks, and have achieved some promising results. ``Sun'' has  offered a franchise to ``Mikron'' for producing microprocessors  by the most progressive SPARC technology.    [Lazareva]SPARC is a homonym of ``spark''. So is  the franchise from ``Sun'' a spark of hope?    [Sokolov]To some extent, yes. The fact is that  ``Sun'' takes pride in its open technical policy. And that  policy includes the opportunity, if that is the right word, of  further creative development of their circuits. We have  purchased not just a technology, but also data about the  theoretical principles of production of the chip, mathematical  groundwork, and architecture. On this basis, we have acquired  access to international standards. And thanks to the  considerable experience of scientists in our nation, we will be  able to use the acquired technology as a springboard, or to put  it in a better way, to skip over several steps and create our  own Russian devices that are modifications of U.S. chips meeting  specifications on the world level. There are companies in Russia  that are ready to use these chips. It has been suggested that we  use them for Russian workstations based on powerful personal  computers. Design problems are being studied by Vladimir  Betelin, director of NIISI [not further identified] of the  Russian Academy of Sciences. In future he is hoping to arrange  for industrial production. To carry out this project, monetary  credits are being requested through the line of the Russian  Academy of Sciences. The same source will allocate the necessary  funds for ``Mikron'' to acquire a franchise for the chip.    [Lazareva]But are you sure that you will be able  to carry out such ambitious plans just now?    [Prikhodko] Thanks to maintaining our potential  for this period, we have not yet run out of energy. We are now  starting to carry out large-scale international programs. The  first is tied up with the ``Sun'' franchise. The second novel  technology that we have developed is ultrathin silicon films on  an insulator. This is called the SIMON process. A Russian- U.S.  joint enterprise has already been set up. The money is being  contributed by the U.S. side and some Russian businesses and  organizations. Billions of rubles are needed for this promising  technology. Our minister of science Boris Saltykov is very  interested in this project. His technological fund is now ready  to invest the necessary money in the SIMON process. To have the  capability of carrying out the most flexible technical and  economic policy, as well as to establish the closest working  contacts with the world microelectronics community, our plant  and his research institute have now set up a joint-stock company  of open type. We feel that this is the most convenient form of  privatizing a large state enterprise.    [Lazareva] Well, have you lost any of your  essential personnel?    [Prikhodko] Of course, small businesses have  taken away a lot of my specialists, and incidentally the best of  them. One expects this. It is the educated, inventive,  linguistically talented people with a feel for technology who  can confidently count on independent success in small business.  And many have been successful, but unfortunately are losing the  qualifications necessary for our work. Right now in our  association the average pay scale is 62,000. And the salary  reaches something like 120 in a bread-baking plant, and even  more in some small enterprises. Naturally, some are leaving for  commercial structures, especially banks. We are also aware that  the most successful of those who have left us for free  enterprise are trying to get the greatest number of our shares  when they are auctioned off. It is natural that in this  situation we look out for the interests of our team of  scientists and workers, so that they will be able to make  continued use of the potential in microelectronics that they  have created.    Let us hope that the controlling block of shares will go to  people with clarity of purpose who have staked a lot and know  what is worth attaining by their investment. And in the given  case, the only thing worth attaining is getting the Russian  microelectronics industry properly into the world distribution  of labor, and making a profit.</p>

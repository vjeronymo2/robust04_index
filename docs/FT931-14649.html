			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: A neurotic soul goes on holiday IMPOSSIBLE VACATION by Spalding Gray Picador Pounds 14.99, 228 pages BROKEN VESSELS by Andre Dubus Picador Pounds 15.99, 195 pages BREWSTER North, the angst-ridden narrator of Spalding Gray's memorable first novel, suffers from a dire complaint - he just can't enjoy his holidays. The moment he arrives in India or Las Vegas or Amsterdam, he finds himself wondering if some other destination might not be more suited for his psychic well-being. To make matters worse, he has serious doubts about whether or not he has enough of a life to leave behind. As a result, he is forever undertaking arduous journeys that somehow land him, unfulfilled, on his own darkened doorstep. Gray is best known for his remarkable film Swimming to Cambodia, a monologue account of his quest for a 'perfect moment' in Thailand. Impossible Vacation presents a similar pilgrimage. It opens with young North visiting the beach with his disturbed mother, who soon travels to that great Butlins in the sky via a fume-filled garage. All is idyllic until an uncle returns from the South Pacific, filling boy Brewster's head with postcards of paradise that haunt him for the rest of his life. Thus begins his tortured progress from experimental theatre in New York to experimental sex in Amsterdam, from an ashram in Poona to a prison in Las Vegas. It is only when he descends into the Grand Canyon that Brewster is able to achieve some sort of peace, to pass through the Nothing to Declare chute of his own soul. Gray's book is funny, full of insight and often quite bold, especially in its sexual sequences, which include Brewster's ill-starred career as a porno film actor and his affair with a woman with a penchant for pig masks. Spanning the 1950s to the present, it provides a consistently ironic view of a generation's failed attempt to track down paradise. But, as anyone familiar with Gray's work will know, what really distinguishes the book is its voice - mordant, obsessive, working overtime. It is the voice of neurotic America, of the soul that arrives in Eden only to wonder what's the next stop on the itinerary. Another distinctly American voice can be found in Broken Vessels, a collection of non-fiction by one of that country's most under-rated short story writers. Like his fellow realists Carver, Ford and Wolff, Andre Dubus is a grunt in the army of American literature, working his way slowly yet relentlessly through the battlefield debris of his nation's daily life. His non-fiction bears the same virtues as his stories - resolute honesty, detailed perception, effortless prose. The book's first essays are the most accomplished, particularly 'Under the Lights', which depicts Dubus's boyhood job of chasing foul balls for his local, woebegone baseball team. There is also a memorable account of a cross-country train ride, as well as a shocking brush with America's constipated legal system. These essays are followed by examinations of the pitfalls of a career as a short story writer, the book's weakest section, that should appeal mostly to fellow authors. The last group of essays deals with what is no doubt the meat of the book - the horrific injuries Dubus suffered in a 1986 car crash, leaving him confined to a wheelchair. Dubus writes about his plight with unblinking honesty, whether it be the effect of his paralysis on his young marriage or the terror of watching helplessly as his one- year-old daughter severs her finger. The ex-Marine even finds it hard to stand up to a lout in a theatre, not out of fear but rather because 'if you confront a man from a wheelchair you're bullying him. Only a coward would hit a man in a chair.' Fiction writers such as Dubus are often judged by their ability to cast a cold eye on imagined tragedy. It is a testimony to Dubus's skill and integrity that he is able to bring this dispassionate vision to bear on a very real, very personal crisis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- Science and Technology  Agency Director General Satsuki Eda, head of the minor United  Social Democratic Party (USDP), said Saturday [29 January] he  and USDP Secretary General Shogo Abe will join the parliamentary  alliance of Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Japan New Party (JNP).    Eda and Abe said they will join the Sakigake-JNP group in  the  next regular Diet session due to open Monday. The two men  expressed their intentions in a meeting of legislators belonging  to the parliamentary group.    To pursue the new political alliance, Eda and Abe on  Saturday  left a parliamentary group comprised of members of the USDP and  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the leading component in the  ruling coalition.    The USDP, formed in March 1978 after bolting from the SDP,  holds four seats in the powerful House of Representatives.  Another USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already joined  the Sakigake-JNP.    Yanosuke Narazaki, the other lower house legislator, is  expected to remain in the SDP-USDP group to maintain ties  between the two parties. Hideo Den, the USDP's only upper house  member, left the party Monday.    The USDP joined six other parties last August to form the  coalition government, ousting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  from a 38-year grip on power.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, meanwhile, said Saturday  that his own JNP will not merge with Sakigake in the next  regular Diet session as initially envisioned.    Hosokawa said in a news conference after Diet approval of  the  government's political reform package that there would not be  any problem if the two parties do not rush to get together. A  top official of Sakigake, headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, also denied the possibility of the two  parties' early merger.</p>

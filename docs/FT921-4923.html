			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Hong Kong budget upsets Beijing THE Chinese government yesterday turned up the heat on Britain's colonial rulers of Hong Kong when a senior official objected to the government's budget presented on Wednesday. Mr Lu Ping, director of Beijing's Office of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, said in Guangzhou (Canton) yesterday that Mr Hamish MacLeod's budget violated a stipulation in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, that government spending should be kept within the limits of the revenue it raised. He said it appeared as if the Hong Kong government had first determined its expenditure needs and then sought ways of finding the revenue to fund itself. Although Mr Lu's comments had a familiar ring, a Hong Kong government spokesman said he found Mr Lu's statements 'strange.' The budget had been planned along normal lines and kept to the colony's policy of not allowing the growth in expenditure to exceed the growth rate of the economy. He further stated that the budget was not in conflict with the Basic Law and that even if it were it was of no concern of the Chinese government. The Basic Law was a constitution which came into effect after the Chinese government resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong, and not before, he said. But Mr Lu's intervention is of a piece with Beijing's attempts, since the signing of the airport agreement last September, to gain greater influence over decision making in the colony before it is handed over to China in 1997. In the airport agreement Britain formally recognised China's right to be consulted over policies which straddle June 1997. Since then the Chinese government has attempted to further its involvement in the colony's affairs, notably through the creation of a 40-strong 'consultative' group of local worthies to advise it on Hong Kong matters. China has also objected to the 'corporatisation' of Radio and Television Hongkong, the semi-official broadcaster in the colony.</p>

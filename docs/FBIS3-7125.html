If we are not popular as a result of  that, it is just a consequence. Whatever action we take is not  meant to make us popular.    The bottomline is that it's a plus for us...    But we don't go round on the basis of counting pluses and  minuses. From my assessment, more people appreciated and  approved of our actions than disapproved.    On the impact of such an approach on neighbours and  friends:    [Badawi] We cannot pursue a policy purely on the basis of  what our friends want us to do. As an independent and sovereign  nation, we have the right to voice our views in any  international forum and we have expressed them loud and clear.  But we do not do it on the basis of wanting to compete with  others.    We are also very responsive to suggestions from other  leaders. We have never held back our support for any good idea  that came from anybody...    On Malaysia being the odd-man-out in ASEAN over the  future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], a 17-member  grouping:    [Badawi] I don't think so. If I understand (Indonesian  Foreign Minister) Ali Alatas, I don't think Indonesia is ready  for a more formal structure. I have been assured that Singapore  too does not want anything big.    If we are not careful, the development of APEC could lead to  the diminution of sub-regional cooperation. That's why Malaysia  has been speaking up -- because we want to make sure that ASEAN  is not swallowed. We do not want ASEAN to lose its identity and  its effectiveness.    We have taken a pro-ASEAN position. We want to preserve and  promote ASEAN because we value ASEAN cooperation which has  proven verv successful.    We do not reject APEC. We will participate in its meeting  and we will implement whatever projects we are involved in. But  we do not believe APEC should be structured with a big  secretariat like a mini-United Nations.    On the attendance of Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar  Ibrahim at the APEC finance ministers meeting this week, and Dr.  Mahathir's likely presence at the Jakarta APEC summit later this  year:    [Badawi] We have been assured that it is (the finance  ministers meeting) going to be a one-off meeting, not an annual  affair. That's why Datuk Anwar went in his capacity as finance  minister, not as the deputy premier.    Dr. Mahathir is also likely to go to Jakarta. Whatever  happens after that, we don't know.    My fear is that the APEC summit might be an annual event. I  think there will be many countries anxious to hold this kind of  gathering. But our position remains unchanged.    In ASEAN, we respect our differences over this issue. It has  not divided us yet and there's still continuing cooperation. On  some pressing issues, we can still reach consensus.    But we are actually worried of what may happen in the  future.    On reports that American officials are urging Japanese  and Koreans privately not to join the EAEC [East Asian Economic  Caucus] despite the Clinton administration dropping its  opposition to the caucus which excludes the United States:    [Badawi] I don't want to use harsh words such as hypocrisy.  But this is the kind of double-game diplomacy that we don't  want. One plays at the net, the other lobbying from the  backline.    I will go by what Warren Christopher said in Singapore in  his  official capacity not as a private person.    (During the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference in Singapore  last July, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared  that "the United States now views the development of the EAEC  with interest and without hostility, and hopes that the EAEC  would enhance a more open trading system".)    It was not an off-the-cuff remark he made in some corner of  the world in response to a reporter's question. So we have to  hold on to his words.    We hope that the first meeting of EAEC at an appropriate  level can be held by the end of this year.    On the repercussions of the current row with Britain  which began after the London SUNDAY TIMES newspaper began  implying that Malaysian government leaders, including Dr.  Mahathir, were corrupt:    [Badawi] We are monitoring it very closely. At the moment,  nothing adverse yet.    On our part, we have no fear in dealing with any government  which speaks on what it believes in. I don't think other  countries have any problem with us. It's a not a minus point  for Malaysia to stand up for its beliefs. After all, we are not  tearing up any contract that has been signed.    Every issue will be resolved eventually. I am in no position  to predict when this can happen. See what happened with  Australia. All the noises and then it all ended amicably.    Neither Malaysia nor Britain wants to do anything to worsen  the situation.  On his first official visit to Singapore from tomorrow and  bilateral relations:    [Badawi] Well, we are so close, we don't normally make state  visits. I don't think [former prime minister] Tun Razak or Tun  Hussein made any official visit to Singapore. Likewise, Lee  Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong too have never made an official visit  to Malaysia.    As to my trip, it is like dropping into a neighbour's semi-  detached house for tea. I have been going in and out and  passing through all the time, so Kan Seng (former Singapore  Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng, who is now in Home Affairs)  suggested that I drop in for a chat.    There isn't anything intimidating about the visit. I am not  going to talk about the dispute over Pulau Batu Putih (Pedra  Branca).    The meeting of officials to resolve it has been going on.  They have their own schedule. I am not going to interfere.    As to other problems, I can't think of any.</p>

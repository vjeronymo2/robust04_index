			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Data transmission deal A consortium including RWE, the utility, and Deutsche Bank yesterday won the contract to operate a data transmission network in Germany, a market worth DM2bn (Pounds 800m) annually. The contract marks another step towards the deregulation of telecommunications in Germany, a process due to be completed by 1998 following the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. The new company, called Gesellschaft fur Datenfunk (GfD), will compete against DeTeMobil, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, so far the only company to provide data transmission services. GfD said it would spend DM500m to build about 1,500 stations across Germany through which it would relay data on short wave to subscribers using portable computers and modems. Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post minister, said the RWE-led consortium was technically better than another bid led by Viag, the industrial conglomerate. Viag, one of Germany's 10 largest companies in sales terms, said it was 'somewhat surprised' to have lost the bid. Only days ago the group said it was confident of winning the contract, arguing that IBM - which had a 5 per cent stake in the consortium - had unrivalled experience in data transmission with Ardis, one of the world's largest networks which it built up in the US.</p>

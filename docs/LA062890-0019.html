			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NELSON MANDELA'S CONTROVERSIAL TIES TO ARAFAT, KADAFI AND CASTRO  </P> <P> Mandela is quoted as defending his friendship with Arafat, Libya's Moammar  Kadafi and Cuba's Fidel Castro by saying: "There is no reason whatsoever that  we should have reservations about their attitude toward human rights in their  own country -- we have no time to look into the internal affairs of another  country" (Part A, June 22).  </P> <P> In that case, why does he expect the U.S. to do just that, and to impose  sanctions against the government of South Africa? I guess he would have  accepted support from Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin, Somoza and Duvalier.  </P> <P> G.R. TURGEON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 8 INJURED AS BUS SKIDS ON SLICK FREEWAY  </P> <P> A rash of morning fender benders accompanied early morning showers in San Diego  Sunday, including an Immigration and Naturalization Service bus which went out  of control and injured eight.  </P> <P> The bus, loaded with 60 illegal aliens being transported back to Mexico from  San Clemente, went out of control on Interstate 805 near San Ysidro Boulevard,  skidded into the center divider and then crossed over four southbound lanes of  the freeway before coming to rest on the shoulder of the road.  </P> <P> Eight persons, including the bus driver, William Real, 61, and another INS  officer, were taken to Chula Vista hospitals for treatment. None of the  injuries was major, a San Diego police spokesman said.  </P> <P> In another South San Diego accident, two San Diego police cars were damaged  when a truck stopped in front of them at Virginia Avenue and East San Ysidro  Boulevard. One of the police cars struck the rear of the other, pushing that  vehicle into the rear of the truck. No one was reported injured in the  accident, police reported.  </P> <P> A California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said that dozens of minor accidents  were reported during the morning rain around San Diego County, but no major  injuries or accidents occurred. She said that the accident rate was normal for  a rainy day because the pavement becomes slick when the accumulated oil on the  roadways is brought to the surface by the rain.  </P> <P> Scattered showers brought .40 of an inch of rainfall to Julian, .27 to Ramona  and .22 to Alpine. Coastal areas reported .10 of an inch or less.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service forecast is for continued breezy, cloudy and cool  weather with a 30% to 40% chance of showers today.  </P></p>

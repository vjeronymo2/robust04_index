			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed. -- ASEAN members will apply the  same standards to minimise air and water pollution by the year  2010.    Science, Technology, and Environment Minister Datuk Law  Hieng  Ding said today the commitment was made at the sixth ASEAN  ministerial meeting on the environment under the Bandar Seri  Begawan Resolution on Environment and Development. The two-day  meeting in Brunei ended yesterday.    Describing it as a major breakthrough, he said applying the  same environmental standards would ensure efforts to contain  water and air pollution were harmonised in the region.    ASEAN members have targeted that by the year 2010, the  pollutant standards index (PSI) for air quality should be below  100 PSI, while for river water, the PH (acidity) should be  between six and 8.5. The other water quality parameters include  dissolved oxygen of 2 mg/1 or more and total suspended solids  (TSS) of 200 mg/1 or less.    Further to this, he said 1995 had been declared ASEAN  Environment Year where each member country would highlight  specific events to commemorate the occasion.    Besides official meetings, ASEAN members would hold informal  discussions on the environment from time to time. Malaysia will  take the lead by holding the first informal meeting at the end  this year.    Law said ASEAN members had agreed to strengthen regional  cooperation in the monitoring of transboundary movement of toxic  wastes. This was in line with the Basel Convention members'  agreement on the immediate export ban of toxic waste from  industrialised to developing nations    "At the meeting, we pledged to actively implement actions as  outlined in Agenda 21 and promote th principles contained in the  1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.    "Under our ASEAN Strategic Plan of Action on the Environment  for 1994 to 1998, we reached a consensus to harmonise policy  directions as well as to enhance operational and technical  cooperation.    "We also agreed to undertake joint action to address common  environmental problems," he told reporters after attending the  weekly cabinet meeting.    Law also said the concerted efforts by ASEAN ministers to  integrate environment and economic policies at regional level  was testimony that developing countries were sincere and  committed in achieving sustainable development.    "We need to guard ourselves against the developed countries  lest they accuse us of disregarding our environment in our  pursuit of development. They may resort to such tactics to  impose trade sanctions against us.    To push ASEAN in the forefront on environment, he added it  had been proposed that the ASEAN secretary general be  represented at the Commission on Sustainable Development (an  outcome of the 1992 earth summit) meeting in New York at the end  of next month.</p>

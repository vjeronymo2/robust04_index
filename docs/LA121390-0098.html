			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS;  </P> <P> MARTIN BREAKS FREE IN FOURTH QUARTER, RALLIES OCEAN VIEW  </P> <P> Guard Ryan Martin sparked a fourth-quarter rally that gave Ocean View High  School a 79-76 victory over Lakewood Wednesday night in the second round of the  Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> Martin scored 11 of his 20 points in the final quarter, including a three-point  shot with 1:23 remaining that pushed Ocean View ahead, 75-74. Forty-three  seconds later, Martin made a driving bank shot that increased the lead to  77-74.  </P> <P> Ocean View (5-1) fought an uphill battle in a physical game after missing its  first seven shots. The Seahawks didn't take their first lead until 6:37 left to  play when Martin scored on a layup for a 61-60 lead.  </P> <P> Martin had been contained for three quarters by Lakewood's Mike Fields. But  Fields wasn't a factor in the decisive fourth quarter.  </P> <P> When Lakewood Coach Tim Sweeney was asked why he took Fields off Martin in the  fourth quarter, the coach said, "Fields took himself off Martin, I didn't. He  stopped guarding him."  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Ocean View made all eight of its field-goal attempts and  10 of 13 free throws. Center Marcel TenBerge, who was double-teamed most of the  game, led all scorers with 28 points, making 11 of 20 shots.  </P> <P> Reserve forward Marc Sessions came off the bench to hit two three-point shots  for Ocean View and added 10 points. Afterward, Ocean View Coach Jim Harris  called the game "incredibly physical."  </P> <P> "We had to fight our way back, literally," Harris said. "This was a good win,  particularly after the position we put ourselves into to open the second half  (trailing, 41-30)."  </P> <P> In another quarterfinal:  </P> <P> Mater Dei 68, St. Monica 41 -- J.J. Ballesteros scored 15 points to lead Mater  Dei.  </P> <P> In consolation play:  </P> <P> Servite 67, Bosco Tech 35 -- The Friars (6-1) took a 7-0 lead and never looked  back, rebounding from a last-second loss in the first round. Forward Adam  Anderson scored 16 points in three quarters, making six of 10 shots and all  four of his free-throw attempts.  </P> <P> "I was anxious to see how we would react after a tough loss, and I thought we  played very hard defensively in the first half," said Richard Smith, Servite  coach.  </P> <P> Servite, which forced Bosco Tech (1-3) into 28 turnovers with a trapping press,  made 21 of 43 shots in three quarters before Smith emptied his bench.  </P> <P> Inglewood 101, Loara 81 -- Guard Tes Whitlock of Loara hit only 13 of 33 shots.  Whitlock did make five of six three-point shots in the fourth quarter to finish  with 41 points for the Saxons (2-3).  </P></p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme - The history of flowers on film THERE is almost no limit to the purposes for which photographers have pointed their cameras at the vegetable kingdom and clicked. Flora Photographica. Masterpieces of Flower Photography admirably belies what could sound a slightly fusty title - fusty if you have momentarily forgotten such ripe masterpieces of kitsch as Bert Stern's portrait of Marilyn Monroe clasping huge roses to her naked breasts. An Arts Council touring exhibition, Flora Photographica is at the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington until 20 September. What we find is some 100 photographs which add up to a survey of the uses of flowers in photography, from the pioneers of the last century until the present day. It includes pictures by many of the best known names of photography, ancient and modern, from Fox Talbot, Robert Fenton, and Julia Margaret Cameron, to Cecil Beaton, Andre Kertesz, Edward Steichen, and Robert Mapplethorpe. The exhibition is divided loosely according to the different types of flower photography. It shows how photography became part of the tools of the botanist, though not without early opposition from the botanical illustrators, alarmed at the prospect of this devilish invention elbowing its way on to their patch. Nonetheless, botanists soon added cameras to their exploration kit. One of the funniest photographs in the show is an unknown botanist's record of an extraordinary plant in Sumatra, towering some 10 ft tall and descriptively named Amorphophallus Brooksii. Many photographers took up the challenge of emulating the achievements of the immortal Pierre-Joseph Redoubte and the great Dutch floral artists. In black-and-white, the effect was obviously rather odd. Texture was hard to convey, so that peaches in Robert Fenton's late studies, could resemble bread-rolls or suede. However, there are also many lovely studies such as those by the Alinari Studios. Nor was photography less able to capture the kinds of association which the Dutch masters achieved. Edward Steichen's studio arrangement of roses, caught at the moment when they start to exhale the aura of decay, conveys the foreboding of a Frenchman in 1914. Death, oblivion, virginity, fragility, fruitfulness, and vice. . . The associations of flowers are wonderfully rich, and as this fascinating exhibition shows, over the past 150 years photographers have crossed the same ground over and over again, exploring what the Victorian founding fathers of their craft called the language of flowers. For a still more extensive survey, you need the elegant book by the originator of the exhibition, William A. Ewing, Flora Photographica, Thames and Hudson, 223pp. Pounds 25. Flora Photographica is sponsored by BT. It will move to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh (3 October-22 November), then to Manchester (28 November-17 January) and Coventry (23 January-7 March)</p>

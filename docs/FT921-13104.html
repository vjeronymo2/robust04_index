			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Fischer sells 31% stake to Japanese FISCHER Gesellschaft, the family-owned Austrian sporting goods company, is selling a 31 per cent equity stake in the company to its two Japanese importers for Sch150m (Dollars 13.38m). Kanematsu, the trading company, and Goldwin, the sportswear maker, are each acquiring 15.19 per cent of Fischer, while Kanematsu's German subsidiary is acquiring 0.62 per cent. The acquisition continues a trend of Japanese companies buying into famous European brand names. Fischer is the world's third largest maker of Alpine skis and the largest supplier of cross country skis. Kanematsu said the Fischer family, which owns the company, approached the Japanese importers in search of an equity partner which could inject capital to expand the business. Kanematsu has been the import agent for for 27 years, and said the equity link would lead to closer ties between the two companies that would promote a more stable supply relationship and strengthen sales. Fischer has 920 employees and is expected to achieve sales of Sch780,000 in the year to the end of February. It produces about 845,000 sets of skis a year and 200,000 tennis rackets. Kanematsu and Goldwin import about Y4.5bn (Dollars 36m) a year of Fischer equipment. The total Japanese market for ski gear is about Y250bn a year, 40 per cent of which is clothing. The market is growing by about 10 per cent a year.</p>

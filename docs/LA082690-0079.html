			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> THE FESTIVAL AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Los Angeles Festival 1990 grew out of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival and its  1987 successor, a not-for-profit event requiring three years of planning and  the joint efforts of artists, communities and corporations.  </P> <P> More than 1,400 participants from 21 countries are scheduled in 230 events at  70 venues throughout Southern California, including 800 artists from the L.A.  area.  </P> <P> In many ways, Festival '90 is unlike either of its two predecessors: It focuses  on art and cultures that rim the Pacific: Asia, Latin America and Oceania.  </P> <P> </P> <P> This Issue  </P> <P> Film, stage, music, dance, family attractions and visual arts are spotlighted  in this issue.  </P> <P> A schedule of programs from Friday's five performances and Saturday's  multi-site Opening Day ceremonies to the finale on Sept. 17 runs on the borders  of the pages.  </P> <P> A map to locate festival sites is on Page 12; a schedule of Open Festival  events today through Tuesday begins on Page 16 and a list of visual art  exhibits begins on Page 20.  </P> <P> The Open Festival, an adjunct to the curated festival, offers even more variety  than its predominantly international counterpart, with 600 events at 400 sites  by 740 artists.  </P> <P> For recorded information on festival events, call (213) 688-ARTS; for ticket  information: (213) 623-7400.  </P> <P> Editor: Gail S.

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Wanted: soap-opera star You have to shake your head to believe it. It is less than a year and a half since the last general election and some of us are already in a fuss about the next one. Technically speaking - and the Grim Reaper permitting - the government elected in April 1992 can sit there until 1997. Even if it follows recent precedent, it need not face the electorate before October 1996. That is three years away. Meanwhile there should be nothing to get excited about. The principal parties are currently led by two grey Johns and a puffed-up Paddy. Political discourse ought to be at a low ebb for, say, at least another 24 months. That it is not is partly the fault of our national appetite for the savouring of politicians' discomfiture. The British seem to take a particular, and perverse, pleasure in watching holders of high office self-destruct, even to the extent of helping the destruction along a little. Now the hunt is on for a new victim. The pack that brought down Mr David Mellor and Mr Norman Lamont, to name but two, is baring its teeth at the prime minister. After a blooding, the urge to kill is hard to repress. I have to confess that I rode out with the Lamont hunt once or thrice and found the experience exhilarating. The public seems to enjoy the sport as much as the mounted participants. This is one reason, although not the only one, why the Conservative conference in Blackpool the week after next will be about a single subject: can Mr John Major survive? Patience. Before that we will know the answer to the other great single-question conference of the season. When Labour meets in Brighton this weekend, the matter that will dominate the proceedings will be whether Mr John Smith wins a procedural vote next Wednesday morning. If he fails, local trade unions will continue to exert undue influence over the choice of candidates for parliamentary elections, at least until the issue is obliterated by Labour's national executive committee. The message would be that Mr Smith's leadership of the Labour party has been undermined by powerful trade union leaders. From that it is but a short step to 'can John Smith survive?' If he prevails, the selection of Labour candidates will be determined by a vote of registered members of the party. 'Smith', the headlines will inform us, 'triumphs'. That is the main plot-line. There is likely to be little else to grab the nation's attention in next week's instalment of Britain's soap-opera politics. Yet this ungripping yarn has already determined the shape of the conference. In preparing for it Mr Smith's managers have been faced with an awkward choice. If the candidacy vote had been scheduled for Monday, as was originally the case, rules and precedent would have prevented Mr Smith from speaking before the event. It is alleged that the vote is on a knife-edge, that it could go either way. If he lost on Monday, 'Smith humiliated' would have been the message for the rest of the week. The vote therefore moves to Wednesday morning. This gives the Labour leader his chance to make his big speech on Tuesday. In it he will devote all his Scottish moral passion to an onslaught on the Conservatives. Much good may it do him. He will also seek, without necessarily saying so, to cast himself as a moderniser when it comes to constitutional reform and a Labour radical on the economy. Echoing his speech to the Trades Union Congress a few weeks ago, he will argue for full employment (at least if part-time work is included), the minimum wage, and trade union recognition. His hope will be that some of his phrases get through, or at least enough of them to give the impression that his factionalised parliamentary party is united and that he is a leader with a sense of direction. We can be sure that it will be a stout effort. Mr Smith can then return to the platform on Wednesday morning to state the case for one-member-one-vote in candidacy elections. With luck, and last-minute scurries, he may even win. This plot-line has a fatal flaw. It lacks real drama. There is no possibility of blood on the carpet. There has been some debate among the Labour leader's advisers over whether he should say - on Tuesday or Wednesday, it makes no difference - something like 'I could not remain as leader of the party if candidate selection is not democratised' or, in headline form, 'back me or sack me, says Smith'. The argument against such a grandstand play, an argument that as I write still prevails, is that it would echo Mr Major's similar intimations over the Maastricht vote, and thus reveal Mr Smith to be as weak as some perceive the prime minister to be. It is a poor argument. What Labour needs is something that will blast away the image, held in southern voters' minds, of a collectivist party that represses individual aspirations, the representative of life in the co-op and on the council estate. As Mr Tony Blair says in the latest Fabian Review, the need is to stamp Labour as the party of 'new economic opportunity, not engaged in a battle for territory between private and public sector; as helping people out of welfare, not keeping them on it; of high-quality public services, not the defence of vested interests; of ensuring social action assists individual responsibility and is not substituted for it in areas like crime . . .' The way to get all that across (and there is more on Mr Blair's agenda) is to offer up Mr Smith as a potential sacrifice. We all know the danger of threatening to resign. You may have to. This would be sad for Mr Smith, but Labour without reform of its internal constitution is hardly worth leading. Mr Blair reminds us that the party faces the same task as left parties every-where, which is to adjust to a changing society, 'a question of dealing not simply with the flotsam and jetsam of individual policies or per-sonalities but with a tide of ideas'. Yes and no. When you face a TV-addicted electorate, personal melodrama is likely to be the most effective means of communicating a change in the tide of ideas. 'Smith lays his job on the line' followed by 'triumphs' would not in itself suffice, but it would start to shake voters' perceptions of the party. As Mr Blair says, looking two or three years ahead, Labour 'must fear nothing, except losing again'.</p>

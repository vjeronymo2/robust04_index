			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Today, official sources  reported that on Sunday [26 June], two Cuban citizens left the  Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana. Sixty-nine of a total  of 124 persons who jumped over the fence of the residence to  obtain political asylum on 28 May remain at the diplomatic  mission.    Since then, a total of 55 persons, among them several women  and children, have left the diplomatic mission, accepting the  guarantees offered by the Cuban authorities that they will not  be subject to legal proceedings for entering the embassy.    A week ago, the Cuban Government announced it will not  authorize the departure from the country of any Cuban who  forcibly enters a diplomatic mission. A total of 21 persons  remain at the German Embassy in Havana, while the eight  occupants of the Chilean Consulate General left the mission last  week.</p>

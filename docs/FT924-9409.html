			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar prices forecast to remain in doldrums THE SLUGGISH world sugar industry can expect only modest improvements in the decade to the year 2000, according to a report compiled by the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organisation and the International Sugar Organisation. In 1990 sugar overtook coffee to become the biggest soft commodity export earner for developing countries, accounting for USDollars 8.6bn. Taking the UN's growth rates for the 1990s as a baseline case, the report predicts growth in sugar consumption to average 1.76 per cent a year, reaching 128.3m tonnes in 2000, compared with 107.8m tonnes in 1990. Production is expected to be 1m tonnes below consumption. In contrast to the stagnation and decline of the 1980s, trade will expand by about 4m tonnes. But prices in 2000 will still be around 10 cents a lb in 1990 terms, after falling lower in the middle of the decade. However, the report warns that if world income growth falls below the UN's projected rate, 'the prospects for the remainder of the decade would be bleak'. In addition to growth prospects, developments in the sugar market will be heavily influenced by activity in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, the report suggests. World imports will be 26.8m tonnes in the year 2000 given 'stable' production in the former Soviet Union, but only 23.7m tonnes if the region were to achieve a 'high' production of 12.5m tonnes by then.

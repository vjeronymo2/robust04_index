			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / People: Davis succumbs to Aegis's carrot The media buying and planning group Aegis, holding company of the European-wide network of Carat companies, moved a step further on its steady rise back from the grave with the appointment of a new chief executive, who has a track record in managing some of the world's best-known and most successful brands. He is Crispin Davis, 45, whose most recent employer was United Distillers - where he took the controversial decision to reduce the strength of Gordon's gin. But he spent much of his working life - the years 1970-1990 - with Procter &amp; Gamble; he was offered the job following a Europe-wide head-hunt. Davis is taking over from Charles Hochman, 65, who, on retiring from the chief executive's role, will become non-executive deputy chairman until the end of 1995. Aegis has had a rocky two years since Peter Scott was ousted as chairman in July 1992. It suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 18m in 1993, including exceptional items of Pounds 40m, following (restated) losses of Pounds 11m the previous year; it staged a Pounds 61m refinancing package in October 1993. In April this year, Davis was reported to have received cash and non-cash benefits worth a total of Pounds 670,000 from Guinness, following his October 1993 resignation as regional managing director of the United Distillers spirits subsidiary and his consequent departure from the main board of Guinness. It is believed that Davis's abrupt departure from Guinness followed a clash over marketing strategy with chief executive Tony Greener. Until that clash, observers had regarded Davis as being groomed to take on the top executive job. Running Aegis will give Davis plenty of scope to realise fully his own views on marketing. Davis left Procter &amp; Gamble in 1990, where he started life as an assistant brand manager. By 1978 he was marketing director of P&amp;G's UK operations, responsible for such matters as establishing the Pampers brand of disposable nappy as market leader. At P&amp;G Davis rose to become vice president in charge of the US foods businesses. He takes over at Aegis on October 15.</p>

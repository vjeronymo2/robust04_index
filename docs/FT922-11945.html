			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Assad seeks to retrieve Arab dignity PRESIDENT Hafez al-Assad of Syria rarely strays far from his Damascus citadel and is not an enthusiastic traveller. His tour of all six Gulf Co-operation Council states this week was a measure therefore of his apparent determination to assert leadership in dealing with the latest crisis to befall the Arabs. While initial reports suggested that Mr Assad was seeking to bolster Arab support for Libya in its confrontation with the west, it seems that the wily Syrian leader had a much broader purpose. A western official in Damascus observed yesterday that Mr Assad's mission to the Gulf was designed to deliver a message to his brother Arabs that Arab dignity was being demeaned by the west's handling of the Libyan crisis, and that only by presenting a united front would the Arabs salvage credit for their future dealings with powerful western states. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syria has been obliged reluctantly to accommodate itself to a so-called new world order and the reality of US predominance in the Middle East, but Mr Assad is likely to have argued in his talks with Gulf rulers that Arab solidarity was the best response to western pressures. In Cairo, where Mr Assad's tour of Gulf capitals is being observed with more than passing interest, an Egyptian foreign ministry official said the Syrian president's aim was to 'rally support' to try to ensure that the Arab consensus as embodied in the resolutions of the Arab League would be respected by the international community. The Syrian leader is certain to have argued, with his eyes firmly on the peace process, that Arab weakness and disarray was not a sound basis from which to engage in delicate Arab-Israel negotiations. Damascus, which has shunned multilateral talks involving Israel and the Arabs including Gulf states, believes that simply by engaging in such talks Arab states were handing Israel a diplomatic windfall without gaining anything in return, since the Israeli government has given no sign it might trade land for peace in bilateral negotiations with its neighbours. Mr Assad's other goal, according to officials in Damascus, was to remind Gulf rulers of their commitment to the Damascus Declaration signed in March, 1991 a few days after the end of the Gulf war. The Gulf states plus Egypt and Syria agreed to co-operate in defence and other fields, but implementation of the agreement has been stalled by Gulf hesitancy on the issue of the stationing of Egypt and Syrian troops in the region to ensure regional security. Syria was extremely disappointed when a meeting of the Damascus Declaration group scheduled for last month in Qatar was postponed until May. Interestingly, Egypt has also been expressing frustration over delays. Its foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, said yesterday: 'Egypt, which refuses any amendments to the defence agreement, feels that the accord will become extinct if it is not immediately implemented.'</p>

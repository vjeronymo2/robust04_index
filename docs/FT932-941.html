			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nomura takes a long-term view of chaos - The head of Japan's leading broker puts things into perspective JAPAN'S political turmoil may be sending shivers through the financial markets, but Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura Securities, prefers to view events as a historian rather than as a leading, world-scale stockbroker. He puts the chaos into a longer-term perspective, making it appear less threatening and more logical. According to Mr Sakamaki, political upheaval is a natural result of changes in the country's character, and a part of the necessary demolition of reassuring myths that had seemed to be permanent pillars of Japanese society. 'We have the high-growth myth, the myth of endless trust between the US and Japan, full employment, and the myth that land and stock prices will always rise. The other myth is that the Liberal Democratic Party will always remain in power,' he says. 'It will be better for the country to go through this change.' The corporate rush to China also prompts a few steps backward by Mr Sakamaki, who was appointed president of Nomura two years ago after a spate of securities industry scandals. In describing business opportunities in Asia, he wants to make clear that Nomura has not suddenly discovered Chinese economic reform and does not presume that the profits will come thick and fast. 'We opened a representative office in Beijing 11 years ago. We have been involved in underwriting samurai bond issues for institutions like the Bank of China,' he said. 'You need a long-term perspective. Over a decade or two decades you can build a human network - that is how you do business in that country.' In May, Nomura transferred the control of Asian regional business from Tokyo to Hong Kong, and while trimming staff in other areas, the broker increased Asia department employees from 580 to 616 over the past year. The company is also involved in an 'intelligent' office building in Beijing and a hotel in Shanghai, which Mr Sakamaki benevolently described as returning a favour to China. But the long-term vision has limits, and Nomura cannot obviously afford the investment indulgences of the late 1980s. Its net profit tumbled by almost 90 per cent last year. The other three big brokers, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities, reported net losses while results were worse still among small brokerages, which suffered a serious bruising from the fall in stock prices and turnover. Nomura cut its graduate intake from 1,002 to 606 recruits this year, while computer-related spending has fallen from Y44.8bn in the year ended March 1991 to Y18bn (Dollars 165m) in the year ended last March. Another sign of trimming is the closure of 12 of 18 securities boutiques opened in department stores and railway stations. 'It is easier to grow than to curtail something which has grown. Restructuring is a very difficult issue. For Japanese, since we do not have such experience, this will be a very painful thing indeed,' Mr Sakamaki said. He can take some credit for overcoming another phenomenon of the boom times, scandal, which undermined investor confidence in the brokers and propelled him to the top at Nomura. There were links between brokers and gangsters, alleged stock price manipulation, and the compensation of favoured corporate clients for investment losses. Mr Sakamaki had been executive vice-president, and was close to Mr Yoshihisa Tabuchi, 'Little Tabuchi,' the president, who was forced to resign in mid-1991, while 'Big Tabuchi,' Mr Setsuya Tabuchi, resigned as chairman. The departure of the two Tabuchis, who are not related, created a vacuum which Mr Sakamaki has gradually filled. The difficulties confronting the securities industry have prompted the finance ministry to slow deregulation, a decision applauded by Nomura. Mr Sakamaki argues that the industry is going through a 'correction phase' because of over-capacity, and banks should not rush into the already overcrowded securities business. Since April, Japanese brokers have been allowed to establish trust banking subsidiaries, while some banks can open securities subsidiaries able to issue convertible and warrant bonds, and to deal in straight bonds. Commissions on stock transactions of over Y1bn, accounting for just over 3 per cent of stock commissions, will be negotiable from next April, although the industry wants to keep fixed commissions for other transactions. In explaining the vulnerability of brokers, Mr Sakamaki emphasised that their problems were very different from those of banks, which are burdened by an accumulating pile of non-performing property loans made during the easy money era of the late 1980s. 'For the banking system, the problems have only been deferred, they have not been fundamentally resolved. But, for securities companies, the situation is different. We are in a market-orientated system, and if there are any large losses, they will be revealed - that's not something one can hide in one's books.'</p>

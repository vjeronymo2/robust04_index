			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Nigeria could be Africa's last hope - Simon Kuper in Boston finds the African challenge led by the continent's more stable countries 'We are here to win the World Cup,' says Nigeria's Dutch coach, Clemens Westerhof. No coach of an African World Cup side has ever been able to make that boast, and Westerhof may be proved right. His team are making their first appearance in the finals, and are expected to beat Bulgaria in a Group D first-round match in Dallas today. But despite the hype, African soccer may be getting worse, not better. Certainly Nigeria look the strongest African side ever to make the World Cup finals, stronger, certainly, than this year's Cameroon and Morocco. I do not wish to exaggerate, but the Nigerian players are all intelligent giant sprinters with tremendous skills, particularly their two strikers, Daniel Amokachi and Rashidi Yekini. For various reasons, no Nigerian defender has played league soccer recently: one player was suspended for six months for calling a Belgian referee a racist. But the team captured the African Nations Cup in April, and some European pundits think the Nigerians will do extremely well in the US. European pundits have always loved to say that an African side will win the World Cup one day. The prediction sounds grandiose, cannot immediately be disproved, and is kind to the Third World. But Africa gets poorer by the year, and African soccer suffers too. 'The scissors of European and African football will separate even further,' predicts Joachim Fiskert, the German manager of Congo. The World Cup is the main sporting event - perhaps the main event, full stop - for most African countries, yet over 20 of them failed to enter the current competition. The obstacles were famine or civil war or lack of funds (or all three), while Libya could not travel due to a UN air embargo. Zambia did enter, but its players died when the ancient military aircraft carrying them to Senegal fell into the Atlantic. The Zambian FA had been unable to afford a regular airline. Or take Ethiopia, one of the African countries which managed to play all its qualifying matches for this World Cup. The Ethiopians' first match was in Morocco. The team flew via Rome, where their five key players sought political asylum. That left eight players to contest the match. The reserve goalkeeper, the assistant manager and a friend filled in, and Ethiopia began the game with 11 men. By half-time, however, two of the volunteers had dropped out exhausted, and Morocco led 5-0. Early in the second half, three more Ethiopians gave up. With just six players left standing, the referee ended the game. Ethiopia did not make the finals. The three African teams that are here, Morocco, Cameroon and Nigeria, are among the continent's richer countries, though Nigeria and Cameroon are slipping fast: both had to ask their fans to help pay for their World Cup preparations. History shows that except for Zaire in 1974 - and they failed horribly  - only relatively rich, stable African countries have qualified: Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria and Cameroon. That Cameroon is becoming less stable shows up in this year's squad. The country's president, Paul Biya, has repeated his 1990 feat of personally picking Roger Milla for the national team. This time Milla is 42 rather than 38 years old, and the French coach Henri Michel does not want him along, but President Biya has been unloved since the elections in 1992, and was obliged to try something. Milla had predicted a 'revolution' were he not selected. Political interference is the norm in African soccer. When I asked Niger's sports minister whether he picked the national team, he replied: 'It comes with the job.' King Hassan of Morocco is said to have a direct telephone link to his team's bench. Nigeria's military rulers wanted their team to reflect 'the Nigerian federal character' - players from each main tribe, please - though most of the time Westerhof is his own man. 'Cameroon did very well in Italy,' he says. 'But we want to do better here and I know we can.' When Cameroon reached the quarter-finals in Italy in 1990, the world's bookmakers were shocked. They should not have been. In 1978 Tunisia beat Mexico 3-1 and were unlucky to draw 0-0 with West Germany. Four years later Algeria beat West Germany and Chile, and Cameroon gained three draws in three games, while in 1986 Morocco won England's group. At each World Cup the Africans do well, and each time it is said that the African game is finally coming of age. In reality, it has not advanced much in the past 16 years. All over Africa you will find boulevards, squares and even churches re-named after Roger Milla, the continent's hero of 1990. The World Cup matters more to Africa than to any other part of the world. Only in sport, explains the Cameroonian writer Celestin Monga, 'is the African really perceived by the big western media as a man . . capable of making a valuable contribution to the history of humanity.' Every quartier in Africa will be spending the next month around a TV set. Let us hope Westerhof was not just not boasting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- A new contingent of  Self-Defense Forces (SDF) members replacing another Japanese  peacekeeping [PK] group in Mozambique was formally organized in  a ceremony Tuesday [7 June] on the eve of departure.    The 48-member contingent will stay in the southeastern  African nation until February 1995 to engage in the  transportation of personnel and materials, SDF officials said.    The team is the third Japanese peacekeeping group to go  there. It plans to be among the last U.N. peacekeepers to leave  because it is in charge of transportation.</p>

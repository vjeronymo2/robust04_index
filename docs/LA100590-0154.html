			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: PASADENA'S TRA FIORE: THE MORE THINGS CHANGE . . .  </P> <P> In the late '70s and early '80s, upscale Los Angeles restaurants looked mostly  to France for inspiration. Even as they experimented with local ingredients and  explored other cuisines -- especially Asian -- chefs here followed the rigorous  rules of French cooking and presentation.  </P> <P> (No California chef was considered fully trained until he or she had cooked in  France for at least a month or two.)  </P> <P> By the late '80s, many Los Angeles chefs had switched their alliances to Italy.  As it turns out, a lot of people believe Italian cuisine is better suited to  Los Angeles' lifestyle.  </P> <P> Still, the announcement earlier this year that Pasadena's well-loved Cafe  Jacoulet would close for a few months and reopen as Tra Fiore surprised a lot  of people. Instead of contemporary California-French food (with a few Asian  touches), there would be northern Italian. Instead of beurre blanc, pesto.  </P> <P> But judging by Tra Fiore's first weeks, Cafe Jacoulet's former regulars  shouldn't worry. The restaurant may look different (beautiful and  expensive-looking dark woods set off the white open spaces of the dining  rooms), and the menu may be full of Italian-sounding dishes, but the food at  Tra Fiore seems a lot like the food served at Jacoulet, only with the French  dish names translated into Italian. Even the chef is the same.  </P> <P> Some of the familiar Jacoulet-inspired dishes: tuna sashimi layered between  won-ton skins and avocado with a mustard-sesame dressing; sesame-seed ravioli  filled with John Dory mousse. It seems some things don't change as easily as  others.  </P> <P>  Tra Fiore, 91 N. Raymond Ave., Pasadena, (818) 796-2233. Entrees  $14.50-$22.50. LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

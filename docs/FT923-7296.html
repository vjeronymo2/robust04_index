			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / NHS trust sets up pay system A JOB evaluation system for healthcare employers seeking to introduce local pay bargaining has been developed jointly by Manchester Central Hospitals, which was in the first wave of National Health Service trusts in April last year. Accountants KPMG Peat Marwick developed the system in conjunction with the Manchester hospitals and hopes to sell it to other NHS trusts that want to break away from the centralised pay and grading structure. The Manchester trust employs about 6,000 people and has more than 450 types of job. The new computerised evaluation system is highly complex because each department has very different skill requirements for apparently identical job titles. The system will form the basis of a single pay spine for all the trust's medical and non-medical staff. A progress report by Industrial Relations Services, the research group, says that the Manchester trust has not yet moved to local bargaining for basic pay and conditions. The trust has, however, created 'single-table' bargaining for its 22 staff organisations on non-pay matters discussed at local level. These are for grievance procedures, which are covered by deals replacing NHS agreements. Mr Richard Sugden, trust personnel director, says that the success of the trust will largely depend on how well it manages its pay bill, which accounts for 70 per cent of costs.

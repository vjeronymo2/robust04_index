			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The controversy swirling around KVEA Channel 52, the Los Angeles  Spanish-language station targeted by Latino community protesters last week,  took a new turn Monday when officials for the station's parent Telemundo  network agreed to talks next week with some of its critics. Network officials  made the move after receiving a letter from the Los Angeles-based National  Hispanic Media Coalition urging Telemundo to discuss its alleged failure "to  meet the needs of the Latino community." Among other complaints, the letter  asserts that the directors of Estrella Communication Inc., KVEA's license  holder, has no Latino on its nine-member board and that there is only one  Latino on Telemundo's board of directors. The coalition had asked that its  letter be answered by Friday. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

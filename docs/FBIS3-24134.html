Overall, among tax-dodging enterprises, there are ten times as  many commercial organizations as state enterprises.    Head of the Russian Federation State Tax Service Vladimir  Gusev said at a press conference on Feburay 21, serious  violations of the current state tax legislation consist of:  concealment or understatement of expenditures, falsification of  accounting records, an erroneous application of tax rates and  tax privileges, depositing hard-currency earnings into accounts  in foreign banks in violation of the relevant laws.    One of the causes of such violations is that the system of  taxation is much complicated. There are too many local taxes  (over 20, and practice has shown that their effectiveness is  very low). Moreover, the payment of taxes is often late, in part  for the lack of relevant information.    Foreign economic activity is the sphere plagued with the  most  criminal activity. It is in the lead as regards hard-currency  budgetary indebtedness. Over 1,000 legal entities have been  identified which have failed to register with the tax  inspectorates. Commercial banks which open several accounts for  a single enterprise simultaneously are also among violators of  tax laws.    In 1993, taxes as a share of the gross domestic (national)  product stood at 23.4 percent, and tax debts at 25.2 percent. As  compared to 1992, those figures have fallen by 2.7 and 1.3  percent, respectively, as a result of the fall in the VAT rates,  a slowdown in profit growth and an increas in the number of tax  privileges and incentives. One result of the recent tax amnesty  has been the chanelling into the budget of over 330 billion  rubles from 44,000 legal entities and 3,000 individual persons.    The combined enterprise debt owed to the state in unpaid  taxes comprised 8 percent of the total sum of taxes earlier this  year. The number of the debtor regions, for VAT, has reached 38  and for the corporate profit tax -- 14.    Head of the Tax Police Department Sergei Almazov reported  that in 1993 on the results of tax audits, debtors were  obligated to pay 600 billion rubles, 120 million dollars and 2  million DM. A total of 617 law suits were filed against  offenders but only a handful of persons were brought to justice.  He explains the great difference in figures by lack of adequate  legislation and trained personnel.    The tax bodies are often accused of prejudice and  corruption,  says Vladimir Gusev. But of the 17 suits examined in court only  one was settled in favor of a taxpayer. During the past year  only 33 tax-service officials were sued, the total tax personnel  being close to 132 thousand. Simultaneously, 100-odd attacks on  tax officers were registered.</p>

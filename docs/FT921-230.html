			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Continental's net deficit hits DM128m CONTINENTAL, the world's fourth largest tyre manufacturer which recently won a protracted fight to remain independent of Italy's Pirelli, reveals a group net loss of DM128m (Dollars 77.5m) for 1991, Reuter reports from Hanover. . The loss, much as expected, compares with a net profit of DM93.4m for 1990. Group turnover of the German tyremaker amounted to DM9.4bn, an increase of almost 10 per on 1990's DM8.55bn. Parent company net loss was DM417m, against a profit of DM42.2m previously. Continental's directors ascribed the plunge into the red to high extraordinary costs linked to the closure of its Barrie, Ontario, plant and transfers to reserves for restructuring measures. Parent company results were also depressed by write-offs on the book value of the US General Tire unit. But operating profit rose and extraordinary costs fell away, and the group predicts a return to 'clearly black figures' in 1992.</p>

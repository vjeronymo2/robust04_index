			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Airport plans at crucial stage - Wrangles continue over new Pounds 13bn airport and Pounds 1bn container terminal CAPTAIN Charles Elliot, the British naval officer who claimed Hong Kong for the British crown in 1841 might, if he still takes an interest in its affairs, allow himself a wry smile as he watches over his progeny. His judgement about the territory, which Lord Palmerston, then Foreign Secretary, scornfully dismissed as 'a barren island', has been vindicated. Scores of vessels wait at anchor in the magnificent natural harbour used as a springboard for the opium wars 150 years ago, queueing to unload their cargo at what is now the world's busiest container terminal. Overhead, every four minutes, a plane banks sharply over the skyscraper city, now housing six million people, to land at Kai Tak, the world's fourth busiest airport. Elliot might also reflect on the irony that Hong Kong's greatest physical asset, and the reason why he picked it in the first place, could become the last and potentially the most damaging problem in the bruising wrangle with China ahead of the 1997 takeover. Short of cutting off the water supply, the Chinese could hardly have picked more vulnerable targets than Hong Kong's new Pounds 13bn airport and the Pounds 1bn plan to extend the territory's container terminal. Hong Kong's importance as an entrepot for the booming trade with China's rapidly growing economy and the urgent need to relieve the pressure on Kai Tak airport, which will be bursting at the seams by 1994 with 24m passengers, made them obvious targets for Peking in their war against Mr Chris Patten, the governor. They are Hong Kong's jugular. The attempt to build the new airport on man-made Chek Lap Kok island on the territory's south-west extremity has already claimed a number of victims including, arguably, Lord Wilson, its originator and Mr Patten's predecessor. Mr John Major, the British Prime Minister, was forced to make a humiliating trip to Peking in 1991 to clear the way for a Memorandum of Understanding which committed China to support the so-called Airport Core Projects (ACP) only to find it used as a weapon against him two years later. Whether either project goes ahead now depends on the outcome of the on-off talks between Peking, the British government and Mr Patten. It could be argued that the new airport, to be financed half by the Hong Kong government and half by a mixture of banks and franchise investment, has acquired such a momentum that it cannot be stopped. Japanese, British, US, Dutch, Belgian and Chinese companies are blasting, shifting dirt and and dredging to create the new platform designed to take two parallel runways, up to 375,000 aircraft movements and nearly 90m passengers a year by 2040. The design for the airport terminal by a mostly British consortium is well advanced. Contracts for the terminal could be awarded within months. THE related parts of this monumental plan, thrown together as a confidence booster after the Tiananmen Square massacre - a viaduct, two suspension bridges, an undersea tunnel, a railway, a new town and a highway to the Chinese border - will be largely funded by the government. But unless Britain and China can agree new terms, two key parts of the core project - the airport itself and its connecting railway - cannot go ahead: The Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) may run out of money by the summer. If the Legislative Council, the local law-making body, refuses to vote it more money salaries could not be paid. The international banking community could hardly be expected to come with the required loans even though, in the long-run, the new airport will be a money-spinner. If there were an agreement, however, the PAA could expect a rush of loan offers on extremely favourable terms. Although of less magnitude than the airport, the delay to building the four-berth Container terminal 9(CT9) at Kwai Chung, poses a more immediate practical problem. Gouged out of the sea on what was known as Gin Drinker's Bay, Hong Kong's container port is the bridgehead for goods moving in and out of China. The decision to award the contract for CT9 was arrived at after much wrangling and provoked bitter recrimination among the losing bidders. The winning consortium, headed by Hong Kong International Terminals and Modern Terminals (HIT) in one group, and Jardines and Sea-Land in another, are now faced with the choice of pressing on without agreement from Peking or biding their time. Both courses of action pose significant problems. If the developers decide to try to press on, there must be a doubt over whether they can take the banks with them. If the HIT consortium decides to bide its time, the pressure of traffic on its existing terminals - which grew at 17 per cent in 1992 - could become unbearable. The fact that there is a heavy mainland Chinese involvement in both consortia could complicate matters. There have already been hints that, unless matters are resolved, it may shelve or even abandon its plans for CT9 and look to China for its next development. 'With costs escalating in Hong Kong,' said one executive, 'this would make sense.' Like so much else in Hong Kong, this could be an astute piece of pressure aimed at bringing Hong Kong and China to their senses. Both China and Hong Kong stand to lose a great deal if either project falls through. Of the two, however, there little doubt about who stands to lose most.</p>

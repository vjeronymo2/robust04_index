			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate Rules Committee rebuffed federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings' request  that the full Senate conduct evidence hearings in his impeachment trial.  Instead, the committee called for a panel of 12 lawmakers to conduct hearings  that would be televised so senators could watch if they chose. "There will be  no question about the fairness of it," Rules Committee Chairman Wendell H. Ford  (D-Ky.) said as his panel approved a plan under which six Republicans and six  Democrats would be named to hear evidence. The House already approved a bill of  impeachment alleging that the U.S. District Court judge conspired with a  Washington attorney to obtain money from two convicted racketeers in exchange  for a guarantee they would not serve time.  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Competition for the investor's dollar: US retail investment brokers' fight against the giants of the financial services industry This week's sale of Kidder Peabody to rival Wall Street securities house PaineWebber has created a new member among the elite of the US retail brokerage business. By acquiring Kidder, Paine-Webber boosts the size of its army of stockbrokers to 6,600. Only Merrill Lynch (with about 12,200 brokers), Smith Barney (11,200) and Dean Witter (7,300) are bigger. These brokers are the front line of the retail investing industry. For PaineWebber, the extra hands will allow the firm to compete more effectively with the other giants of the financial services industry - the mutual fund groups, banks, insurance companies and discount brokers  - which are scrapping for the right to manage the trillions of dollars Americans have invested in financial assets. Retail investment broking in the US has not always been so competitive. Little more than a decade ago, it was a relatively simple business. Its targets were people like the dentist from Des Moines with a little money to spare. He could buy a certificate of deposit from a bank or a government bond from a broker and know that his money was secure. If he wanted to risk his capital, he could buy one of the few mutual funds sold by fund groups or, more likely, invest it directly in the stock market through a broker like PaineWebber. Today, the Des Moines dentist has been joined by millions of other Americans who want to invest in securities. They can choose from a vast array of investment products sold by a variety of financial intermediaries. The fastest growth has been recorded in the mutual fund business, amid intense competition between financial services providers. In 1980, just 6 per cent of US households invested in a mutual fund. Ownership levels had jumped to 27 per cent of households by the end of 1992 (the most recent date for which data are available). Today, mutual fund assets total Dollars 2,200bn, up from only Dollars 50bn in 1977, and more than double the total just five years ago. Mr Joe Grano, head of Paine-Webber's retail broking force, says the flow of money in recent years into investments such as mutual funds has been 'mind-boggling'. 'There has been a mad rush by non-traditional competitors to get into our business,' he says. These 'non-traditional competitors' include discount brokers, banks, specialist fund groups and insurance companies, which are fighting over the retail dollar with full-service brokers such as Paine-Webber and Merrill Lynch. The discount brokers have prospered in recent years by offering investors low-cost services. Since fixed commissions were abolished in 1975, firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Brokerage and Quick &amp; Reilly have been steadily winning business from the full-service brokers. Although dwarfed by the full-service firms in the size of their broking forces and assets, they now account for about 14 per cent of retail broking commissions in the US, up from about 5 per cent 10 years ago. Firms such as Charles Schwab have been particularly successful in winning mutual funds business from the big brokers by offering investors an easy way to buy into a wide range of mutual funds with low commissions and 'no-load' funds that charge no commission. Insurance companies are also beginning to make their presence felt in the retail market. Mr Bill Hartman, securities industry analyst at JP Morgan in New York, says that insurers have a built-in advantage over other financial services firms because of their long experience in selling specialised tax-efficient investment products direct to investors. Mr John Steffens, executive vice-president of Merrill Lynch, the second largest mutual fund manager in the US, is taking the threat from the insurers seriously. 'The insurance companies have some definite advantages, because they have significant relationships (with customers), big asset bases, and large distribution systems in place.' The biggest threat to full-service brokers' retail investment business, however, comes from the banks. They can sell investment products through their large branch networks, which offer growing competition to the brokers' own distribution networks. Banks are relatively recent entrants into the retail investment market after decades in which regulatory barriers kept the banking and securities industries apart. Five years ago, banks managed mutual fund assets worth Dollars 43.8bn. By April of this year, that figure had jumped to Dollars 219.4bn, or 10 per cent of the mutual fund market. The growing competition in the retail investment market is encouraged by demographic trends which are increasing the demand for savings products, says Mr Grano of PaineWebber. As the number of retired people expands, the working population will have to save more to pay for care of the elderly, he says. In the next 30 years, the number of people over 65 will double. He also expects a rise in demand from the generation of baby-boomers, now passing the age of 40. 'They are entering a period of their life when they have the most earning power and disposable income,' he says. Financial services providers are coming up with an ever-wider array of products tailored to their customers' needs. These range from futures and options, to new forms of pension plans and funds investing in emerging market. Technology is revolutionising the industry by providing investors with new ways to make investment decisions and to acquire financial information. They can initiate transactions and monitor the performance of their investments on a laptop computer at home or in the office, 24 hours a day. Mr Roger Servison, head of the Fidelity group's discount brokerage unit, says 71 per cent of phone calls to the fund group - the largest in the US - are answered by computers which use automated response technology to provide the caller with the information required. These new techniques also allow brokers, fund groups and their competitors to improve efficiency and save money. Without automated response technology, says Mr Servison, the company would need to hire an extra 4,000 employees. By allowing firms to cut their costs, technology also enables them to charge lower fees to their customers, a crucial advantage in a business that has become so price-sensitive. Yet not all investors are chasing the lowest commissions: while some want inexpensive, efficient transaction-based services, other are looking for high-quality professional investment advice, which does not come cheaply. As Mr Steffens of Merrill Lynch puts it: 'The market is getting more segmented. Some people are looking for an increased level of service. Others are looking for rock-bottom prices just to execute a trade.' Mr Servison believes investors are increasingly seeking the latter. 'Price seems to be winning out over advice. On the brokerage side you see it in the accelerating gains in market share the discount brokers are enjoying over full-service firms. On the mutual fund side, you see it in the increasing share of the market the no-load business is winning.' That view, however, is contested by the full-service brokers. Mr Steffens says that future prosperity lies in building long-term relationships with investors by providing them with a broad range of products backed by expert advice. Long-term business trends are working in the big brokers' favour, believes Mr Grano. He says that more than 20 years ago, brokers mostly concentrated on handling investors' trades. Ten years ago, they worked on attracting investors' assets. Today, says Mr Grano, success lies in finding solutions to investors' problems, and meeting their individual needs. 'The '70s were a transactional era. The '80s were an asset-gathering era. The '90s are a problem-solving era.' If he is right, the full-service brokers may yet hold their own against the competition over the rest of the decade. With thousands of highly paid brokers, costly branch networks and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in technology, they cannot afford to be wrong.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            US RETAIL INVESTMENT MARKET - THE MAIN PLAYERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Full-service brokers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch:         biggest with 12,200 brokers and Dollars 1.4bn                        profits in 1993 PaineWebber:           recently expanded to 6,600 brokers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Discount brokers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Charles Schwab:        dominant in discount sector, ie low-cost or                        no-fee Quick &amp; Reilly:        750,000 customers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mutual fund groups  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fidelity Investments:  the biggest fund group, with Dollars 272bn funds                        under management, and 7m customers.

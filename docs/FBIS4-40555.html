			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Washington Proposes First </F> Sanctions Against Pyongyang"]    [Text] Washington -- The United States has proposed the  first package of measures for economic sanctions against North  Korea to the United Nations. While former U.S. President James  Carter enticed the DPRK foreign minister at a state dinner in  Seoul with prospects of extensive trade, respectful relations,  and mutually advantageous trading exchange between the despotic  Pyongyang and Washington, leader of the free world, M. Albright,  U.S. permanent representative at the United Nations, clearly  showed that her government was tired of waiting.    The sanctions against North Korea -- which has left the  international organizations that inspect and coordinate all work  with nuclear materials -- have put the United Nations face to  face with the need for action. The United States has taken the  lead, as usual in recent years. The first set of measures  proposed by Washington on Wednesday does not look very  impressive. It is believed that the United Nations will only  approve two points: discontinuing weapons trading with the DPRK  and discontinuing all air flights except for passenger flights.    Observers maintain that this is just the first step. If  Pyongyang does not listen and continues its policy, tougher  sanctions will follow. In particular, the next step will be to  freeze all the DPRK's assets in international banks and exclude  this country from transnational financial activity.    North Korea has repeatedly stated that it will consider any  economic sanctions to be an act tantamount to a declaration of  war. However, a group of journalists who arrived in Pyongyang  together with Jimmy Carter did not discover any outward signs of  preparation for combat operations.    The magnificent reception given to Ex-President Carter by no  means signifies Pyongyang's readiness to respond to his  initiative. Carter's idea briefly boils down to North Korea  being promised serious political and business contacts, and  talks about this would start straight away as soon as the DPRK  restores access to its nuclear reactors for international  inspection. However, these promises have met with no response  in Pyongyang.    Many people believe that the DPRK will continue with its  tough brinkmanship [protivostoyaniye na grani voiyny] until it  receives real diplomatic recognition in the West and until the  blockade, which has become particularly painful following the  disintegration of the USSR and China's greater involvement in  the world economic process, is broken.    However, all the indications are that North Korea's  intentions do not end there. As one expert on the region said,  "through its activity in developong [sozdaniye] an atomic bomb,  Pyongyang wants to achieve two aims. The first is to achieve  international recognition. The second is to obtain an atomic  bomb."    Analysts believe that the aged North Korean dictator Kim  Il-song can foresee a time when the unification of Korea into a  single state will become inevitable. Possessing nuclear weapons  may be a the deciding trump card both at the unification  negotiating table, and, equally importantly, under the table.</p>

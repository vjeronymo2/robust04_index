			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria posts a 20% slide Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, has reported a 20 per cent slide in pre-tax profit in the first half to Sch2.1bn (Dollars 189m) due to a slump in trading income. But the bank expects an unchanged pre-tax result in the full year, as higher lending margins in the second half offset lower profits from trading. It also said provisions for bad loans would be about 10 per cent lower than last year's Sch3.8bn. Net interest income in the first half was flat at Sch6.06bn as loan demand remained slack. Partial operating profit (pre-tax profit excluding own account trading) was up 5.5 per cent to Sch1.8bn, mainly due to lower transaction taxes. But trading income fell 66.6 per cent to Sch291m, causing the sharp decline in pre-tax profit. Comparative figures were adjusted to remove the extraordinary charges last year for reforming the employee pension fund.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Danish contract boosts British Coal's exports BRITISH COAL has won its biggest overseas order since it began testing the market for extra sales in March, and is on course to increase exports by more than 50 per cent this year. The deal for 100,000 tonnes, concluded with a Danish electricity generator, was achieved against intense international competition. It will help British Coal counter arguments from MPs, including Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Conservative MP for Batley and Spen, that it has been sluggish in winning extra sales. Such criticisms may resurface today in a Commons debate. The agreement, disclosed by International Coal Report, a Financial Times publication, will also test how far the government is prepared to go in subsidising coal sales. In its white paper in March the government said it would provide subsidies for sales to UK electricity generators and indicated that up to Pounds 500m was available. Since then the generators have shown a marked unwillingness to buy additional tonnages this financial year at least. But the government said last week it would subsidise a British Coal deal to sell 1.2m tonnes to Alcan, the aluminium company, in the north-east of England. The Department of Trade and Industry is considering British Coal's request for a subsidy for the Danish contract, which is with SK Power for its Copenhagen plant. British Coal refused to say yesterday what price it had agreed for the Danish contract, but it is likely to be significantly below the Pounds 35 a tonne of British Coal's existing contracts with the UK generators. ICR said Danish companies had recently bought coal for as little as Dollars 30 (Pounds 19.80) a tonne. The contract means British Coal will sell about 1m tonnes of coal overseas this year, compared with 600,000 tonnes last year. However, imports have also increased from 400,000 tonnes to about 800,000 tonnes, according to British Coal. The order provides a fillip for the north-east of England, where the coal will be produced. However, some of the coal will come from opencast operations, which are not able to claim government subsidies. The order will not affect significantly the decline in jobs in the deep-mine coal industry. Shipments began this week. British Coal exports, Page 34</p>

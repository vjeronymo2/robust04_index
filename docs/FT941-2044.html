			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Warning on draft insurance law Draft new legislation from the Department of Trade and Industry threatens the stability of the insurance market, a firm of solicitors warned yesterday. Davies Arnold Cooper said the DTI had muddled the definition of assets in its proposed law designed to adopt the EC's third non-life insurance directive. The firm said the wording would have the effect of de-barring as assets for solvency purposes insurance and reinsurance debts uncollected after three months.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Prime minister looks to staunch internal opposition - John Major hopes he has found an agenda that few Tories can quarrel with THE CONTENT of the Queen's Speech was decided long before one of Mr John Major's aides coined the government's latest catchphrase, Back to Basics. But details like that do not count when a prime minister is searching for a new political rhetoric. The original plan was to tailor the new legislative programme to the instincts and prejudices of the Tory back benches and of the party's footsoldiers in the constituencies. That, it is now said, will also catch the mood of the country by favouring a return to traditional values. After the civil war over Maastricht and the catastrophic by-election defeats in Newbury and Christchurch, it was time for a battered prime minister to concentrate on what united the Tory party rather than on what divided it. So whatever its broader appeal the central planks of the Queen's Speech have one simple objective: to win back for Mr Major's government the confidence of Conservatives. As one cabinet minister put it yesterday, winning back the rest of the electorate can wait. The point, he added, was that no Tory could quarrel with a promise to crack down on crime, to overturn the liberal establishment in teacher training colleges and to lift the regulatory burden on business. More dangerous legislation - London bus de-regulation, equalising the pension age at 65, privatisation of the Post Office - has been put to one side. There will be occasion enough for rebellions on taxation and spending without provoking the disgruntled and disenchanted on the Conservative back benches. Unveiling the programme in the Commons, Mr Major was in confident mood. He has had a good few weeks. The economy looks better than he dared hope even a month ago. His willingness to take risks in the search for peace in Northern Ireland has won him deserved plaudits. He looks comfortable talking about the 'commonsense' values his programme is designed to reassert, and about the promised return to suburban Conservatism. The backbenchers like it too. Whether Mr Michael Howard's massive criminal justice bill will actually curb crime is neither here nor there. Promising to jail teenage hooligans, tighten bail conditions, increase jail sentences and scrap the right to silence is judged to be popular as well as populist stuff. Teacher training colleges were a similarly obvious target. So too was the ever-increasing burden of regulation from Whitehall and Brussels. But if those three bills can justifiably be bracketed as part of the return to basics, the rest of the legislative programme is an uncomfortable hotch-potch. The Sunday trading bill was forced on the government. It will be controversial, but ministers are determined to remain as neutral as possible. Coal privatisation is designed to draw a permanent line under last year's near-disaster over pit closures. Local government reform in Scotland and Wales is a precursor to wider changes in England. The bill to put MI6 and GCHQ on a statutory basis is a left-over from the promised post-election drive to create more open government. From Mr Major's perspective the programme represents an intelligent political strategy. After the battering he has taken over the past year he needs to rebuild the trust of his own party. He needs to do it before the expected electoral battering expected by the Conservatives in next summer's local and European elections. But he is aware also that the mood of the present parliamentary session will be set not by yesterday's Queen's Speech but by the Budget in two weeks, and perhaps by the success or otherwise of his Northern Ireland initiative. The finance bill, a perfect target for Mr John Smith's Labour party, will be more difficult than any in recent history. Spending cuts will provide ample scope for another collective nervous breakdown on the Tory back benches. A planned squeeze on invalidity benefit and the transfer to employers of more of the burden of statutory sick pay will both need legislation. The still-seething rebel opponents of the Maastricht treaty will not miss the irony that those bills will run in parallel with legislation to authorise higher British contributions to the Brussels budget. Mr Major, of course, hopes that another issue will define his prime ministership during the next year. For the second time in a week he again yesterday put his personal authority behind the drive for peace in Northern Ireland. Cynics in the cabinet see little chance of a breakthrough. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, offered a warning to the prime minister of the risks he will run with his own party if he leans too far in the direction of Sinn Fein. But Mr Major appears determined. Success would represent a huge political prize. The prime minister needs one.</p>

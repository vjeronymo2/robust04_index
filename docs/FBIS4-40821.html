			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin, Oleg Velichko </F> and Vitaliy Chukseyev]    [Text] Washington June 21 TASS -- In the coming four days  almost a half of Russian cabinet members, led by Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, will be in the United States attending a  regular session, the third one, of the Russian-U.S.  Intergovernmental Commission for Economic and Technological  Cooperation.    The commission formed last year under the Vancouver accords  reached by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in spring  1993, is co-chaired by U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore and  Russian Premier Chernomyrdin who arrives in Washington on  Tuesday from Milan where he attended the World Gas Congress.    The commission's session promises to be quite intensive and  productive. The first two sessions were held in Washington and  Moscow last year.    About twenty documents on bilateral cooperation in various  fields are to be signed as a result of the session, Mikhail  Tarasov, assistant to the Russian premier, told ITAR-TASS.    There is every indication that the most important one will  be  a package of agreements to integrate Russia into the  international programme for the development of an Alpha space  station.    It is expected in particular that during the session NASA  and  Russian Space Agency chiefs Daniel Golding and Yuriy Koptev will  sign a contract worth a total of 400 million U.S. dollars for  the operation of the Russian orbital station Mir during the  first phase of the Alpha project.    A concept, worked out by the two countries' experts, of  Russian participation in creating a new-generation orbital  station has already been endorsed by all other participants in  the programme, including space agencies of Europe, Japan and  Canada. An agreement in principle has been reached in  particular to launch a Russian power module in 1997, Tarasov  said.    The Russian premier's assistant also spoke about the  possibility that agreements will be signed to shut down reactors  for the production of plutonium and cease using it for the  production of nuclear weapons. However, Tarasov specified,  there is no full confidence so far that such a document will be  signed in the coming days because the sides still adhere to  different approaches to the question of compensation for the  regions where reactors subject to shutdown are located.    Much interest is being generated by the forthcoming meeting  between Chernomyrdin and World Bank President Lewis Preston and  International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Michael  Camdessus.    It has become known from informed sources that the Russian  premier's conversation with the World Bank president is expected  to result in the signing of four agreements to grant credits to  Russia amounting to a total about 800 million U.S. dollars.    According to preliminary information, no agreements are  planned to be signed during the Chernonyrdin-Camdessus meeting.    However, informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the IMF chief  recently spoke about the possibility of granting the IMF's  so-called standard credit to Russia in the near future. It is  precisely this matter that is expected to dominate the talks.    On June 23, on the final day of the commission's session, a  meeting between Chernomyrdin and President Bill Clinton is to  take place in the White House, with the Russian premier doing  his best to persuade the U.S. President into granting Russia the  status of country with a transitional market economy and finally  abrogating the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the trade act.    The Chernomyrdin-Clinton meeting will also be an important  stage of preparation for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  forthcoming visit to the United States in autumn.    Apart from staying in the U.S. capital, Chernonyrdin is  planning to visit Detroit, Michigan, to familiarise hinself with  the operation of the General Motors technological centre on June  24 and even test one of the newest vehicle models.    On the same day the Russian premier intends to attend a  Russia- Sweden match at the World Cup finals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin today proposed the holding of a multi-lateral meeting to  settle the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula in a phone  conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton who was in Rome on  a European trip.    The two presidents agreed to have experts further study the  issue and make recommendations.    According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Clinton today also  gave a phone call to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is  visiting Moscow, to discuss the situation in the Korean  peninsula.    The contacts between the presidents notably occurred after  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report  to the U.N. Security Council earlier that the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has made it impossible for  international inspectors to determine whether spent nuclear fuel  was diverted to a secret weapons program in 1989.    Pyongyang denied such a report the same day, arguing that  its  operation to discharge the spent fuel from a five megawatt  nuclear power reactor is being done in a manner that will  maintain the ability to take measurements later.    It accused the IAEA of attempting to internationalize and  politicalize a technical issue to pursue a "sinister political  purpose."    According to a statement issued by the U.S. State Department  in Washington today, the U.S. has already begun consultations  with its allies and the U.N. Security Council on sanctions  against DPRK.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for the DPRK Embassy in Austria  announced in Vienna today that DPRK has proposed to the IAEA  that it can carry out a sample test on the disputed nuclear  power reactor in Yongbyon.    However, Lothar Wedekind, a spokesman for IAEA, said he knew  nothing about it when asked if he was informed of the proposal.    He added that the IAEA has never got a clear picture of the  whole nuclear program of DPRK.    But DPRK Ambassador to Austria Kim Kwang-sop insisted that  the refueling of the nuclear power reactor is only a technical  issue.</p>

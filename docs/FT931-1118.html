			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: Better colours in the office - Worth Watching Printers which produce colour images with the quality of photographs have largely been the domain of publishing departments or specialist companies. Now Kodak has launched such a printer aimed at general office use which can be attached to a computer network. The ColorEase PS uses thermal dye sublimation, in which transparent dyes are layered on top of each other to give the high-quality image. The cost of printing a single sheet costs Pounds 1.68, while the printer costs Pounds 6,795. Kodak: UK, 0442 61122.</p>

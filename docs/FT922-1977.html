			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Debt still accessible, but more expensive THE FAILURE of GPA Group's share sale leaves the group facing an increase in its cost of borrowing - though financiers said yesterday that it would still have access to debt. The likely rise in borrowing costs was signalled yesterday as Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, placed GPA under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's Investors Service, the other big US agency, is already reviewing GPA for downgrading. The group currently carries a Baa1 credit rating from Moody's, one notch lower than S&amp;P and only two notches above the 'speculative' grades shunned by most investors. Mr Phillip Baggaley, credit analyst with S&amp;P in New York, said: 'Following a period of rapid development, GPA does need an injection of equity. Failure to complete the share offering will weaken the balance sheet going forward, although there is no sign of any cash or liquidity problem.' GPA has relied until now on three main sources of debt finance: banks, bonds and securitisation (under which it has sold bonds with the backing of aircraft leases as security). It has also succeeded in selling shares in a number of private placements. One banker said: 'They have tried all the avenues: no one particular form of finance has been enough for them. This will make it a bit more difficult.' GPA's main banking facility is a Dollars 2.075bn syndicated credit line negotiated with a group of 73 banks in 1987. Other lines include a Dollars 325m interim facility signed in September last year, falling due for repayment in December 1993 and March 1994. Although these committed bank lines are secure, banks are unlikely to extend additional credit. GPA made its first public bond offering at the end of last year, a Dollars 500m seven-year issue in the US market, and has placed bonds and preference shares privately with institutions several times. While US institutional investors may have been unwilling to commit equity capital to GPA, it has raised substantial debt finance in the US. Yesterday however, trading in its bonds had dried up in New York. Dealers at US investment banks were unwilling to quote a price on the debt. The US market has also been a source of short-term liquidity for GPA via its Dollars 250m commercial paper programme, set up in March 1990. The prospectus said GPA had on average Dollars 84m commercial paper outstanding at any time. S&amp;P said yesterday its short-term commercial paper rating for GPA would not be reviewed. Securitisation remains one of the group's best chances of raising further debt in the near future. Last week, GPA made the first issue of securitised aircraft leases. Under the issue, 14 aircraft leases were placed in a special purpose company which then issued bonds. The cash flow from the leases is used to pay bondholders. Similar techniques are well established in other areas of the financial markets: credit card debt and mortgages are often securitised in the US. The special purpose company which owns the aircraft leases and issued the bonds is 'ring-fenced' and should be immune from any financial difficulties at GPA. The price of last week's bonds were barely affected by yesterday's news. Analysts said that the availability of securitised finance depended on the health of the airline industry. If charter companies leasing the aircraft default, bondholders will only continue to receive payments if the aircraft can be repossessed and either leased or sold. That means that securitised bonds look a less attractive investment if airlines and charter operators are in financial difficulty, if income from aircraft leases falls, or if the residual value of commercial aircraft is depressed.</p>

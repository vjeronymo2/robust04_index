			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / World travel sees growth THE travel and tourism industry is expected to contribute Dollars 3,500bn to the world economy in 1993 - a 20 per cent increase on its Dollars 2,900bn contribution in 1990, according to Wharton Econometric Forecasting in a study commissioned by the World Travel and Tourism Council.* The study predicts that the industry will account for 127m jobs worldwide by next year. It will attract Dollars 422bn in investment (6.7 per cent of the expected world total) and will account for Dollars 2,000bn in consumer spending. The study warns of increasing congestion in the air, and the emergence of ecotourism and rural tourism as new growth areas. * Travel &amp; Tourism, the WTTC Report, 1992.

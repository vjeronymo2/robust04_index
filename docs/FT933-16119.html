			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC studies US soda ash 'dumping' the main ingredient in glass making, and a Dollars 650m (Pounds 430m) business in Europe - is to be investigated by the European Commission, following a complaint from European chemicals manufacturers. The complaint, which is being pressed through Cefic, the European chemical industry council, was heard yesterday by the EC's anti-dumping committee. It is headed by Solvay, the Belgian company which is the world's leading soda ash producer. A spokesman claimed yesterday that US imports had increased from 50,000 tonnes in 1990 to 634,000 tonnes last year, while prices have dropped by 15 per cent since 1991. 'Some people would consider this to be a sign of injury,' he said. US soda ash manufacturers say sales to Europe have slumped by 25 per cent in the first five months of 1993. They also insist that almost one third of US exports are from subsidiaries owned by Solvay and Rhone-Poulenc. Solvay claims that the dumping margin is as much as 15 per cent, and argues that pressure from cheap US imports was one reason why it was forced to close its 100-year-old soda ash plant in Couillet, Belgium, and to consider closure of another plant at Heilbronn in Germany. However, both were small and comparatively inefficient, and production has been shifted to newer plants, including a new plant at Bernberg in eastern Germany. Europe is one of the world's most fiercely protected soda ash markets, with tariffs averaging 10 per cent. This compares with zero tariffs in Japan and 1.2 per cent in the US. In 1990, ICI and Solvay were fined a record Ecu47m (Pounds 32m) for carving up the soda ash market. ICI has since sold its UK production facilities to an Australian company. Complaints by European manufacturers have risen recently as eastern Europe - in particular Poland - has joined the US as an aggressive exporter of soda ash.</p>

Chinenov, Taganrog </F> Radiotechnical Institute, Russia; UDC 661.325]    [Abstract] Traditional computer architectures are  inadequate to solve some problems in real time and simple  parallel computing is inadequate for database operations,  especially when the database is large. A complete topology  between processors is needed for efficient processing in real  time. The ability to reconfigure memory and processors decreases  the total number of iterations required to process large data  files. This article examines the possibility of using a  hypercube switching network to reconfigure processor elements  and memory in database machines. Two hypercubes are united to  form a four-dimensional hypercube. Any processor can be linked  with any memory unit, and any memory unit can be linked with any  other memory unit. The hypercube can be used to perform  randomization, sorting, and other relational algebra operations.  Figures 4; references 4: 3 Russian, 1 Western.</p>

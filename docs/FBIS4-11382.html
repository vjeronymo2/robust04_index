			<p>BFN     [Text] Based on the latest data collected by the research  institutes, the Finance Ministry has concluded that prices  converted into Real Value Units (URV's) rose by 5 percent  between March and April. This has prompted the government to  implement the real on 1 July.    Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's team believes the  decision  to introduce the real in July and to announce its implementation  35 days in advance will give the economic agents more security  and reduce price readjustments.    The Finance Ministry attributes the increase in prices after  they were converted into URV to entrepreneurs' fear of an  eventual price control and of a freeze on the basic foodstuff  basket produce.    The inflation in URV has made Ricupero give up the idea of  implementing the real on 1 June.</p>

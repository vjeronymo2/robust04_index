			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television You might have thought that a 5-part series called Israel: A Nation Is Born would need to go back a very long time for its opening episode, but C4 begins with the second world war, the Nazis 'final solution', and the UN decisions which led to Israel's declaration of independence in May 1948. BBC2's collection of personal views of the Falklands war, War Stories (9.30), continues with an account by Ian Mather who was sent to Argentina by the Observer in 1982, arrested as a suspected spy, and held in gaol. He re-visits the cell where he and colleagues awaited the outcome of the war. The steam trains and vintage motors which star in The Camomile Lawn are as impressive as ever, and today this oddly unfeeling account of middle class bed-hopping during World War 2 manages to include a scene of three-in-a-bed. Isn't Ruby Wax a scream?

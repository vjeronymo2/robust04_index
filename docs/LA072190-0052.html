			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT IMPRESSED WITH BODY OF THEIR WORK  </P> <P> Bodybuilding has its place, but it's not in the Olympics (July 14). Ben  Weider's attempt to crowbar body exhibitions into the category of sport is more  ludicrous than persuasive.  </P> <P> Few would agree with Weider's claim that putting a good body on display is as  worthy as swimming fast, but, agree or not, swimming, like every other Olympic  event, is measured by performance, not show. The only element of performance in  a body exhibition is the posing skill, which is secondary to the possession of  a well-formed body.  </P> <P> Body posing does not seriously test any of the qualities associated with  athletic endeavor (speed, strength, timing, coordination, strategy). Let's not  sully the concept of sport and the Olympic tradition by the admission of a  beauty contest.  </P> <P> AL CLARKE  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A guide for wide-eyed graduates - So you've left university and started work. Bethan Hutton explains how to negotiate the financial labyrinth So you're a 1993 graduate, starting your first job this autumn. You might have been impressed initially by monthly pay cheques as big as the grant cheque you got each term. By now, however, you probably have realised that the more you earn, the faster money tends to disappear. Food, rent, council tax, transport, clothes for work and an active social life can leave very little in the bank at the end of the month. So, this could be a good time to sit down, examine your financial situation closely and work out your priorities. The first task for many new graduates will be repaying the debts accumulated during their studies. The average 1993 graduate left college owing almost Pounds 1,800, according to a survey this year by Barclays bank. 'Interest rates are low at the moment but, if someone is going to organise their finances properly, debt repayment must be a priority,' says Mark Bolland, of London fee-based financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe. A growing proportion of student debt arises from official student loans. But these have a very low interest rate and repayments do not start until the April after graduation, so they are not such an immediate worry;,in any case, graduates earning less than 85 per cent of average earnings (now Pounds 1,165 gross a month) can delay repayment. Bank overdrafts and loans, however, usually carry much higher interest rates and should be paid off as soon as possible. Running an overdraft can also lead to hefty bank charges, while credit card debts are an even more expensive type of borrowing. A number of banks offer graduate loan schemes, intended to cover the expenses incurred in setting up home and starting work. Some also are marketed as a way to consolidate student debts with regular repayments. This idea should be treated with caution, though: borrowing more to pay off existing debts is usually an easy way to end up in even deeper trouble. But if you have large debts at high rates which you have no hope of clearing in the short term, it could be worth looking at one of the special graduate loans - providing the rate is lower and there is no arrangement fee. This could also be the time to look at what your bank is offering in terms of general service. The bank offering the most attractive deal to first-year students is not necessarily the best once you are in work. Most of the big high street banks offer graduate packages for six to 18 months after finishing university. These usually involve free banking and preferential loan and overdraft rates and most are are open to all new graduates, not just existing customers. Once you have your debts and day-to-day finances under control, you can start thinking about planning for the future. Are you keen to settle down and buy your own flat, or are you waiting only for the results of your final accountancy exams before taking off round the world for a few months? In either case, regular saving is a good habit to acquire while you are young and without dependants. But maintain a healthy scepticism towards people who say they have the ideal savings vehicle for you. Remain especially alert when confronted by members of the financial services industry: once you are earning money, you are on their list of targets and some can be over-enthusiastic about trying to sell you life assurance and related savings policies. Some of these can turn out to be inflexible for the saver while paying good commission to the seller. Watch out in particular for casual acquaintances from school or college who call out of the blue and are keen to meet. You could turn up expecting a relaxed drink but find yourself on the receiving end of a hard sell for insurance or investments. David Harris, of independent advisers Chantrey Financial Services, says: 'I do not believe that the majority of life assurance-related savings schemes are appropriate. The inflexible nature and longer time-scale of such plans makes them unsuitable.' Instead, he recommends looking at a range of more flexible products. These range from low-risk, tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) and National Savings products such as the yearly plan and the investment account, to equity investments using a tax-free personal equity plan (Pep). You can save as little as Pounds 20 a month with all these schemes. 'Flexibility must be an important consideration for very young people,' saysBolland. He recommends investment trust savings schemes as a sensible way of building up some capital. Investment trusts are companies which buy shares; investors purchase shares in the trust as a way of gaining exposure to a spread of equities. Savings schemes allow you to buy small quantities of shares on a regular basis, with as little as Pounds 20 a month. Bolland also mentions National Savings, and the save-as-you-earn share option schemes offered by some employers, as worth considering. As for housing, Bolland says: 'Right now is probably a good time for young people to buy their own flats. It all depends on earnings but, in many areas, servicing a mortgage is cheaper than renting. I would suggest that this is a more practical use of money for someone at this stage of their life than engaging in long-term savings.' Accumulating some savings before taking on a mortgage is a good idea, however. Not only will this help with legal costs and so on but, if you can put down a deposit of around 25 per cent of the value of the property, you could avoid paying expensive mortgage indemnity premiums - and reduce the hazard of getting caught in a negative equity trap if property prices fall. Retirement seems a long way off when you have just started work but people will tell you that, now you are working, you should think about a pension. 'The financial services industry would have everyone believe that the younger you start saving for a pension, the better,' says Bolland. But he is sceptical. If your employer has an occupational pension scheme, Bolland says it will probably be worth joining, depending on a number of factors - most importantly, how long you expect to stay in the job. Personal pensions, sold by life assurance companies, are less likely to be worthwhile at this early stage in your career because early payments are eaten up by commissions and charges and your personal and work circumstances are likely to change. 'If the person really is in a position to put some money away for retirement, then single premiums where possible should be paid,' Bolland says. 'The point is that it is daft to expect that a personal pension which might be suitable at age-22 will remain so for the rest of the person's life. There must be limited appeal in a 22 year-old tying up capital for 40 years or more.' Harris agrees. 'At this age, it is difficult to see how single individuals would have a need for life assurance or sophisticated pension arrangements. 'It would be far more beneficial to think of channelling available resources into savings, which are flexible and may be used at a future date in purchasing property.' Bolland's advice is unequivocal: 'I think the main point that people should bear in mind is that there are going to be a lot of people trying to sell them things, and that great care is needed to avoid making investments on spurious grounds. Keeping one's options open at all times is sensible.'</p>

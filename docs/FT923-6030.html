			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Engineering sector deals fall to 3% AVERAGE PAY settlements in the engineering sector fell to 3 per cent in July, according to the Engineering Employers Federation. In its latest pay bulletin the federation says the July figure may be unusually low because the 35 deals so far recorded included nine pay freezes. The average federation settlement level over the past three months is 3.87 per cent, while research from Incomes Data Services says that more than half of all rises are between 4 per cent and 4.9 per cent.</p>

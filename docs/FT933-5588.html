			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Linton Park doubles to Pounds 4.3m on higher tea prices LINTON PARK, the diversified tea coffee and fruit producer and food trader ultimately controlled by Lawrie Group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.32m for the six months to June 30. The outcome, achieved after reduced interest charges of Pounds 684,000 (Pounds 1.05m) was a 'significant improvement' on the comparable Pounds 2.17m, according to Mr Keith FitzGerald, chairman. He said the improvement reflected better tea prices and increased production on the group's Kenyan estates which have now recovered from the drought early in 1992. In Malawi, however, the rains came too late to have a material impact on the current year. Turnover on continuing operations, taking Kakuzi, a long-time associate, as a subsidiary from March 1, amounted to Pounds 62m (Pounds 58.7m). The interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p, payable from earnings of 13p (6.4p) per share.</p>

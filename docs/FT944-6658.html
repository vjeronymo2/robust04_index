			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Malaysian politician on trial A leading member of Malaysia's main party appeared in court yesterday on corruption charges. Mr Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, until recently chief minister of Malacca state and head of the youth wing of the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), was charged with abuse of power and corruption. Mr Rahim was forced to resign from his official posts last month after it had been alleged that he had sexually abused a 15-year-old girl. But the attorney general ruled that there was not enough evidence to bring charges. Mr Rahim had been considered a close ally of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>

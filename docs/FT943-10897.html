			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Chinese stocks surge on Beijing rescue package China's infant stock markets surged by more than 30 per cent yesterday fuelled by a buying frenzy after Beijing announced a rescue package aimed at arresting a disastrous slide in share values. Shanghai's A-share index for local investors leapt by 36.14 per cent to 447.68 points in an astonishing reversal of the sharp declines of recent months. The Shanghai index had lost 80 per cent since highs of early 1993. The smaller Shenzen exchange in territory adjacent to Hong Kong also rocketed ahead. The Shenzen A-share index leapt by 33.94 per cent to 127.59 points. Securities analysts attributed the rise to a change of sentiment among fickle investors who had been seeking positive news that might justify a return to the markets they had abandoned in the past year. But these analysts doubt that the China A-share markets will hold on to their gains. They expect the markets will continue to be highly volatile. China's B shares, reserved for foreigners and traded in US and Hong Kong dollars, recorded modest gains. The Shanghai B-share index rose just 1.83 per cent. Shenzen's gain was less than  1/2 per cent. The astonishing leap in China's market followed the announcement last Friday by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) that it was suspending new share listings this year. The CSRC, which has been under enormous pressure from disgruntled investors, also gave notice that it would permit Sino-foreign joint venture security houses to trade in A-shares, previously reserved for Chinese. This potentially important concession points the way to an eventual merging of the A and B-share markets once the yuan is a fully convertible currency. Rampaging Chinese investors also appeared to be responding to improving economic news, with indications that the government was bringing an overheating economy under control. Growth rates have slowed and inflation is coming down, raising the prospect of the authorities easing a credit squeeze. See Lex Pearson in deal to buy stake in HKTV, Page 17</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DUTCH NOW QUESTION EFFECTIVENESS OF GIVING AID TO THE THIRD WORLD;  </P> <P> NETHERLANDS: A SURVEY SHOWS THAT A THIRD OF ALL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS END IN  FAILURE.  </P> <P> The Netherlands, long proud of being among the most generous donors to the  Third World, is worried that the aid it gives is doing little good.  </P> <P> Newspapers have given wide coverage to a Dutch-built airport hanger in Tanzania  that remains unused, a farming project in Zambia that collapsed as soon as  farmers needed spare parts for their new tractors and Dutch dairy cows,  exported to Sri Lanka, dying in the heat.  </P> <P> "I do not think we have a specific problem, compared with other European  countries," former Development Cooperation Minister Piet Bukman said in an  interview.  </P> <P> "The issue of the quality of development aid is on the table all over the  world," said Bukman, who ended three years in the post when a new Dutch  government came to power Nov. 7.  </P> <P> The Dutch, who have a traditionally international outlook, take development  cooperation more seriously than most.  </P> <P> The Netherlands earmarks 1.5% of its gross national product each year for aid  to developing nations, making it among the world's most generous donors.  </P> <P> The $2.6 billion the Dutch will give away this year is far more proportionally  than the United States, which gives away about 0.2% of its GNP, Britain (0.3%),  West Germany (0.5%) or France (0.8%), according to World Bank figures.  </P> <P> A recent study said an overwhelming majority of the Dutch support their  government's generous policies, but found that 80% believed the help was "too  Western" and that aid organizations were often at cross-purposes with each  other.  </P> <P> Critics say Dutch aid is increasingly linked to the sale of Dutch goods --  useful or not -- and allege that many development projects display just plain  ignorance.  </P> <P> An internal Development Ministry review shows that two-thirds of Dutch import  subsidies in 1988 went to underwrite the purchase of Dutch-made goods.  </P> <P> Bukman defends the policy he did much to promote after becoming minister in  1986.  </P> <P> "If an industrialized country has a good package to offer, there is nothing  wrong with combining the interest of the developing country and the interest of  the developed country," he said.  </P> <P> Other experts, however, say the results mean countries end up with  sophisticated medical equipment they lack the expertise to use, fertilizer that  is useless for their crops and food imports they could have bought more cheaply  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Some Dutch companies make big profits off these projects and the developing  countries end up not always getting value for the aid money," said Paul Hoebink  of Nijmegen University's Third World Center.  </P> <P> The criticism has been strengthened by another ministerial study that made  headlines when it showed that a third of all Dutch aid projects failed.  </P> <P> Only one-third were considered successful, and the remaining third partly  accomplished their goals, the study concluded.  </P> <P> The problems are often cultural.  </P> <P> A project to provide running water in a village in India to make life easier  for women instead angered them. By doing away with the need to visit the local  well, the project deprived women of their main chance to venture outdoors and  socialize.  </P> <P> A plan to train young men in Ghana in new grain-raising methods failed  dismally. Once back home, the young men had no power to put the new methods  into effect because in their tradition-bound society, only the old have the  clout to introduce change.  </P> <P> Bukman, however, defends the Dutch record.  </P> <P> "Money is spent on developing countries in very difficult circumstances, under  poor economic conditions. . . . People forget that in our society, too, we have  many examples of mismanagement and bad decisions," he said.  </P> <P> In an effort to avoid cultural problems, the Dutch are trying to use more local  experts in development projects -- a practice that also cuts down on costs.  </P> <P> The Netherlands has moved away from straight food aid to helping create  permanent structures to strengthen the economy of poor countries, for example,  by building ports and dredging waterways.  </P> <P> "In the 1960s and '70s there was a tendency to say what we must do is alleviate  the poverty of the poorest layers of society. But for me, it was very important  that what we do has a structural effect on poverty in developing countries,"  Bukman said.  </P> <P> The Dutch have also played a central role in trying to help arrange for  rescheduling of debts for developing countries within international  organizations.  </P> <P> The Netherlands follows a policy of targeting about a dozen countries a year  for long-term aid, concentrating its efforts rather than trying to spread the  wealth too far.  </P> <P> "If we concentrate on a particular region or sector, we can develop a  long-lasting relationship. This is favorable for the recipient country," Bukman  said.  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Last chapter in a stormy career  -Jean-Yves Haberer is unlikely to go quietly Mr Jean-Yves Haberer has been out of work before but he has always bounced back - until now. He was fired in 1986 as chairman of Paribas, the prominent French bank, only to resurface two years later as head of Credit Lyonnais until he was banished last autumn to the less prestigious Credit National. Yet it is inconceivable that Mr Haberer, 61, could recover from yesterday's news that the French government has dismissed him after only five months at Credit National. His departure, which follows last week's news that Credit Lyonnais made a FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.2bn) net loss in 1993 and that it was to be baled out by the state in a FFr44.9bn rescue deal, marks the end of one of the stormiest careers in French finance. It also raises serious questions about the relationship between politics and commerce in France. 'Am I surprised by his dismissal? No way,' said one senior Paris banker. 'Credit Lyonnais is in a dreadful state. The government has to find someone to blame and Jean-Yves Haberer is the obvious candidate. The only surprise is why they gave him another job last autumn when they kicked him out of Credit Lyonnais.' Mr Haberer was nothing if not a controversial choice as chairman of Credit National. He is a brilliant but undeniably difficult man whose manner has made him highly unpopular among his peers. His critics have for years been prophesying that the aggressive stance on loans and international acquisitions he pursued in five years as chairman of Credit Lyonnais would end in disaster. Their fears were realised last spring by the news that Credit Lyonnais in 1992 had fallen into the red for the third time in its history with a net loss of FFr1.85bn. Mr Haberer's reputation was so tarnished that when he arrived at Credit National last autumn two of its German institutional investors protested against his appointment. The official reason for his new job was that it reflected the 'softly softly' approach to public sector appointments adopted by Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right prime minister, since he came to power last March. Mr Haberer, a former conservative who had changed allegiance when the left took power in 1981, was appointed to Credit Lyonnais by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the late socialist premier. Mr Balladur wanted him to go - but quietly. The Paris financial establishment was also anxious to avoid an outburst from Mr Haberer. 'There's no doubt that Haberer was the architect of Credit Lyonnais' problems, but what about the ministers who backed his decisions and the banking supervisors who let them give him more capital?' said one banking analyst. 'They must all have been worried about what he might say and very relieved when he was kept quiet by being given a new job.' Mr Haberer was also backed by influential friends on the left, notably by Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president. Observers say that Mr Mitterrand last autumn put pressure on Mr Balladur to find another job for Mr Haberer, rather than to dump him as Mr Jacques Chirac, the last centre-right premier had done in 1986 by firing him from Paribas. But even the president could not shield Mr Haberer from last week's storm when Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the new Credit Lyonnais chairman, revealed the full extent of the bank's 1993 losses and disclosed the final terms of the government's rescue package which includes a FFr4.9bn capital injection and the transfer of FFr40bn of non-performing property loans to a new company. Le Point, the right-wing weekly news magazine, dubbed Credit Lyonnais 'The Banking Scandal of the Century' and fingered Mr Haberer as 'The Man Behind the Scandal'. By the beginning of this week a number of conservatives had called for inquiries into Credit Lyonnais' affairs and rumours were circulating about Mr Haberer's imminent dismissal from Credit National. The rumours were confirmed after yesterday's cabinet meeting by Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the official cabinet spokesman. This time Mr Haberer shows no sign of going quietly. He issued a formal statement on Tuesday claiming to be the victim of a 'media lynching'. He also claimed that some of Credit Lyonnais' problems dated back to decisions made before his appointment and that others were based on 'recommendations' from the old socialist government. Finally, Mr Haberer called for an official inquiry into management of the group, claiming that he would be vindicated by such an investigation. His old friend, Mr Mitterrand, yesterday successfully insisted that the cabinet agree to mount an inquiry. 'This is just a warning shot,' said another analyst. 'Haberer has made it quite clear that he won't go without a fuss. And as the French government is well aware, he could make sure that the Credit Lyonnais story gets very, very dirty indeed.'</p>

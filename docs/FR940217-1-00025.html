			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)(2) of the reproposed rule also would require that broker-dealer supervisory policies and procedures contain systems reasonably designed to inform persons and large traders of their obligations to file Form 13H and disclose their large trader status. In this respect, questions and informative disclosures on new account applications, as well as annual notices to identified and unidentified large traders, among other things, would be deemed by the Commission to fulfill this element of the safe harbor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes that the elements of the safe harbor do not specifically require automated systems, employee training programs, or any other systems or procedures. The adequacy of supervisory procedures would depend on the nature and characteristics of a broker-dealer's business. The Commission believes that many different systems or procedures may be effective for accomplishing the objectives of the supervisory duties and, therefore, would satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f) of the reproposed rule incorporates many of the suggestions contained in the comments for reducing the burdens attendant to supervision of the system. The Commission believes that these new paragraphs add detail and objectivity to the reason to know requirements of the Market Reform Act and, therefore, reduce the burden of the supervisory scheme of the reproposed rule. The Commission also believes that these provisions are consistent with the general supervisory obligation imposed on broker-dealers by the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission, however, specifically solicits comments on the reproposed supervisory scheme and whether other more effective means exist, within the limitations provided by the Market Reform Act, for assuring the accuracy or reliability of information collected through the reproposed system and maintaining a level playing field between broker-dealers and banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 72 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See e.g., Sections 15(b)(4)(E) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(E) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13(h)(6) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person or class of persons or any transaction or class of transactions, either conditionally, upon specific terms and conditions, or for stated periods. The Commission may provide for such exemptions through rules or orders that are consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 73 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See 15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(6) (1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters did not express objections to the proposed exemptions, which were based upon the capture of similar information by SROs or involve activity generally deemed not to affect markets for publicly traded securities. The commenters, however, suggested additional classes of persons and transactions that should be exempt. These suggested exemptions included: (1) Introducing broker-dealers; (2) foreign and domestic market makers; (3) certain custodian banks; (4) small investment managers; (5) unit investment trusts; (6) issuer repurchases; and (7) after-hours foreign trading activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(1) of the reproposed rule would specifically provide that certain broker-dealers are exempt from the identification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of the Rule. The reproposed rule would retain the exemptions proposed ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> specialists, option market makers, and floor brokers) and add market makers registered by a national securities association to the extent that they are acting in their market making capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(2) of the reproposed rule would exempt certain transactions and introducing broker-dealers from the reporting requirements. The specific transactions that would be exempt from the reporting requirements only include those transactions effected by specialists, option market makers, and other market makers in the publicly traded securities for which they are registered. In addition, paragraph (g)(2)(iii) has been added to definitively exempt introducing broker-dealers that do not carry accounts for themselves or others from the reporting requirements of the reproposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the comprehensive exemptions for entities that are subject to similar SRO recordkeeping and reporting requirements would establish an equal competitive environment between all forms of market professionals that are registered with an SRO. The Commission also believes that these exemptions would assure that the reproposed system collects the appropriate information from the appropriate registered broker-dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to other suggested exemptions, the Commission believes that some have been incorporated in portions of the reproposed rule. For instance, the reproposed definition of a large trader, reduced scope of Form 13H, and inactive filing status, would implicitly exempt or significantly reduce the burden on custodian banks or trust companies, foreign market makers, and unit investment trusts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  On the other hand, the Commission believes that some of the other suggested exemptions would not be consistent with the purposes of the large trader reporting provisions of the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Unit investment trusts, and similar ``closed-end mutual funds,'' essentially are fixed portfolios of securities assembled by a sponsor and held for the life of the trust. Typically, these entities investments are static and, therefore, the identification or reporting requirements of the reproposed rule may be triggered only at their inception and termination. The new inactive status was designed, in part, with these entities in mind and would effectively eliminate the ongoing burdens of the reproposed rule on these entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  These suggested exemptions would include: (1) ``small'' investment advisers that control ``large transactions'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> transactions that reach the identifying activity level); (2) issuer repurchases; and (3) after-hours foreign trading activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exemptive provisions of the reproposed rule acknowledge the existing systems for collecting similar information. The Commission believes that these exemptions accomplish the purposes of the Market Reform Act and minimize the number of persons affected by the various aspects of the reproposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

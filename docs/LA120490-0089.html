			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> ABT Dancers' New Contract: American Ballet Theatre dancers are expected in the  rehearsal studio today following an agreement reached midnight Friday after an  intense 10-hour negotiating session. Dancers won a $2 increase per day, but  will double up in hotel rooms for two foreign tours. For domestic tours -- such  as the Orange County Performing Arts Center in March -- dancers will get  individual rooms. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

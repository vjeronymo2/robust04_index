			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (I) Vital Area Access Control Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC may accept the changes to vital area (VA) access control measures in security plans discussed below upon confirmation that (1) certain other site-specific measures are in place or will be implemented to demonstrate (e.g., through contingency drills) a capability, including a protective strategy, to protect against an external adversary after making any of the changes and (2) measures are in place to examine hand-carried packages for explosives using equipment specifically designed for that purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Compensatory Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Eliminate compensatory measures for failure of vital area mechanical lock hardware if the access control hardware and alarms are operable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Extend the timeliness requirements for implementing compensatory measures for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  malfunctioning element of the vital area access control system from 10 minutes to a period similar to that which technical specifications permit for safety equipment to be out of service while the plant is in Mode 1 until required to be in Mode 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee could extend the time to implement compensatory measures only if either the VA door lock or alarms are operable. The most restrictive limiting condition for the timeliness of the compensatory measure(s) would be the most restrictive safety equipment in the vital areas accessed by the VA door needing compensatory measures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Maintenance of Discrete Vital Area Access Lists <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eliminate separate access authorization lists for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> each  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> vital area of the facility. As an alternative, maintain a single list of persons who have access to any vital area. This list would have to be revised as status of persons changes in order to maintain its accuracy, especially for removing vital area access authorization from individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Alarm Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Modify the response to vital area access control alarms (doors). Response would only be needed to vital area access control alarms that coincide with an unresolved alarm at the protected area perimeter, a known intrusion, or a constant alarm, such as that caused by an open door. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Locked Condition of Door  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although locking mechanisms and access control systems, including door alarms, would be retained, doors to vital areas could be left unlocked. A licensee choosing this option would be expected to have the capability to remotely lock the door(s) from both alarm stations, as necessary, in response to an external threat. Licensees choosing this option would be expected to demonstrate, as part of the demonstration of their capability to protect against an external adversary, the ability to remotely lock doors in time to delay the adversary where delay was essential in the protective strategy. Access control systems retained on vital area doors would continue to maintain a record of personnel access and generate alarms if the door was open without a proper access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process for licensees to revise their security plans to implement the changes to security measures in vital areas will depend on the content of their present security plans. Since these changes would reduce slightly the effectiveness of the security program, most changes would need to be processed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.90. Some of the changes may be processed by an exemption request or in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p). If appropriate, changes in security plans should include commitments to the measures described in paragraph (I) above. To ensure unrestricted emergency access, the NRC staff notes the advantages of (1) having the ability to remotely unlock doors to vital areas from each alarm station, (2) ensuring that malfunctions result in doors failing unlocked rather than locked, and (3) allowing all operators and auxiliary operators to carry metal keys that can override keycard-operated lock mechanisms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (II) Access Search of On-duty Armed Security Guards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC may accept changes to allow armed security officers who (1) are on duty and carry a weapon in accordance with assigned duties, (2) have already been searched during their current shift, and (3) have left the protected area on official business, to reenter the protected area without being subject to the metal detector searches (but still be subjected to explosive searches). If search equipment is a single unit containing both metal and explosive detection equipment, alarms from the metal detector may be disregarded. This change could be made to security plans in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (III) Containment Access Control Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC may accept changes to allow persons other than security personnel, provided they are appropriately trained in access control procedures in accordance with the security plan, to control access for personnel and materials entering the containment any time frequent access is permitted to the containment. This change could be made to security plans in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (IV) Alternative Measures for Control of Security Badges <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC may accept changes to allow for alternative approaches for accountability of picture badges used for unescorted access so that certain types of badges may be taken outside the protected area. Alternative approaches need to include the ability to ensure positive identification of individuals upon entry to the protected area and to ensure the badge is disabled of its access function when taken out of the protected area. For employees, such changes can be made under 10 CFR 50.54(p) because the regulations currently allow licensee employees to take badges off site. Changes to security plans to allow contractors to take security picture badges off site would require a request for exemption from the provisions of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5). Coincident with receiving approval of the exemption request, the licensee would be able to implement the change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This generic letter requires no specific action or written response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 24th day of October, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Brian K.

The  congress is attended by 830 delegates of Podkrepa structures  throughout the country. Fifty-eight leaders of foreign trade  union organizations are attending the congress as guests. The  delegates were greeted by Enzo Friso, secretary general of the  International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and by  Marku Jaskelainen, deputy secretary general of the European  Trade Union Confederation. The participants were also greeted  by Mr. Kadir Kadir, deputy chairman of the National Assembly  (attending the congress in his private capacity), and by Mr.  Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and  Freedoms, as well as by some MP's.    The opening of the congress was not attended by President  Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov  and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, invited by Podkrepa. No  representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party were invited  because, according to Dr. Trenchev, Podkrepa does not maintain  contacts with this party. There were also no representatives of  the other major Bulgarian trade union amalgamation -- the  Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB)  with which Podkrepa is in an escalating conflict. Dr. Trenchev  believes the KNSB to be an unprincipled and procommunist  formation. According to Podkrepa, the Association of Free Trade  Unions, led by Asen Chaushev, does not deserve serious attention.    The government is unable to solve the enormous problems  facing this country and is leading it to disaster, Dr. Trenchev  said in his speech. According to him, in such cases it is the  duty of the trade unions to undertake nationwide actions.    In the two years which have elapsed since the last congress  of Podkrepa, the relations between this trade union amalgamation  and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) have deteriorated, said  Dr. Trenchev who is one of the founders of the SDS. Many  delegates at the congress appealed for improving these relations  at today's debates. Others stressed that Podkrepa should not  commit itself to any political organization.    According to Dr. Trenchev, over the past two years the  confederation has gained in trade union experience and  professionalism and has established democratic decision-making  mechanisms. However, the Podkrepa leader also mentioned some  shortcomings in the work of the confederation, including  conflicts between its regional and branch structures and the  failure of the PODKREPA newspaper, conceived as a democratic  publication but left in bad hands, Dr. Trenchev said. According  to Dr. Trenchev the most important task of the congress is the  amendment of the statutes of the confederation.    Initially, the independent Podkrepa Trade Union united part  of Bulgaria's sci-technical and artistic intelligentsia. It was  founded in early 1989 and became a federation that same year.  Dr. Konstantin Trenchev is its first chairman and subsequently  president. At its congress in 1990 the organization was renamed  Podkrepa Labour Confederation and was officially registered  under this name in 1993.    The decision for holding the Third Congress of Podkrepa was  taken at a Confederative Council last September. Statutes,  Programme and the Mandate Commissions will work on different  organizational issues, including the amendment in principal  documents of the confederation. Some sections have not been  represented because of failure to present registration  documents. The congress is expected to vote 25 resolutions, Dr.  Trenchev said at a recent briefing. According to a statement  made by him at this briefing, the congress may discuss a  decision for calling a general strike aimed at overthrowing the  Prime Minister Berov's cabinet. The congress will elect a new  leadership.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S UNFINISHED REVOLUTION;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: PROPOSITION 103 IS STILL UNDER SEIGE FROM THE INDUSTRY, THOUGH IT'S  MORE POPULAR THAN EVER WITH CONSUMERS. NOW MAY BE THE TIME FOR A SUCCESSOR PLAN  TO END INSURER DEFIANCE.  </P> <P> The ramifications of Prop. 103 may ultimately force the voters to re-examine  Prop. 103, but only if events create an unstable environment where the auto  insurance system is in continuing turmoil.  </P> <P>  -- From a secret memo to the insurance industry from its political consultant,  Clinton Reilly, three weeks after voter approval of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> One year ago today, California voters took insurance reform into their own  hands and passed Proposition 103. But unlike other recent mass uprisings around  the world, this was a peaceful revolt.  </P> <P> As citizens of a democracy, Californians have the power to override a corrupted  Legislature and pass needed laws simply by going to the polls. So after  enduring years of legalized extortion by insurance companies, the people  approved Proposition 103, reducing auto, homeowner and other liability  insurance rates to 1987 levels, eliminating arbitrary and discriminatory  practices and imposing the most stringent controls in the country on this  rapacious industry.  </P> <P> The intervening 12 months, however, have revealed that the insurance industry,  and its allies in government charged with enforcing Proposition 103 have no  more respect for democracy than a Colombian drug cartel. Insurance executives  and state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie ridicule the law as the  product of an emotional, unthinking mob that has no place telling insurers what  to do.  </P> <P> Addicted to excessive profits and desperate to discourage reformers in other  states, insurers have plotted revenge against California: a course of  intimidation, coercion and outright lawlessness designed to punish the people  for approving 103. The strategy was laid out in the secret memo by consultant  Reilly. It concluded, "In defeat, the industry may finally win -- if it  realizes the opportunity and continues to mobilize its considerable resources."  </P> <P> Resources it has. Consumers should have gotten their 20% rollbacks long ago.  Instead, the "good hands people" have shoved their greedy fingers even deeper  into our wallets, jacking up rates as if 103 had never existed. Longtime  customers have had their policies arbitrarily canceled or have been suddenly  reclassified as higher risks, in flagrant violation of Proposition 103.  Companies have refused to open their books to independent review, as required  by 103, or to participate in the hearings mandated by the new law. And, using  millions of dollars of our money, the insurance industry has hired thousands of  lawyers -- at an estimated $1 million per day -- to file legal challenges to  the law, to concoct absurd legal arguments to circumvent its requirements or to  delay the new regulations. In one particularly reprehensible case, attorneys  from the same law firm agreed on behalf of one insurer to comply with a  schedule for implementing 103, then turned around and sued on behalf of another  company to have the plan invalidated.  </P> <P> Yet despite the turmoil and the industry's continued intransigence, polls show  that far more Californians support Proposition 103 today than on Election Day  1988, even though a majority believes that rollbacks will never be extracted  from insurers.  </P> <P> Why the greater support? Because more than ever, the public knows that 103 is  necessary for its protection. The insurance industry has, since approval of  103, proven the wisdom of the initiative: The more the insurers disobey the  law, the stiffer the resolve of citizens to insist that it be enforced. This  mounting public support, in turn, fortifies the law in the face of those who  would otherwise ignore or subvert it. It is no accident that the Deukmejian  Administration, which only recently was not embarrassed to champion the  interests of insurers, now finds itself freezing insurance rates to protect an  outraged public.  </P> <P> In response to a lawsuit brought by Voter Revolt, the Proposition 103  Intervention Team and other citizen groups, Insurance Commissioner Gillespie  also agreed last month to scrap every one of the hundreds of exemptions from  the 20% rollback she had previously granted. Using an approach favored by  consumer advocates and Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, she will begin anew the  process of determining rollbacks and adopting procedures for regulating rates.  </P> <P> And though much of the focus has been on 103's 20% rollback, voters have  gradually become aware of its other reforms for which there is equally strong  public support. Polls show that Californians throughout the state are  particularly supportive of 103's requirement that auto insurance rates to be  based primarily on characteristics that drivers control, such as safety  records, rather than zip codes.  </P> <P> Voters also see the opportunity to elect the insurance commissioner in  November, 1990 -- mandated by 103 -- as a virtual guarantee that the remainder  of the initiative will eventually be implemented.  </P> <P>  (Ralph) Nader wants our Persian rugs off our floors, he wants to cut insurance  executives' salaries, he wants to cut your commissions as agents and brokers.  ... Like Hitler, there is no appeasement. ... Some may appease you, consumer  activists, but we at the National Assn. of Independent Insurers ... will fight.  ..."  </P> <P>  -- Insurance executive John Crosby, leader of the industry's unsuccessful  campaign against 103, in a speech in New York City on Sept. 22, 1989, comparing  consumer activists to Adolf Hitler and insurers to Winston Churchill.  </P> <P> Proposition 103 has ushered in a new era of tough scrutiny and regulation of  insurers. But its long-term success in reducing rates requires that insurance  companies accept a fundamental change in their basic purpose.  </P> <P> Before Proposition 103, insurers operated on a "cost plus" basis: The costs of  claims were simply passed on to consumers, along with an average 56% markup to  cover insurer profits, multimillion-dollar executive salaries, campaign  contributions and other expenses. Under this system, insurers perversely  profited from more accidents, litigation, higher doctor bills, inflated car  repair and other costs.  </P> <P> Instead of acting simply as middlemen, insurers must be willing to take  responsibility for controlling the costs of the claims and expenses they pay  out. By giving the insurance commissioner the power to regulate rates,  Proposition 103 allows the commissioner to set performance standards that will  encourage insurers to focus on claims prevention, rather than on maximizing  profit.  </P> <P> Thus far, however, the bureaucratic auto insurance industry has demonstrated  about the same willingness to change as the Chinese government. Instead,  insurance companies have bulldozed the nation with a $90-million advertising  campaign designed to convince us that they care about lowering rates and paying  lip service to the need to control costs. But when a comprehensive bill to  improve auto safety, limit unnecessary lawsuits, crack down on health-care  fraud and uninsured motorists and provide a lifeline auto policy for low-income  Californians surfaced in the California Legislature, the auto insurers'  lobbyists fought the measure and won a veto from the governor.  </P> <P> The prognosis for change is not good. Industry executives, ensconced in their  high-rise office suites in Illinois and Connecticut, refuse to let a mere  California ballot initiative dictate how they should run their empire. But  their time is running out. Inspired by Proposition 103, consumers in 35 states  from Nevada to South Carolina have promoted or passed rate rollbacks and other  reforms.  </P> <P> In California, where democracy itself has been invigorated by 103's passage,  the voters have the power to end the industry's defiance once and for all. One  option is illustrated by the experience of British Columbia. For every dollar  consumers there pay in premiums, their insurance company pays a full dollar  back in claims; investment income covers all expenses and overhead, which  amount to one-third of what California auto insurers spend. For equivalent  coverage, rates are dramatically cheaper in British Columbia than in  California.  </P> <P> Why does the system in British Columbia operate so well? Because in 1974 the  public got fed up with the arrogance and greed of private auto insurance  companies and kicked them out of the state. They were replaced with a  citizen-owned company that operates on a nonprofit basis. The Insurance Corp.  of British Columbia carefully manages claim costs by aggressively promoting  safe driving, negotiating reduced auto-repair rates and health-care charges and  really going after fraud.  </P> <P> But most important, the public loves the corporation. Last summer, Allstate and  other private auto insurers waged a costly campaign to be allowed back into  British Columbia, begging to serve the market they once scorned as  "unprofitable." But consumer support for their auto insurance corporation is so  strong that the state's conservative government refused to let the private  insurers return.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget: Investors shocked by PSBR forecast INVESTORS and City analysts were shocked by the government's forecast that public borrowing in the next fiscal year would rise to Pounds 28bn. Prices in the gilt-edged or government bond market fell sharply as investors recognised that the government would have to sell an increased volume of gilts to finance the borrowing requirement. Immediately after the chancellor's speech, gilt prices fell by about 5/8 . Sterling also lost the modest gains it made during the day, and analysts said the chances of a cut in base rates were much reduced. The pound closed in New York last night at DM2.8691, at the bottom end of its range within the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'I don't see sterling going up very much in the short term.' 'The PSBR was right at the top end of City expectations,' said Mr Gerrard Lyons, economist at Daichi Kangyo, the Japanese bank. He said the sharp rise in PSBR showed the 'sheer scale of the recession', which has reduced government revenues. In the previous Budget the government forecast revenues of Pounds 240bn for 1992-93. However, the chancellor yesterday cut this forecast to Pounds 229.8bn. Mr Lyons said that the delay in economic recovery meant that companies and individuals would earn less than expected and thus pay less in taxes. However, some investors and fund managers feared that the PSBR may turn out to be even higher than the forecast: 'I am anxious that the PSBR is understated by too rosy a forecast of economic growth by the end of this year', said a manager in charge of one of the biggest UK investment funds. Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a forecasting body which uses the Treasury's economic model, said the government's borrowing predictions 'showed realism' about the poor outlook for the next few months. Mr Lyons warned that 'government expenditure may be out of control'. He said that the government may have to pay more in benefits to the unemployed than it currently expected. There were mixed reactions from the chairmen of big City companies and from fund managers. Sir John Cuckney, chairman of Royal Insurance, and of 3i, the UK's biggest provider of long-term finance to small and medium-sized companies, said: 'The economy is like a man who needs a stiff drink. The Budget was a single, but I think it needed a double.' Mr Roger Bartley, chief investment officer at County Natwest Investment Management, said his one concern, a 'personal view', was whether the Budget was over-cautious: 'The tax cut was of assistance to those (the low-paid) who would not normally have voted Tory anyway. That might not have been the best use of money to gain votes.' Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of TSB Group and of the British Bankers Association, praised the government for not cutting taxes further to buy votes: 'I am glad they are taking a long-term view.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cyprus Government demands an upgrading of the  political dialogue on the Cyprus issue and an upgrading of the  support given the UN secretary general by the Security Council  in the efforts to solve the issue. This is the message conveyed  by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis during his contacts with  the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Mikhailidhis,  who has been in New York since yesterday, is expected to  conclude his contacts with all members of the UN Security  Council tonight.    In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation],  Mikhailidhis stressed that he feels there is serious thought  that the UN Security Council is showing strong signs of fatigue  on the Cyprus issue. Mikhailidhis added that in order to  overcome Turkish intransigence, specific directives should be  issued to engage the Security Council and an agenda should be  drawn up on the basis of which Security Council members will  move on the direction of the Turkish side.    This evening, Mikhailidhis will attend a working dinner with  UN official Marrack Goulding. Tomorrow, the foreign minister  will go to Washington where he will meet with U.S. Deputy  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.</p>

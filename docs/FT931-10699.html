			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Fashion: Snails and frogs now talk the international power language THE MOTIF tie has become the power neckwear of the 1990s. Gone are the staid spots, stripes and old school colours; today's high-flyer is wearing a tie decorated with the unlikely power symbols of owls or rabbits, tea-cups or palm trees. For some years, the classic Hermes tie has been the ultimate executive neckwear, outclassing school and regimental ties with its international chic. The chains, ropes, stirrups and anchors of upper-class sporting pursuits were intertwined across the tie in an intricate pattern. And this interlocking style became an international classic, copied by tie manufacturers everywhere. But then, to its traditional themes, Hermes added some audacious designs. From a distance, these ties appear to be just another intertwined or repeated pattern. But to the wearer, or a close observer, it is something far more interesting - the interwoven motif is of an animal, a playful image which subverts the formality of boardroom dressing with its whimsy. Hermes began decorating ties with images of elephants, frogs and even snails. While traditionalists, such as the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Westminster, have remained true to the original patterns, individualists such as Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's former public relations guru, Robert Sangster, the race-horse owner, and Sir David Frost, the television personality, shifted their allegiance to the animal motifs. Hermes believes that motif ties are bought by confident men, those with sufficient power or individuality to break with tradition. Now, every upmarket label is producing motif ties. Some call them pictorials, others call them character ties, but the fashion has taken off, as each company tries to create distinctive designs which combine individuality, wit and elegance. The boardroom tie market is an important one, and not just in terms of design. Hermes has claimed to sell around 800,000 ties a year internationally at Pounds 59 a time. Even a share of that market is significant. The competing labels are making an impact. Paul Karvandi, a senior trader at Paribas, for instance, has noted that the monopoly of the Hermes label is being eroded. 'People are wearing motif ties widely,' he agrees, 'but not always the ones by Hermes. That's particularly true of younger City types, people who started out in the '80s and don't feel tied to tradition in quite the same way as the older executives. 'Quite often, their ties will be from the other houses, who have taken the motif and worked it into a more elegant design. There's a lot of choice out there and there's room for individualism.' The more closely interwoven the motifs, the more conservative the tie initially appears; the more scattered and separated the motifs, the more adventurous the wearer. Some designs retain obvious class associations, with images of horses, bugles and vintage cars. But at the more daring end of the spectrum, there are teacups, skiers, zebras, golfers, bon-bons and gramophones; a wealth of amusing images. Hermes says, naturally, that the copies are the biggest form of flattery. But each label has its own distinct interpretation of the original idea. And motifs come in many moods - they can be witty, graceful, restrained, bold, continental or British - somewhere in that range must be something for almost everyone. Hermes The original and the most expensive (Pounds 59), the variety and depth of its colours remains unrivalled. Its witty designs are still immediately recognisable, but that has been achieved at the cost of sticking to its original look. Hermes still concentrates on its trademark animals; frogs, pelicans, dolphins, seals and fish are current favourites, although recent motifs have also included clouds and tugboats. The most successful, and the real trendsetter, was an owl motif as sported by Sir Tim Bell. Ferragamo It was Ferragamo which really declared motif war. In a series of full-page tie advertisements last year, it went head-to-head with Hermes, and many felt that the Italian label's distinctive, clever little figures and deeper colours surpassed the blunter designs of the French. Ferragamo ties (Pounds 49) feature mainly people - minstrels, musicians, knights - with an historical feel, and the actual motifs are now growing into tiny narrative pictures reminiscent of willow pattern. Colours are rich, even featuring browns and purples. Dunhill Dunhill only entered the motif-market last season. It has tried to capture a particularly playful, English feel. Tea cups, playing cards and music staves featured in its first collection, and themes from English country life will play across the next. Uniquely, it uses Royal College of Art fabric design students, unrestrained by commercial conservatism, to provide ideas; a sea-monster design was the result of this collaboration. While retaining its other, classic tie designs, Dunhill is committed to both wit and vibrant colour across its pictorial ranges (Pounds 49). Gucci There is a small room in Gucci's Bond Street shop in London entirely devoted to ties, and nowhere is the revival of the label's design sense more evident. In linked motifs, its graphic interpretations of skiers, gazelles and striding men have grace and flair. In scattered motifs, its dice, falling leaves and porcelain cups are clever and elegant. With dozens of rich and subtle patterns, it seems that in certain circles Gucci is nowadays considered the most sophisticated motif ties around (Pounds 55). TM Lewin Restraint is the keynote of Jermyn Street style, and that is reflected in the designs at TM Lewin. It is known for the most competitively priced shirts on the street, and its motif ties are also very reasonably priced. At Pounds 24 it has golfers, drums and bugles, and palm trees, at Pounds 20 knights on horseback and, most attractive of all, gramophones. Hilditch &amp; Key Each Hilditch &amp; Key design is available in muted colours. It has a much smaller range (Pounds 29.95, Pounds 24.95 at sale prices), on lighter weight ties. Its scattered golfers, parcels, cars and bon-bons are only available on two backgrounds - a somewhat brash scarlet, but also a very effective black, which sets off the motifs nicely. Charles Tyrwhitt The mail order-only shirtmaker Charles Tyrwhitt (telephone 0252-860940 for a catalogue) has character designs in rich colours in the Hermes style; golfers and polo players, elephants and parrots, and Sir David Steel's favourite, chess knights (Pounds 24.50).</p>

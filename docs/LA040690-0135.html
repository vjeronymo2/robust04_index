			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACE OF CONSUMER CREDIT GROWTH SLOWS  </P> <P> Americans took out $3.4 billion more in consumer credit than they retired in  February, but the pace slowed because of slackening demand for car loans, the  government said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted  annual rate of 5.7%, down from January's revised 6.4% pace.  </P> <P> The January rate was reported last month to have been 5.9%.  </P> <P> Consumer credit, which includes all consumer loans except mortgages, was up  7.3% in December.  </P> <P> Automobile loans advanced in February to a seasonally adjusted $889 million in  February. That represented an annual rate of 3.7%, less than half the 8.4% jump  in January when sales incentives were reinstated. The incentives continued in  February, but consumer response failed to keep up.  </P> <P> Without incentives, auto loans had fallen 0.4% in December.  </P></p>

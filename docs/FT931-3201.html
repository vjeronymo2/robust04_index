			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Self-employed free to assess their own tax THE most far-reaching reform of the personal tax system for nearly 50 years was announced by the chancellor yesterday. It is intended to simplify the chore of filling in tax forms and will mean that about 8m taxpayers will be able to assess their own liability to tax. If the proposals work out as intended taxpayers will normally have to deal with the Inland Revenue once or twice a year when they send in their returns and payments. This should do away with the present system of estimated assessments, appeals, postponements, appeal hearings and revised assessments, the Revenue said. Legislation will be introduced next year but the changes are not due to take effect until the 1996-97 tax year. The first completed self-assessment returns will be due at the beginning of 1998, a year later than suggested in a consultative paper last November. Organisations representing small businesses and the self-employed welcomed the change as further proof of the government's serious intent to reduce the burden of red tape. But Mr Richard Brown, policy director at the British Chambers of Commerce, said he remained unconvinced that there would be a real simplification of procedures. The new system, which is intended to provide taxpayers with just one tax statement and one tax bill for all their income, will affect 4m people who are self-employed or living off investments and a further 4m employees and pensioners who receive tax returns. For the self-employed there are special rules, under the present system, for assessing the profits of the first three and last three years of the business. The chancellor's proposals are designed to sweep away these complications, the Inland Revenue said. Under the new system most tax returns will be accepted without further inquiries but the Revenue will have the right to check any return. If taxpayers fail to send in payments, returns or their accounts on time they will face extra charges. The Revenue believes the new system will lead to substantial savings in time and effort for both taxpayers and itself. But anyone who cannot work out his or her tax bill, or does not wish to do so, can call upon the Revenue to do it for them.</p>

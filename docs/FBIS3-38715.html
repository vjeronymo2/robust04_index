			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social  Democratic Populist Party, state minister, and deputy prime  minister, addressed the people in Corum, where he presented 460  land deeds within the framework of the redevelopment and  renovation plan. [passage omitted]    On the subject of the massacre the Serbs perpetrated on  Sarajevo yesterday, Karayalcin severely condemned the approach  of the United States and European countries on the issue.  Explaining that the above countries were silently watching the  massacre of 68 people in Sarajevo, Karayalcin recalled that  these same countries sent troops when faced with the slightest  disagreement in the Middle East. Karayalcin said:    [Begin Karayalcin recording] We are against Islamic  radicalism. We refuse to recognize Islamic radicalism and  regimes that are not secular. As Turkish republicans, we are  against all attacks against laicism; but while we, on the one  hand, reject Muslim initiatives that are not secular, we cannot,  on the other hand, accept or stomach Christian radicalism. I  would like to ask you dear citizens of Corum, if the world would  be as silent as it is now if the inhabitants of Sarajevo were  not Muslims or if they were Jews instead of Muslims. [end  recording]    Karayalcin further stated that the countries that are not  intervening in Sarajevo should at least extend military aid to  the Muslims living there. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: Built in America - Paula Deitz on the Frank Lloyd Wright exhibitions in New York 'We will never have a culture of our own until we have an architecture of our own,' is how Frank Lloyd Wright expressed his main idea to the people of Marin County, California in 1957 when he designed their Civic Center, the final building of his career. During his 70-year career which began in the Arts and Crafts movement and ended in soaring designs at the threshold of the space age, Wright never lacked for words or ideas in his mission to create an architecture that became a vehicle for his views. He also oversaw the design of all publications dealing with his buildings to control how people perceived them. This is interesting to keep in mind as one plunges into the Museum of Modern Art's major retrospective, Frank Lloyd Wright: Architect, which features 350 original drawings; 30 scale models, some newly constructed; six full-scale mock-ups of innovative wall sections; photographs and assorted architectural and decorative fragments, covering 190 buildings and projects. And yet, the picture is not complete without viewing four other concurrent Wright exhibitions in New York: his decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Pedro E. Guerrero's photographs of Wright at work and play over a 20-year period, at the Lobby Gallery; the Guggenheim Museum's survey of drawings for its own building; and finally, at Columbia University's Arthur Ross Architecture Gallery, a revealing look at the rare Wasmuth Folios, the 1910-1911 Berlin publication that paired Wright's selection of photographs and lithographs. Because Wright orchestrated a unified whole that took into account every detail of furnishings inside and landscaping outside, the term architect seems too limiting a definition. He called himself a farmer, architect and collector, acknowledging his origins in the Wisconsin countryside and his fascination with the objects he integrated into his interiors. He had the ability to make a masterpiece out of the quotidian - and did for over 300 suburban American houses. At MoMA, the exhibition begins with the low-slung prairie house of the Mid-west, the drawings demonstrating the various stages in devising the pinwheel arms that rotate around the central vertical element, the hearth. Placed under a massing of horizontal rooftops, these houses with overhanging eaves and prowlike profiles exude protective warmth. Unfortunately, what the multitude of drawings for each house conveys is lacking in the newly made and colourful models. Wright, in matching photographs with lithographs, found the diagonal views more dynamic: distant elevations of houses terraced into hillsides makes them appear like some elaborate Lamaist temples in Tibet. In comparison the models appear flat and static. In reality, his settings do direct visitors to the diagonal angle; nothing in American architecture equals the view of the cantilevered concrete terraces as seen from below the waterfall at Fallingwater, his Pennsylvania house for the Kaufmanns. Though not as sumptuous as the prairie houses, the more modest Usonian houses he devised conserved space with built-in furniture and cabinetry. Curiously, their compact, organised spaces are liberating. And the Textile Block houses in California, with their repeated designs of plain and ornamental concrete blocks that were also economical, exude an exoticism akin to Mayan architecture that suits their Los Angeles and Hollywood settings. In 1905 Wright went to Japan, where his influence is still strong, if only to preserve his buildings. Indeed the Imperial Hotel, before its demise, was like a great Meiji shrine. His admiration for the techniques of old Japanese prints influenced his style of presentation drawings. His career was like a tide that kept coming in, bringing something new each time. He was a magician of style, always with something new up his sleeve, and passionately devoted to the quality of life in an America where he sought to integrate agrarian values into suburban communities. He titled a photograph of himself standing behind his drafting board like some short order cook: 'I am an architect. What'll you have?'</p>

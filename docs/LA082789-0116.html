			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET SATIRE  </P> <P> I was glad to see your review of "Soviet Humor: The Best of Krokodil" (Book  Review, Aug. 13), as I will be hosting a delegation of Soviet humorists (some  of them writers for Krokodil) at UCLA in October. The event, which is jointly  sponsored by Antioch University and UCLA Extension, will discuss similarities  and differences between American and Russian humor, and will feature several  well-know American humorists as well. Information: (213) 825-5362.  </P> <P> A minor cavil: The cartoons in "Soviet Humor" are not all caricatures, as your  reviewer suggests. They range from the whimsical to the philosophical and  include many skillful, artistic, and thought-provoking drawings.  </P> <P> HARVEY MINDESS  </P> <P> ANTIOCH UNIVERSITY  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

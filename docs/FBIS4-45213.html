			<p>BFN     [Text] Heavy fighting continued between Khun Sa's army and  Burmese troops in Shan State close to the Thai border.  According to a recent report, Burma sent 10 battalions more of  reinforcements in an attempt to retake Mong Chot.    A reliable source reported to MATICHON on 23 May that,  during  the night of 22 May, 10 battalions of the 23d brigade, with its  stronghold west of the Salween River and about eight kilometers  from Mong Chot, mounted an offensive against Khun Sa's soldiers  and managed to take back the military stronghold at Mong Chot at  dawn on 23 May. There was no report on the casualties of both  sides, but Khun Sa's men reportedly pulled back from Mong Chot  toward Doi Na Mu and Doi Nam Cham.    As for the situation in Chiang Mai, MATICHON's correspondent  reported intense fighting at the border in Wiang Haeng, Mae Ai,  and Fang Districts in Chiang Mai. There was also fierce  fighting opposite Muang District of Mae Hong Son Province, about  10 kilometers from the Thai-Burmese border, with the two sides  pounding artillery fire on each other continuously.    The source reported that Khun Sa's troops advanced toward  Thachilek-Napong and, in the past two days, launched three  attacks on Burmese Government troops, killing and wounding many.  They apparently wanted to capture Thachilek. The Burmese  border pass at Thachilek opposite Mae Sai in Chiang Rai was  closed, as the Burmese military was recruiting men to be porters  and soldiers. It also wanted to black out news about the  situation in Burma to keep it from leaking to the Thai side.    Meanwhile, Mr. Kansai Chaiyen, a leading member of the Shan  State Restoration Council, said the Burmese Government proposed  a cease-fire negotiation after three weeks of fighting. Burma  claimed that several factions of Khun Sa's army had already  agreed to a cease-fire negotiation. However, the Shan State  Restoration Council made it clear that there would be a  negotiation only when Burmese troops had pulled out from Shan  State, and that the negotiation be conducted in a country other  than Burma.</p>

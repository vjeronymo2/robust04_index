			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY, CABLE FIRMS' FIGHT HEATS UP  </P> <P> In the first of what promises to be a long series of high-stakes legal  proceedings, the Orange County assessment appeals board Wednesday heard opening  testimony in the rancorous dispute between the county's cable television  companies and county Tax Assessor Bradley Jacobs.  </P> <P> The controversy centers on radically higher property tax assessments that  Jacobs imposed on 10 county cable-TV operators last year. The cable companies  say the new assessments, which in some cases have increased property tax bills  nearly 400%, are discriminatory and illegal.  </P> <P> Jacobs and his deputies maintain they are simply responding to the rapid  appreciation in the value of cable TV franchises and meeting their  Constitutional obligation to assess all property at fair market value.  </P> <P> Cable companies and county tax assessors in several other areas of the state  are embroiled in a similar controversy.  </P> <P> Until Wednesday, the dispute in Orange County had been played out largely in a  series of newspapers advertisements, press releases and cable-TV bill inserts  put out by the cable companies. The cable operators say the new tax assessments  will require a $1 to $2 per month increase in basic cable rates. Several  companies have already added the charges to consumers' bills.  </P> <P> The three-person assessment appeals board, a quasi-judicial body appointed by  the county Board of Supervisors, will ultimately decide whether to uphold or  reduce Jacobs' assessments on individual companies.  </P> <P> The board's decisions can be challenged in state court, and they often are in  important cases. In addition, 10 cable companies have also sued the county,  Jacobs and other officials, alleging that the new assessments violate their  Constitutional rights.  </P> <P> Wednesday's hearing, inauspiciously convened in a dilapidated Civic Center  hearing room, involved American Television &amp; Communications Corp., a  subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. that operates the Cablevision system in the city  of Orange.  </P> <P> ATC's property tax increase, from $122,607 in 1988 (based on an assessed value  of $11.8 million) to $189,359 in 1989 (on a value of $18.3 million), was  actually much less than for many of the other companies because the ATC system  has not been sold in recent years.  </P> <P> Proposition 13 places a 2% cap on the amount that an assessment can be  increased in one year unless there's a change in ownership. The ATC increase,  however, also reflects an assessment for new construction, which is not  shielded by Prop. 13. ATC and the other companies are also disputing  retroactive "escape" assessments that require additional tax payments for  1985-1988.  </P> <P> In arguments that will be repeated again as the nine other firms move through  the appeals process later this year, cable company attorney Paul Gordon said  his client's property consists of "fairly sophisticated electronic equipment,  several hundred miles of cables and a large number of converter boxes." He said  the property tax assessment should be based on the replacement cost of that  equipment, minus depreciation.  </P> <P> "The assessor," Gordon maintained, "is taking the business value and saying all  the value of our business is in the property." That methodology, he said,  results in an assessment that is "off the chart," a property value far higher  than any buyer would reasonably pay.  </P> <P> Gordon also asserted that the assessor had decided that "we should be treated  differently from all other businesses because we are a monopoly." Cable-TV  companies, he argued, are not in fact monopolies.  </P> <P> The assessor's representatives -- two county attorneys and three deputy  assessors led by Ron Cooper -- declined to present an opening argument. But in  a brief filed with the board, the assessor notes that three methods --  replacement cost, income and comparable sales data -- can legitimately be used  in computing property values.  </P> <P> The brief states: "The evidence in this matter will show that comparable sales  data and income data support a fair market value much in excess of the  replacement cost data urged by American." Because the system would be bought  and sold as a unit, it should be valued as a unit, and not as the sum of its  hardware, the assessor maintains.  </P> <P> The assessor also contends that "because of the de facto monopoly status, this  cable television business has virtually no income or market value which can be  attributed to enterprise activity, good will or any other excludable  intangible." Intangible assets are specifically exempted from property tax by  the state Constitution.  </P></p>

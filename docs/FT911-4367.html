			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Jobless tops 2m after biggest ever monthly rise UNEMPLOYMENT in Britain passed the 2m mark in March with the biggest monthly increase on record, unleashing fierce criticism of the government a fortnight ahead of the local elections. The Department of Employment's announcement that seasonally-adjusted unemployment rose by 113,000 to 2.1m last month led to heated clashes in the House of Commons over the government's economic record and renewed speculation about the timing of the general election. The record rise pushed up the unemployment rate to 7.4 per cent, from 7 per cent in February. Unemployment has risen for 12 consecutive months and by almost half a million since the rise began. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said: 'Mr Major's classless society is now a jobless society for over 2m unemployed.' Separate figures deepened the gloom as the government announced the biggest fall in manufacturing output for three years. Between January and February, output declined by 1.6 per cent. Officials said the rate of decline was increasing and there was no sign of the recession reaching a trough. Opposition parties called for further cuts in interest rates which were echoed in private by some Conservative MPs. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, however, told the Commons that cuts would depend on further falls in the inflation rate. Figures published yesterday also showed that average earnings across the whole economy rose 9 1/4 per cent in the year to February - compared with an annual rise of 9 1/2 per cent to January. Smaller bonuses and a drop in overtime hours worked had produced the drop, officials said. It would be hasty to attribute it to an easing in inflationary wage settlements. Mr Major's close advisers insist that an unexpectedly good result in the May local elections could yet persuade him to seek a new mandate in June. However, yesterday's figures, which confirmed that the brunt of the jobless rise is being felt in Conservative-held seats in south-east England, reinforced the view of most ministers that the autumn now looks the earliest possible general election date. There has been the first substantial rise in service sector unemployment - concentrated in the south-east - since 1982, with a rise of 82,000 in the last quarter of 1990. With any improvement in the employment outlook likely to lag the expected upturn in the economy later in the year, some senior colleagues believe that the prime minister would do better to wait until next year before calling an election. Labour plans an intensive campaign to taunt Mr Major for his refusal to call a summer poll, using it to reinforce its charge that the prime minister is a 'ditherer'. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, called Mr Major the 'prime minister of unemployment'. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, said the UK unemployment rate was lower than the European Community average of an estimated 8.5 per cent last month. As the government was 'clearly winning the battle against inflation,' there would be a return to employment growth, he said. For the short-term, however, most economists expect unemployment to rise for another year. The employment department said the underlying trend - based on the rate over the three months to March - had risen to 83,500 a month. On an unadjusted basis, the jobless total increased by 97,000 to 2.1m. Output decline Page 10R&amp;D falls Page 10 Editorial comment Page 22 Money Markets Page 39 London Stocks Page 48</p>

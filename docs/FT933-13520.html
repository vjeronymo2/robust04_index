			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (8): Banks re-think lending policy - John Gapper considers the risks posed by small businesses OF ALL sectors of corporate finance, lending to small and medium-sized businesses faces the greatest uncertainties. British banks have been forced into a fundamental re-think both of the terms on which they do such business, and even whether they should be doing it at all. While banks ponder their future in the market, smaller businesses are themselves considering ways to avoid more exposure to loans after poor experiences. Both sides are licking their wounds after a wave of company failures that emerged as big provisions on bank balance sheets. This sense of uncertainty is relatively new for small corporate finance. Lending to the sector has appeared the last, best hope of many British banks after the process of disintermediation of large corporate business which flourished in the 1980s cut lending margins to wafer-thin levels. In contrast to larger corporate lending margins of below 50 basis points - or half a percentage point - small firms have been forced to obtain money at up to 6.5 percentage points above base. This form of traditional bank business logically offers the best hope of higher returns on capital. Apart from the size of margin, small corporate lending also tends automatically to attract other fee-earning business for which banks have to press large companies. Fees for services such as clearing cheques not only raise overall profits, but help to support the cost of branch networks. However, the assumptions underlying much small corporate business have been put in question by the experience of the last UK economic cycle. Banks failed to assess the risks of lending in the over-heated economic surge of the late 1980s, and were caught in the backlash of corporate failure. Despite the attention attracted by the well-known cases of corporate failure, many of the banks' bad debt problems have been caused by small firms. Nearly half National Westminster's bad debt provisions of Pounds 1.3bn in branch banking last year were on loans of less than Pounds 50,000 - both corporate and personal. Banks have drawn three lessons from these problems. The first is that they have assessed the level of risk wrongly. The second is that much of what they took to be retrievable loan capital was in effect equity. The third is that they did not have enough data to understand their debtors. The problem with the re-assessment of risk is that small business lending risk is closely allied to the severity of economic cycles. This means that much of the calculation of future risk depends on which view the bank takes of Britain achieving more stability. Assuming greater stability in future, banks would be wrong to price loans to compensate for a similar wave of corporate failure. Such pricing would raise margins drastically, and would risk them losing market share to others, or to other forms of financing such as leasing and factoring. The second lesson is illustrated by the fact that NatWest estimates that 25 per cent of the 1m small companies who deal with the bank are continuously overdrawn. They are thus clearly not using the whole of their overdraft facilities purely as an occasional source of working capital. The problem is what action banks need to take. The British preference for shorter-term sources of financing - notably the overdraft which is not available in many other countries - is not something banks can correct alone, although most are putting more effort into extolling fixed rate loans. One answer would be to try to provide more equity capital to small companies on the model of Germany. However, few UK commercial banks have the expertise at branch level to feel confident in taking equity stakes. Moves towards developing venture capital expertise have so far been limited. Nonetheless, UK bankers are getting increasingly worried about the traditional structure of lending. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of HSBC's UK subsidiary Midland Bank, has called for banks to find ways of encouraging equity stakes, including the offer of equity options to small firms. The third lesson is that banks have discovered little they know about many of the 3.3m small firms with which they have relationships. Partly this is because some relaxed diligence of new propositions in the late 1980s as asset price rises seemed to make them needless. Banks tend to argue that this is partly because companies do not know enough about their own businesses. Barclays Bank recently published survey figures showing that 54 per cent of British small businesses do not have a financial plan that includes budgets, and analysis of cash flow. Nonetheless, banks are actively thinking of ways in which to encourage the businesses with which they deal to collect and forward more thorough information. Some banks are also trying to monitor account movements to identify earlier those companies which are heading into financial problems. These developments pose two questions for small business financing. The first is whether particular banks are likely to build a greater market share by moving aggressively into the market while others hold back. The other is whether forms of non-bank finance will achieve more prominence. As far as individual banks are concerned, the one most likely to build market share appears to be Midland. It has gained both greater capital strength, and treasury and trade finance resources from the HSBC acquisition last year. The bank has been emphasising this in marketing efforts. As far as wider competition is concerned, leasing and factoring companies and bank subsidiaries are emphasising the benefits of alternative forms of finance. However, the overall structure of small corporate finance appears to depend above all on bank strategies. For the moment, relatively weak loan demand means that banks and their customers are not faced by hard choices. But the hardest question for both sides is whether they will force the changes about which they are talking when the recovery picks up, and real choices have to be made.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / German health care system in recovery: Insurance surplus after spending cuts GERMANY'S loss-making health care system has recorded a rare surplus following strict curbs on health spending introduced earlier this year, Mr Horst Seehofer, the federal health minister, announced yesterday. State-subsidised health insurance schemes, which finance health care for 90 per cent of Germans, recorded a DM2.6bn (Pounds 1.04bn) surplus in the first six months of the year after reporting a DM9bn loss last year. Health spending per person covered by the schemes decreased by 2.7 per cent for the period after increasing in 1992 by 9.2 per cent. 'The health insurance system is now healthy again. We have succeeded in changing the behaviour of everyone involved in the health care system and in proving that genuine structural changes are possible,' Mr Seehofer said at a press conference. Expenses for general medical treatment fell by 2.1 per cent in the first half of the year while spending on dental care dropped by 2 per cent. More than 20 per cent less was spent on medicines. Spending on auxiliary health treatment such as massages went down by 10.2 per cent. The health minister hailed the decreases as the result of a hard-fought reform of the German health care system which came into effect last January. He said that he was hopeful that reforms would result in targeted savings in state subsidies of DM10bn. Steady increases in health care spending in recent years prompted German politicians to unite in a rare show of cross-party support last year and introduce unpopular reforms of the system. The reforms include severe budget ceilings for medicines and treatment prescribed by doctors and hospitals. Expenses incurred above those levels must be borne by patients, although heavy fines can be imposed upon doctors prescribing superfluous treatment. The reforms have been attacked by the whole medical profession, including the country's dentists who have had to reduce their expenses by 35 per cent this year, partly as a result of the reform eliminating treatment 'not necessary to health care'. The German federation of dentists yesterday said that patients were merely holding back from obtaining needed treatment because they feared having to pay for it. The dentists also warned that the reduction in health spending was only temporary. The reforms, which also list drugs which can no longer be covered by the national health system, have infuriated the German pharmaceutical industry. The industry claims that the policies being followed by the government in Bonn are largely responsible for the drastic decline in their revenues this year.</p>

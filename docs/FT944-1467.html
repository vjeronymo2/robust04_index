			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Observer: Ping-pong Bad luck all those hoping to get in a round or two when next visiting China. Yesterday the state planning commission reinforced a freeze on all new luxury projects until the end of 1995. New golf courses and race tracks will be delayed in the hope that fixed-asset prices will not continue to soar. Of course, the only result will be sky-rocketing secondary trading of golf club memberships . . .</p>

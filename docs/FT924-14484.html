			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Tajikistan peace force planned PRESIDENTS of the Commonwealth of Independent States, fearing Tajikistan's worsening war and the growing influence of its Islamic groups, plan to deploy a peacekeeping force to separate the combatants, officials in Dushanbe said yesterday. The fighting, which has killed more than 2,000 people this year, paralysed the local economy and left the government in chaos, is a main topic at a CIS presidential summit which starts today in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan's neighbour, which is potentially threatened by the violence. Tajikistan's combatants have agreed to accept a peacekeeping force from Kyrgyzstan, political leaders said in interviews. But, a month after a coup removed hardline President Rakhmon Nabiyev, the Commonwealth's south-eastern corner still seems unlikely to stabilise soon. Diplomats say this is partly because arms are flowing in to each side from Afghanistan and elsewhere, and neither is likely to surrender when power is at stake. Both sides have become only more polarised in recent weeks, as Islamic leaders behind the new government have largely marginalised their secular allies in the former opposition to Mr Nabiyev. Now, Tajikistan's most powerful political forces are the republic's paramount Moslem leader, Qazi (judge) Akhbar Toradzon Zoda, and the Islamic Renaissance party. The attempt to pacify Tajikistan follows more than a year of upheaval. In May, Mr Nabiyev surrendered one-third of his 24-member cabinet to the opposition after a bloody, 51-day standoff in Dushanbe. Immediately afterward, however, ethnic warfare broke out between regions loyal to the competing political sides. On September 7, Mr Nabiyev was lured to Dushanbe Airport, where armed men from a group calling itself Tajikistan Youth forced him to resign. Fighting escalated, despite his removal. A key concern of Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been release of the beleaguered 201st CIS division, which has been trapped by the fighting. The fighting has alarmed Mr Islam Karimov, the Uzbekistan president, who has tightened the border considerably in recent weeks. Rail services from Uzbekistan have been halted, except for trains from Moscow. The chief aim of the proposed peacekeeping force is to dislodge the warring forces from the southern region of Kurgan-Tyube, where almost all the fighting has taken place. Villages near the region have emptied, as tens of thousands of refugees have fled. The Kyrgyz force would be deployed in two areas, according to Mr Shadman Usupov, chairman of Tajikistan's Democratic party - the town of Kaleninabad, north of Kurgan-Tyube, and at the Sharshar Pass, just north of the southern region of Kulyab, a stronghold of Mr Nabiyev. Tajikistan was left without a national army when the Soviet Union dissolved last December. The new government is being defended by combined forces loyal to the IRP and Mr Zoda, the Islamic leader. Their forces are mostly from the eastern region of Garm, and have received hundreds of guns from Afghan rebels, military officials say. The anti-government side is composed almost entirely of men from Kulyab, and has been armed in the past from government caches. Other weapons have come from CIS arsenals. Two weeks ago, for example, anti-government forces stole four Soviet tanks and six other armoured vehicles from the 201st. 'We cannot be safe when any gang can take a tank and destroy a city or a village,' said Tajikistan's deputy KGB chief, Mr Jurabek Aminov.</p>

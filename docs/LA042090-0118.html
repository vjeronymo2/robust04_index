			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> UPS AND DOWNS: A week ago Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was all smiles over being  named to Rolling Stone's environmentalist Hall of Fame, but this week it's bad  press. . . . The American Spectator, a national conservative journal, called  Agran in a six-page article the "Evil Emperor of Irvine, California." . . .  Agran is "a serpent (that) slipped into the garden," the article charges, but  Agran calls it "desperation journalism." Steve Emmons and David Reyes  </P></p>

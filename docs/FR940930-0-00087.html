			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Provisions of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this final rule, we are deleting the conditions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage specified in 42 CFR part 494, subpart B, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammography suppliers must meet to qualify for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage of the services under the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, we are cross-referencing the applicable FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification requirements, published in the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that suppliers of the services must meet effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on our analysis of section 354 of the PHS Act, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added by the MQSA, and the related FDA interim regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe that we have fulfilled our responsibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish quality standards under section 1834(c)(3) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act by adopting the quality standards and related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification requirements specified in the FDA regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1834(c)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish standards to ensure the safety and accuracy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening mammography services performed under Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part B. The quality standards that must be established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include: (1) Standards that require the use of equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically designed for mammography and that meet other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiological standards established by the Secretary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography; (2) standards that require that the mammography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be performed by individuals who are licensed by a State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform radiological procedures, or who are certified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified to perform radiological procedures by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate program as the Secretary specifies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations; (3) standards that require that the results of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mammography be interpreted by a physician who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified as qualified to interpret radiological procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by such an appropriate board (or program) as the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes in regulations; and (4) requirements that, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to a woman's first screening mammography performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which payment is made under the program, the results of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mammography will be placed in the woman's permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the FDA interim final rule, 21 CFR subpart B,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;900.11 (``Requirements for certification''), paragraph (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that after October 1, 1994, ``a certificate issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by FDA will be required for lawful operation of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities'' and that in order to obtain a certificate from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA, facilities ``are required to meet the quality standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;900.12 and to be accredited by an accrediting body  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved by FDA'' as described in 21 CFR part 900, subpart A,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;900.1 through 900.7. In &sect;900.12 of the interim final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, FDA established standards for mammography equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel, and practices. These standards are substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same as the Medicare interim quality standards that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on December 31, 1990, but when they do differ from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing Medicare standards, they still appear to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with our mandate under section 1834(c)(3) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Thus, this final rule will remove the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare interim quality standards and, instead, will cross-refer to applicable interim FDA certification requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for mammography services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we are making several technical and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying revisions in the remaining provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing interim regulations that we published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510). With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exception of two points of clarification, a technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, and certain conforming changes to part 405,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart E (``Criteria for Determination of Reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Charges; Payment for Services of Hospital Interns,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Residents, and Supervising Physicians''), the rationale for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these revisions is discussed in the ``Discussion of Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments'' in section III. of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;405.534 (``Limitation on payment for screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography services''), we are making technical changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-refer to the fee schedule for physicians' services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current &sect;405.534 refers to &sect;405.533. The latter was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from the CFR on November 25, 1991, with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of the fee schedule for physicians' services in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 59622). We are also revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (c) and (d) so that, effective for a screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mammography procedure furnished beginning January 1, 1995,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the payment for the screening mammography procedure reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relationship between the relative value units for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional and technical components established for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic mammography procedure under the physicians' fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule. Effective January 1, 1995, the apportionment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the payment limit between the professional and technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components will be changed to reflect the relationship of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the two components for diagnostic bilateral mammograms under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fee schedule for physicians' services for 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Embargoed by KYODO until "approximately" 0400 GMT] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) President Yohei Kono urged Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Monday to hand over power, saying the  seven-month-old coalition government has completed its mission.    Kono, speaking at the start of a three-day interpellation  session at the Diet, said the Hosokawa Cabinet has piled up  policy errors.    The leader of the main opposition party criticized Hosokawa  for carrying over compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to this  year, revoking a "national welfare tax" plan, failing to reach  agreement in trade framework talks with the United States and  giving up a cabinet reshaping plan.    "The Hosokawa Cabinet has now finished its mission," he  said.    Kono accused Hosokawa of failing to maintain a consistent  basic political stance following changes in the balance of power  in the seven-party coalition.    Kono said the Japanese people are concerned that the  country's future may go in an unfavorable direction under  threats from a behind-the-scenes strongman. He did not identify  the man but was apparently alluding to chief coalition  strategist Ichiro Ozawa.    The breakdown in the February summit between Hosokawa and  U.S. President Bill Clinton led to the reinstatement of the  "Super 301" trade provision that gives the U.S. Government broad  powers to impose sanctions, he said.    Representatives of political parties are scheduled to speak  Monday through Wednesday in response to Friday's policy speeches  by Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.    Komeito's Nobuaki Futami and the LDP's Koji Kakizawa will  speak after Kono at Monday's plenary session of the House of  Representatives.</p>

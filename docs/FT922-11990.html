			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Late accounts levies expected to hit 15% of UK companies UP TO 15 per cent of British companies will face automatic levies for late filing of accounts from July, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The levies will be in addition to the fines that can be imposed as a result of criminal charges against individual directors for late filing of accounts with Companies House. Directors from less than 1 per cent of late-filing companies were prosecuted last year. Public companies are obliged to file accounts within seven months of their year-end, while private companies have another three months' grace. A survey by Peat Marwick has revealed that more than 22,700 companies - a mixture of public and private - were 10 months or more late in filing on April 2. The firm suspects that many companies delay filing to avoid exposing their financial difficulties to credit rating agencies and banks. The firm looked at the 147,608 most active private and public companies in a database established by ICC Lotus One Source and updated monthly from Companies House records. Under the new system, directors of the companies concerned will still face personal fines of up to Pounds 2,000 for not submitting accounts. Companies House has had little incentive to pursue offenders because of the cost of prosecution and the fact that fines disappeared into central government funds. The new system means companies will be obliged to pay immediately and the penalties will go directly to offset Companies House costs. Companies House is no longer a government department but was devolved to an agency under the government's Next Steps programme in 1988. The levies will be imposed when accounts are received. A 1989 amendment to the 1985 Companies Act makes the offence absolute, with no excuses permitted. Court proceedings are not needed. The penalties are banded for lateness of up to three, six, 12 and more than 12 months. They range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,000 for private companies, and from Pounds 500 to Pounds 5,000 for public companies. On the basis of the Peat Marwick study, Companies House could receive Pounds 11.35m in penalties when accounts are finally submitted. Peat Marwick carried out the study to find leads for its recovery services and considered late filing might be an indicator of trouble. The numbers discovered surprised the firm. Mr Alan Benzie, Peat Marwick's managing partner in Manchester, said: 'Many companies claim they are late because accounts have not been finalised, but there are always some late filers who delay for tactical reasons. 'Filing makes public a business's profitability and liquidity, or lack of such. This may affect credit rating and can therefore impact on a company's chances of survival. In some cases, companies may wish to conceal an auditor's qualification as to on-going viability.' Company failures rise by 31%, Page 8</p>

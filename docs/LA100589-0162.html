			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS ADD BIT OF GREEN TO SECONDARY, MAKING CORNERBACK GRAY AREA  </P> <P> UCLA's young secondary got a little younger last week, when freshman Carlton  Gray started at cornerback in the Bruins' 24-6 victory over California.  </P> <P> A true freshman hadn't started for the Bruins since Jan. 1, 1985, when tailback  Gaston Green opened in the Fiesta Bowl against Miami. And a true freshman  hadn't started on defense for UCLA since 1983, when cornerback Chuckie Miller  did it against Brigham Young University.  </P> <P> In many ways, though, Gray is not like most freshmen.  </P> <P> Intelligent and serious-minded, he finished fourth in his senior class of 198  last spring at Forest Park High School in Cincinnati, earning better than a  straight-A average while taking accelerated academic courses.  </P> <P> And athletically, the 6-foot-2, 180-pound Gray is talented enough to draw  interest from almost all the major college football powers, eventually deciding  on UCLA after first announcing that he would sign with Miami.  </P> <P> A grandson of Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, Gray won the Dial Award last spring as the  nation's outstanding high school scholar-athlete.  </P> <P> In some ways, though, Gray is no different than any other freshman away from  home for the first time.  </P> <P> Only a few weeks ago, in fact, he was so homesick that his mother, Patricia  Hooks, believed that the youngest of her two sons might pack up and leave and  show up on her doorstep at any moment.  </P> <P> "I think he had that in the back of his mind," she said. "But I told him,  'You've made a commitment. It's too early to decide to go someplace else.' "  </P> <P> In the weeks since, Gray has moved up on the depth chart, making his debut as a  reserve strong safety and nickel safety against San Diego State, then playing  those same positions against Michigan.  </P> <P> Last week, his coaches moved him back to cornerback, which was the position he  played in fall camp, and into the starting lineup ahead of Randy Beverly, who  is hampered by a broken toe.  </P> <P> Gray, 18, is expected to start again Saturday night at the Rose Bowl against  Arizona State.  </P> <P> "Football has really helped me get over the homesickness," Gray said. "Since  I'm playing, I don't constantly think about being away from home."  </P> <P> His mother has noticed.  </P> <P> "He's settling in," she said. "I can tell the difference in his voice."  </P> <P> Like most first-year Bruins, Gray expected to spend a year on the sidelines as  a redshirt. Before this season, UCLA had used only four true freshmen in four  years.  </P> <P> Injuries, suspensions and poor grades, however, have taken five defensive backs  out of the Bruins' lineup, and Gray was the first freshman to step forward and  show that he is ready to contribute.  </P> <P> (Another freshman, Patrick Bates of Galveston, Tex., may start at strong safety  Saturday night in place of sophomore Matt Darby, who is listed as doubtful  after pinching a nerve in his neck last week.)  </P> <P> Bill Rees, UCLA's recruiting coordinator, considered Gray one of the nation's  top five defensive-back prospects last season, but he said that Gray has  exceeded even the Bruins' high expectations.  </P> <P> "He's been advanced in regard to his poise and his understanding of the  coverages and what's expected of him," Rees said. "He's a very heady player for  a guy so young. He's very bright, has very good instincts and anticipates very  well.  </P> <P> "Larry Coyer (who coaches UCLA's defensive backs) calls it moxie. He says  Carlton has a great deal of moxie."  </P> <P> The son of a businessman and an elementary school teacher -- his father,  divorced from his mother, owns a country-music radio station in Vevay, Ind. --  Gray also has a great deal of athletic talent.  </P> <P> He was a multisport star at Forest Park, where he gained All-American  recognition in football and basketball and ran on the school's state champion  400-meter relay team. Depending on how he feels at the end of the season, he  may play basketball at UCLA, too. Last November, Gray said, he seriously  considered signing a letter of intent to play basketball at Stanford.  </P> <P> He ultimately chose football over basketball.  </P> <P> "I just felt, in the long run, I'd have a better chance to play professionally  in football than in basketball, because of the numbers," he said.  </P> <P> His goals at UCLA, in order of preference, are to earn a degree, win "not just  one, but at least two national championships" and earn recognition not only as  an All-American, but also as an academic All-American.  </P> <P> At first, he said, his loneliness affected his relationship with his new  coaches and might have held him back.  </P> <P> "I wasn't responsive," he said. "I wasn't talking back or anything, but I was  moping around."  </P> <P> His high school coach, Lou Cynkar, who considers Gray a close friend, said of  his former student: "Unless you know him well, he stays kind of locked up in a  shell. He can be funny -- he can be a kid -- but he's a serious kid."  </P> <P> In the last few weeks, though, Gray has started to relax.  </P> <P> Still, he's a little surprised to be playing so much so soon.  </P> <P> "My biggest strength is that I've been able to pick up the system and been able  to recognize formations," he said. "Of course, that comes through help from  Eric Turner and Matt Darby and Dion Lambert (his teammates in UCLA's  secondary). They constantly talk to me."  </P> <P> So does his mother, who arrives tonight for a weekend visit.  </P> <P> "I've built up a pretty big phone bill," Gray admitted.  </P> <P> And, in a short time, a pretty good reputation, too.  </P></p>

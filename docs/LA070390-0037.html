			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA'S NEW ABORTION LAW  </P> <P> What an excellent idea. I can't believe how blind our human race is. "Terminate  pregnancy" -- please, just state the facts. To kill an unborn human being  because of his or her place of residence, the mother's womb.  </P> <P> Women do have rights -- not to have sex, and not to get pregnant via  contraceptives. But should we really have the right to take another's unborn  life?  </P> <P> These unborn children are alive. Can we really continue to deny what is  happening -- killing. Whether you "want" a child or not is a moot point. You  have the child already. Letting the child live or die is the issue. We don't  always get what we "want." But to kill a human being unborn isn't a "right" for  anyone to have. Go Louisiana!  </P> <P> CATHY FRENKLING  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

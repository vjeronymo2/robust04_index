			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry says Czech Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec will visit Vietnam soon. We now review  the relations between Vietnam and Czech.    It will be an official visit by a Czech foreign minister in  two years since the country separated into the Federation of  Czech and Slovakia and it also is the first visit by a foreign  minister from an Eastern European country following the end of  the Cold War. The visit will be made in an international  situation, which is changing positively.    Czech has attached a great importance to its traditional  relations with Vietnam and other Asia-Pacific countries. Over  many years, and particularly in the past two years, the  relations between Vietnam and the Czechslovak Federation in  general and Czech in particular, have been constantly  consolidated and developed. Exchange of high-level visits has  been made. Czech has helped Vietnam in training of thousands of  students and apprentices and post-graduate students. Many now  hold important positions in leading offices of Vietnam.    Vietnam and Czech have had labor cooperation for many years.  In the near future, the two countries will continue to sign  agreements on labor cooperation under which thousands of  Vietnamese guest workers will be dispatched to Czech every year.  Czech has also agreed to grant gratuitous aid to Vietnam in  training another 200 Vietnamese apprentices and given 12  scholarships to university students to study in Czech. The  Czech Government has granted 13 million U.S. dollars in aid to  help repatriate Vietnamese guest workers due to changes in  Eastern Europe. In 1993, two-way trade turnover between Vietnam  and Czech reached 13 million U.S. dollars.    During the coming visit to Vietnam, the Czech prime minister  will be accompanied by dozens of businessmen to study Vietnam's  domestic and foreign policies and economic renovation and to  seek the possibility of strengthening and expanding cooperation  with Vietnam in the new era.</p>

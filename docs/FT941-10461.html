			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Freeman accepts Pounds 19m Sheffield Insulations bid Sheffield Insulations, the distributor of thermal insulation and related products, yesterday made an agreed bid for Freeman Group, valuing the insulation, distribution and fabrication specialist at Pounds 18.6m. Mr Bill Forrester, Sheffield chief executive, said the acquisition would strengthen the company's UK insulation distribution activities, and would provide 'an important new base in continental Europe.' Sheffield is offering eight of its ordinary shares for every nine Freeman. At yesterday's closing price of 288p, up 18p, the offer was worth 256p per Freeman share. Freeman shares, up 22p to 242p yesterday, were standing at 204p on January 17, the last dealing day before the announcement of a possible offer. A mix and match offer gives Freeman shareholders the chance to accept instead cash and loan notes to the value of 225p a share. This would be funded by placing 3.28m new ordinary shares at 256p to raise about Pounds 8.3m net of expenses. The placing, which represents about 5 per cent of Sheffield's existing share capital, is underwritten by Samuel Montagu. Sheffield said it had already received irrevocable acceptances from Freeman's directors and other shareholders in respect of 4.15m shares, or about 57 per cent of the company. Holders of the new ordinary Sheffield shares will not receive the final dividend, estimated at 3.6p for the year ended December. Sheffield, which last year acquired WMS Group for Pounds 52.9m, estimates its pre-tax profits for the year at not less than Pounds 9.75m. Freeman shareholders will receive a second interim dividend of 4p once the offer becomes unconditional. Freeman estimates its pre-tax profits for the year to end-December at not less than Pounds 950,000.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Serob Oganyan under rubric "Briefing": </F> "President Prepared To Submit Disputed Issues to the Court of  the People"]    [Text] Yesterday the president's acting press secretary  Levon Zurabyan held a regular briefing devoted to two topics:  First, regarding the adoption of the Constitution, and second,  the latest events in Nagornyy Karabakh.    The press secretary noted that the adoption of the  Constitution, in the president's opinion, is one of the most  important problems Armenia will have to solve. In spite of the  fact that discussions in parliament regarding the question of  the mechanism for adopting the Constitution produced no results,  L. Ter-Petrosyan gave a positive assessment to the discussions  since the positions represented by the political forces in  parliament were determined and their alignment was clarified.  This will make it possible for everyone to take a more  realistic approach to the question of adoption of the  Constitution.    "It is obvious," said L. Zurabyan, "that today's parliament  is indeed not in a position to adopt a Constitution...." The  adoption of the Basic Law was opposed both by deputies insisting  on a referendum and by proponents of a Constituent Assembly.  Thus, the number of deputies voting against this idea was  almost a qualified majority. The idea of a Constituent Assembly  was also actually rejected since no more than 50-60 deputies  support it.    "The debates in parliament showed that the most promising  path to the adoption of a Constitution is a referendum," stated  the president's press secretary. The Constituent Assembly  version can only create another source of tension since the  organ granted these extremely important authority would have to  be chosen under conditions when there is no national accord in  society.    In the press secretary's opinion, the draft Constitution  developed by the Supreme Soviet commission is more legitimate  than the draft of the "six." He reported that the president  suggested providing equal conditions for the drafts, placing  both versions on the referendum. The readiness to hold new  presidential and National Council elections after the adoption  of the parliamentary version of the Constitution confirmed that  this draft was not created under the power of Levon  Ter-Petrosyan. And the latter, the president, through his press  secretary, stated that he is prepared to submit all disputed  issues to a court of the people. The absence of this kind of  approach among the opposition shows their mistrust of democratic  methods and the lack of confidence in the notion that they can  achieve their goals by setting democratic mechanisms in motion.    "In spite of everything, the president is looking to the  future with optimism and thinks that the Constitution will be  adopted through a nationwide referendum. As for the parliament,  even if the constitutional process is slowed up here, this  should not be viewed as a crisis. In such a case, in a year  there will be new elections to the legislative organ and there  will be new deputies to decide this issue...    Then the president's press secretary proceeded to a  discussion of the situation surrounding the Karabakh problem.  After the speaker of the parliament of Azerbaijan, R. Guliyev,  met in Moscow with Minister of Defense of Russia P. Grachev and  reported his readiness to cease combat activities beginning at  0000 hours on 28 February, the latter had a telephone  conversation with President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan,  during the course of which he conveyed Azerbaijan's proposal and  asked that he render assistance to the Karabakh side so that the  Nagornyy Karabakh Republic would also agree to the cease-fire.  This request was relayed to the Karabakh leaders by Yerevan  officials. The Russian side, in turn, conveyed Azerbaijan's  proposal to the authorities of the Nagornyy Karabakh Republic.    "What Azerbaijan is proposing now is only a 10-day  cease-fire  without any commitments," said L. Zurabyan. "And, of course, in  this form the proposal is unacceptable to Nagornyy Karabakh..."    The press secretary expressed the opinion that Azerbaijan  needed these 10 days as a respite and to prepare to resume  combat activities and this is why Armenia fully concurs with  Azerbaijan's position...</p>

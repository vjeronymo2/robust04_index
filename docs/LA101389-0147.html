			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CAPISTRANO BEACH;  </P> <P> MAN FACES 130 YEARS IN $7.7-MILLION FRAUD  </P> <P> A man accused of fleecing his fellow Capistrano Beach church members and other  investors of millions by promising them returns of 60% or higher was convicted  Thursday of fraud charges by a federal jury in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> James B.A. Niven persuaded about 170 investors, many of them members of Calvary  Chapel, to invest $7.7 million in his company, but after less than five hours  of deliberation, the jury agreed with prosecutors who said that Niven spent the  money on himself.  </P> <P> Niven was found guilty on all 24 mail and wire fraud charges and two counts of  acting as an unregistered securities broker.  </P> <P> Niven, 48, is a native of Scotland. He faces a maximum sentence of 130 years  when he returns before U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson on Dec. 18.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Carolyn Kubota said that Niven paid off old investors with  money deposited by new investors. Because earlier investors saw their accounts  appear to grow quickly, they seldom asked to withdraw their money until the  stock market crash in October, 1987, Kubota explained.

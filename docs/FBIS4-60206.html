			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, May 23 (AFP)--A southern military spokesman  denied Monday that northern Yemeni forces had captured a key  base at 'Ataq, capital of the oil-producing province of Shabwah.    The claim by forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  was "totally unfounded, the spokesman told television in Aden,  capital of the breakaway state headed by southern leader 'Ali  Salim al-Bid.    A military spokesman in the capital Sanaa told the official  SABA' news agency on Sunday that the 'Ataq base had fallen to  government troops.    Northern forces also said they had been in control of  another  southern military base at al-'Anad since Friday and had now  surrounded the southern stronghold of Aden.    'Ataq lies 130 kilometers (78 miles) east of Aden.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Another rise in French unemployed French unemployment recorded its biggest monthly increase of the year in May, rising by 20,800 to reach 3.35m or 12.7 per cent of the workforce, the labour ministry said yesterday. The increase, from a revised 12.6 per cent in April, undermines government claims that the rise in joblessness had stabilised. Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, accepted that setbacks remained possible in the fight against unemployment, but said the trend was still showing improvement. Private economists gave some support for this view. 'The figures are disappointing,' said Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais Capital Markets. But she cautioned against reading too much into one month's data, adding that the rise of 44,300 in the number of unemployed in the year to May compared with an increase of 152,500 in the comparable period in 1993. The high level of joblessness does, however, reflect the structural problems in the French labour market and the failure of emerging recovery to make a significant impact on unemployment. The Patronat employers' federation has also expressed concerns about the rate of economic recovery, which it describes as slow, fragile and patchy. The Bank of France, which has sought to buttress the economy through a gradual reduction in interest rates, yesterday trimmed the intervention rate, the key short term rate, by one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.1 per cent. The rise in long-term interest rates, however, resulting from the turmoil in the international bond market, could dampen economic recovery, according to economists. Government officials warned that unemployment could worsen over the summer as school-leavers swell the ranks of job-seekers. They claim, however, that it should stop rising by the end of the year, and start to decline in 1995. The unemployment rate for April was revised upwards to take account of the last week's annual revision of the size of the active population, according to the labour ministry. The unemployment rate for March was also revised upwards from 12.2 per cent to 12.4 per cent. The May increase, which was three times larger than previous months, partly reflected an inflow of young, first-time job-seekers, government officials said. Redundancies and the number of people ending short-term contracts also rose.</p>

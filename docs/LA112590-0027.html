			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'KING OF THE RIGHT' HEADED THE WRONG WAY  </P> <P> "Mahvelous" it is for Bill Buckley Jr. in his pre-senile years to have  conceived of a national service program with Draconian sanctions for those  refusing to volunteer when reaching their 18th birthdays ("King of the Right,"  Nov. 11).  </P> <P> Shall we continue to suffer having the old tell the young how to lead their  lives? Are there too few wars left for old men to send youth to die in? Shall  our country continue to be impoverished by not including in the service program  those over 18 who have gained skills in college and beyond?  </P> <P> Shall those like Bill Buckley, who have been denied the benefits of a national  service program, now be provided the opportunity to do so with Draconian  sanctions should they refuse to serve?  </P> <P> SYLVAIN FRIBOURG  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

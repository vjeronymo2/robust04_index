			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: EC anti-dumping measures not in interests of industrial efficiency Sir, The Commission is currently reviewing a number of anti-dumping duties imposed in the mid-1980s. The cases concern typewriters, electronic scales, outboard motors, compact disc players and, possibly, printers. In practice, the data show in each case the complaining industry is in a worse state today than at the time of the original investigation. Why are anti-dumping measures apparently so inefficient? First, because there is clearly no alternative to free competition. Often, while protected, the EC industry has delayed restructuring. Exporters have compensated for duties by further rationalisation, or by relocating. In the outboard motors case, floor prices since 1983 have kept EC prices some 40 per cent above US prices, yet the EC industry still complains about losses. The Commission must bear a heavy responsibility for the failure of the anti-dumping instrument. Artificially inflated dumping margins have led to the feeling in Europe that foreign competition can be effectively fought with heavy anti-dumping measures. But except in the case of existing anomalies, this is to tackle the problem from the wrong end. Some consider that the only way to cope with the failure of the 1985 duties is to impose still tougher measures. Others, however, believe it is time to replace these heavy instruments of trade policy with specific, time-limited measures correcting market dysfunctions where they exist. This presupposes, in the first instance, a return to the original meaning of dumping under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - that is, the private subsidising of cheap exports using profits achieved on the domestic market. A neutral assessment of injury and, in particular, the causality link between dumping and injury, is also needed. Procedural changes, permanent assessment of the effects of the measure, greater transparency and predictability are long overdue. Only by making these changes will EC industry be protected from unfair practices without being given the illusion of protection, which justifies the postponement of restructuring. European industry should also consider whether its interests are best served by imposing measures which are so heavy that foreign competitors are forced to transfer production into the Community.

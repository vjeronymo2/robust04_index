			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Tighter N-security planned Mr Bernd Shmidbauer, Germany's intelligence co-ordinator, will report to Bonn today on how to combat international plutonium smuggling, following a series of meetings with Russian security officials over the weekend. Diplomats in Moscow suggested the initiative might lead to creation of a joint task force and increased financial aid to tackle the lethal trade. German authorities have uncovered several stashes of stolen plutonium in recent months. Mr Shmidbauer said the talks had been conducted in an excellent climate and in total openness. 'I believe we will achieve excellent joint results and good co-operation, and the questions which have been the subject of speculation can then be solved,' he told German TV. But tensions remained behind the smiles. Russian pride has been pricked by western criticism of lax security. Intelligence officials have continued to deny there is any convincing evidence that plutonium found on a recent Lufthansa flight from Moscow to Munich had been stolen from a Russian plant. Any nuclear material carried on to that aircraft would have been detected by scanning equipment at Sheremetevo airport, they say. German politicians, such as the foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, have backed plans to provide more funds to convert Russia's nuclear programme to more peaceful ends. Others have hinted at a tougher approach. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, was quoted in the German press as saying future financial assistance to Russia would be linked to co-operation in the fight against nuclear smuggling.</p>

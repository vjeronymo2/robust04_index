			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq assesses that within one  to one and a half years the political situation will clarify and  we will know whether the region's leaders are ready to recognize  Israel's security needs and reach normalization with it. If  this does not happen, we will reach an impasse, according to the  chief of staff. Lieutenant General Baraq also said that even if  full peace and security arrangements are achieved, Israel will  still need to preserve its military power and superiority for  many years to come in the 21st century. He also said that  terrorism will accompany us for a long time to come, and that we  must also prepare to confront nonconventional dangers emanating  from Iraq, Iran, and Libya. Our correspondent Haviva Roger  reports that the chief of staff was addressing Haifa Technion  graduates.</p>

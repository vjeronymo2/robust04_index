			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Steel British Steel's results - and probable dividend cut - are two weeks away. It is worth considering the market backdrop against which the payout will be determined. The price increases of some 3 to 4 per cent imposed by European steel producers in the first quarter stuck at the time. But thanks partly to the industry's failure to manage a cut in supply, the market has turned soft again. There are scant grounds for expecting an upturn in demand, given the weak outlook for the European economy dictated by Germany's tight monetary policy, surplus capacity in eastern Europe and the anaemic US recovery. The immediate prospects thus hardly give British Steel an incentive to err on the side of generosity. Investors are probably right to expect at best a final dividend of 1.5p against 5.75p last year. Admittedly, there are belated signs of European production being reined back. That could show through in pricing from the mid-year onwards. Perhaps the market could be kick-started if the prospect of higher prices persuaded customers to rebuild their stocks. But that seems fanciful if, as County NatWest calculates, 11 per cent of Europe's hot-rolled steel capacity is surplus to requirements. All the same, British Steel could yet prove one of the great European survivors in its industry. Its rationalisation programme has given it an edge in terms of cost. But its problem remains the snail's pace at which cutbacks are proceeding elsewhere in Europe. Even high-cost German producers are reluctant to get out, as the acrimony over the Krupp takeover of Hoesch shows. The biggest danger is that as European interest rates fall, economic recovery next year may create an excuse for further delay in rationalisation. That could make British Steel's efficiency less relevant in the context of a market beset with chronic subsidised oversupply.</p>

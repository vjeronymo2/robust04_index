			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Group of Seven: Stalemate on arms spending AN attempt to build a consensus among developing countries about the need to reduce military expenditures failed yesterday, Stephen Fidler writes. A meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 24 developing countries dropped a reference to the issue from their communique for procedural reasons. The Colombian chairmanship had introduced the item too late for inclusion in the statement. There has been growing pressure among industrialised nations for aid to developing countries to be made conditional on low military spending. Mr Rudolf Hommes, Colombia's finance minister, said high spending on arms diverted resources away from poverty alleviation, health and other development spending. Expenditures should be cut in both industrialised and developing countries, he said. The ministers expressed worries about the slowdown in growth in industrialised countries and 'the worsening of the already unfavourable external environment facing the developing countries.' They also emphasised the need to keep up Third World representation in the World Bank and IMF. There are concerns that new eastern European members of the institution will further dilute the developing countries' influence on the institutions.</p>

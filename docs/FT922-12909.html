			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan in loss SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property, the leading property investment company in Scotland, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 840,000 for the half year to February 15 mainly because of significantly higher interest. In the comparative period there was a profit of Pounds 2.72m, but that turned into a deficit of Pounds 8.37m for the full year after exceptional charges of Pounds 11.6m. Interest charges amounted to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 6.6m). Only Pounds 860,000 of interest was capitalised, compared to Pounds 5.5m, following completion of the group's development programme. Mr Scott Cairns, who was appointed managing director in January, said the accounting policy was not to capitalise interest beyond practical completion of a development. The group is taking Pounds 1.5m from reserves to pay an interim dividend of 1.5p. This is a cut from the previous 2.53p but it intends to maintain the total at 4.4p. Second half trading was likely to continue to show a loss, albeit a much smaller one. Mr Cairns said some 11 unlet properties could bring in another Pounds 7m if tenants were found. Net revenues from properties rose 11.5 per cent, from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 10.6m. The group was expected to become more of a Scottish company with up to three quarters of its properties based north of the border, compared with the current 60 per cent. Total borrowings were Pounds 190m compared with Pounds 201m at August 15. Gearing fell from 142 per cent to 137 per cent. Losses per share were 1.38p (earnings 1.86p).</p>

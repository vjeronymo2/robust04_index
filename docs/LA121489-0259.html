			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YANKEES VP SAYS THEY'RE NOT MAKING A PITCH FOR VALENZUELA  </P> <P> If Fernando Valenzuela leaves the Los Angeles Dodgers, it won't be to join the  New York Yankees.  </P> <P> The Yankees said today that they are not interested in signing the free agent  left-hander.  </P> <P> "There has been a lot of talk in the media concerning an apparent Yankee  interest in Fernando Valenzuela, and that is simply not true," George Bradley,  New York's vice president of player personnel, said in a statement. "The  Yankees have never been interested in Valenzuela nor have we had any  conversations with Fernando or his agent. Any information contradicting that is  untrue."  </P> <P> Richard Moss, Valenzuela's agent, said Wednesday that he expected a deal for  the pitcher would be reached shortly. Valenzuela, 10-13 with a 3.43 earned-run  average, earned $1.85 million last season. The Dodgers have offered him a  one-year contract with an option year but he wants a guaranteed multi-year  deal.  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A new Merc and fresh loopholes - Diary of a Private Investor / The Budget and You 'SEE, I've saved you lots of money,' said my wife on hearing details of Norman Lamont's Budget. 'You haven't bought a racehorse have you, or a wood-burning stove?' I asked, nervously, as it would probably be my job to remove the waste material produced by both of them. 'No. I sold one of my cars just in time. The new Nissan Micra I bought is much more economical and I made sure to fill both my cars with petrol before Mr Lamont started his Budget speech and increased petrol prices.' 'But . . .' I started. 'And with the hefty increases on tax on expensive company cars, this ought to be mean that the new Mercedes due to be introduced later this year ought to be much more competitively prices if they expect reasonable sales - so I should be able to trade in my old Merc for a new one at last.' 'I will agree to a new Merc,' I said, 'if you can kindly work out for me all the complexities and implications if the chancellor's changes to advance corporation tax (ACT) and how it might affect your dividend income (as someone who earns too little to pay income tax) and how it will affect taxpayers like me at higher rates.' My wife fell silent and left the room. As I am still struggling with ACT myself, the reader will have to look elsewhere in the FT (page III) to discover the personal effects of the ACT changes. However, with some pension funds and certain other institutional investors claiming a possible 6.25 per cent cut in their cash flow as a result of the ACT changes reducing their income from dividends, perhaps they will now pay even more attention to investing for growth (and capital gains) rather than high dividend levels. Perhaps, in order to generate more cash, institutions will be somewhat more inclined to 'churn' parts of their portfolios, buying and quickly selling whenever a profit can be realised and using part of that profit instead of dividend payments to meet some of their cash obligations. Hopefully, the ACT changes ought to focus more attention on those companies that have been paying dividends out of reserves (or even from part of the proceeds of rights issues) rather than conserving cash and using it to reduce debt or for expansion purposes. As a private investor I still prefer to invest in shares for growth, rather than income, and make use of other types of investment for regular cash generation. The Inland Revenue issued a consultative document which followed on from the Budget and the chancellor's comments on trying to address the problem of surplus ACT arising on account of dividends paid by a company out of profits from overseas sources which have already borne foreign tax. Perhaps a creative tax avoidance expert can devise a means whereby an overseas subsidiary of a UK company might like to make a 'gift' to the shareholders in the UK company of an appropriate sum in the currency of the country concerned. The UK company could undertake to convert small sums into pounds. I was disappointed that the chancellor did not abolish stamp duty on share transactions, especially in view of the long overdue demise of Taurus. However, he did say in his Budget speech that he would 'review the position further in the light of the conclusions of the Securities Settlement Task Force set up by the Bank of England.' I hope the task force includes strong representation from private investors. While the chancellor announced 'roll over relief' for 'European Community agricultural quotas for ewe and suckler cow premiums' he did not take up my suggestion to provide roll over relief to private investors who invest in shares. He did, however, announce that entrepreneurs who sell shares in their own company can 'defer the payment of capital gains tax' if they invest those gains in 'another qualifying unquoted trading company, or companies.' I welcome this move, but I hope that this provision can be expanded to include investing in shares in quoted companies. It is often quoted companies that need an entrepreneur to shake them up - and to focus their attention just on unquoted companies seems a pity. Although, perhaps, tax avoidance experts are already beavering away to produce schemes whereby unquoted trading companies can control stakes in quoted companies. While closing many tax loopholes (such as the long overdue abolition of business expansion schemes which involved the provision of loans to BES investors) the Budget created a number of areas (especially those connected with ACT) which are likely to keep armies of accountants occupied. The chancellor also announced various changes to national savings products with increases in the holdings limits of savings certificates, and capital and income bonds and the reintroduction of first option bonds. All these may well be worth closer study. But with the present pathetic performance of my Pounds 10,000 worth of premium bonds I am unlikely to increase it to the proposed new maximum holding of Pounds 20,000. Thus, while I applaud the various measures introduced by the chancellor to assist small business, I wish he had done much more to help the private investor. Maybe in his autumn Budget he might . . .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>   [Text] Damascus, May 15 (AFP) -- Syria is willing to  discuss an Israeli offer to leave the Golan Heights on condition  it pledges a complete withdrawal within a "reasonable" time, the  government newspaper TISHRIN said on Sunday [15 May].    The remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher was expected here later in his second peace shuttle  to Syria and Israel in a month to forge a peace deal between the  arch enemies.    On his last trip two weeks ago he delivered to Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad proposals from Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin for a phased withdrawal from the Golan Heights,  which Israel conquered in 1967.    Rabin has offered to return three of five Druze villages on  the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five-eight years. But details of the peace plan have been kept  secret.    Syria turned down the offer and sent a list of questions to  the Israeli authorities with Christopher demanding  clarifications.    Diplomats said the exchange of messages between the  arch-enemies was a good sign of their intentions to try to  narrow differences between them.    "The (Syrian) list included some very specific questions  which opened the way for a concrete and serious debate," a  Western diplomat in Damascus said.    Meanwhile a senior Israeli official said in Jerusalem that  Christopher would try to persuade Syria to set up a joint  military commission with Israel in a fresh bid to unblock their  peace talks.    "This trip will aim mainly to establish a military  commission  between the two countries," he said Sunday.    "The commission would draft security arrangements for the  border region and report back to the politicians."    A similar commission was set up by Egypt and Israel and  helped to bring the old enemies together in a peace agreement,  the official noted.    Syria's official press also called on the United States to  honour a pledge to play a full partner role in the peace  process, saying it was not enough for Christopher to be a mere  postman between them.    "Damascus will not negotiate any Israeli proposals which do  not stipulate a clear engagement for a complete withdrawal in a  reasonable time," TISHRIN newspaper said in a front-page  editorial.    The commentary, entitled "Will Israel Take the Adequate  Decision," went on to say that the ball lay in the Israeli court  "and those who give it support" referring to the United States.    The English-language SYRIA TIMES said progress depended on  "Washington playing its full partner role."    "This role should be effective and not ink on paper," the  daily said.    Syrian demand for an Israeli pledge to withdraw totally from  the Golan Heights, which the Jewish state annexed in 1981, has  been a major stumbling block in the peace process.    Christopher, who is in Geneva for talks on the former  Yugoslavia, said he expected the process of reconciling Israel  and Syria to be "long."    On Monday he flies to Israel and has not ruled out a return  visit to Damascus before leaving the region on Thursday.    "I do think the parties are serious and I want to play my  part and take messages back and forth," Christopher said.    A Western diplomat in Damascus ruled out any Syrian  concessions over the Golan.    "Syria is not like the Palestine Liberation Organisation,"  which signed a peace accord with Israel on May 4 for launching  Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of  Jericho, he said.    "Syria will never agree to signing a peace agreement that  does not clearly call for a complete (Israeli) withdrawal from  the Golan. It cannot do less than al-Sadat. It wants to do  better than al- Sadat," the diplomat added.    The late Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat became the first  Arab leader to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1978 and to  obtain a total Israel withdrawal from the Sinai desert.</p>

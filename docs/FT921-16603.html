			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: French credit card processor buys 51% stake in Nexus SLIGOS, the French electronic payments and credit card processing company, has bought a 51 per cent stake in Nexus Payment Systems. The deal means that Sligos enters the UK for the first time. Last year the French concern, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 320m, bid unsuccessfully against First Data Resources, a subsidiary of American Express, for the Southend and Basildon card processing operations of Signet, the Access credit card processing company. Sligos is believed to have lost that deal because its bid was delayed because the then Trade Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, referred it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The referral was based on the fact that Sligos's parent, Credit Lyonnais is a state-owned bank. Nexus was set up in 1989 to provide third party services for automated teller machines and point of sale terminals to banks, building societies and other financial services institutions, as well as telephone banking and computer disaster recovery services. Three non-executive directors will join the board of Nexus from Sligos. Mr Rob Fairbrother, managing director of Nexus, said the link with Sligos would help the company provide specialist cost-effective payment services to large financial institutions.</p>

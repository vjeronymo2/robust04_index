			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: All the nasties cleared from the books - Whitecroft's plea to institutions for one last chance Mike Derbyshire and Martyn Ellis will be in Glasgow today meeting Scottish Amicable, the last of Whitecroft's four main institutional shareholders. They will be explaining why they should be allowed one more chance after announcing pre-tax losses of Pounds 41.8m. Their message is simple: Whitecroft has gone back to manufacturing and is promising never to dabble in property again; it has reduced itself to a more manageable size and array of businesses and factories; it is in its markets of yore, where it knows what it is doing and can influence events; and there are no more nasties lurking in the books from the follies of the 1980s. The losses for the year to end March, announced last Tuesday, were a shock, Even the restatement of the previous year's figures under FRS 3 showed them as a Pounds 3.65m loss, not the Pounds 4.5m profit on which Whitecroft paid a 4p dividend. Shareholders funds were down from Pounds 46m to Pounds 24m and borrowings were Pounds 35m. Derbyshire and Ellis immediately got to work with presentations to shareholders and analysts in the City, briefed managers at their headquarters on Thursday and returned to London for more briefings on Friday. Together with Scottish Amicable, Mercury Asset Management, M&amp;G and BZW Investment Management own more than half the shares. The tactics seem to be working. The share price ended the week only 2p down at 47p, and only 3p below the year's high. The company had lost the confidence of many investors because of a series of profits and dividend warnings as it was squeezed between a rise in gearing and falling property values from the latter half of 1989. The worst never appeared to be over, even though management kept giving the appearance it had In the end investors had to be appeased by bloodletting. In March, Peter Goold, 24 years in the company and chairman since 1989, and Graham M'Cardell, the finance director, fell on their swords. David Kendall, head of Bunzl, came in as part-time non-executive chairman. Derbyshire, who joined Whitecroft from Norcros last year as Goold's deputy, moved to chief executive. Ellis came as finance director from Inchcape, where he had learned from such luminaries as the late Sir George Turnbull. Whitecroft's shares - tipped in January by Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester stockbroker, as one of the recovery shares of the year - started to move up. So how did Whitecroft get into this mess? It was hardly a newcomer to the market. It floated in 1900, having emerged from a trade association of dyers and bleachers in Whalley Bridge. With maturity came dullness. By the early 1980s, Whitecroft was an unglamorous little manufacturing stock rooted in basic industries, such as commercial lighting, builders' merchants and industrial or specialist textiles. Things started stirring between 1984 and 1987 with Tom Weatherby, who had emerged from one of its textile companies as chairman. The property and building boom was under way and Whitecroft, already in some of those markets, joined the bandwagon. The company prospered. A rights issue in 1987 gave it Pounds 15m to go hunting. The next year, the sale of its low-yielding chain of builders' merchants brought in Pounds 34m. After failing to buy Eleco Holdings, the construction and building products group, Whitecroft paid Pounds 6m cash for Lightning Windows, maker of PVC and aluminium replacements windows and doors. Trent Holdings, manufacturer of specialist doors and fittings, was bought for Pounds 13m, followed by MB Modern Decor, which made PVC and aluminium replacement doors and windows, at Pounds 5m; then 80 per cent of a Netherlands fabrics and trimmings company for Pounds 4.4m; then Finch Conservatories - with its successful brand image - at Pounds 6.2m. Annual profits climbed 33 per cent, then 27 per cent; dividends rose to 15p and the share price broke through 300p. But borrowings were rising and book values were being inflated, sowing the seeds of disaster when the market turned. Since the second half of 1989, it has been downhill Whitecroft thought it would be safe because its property exploits had mainly been in small office and retail developments. It was also into housebuilding, but only in the north, where prices remained stable. Last week's results showed just how hopelessly optimistic this was. In spite of several earlier write-downs of property values, Hillier Parker  - the valuers brought in to take a fresh look - slashed another Pounds 11m off book values of Pounds 25m. That, combined with the Pounds 29m cost of pulling out of the home improvements side, accounted for the rise in losses. 'We are now back to basics,' Derbyshire said yesterday. 'Industrial, commercial and street lighting; building products; medical cotton fibre; and specialised textiles. All operating divisions are trading profitably and he says the remaining properties are beginning to move now that they are realistically priced. Last week, Derbyshire insists, was the rock bottom. He knows that Whitecroft has almost run out of chances.</p>

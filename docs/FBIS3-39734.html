But speaking in Edinburgh at the start of engagements in  Scotland, he said his optimism was heavily qualified with  caution.    However Mr Major added that the situation in Bosnia had  "greatly improved" in the last 24 hours.    "A large number of heavy weapons have been handed in and  have  been corralled, and are now under UN control" he said.    "That has been happening for two days now. It seems to be  accelerating so it is certainly looking quite good at the  moment."    Mr Major, who had earlier met Scottish business leaders,  said: "I think it is everyone's hope air strikes can be avoided.    "The purpose of threatening air strikes was to stop the  bombardment of Sarajevo and bring the heavy weapons under  control.    "If that can be done by negotiation, and it seems possible  --  we can't yet be certain that it will be, but it seems possible  that it might -- that is clearly very good news."    The prime minister said he was "very pleased" at the  Russian's intervention in the former Yugoslavia.    "The Russians are a member of the permanent five of the  Security Council and have a very considerable influence in that  role, and a very considerable historical influence and  relationship with the Serbs. I think their involvement is bound  to be helpful and I welcome it."    He declined to say if he had persuaded President Yeltsin to  take the decisive step during his visit to Russia earlier this  week, but agreed he discussed Bosnia with him.    "I certainly express the view both privately and publicly  that it was helpful for Russia, the U.S., and the European  Community separately to use their influence and I am delighted  the Russians are doing that."    Mr Major said he had no fears that the United Nations would  be unable to control the Russian forces in Bosnia.    "I would have no concern about that at all," Mr Major said  in  interviews for the BBC and Scottish Television.    "When the Russian forces arrive they will be part and parcel  of the general command structure and I have no doubt at all they  will come under UN control and make a material contribution."    Changes in Russia in recent years have been profound and it  was in everyone's interests to support the Russians, he said.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said his country was  discussing with the UN how many Russian troops would be deployed  around Sarajevo. He would know the figure "in a matter of  hours".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.P."-signed interview with Zoltan Gal, head of the </F> parliamentary group of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP;  place and date not given: "No Changes Are Expected in the MSZP  Style"]    [Text] The parties that based their programs on replacing  the current coalition have the moral obligation to accept the  burden of government -- Zoltan Gal, head of the parliamentary  group of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told us, and he  also thought that there would not be a minority government.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] On the basis of the results of the first  round of elections, do you see any chance of the MSZP obtaining  more than half of the mandates? Would you accept governing  alone?    [Gal] I only see principled and mathematical chances for  obtaining an absolute majority. In that case, we would probably  not find coalition partners, because the parties would choose  the easier solution of opposition. At the same time, we would  still seek a partner in that situation too, because the tasks  faced by Hungary require broad social support. I am confident  that there will be responsible political forces in this country.  The parties that based their programs on replacing the current  coalition have the moral and political obligation to accept the  burdens of government. In addition, the possible party policy  maneuvers should be explained to the voters. The socialists  would also accept the government task alone, because we would be  able to solve the tasks along with an adequate opposition  attitude. I am convinced that there will be no minority  government here.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It was said on the election night that, in  addition to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], you are  again considering the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]  too....    [Gal] The MSZP said constantly that there are several  meeting points between these two parties on the level of program  coordination. The subjective condition of the MSZP-Fidesz  cooperation has become extremely difficult in the wake of the  change in the Fidesz attitude. If a correction takes place in  the Fidesz, with all its consequences, a new situation might  emerge between the two parties.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you take into account the possibility  that Hungarian society will be slightly surprised at the  superiority of the MSZP and a balance will take place in the  second round of elections?    [Gal] In principle, I do not completely exclude the  possibility of such considerations in the broad strata of  voters. The MSZP continues to conduct its campaign correctly,  and no change in our style is expected.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you see any danger to yourselves deriving  from the considerable advance of the MSZP?    [Gal] A party that won such a high percentage of votes must  think its past and future over thoroughly. Self-restraint is a  desirable attitude, both within the party and toward society.  There can be no revenge or purge of any kind. Obviously, the  party will be threatened by the careerists appearing in the wake  of its success, but this must be avoided with internal  democracy. From a certain point of view, the MSZP is dividing  society, and those who voted against us did this deliberately.  The party has only one argument to convince these people,  namely the coming four years.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / British Coal adds fifth pit to proposed closures BRITISH COAL wants to shut its Silverdale pit in Staffordshire, taking to five the number of collieries where closure has been proposed. Littleton in Staffordshire may become the sixth on Monday when management meets union leaders at the pit. Production at Silverdale will end on December 3 if miners decide not to fight the closure. British Coal told local union leaders that the pit had lost Pounds 5.7m in the past six months. Financial and market pressures had forced the closure proposal. British Coal, which operates 30 pits including the five named for closure, said it would make every effort to transfer miners to other pits but admitted there would only be 'limited opportunities'. Silverdale was one of 12 pits reprieved in the government's white paper in March and has been 'market tested' to try to find new sales. The pit was sunk more than 100 years ago as an iron ore mine before coal reserves were discovered. It produces about 1m tonnes of coal a year and is one of the last remaining collieries linked to a pit village. The announcement came as miners in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, worked their final shift after voting to accept closure. British Coal and the National Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog, have agreed a framework for dealing with the ending of water pumping at pits that face closure and the consequent threat of minewater pollution, Chris Tighe writes. The authority said yesterday that under a new memorandum of understanding signed this week it will be fully informed by British Coal before any pumping operations cease and given the data needed to predict future consequences. The agreement between the two bodies covers all future pit closures in England and Wales. Mr Malcolm Colley, technical manager for the authority in its Northumbria and Yorkshire region, said the agreement could mean that should a pit close very suddenly, British Coal would have to continue pumping for some time afterwards. This would ensure a phased withdrawal and allow time for action to prevent minewater contaminated with metals from polluting streams and rivers. Anxiety over the threat of minewater pollution has been sparked by the rapid recent closure of collieries. The authority had expressed concern that it was not always informed in advance by British Coal when pumping was to cease, and had warned it would consider legal action should the environment be at risk.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (8): A phoenix from the ashes of war - Robert Corzine describes the resurrection of the Burgan oilfield, the second largest in the world The giant Burgan oil field in Kuwait is the stuff of which oilmen's dreams are made. Discovered in 1938, in production since 1946 and set alight by the Iraqis in 1991, it still accounts for two-thirds of Kuwait's proved oil reserves of 96.5bn barrels, which are a tenth of the world's total. Burgan's size is matched by the ease with which it has given up its riches. The 4,000 foot depth of the reservoir means that new wells take just three weeks on average to drill. Production wells flow freely without expensive gas or water injection because of favourable pressure conditions within the reservoir. But it was the positive pressure from Burgan's 636 wells that helped to create the nightmarish inferno unleashed by the retreating Iraqis three years ago. Evidence of those days can still be seen. In places there are heaps of charred, twisted metal that at one time formed the shining 'Christmas tree' blow-out preventors that topped the wells, while occasional burned out trucks litter the roadside. The earthworks and berms built by the multi-national fire-fighting teams who extinguished the blazes within seven months can still be seen, as can some of the 200 oil lakes created by more than 20m barrels of oil which gushed forth from wells that failed to catch fire. Officials from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Company, operators of the field, say 18m barrels of oil have been pumped from the lakes for conversion to bitumen, some of which is being used to coat the defensive sand wall being built along the border with Iraq. The contents of many of the smaller lakes are being concentrated in a few large ones, from which the remaining 3m-4m barrels of oil will be drained. The reaction of the oil in the lakes with sunlight and rain has caused some concern among Kuwaitis about possible atmospheric pollution. There are similar worries that the oil-soaked soil beneath the lakes could have a long-term effect on aquifers, the desert food chain and air quality in Kuwait. Various methods are under consideration to treat the most heavily-contaminated soils, which total about 20m cubic metres countrywide. Unlike other Kuwaiti oil fields, Burgan has no aquifers near the surface, so contamination of water supplies in the area is unlikely, according to Kuwaiti scientists. Ironically one of the most vivid examples of war damage remaining in the field can be found not at a site dynamited and mined by the Iraqis, but at an oil and gas processing centre destroyed by American aircraft because it was being used as a military command post. Dozens of Iraqis died at the site, the devastation of which was so complete that KOC officials decided to reconstruct the facility elsewhere. For the time being the ruins serve as a reminder to visitors of the vulnerability of oil facilities in a politically uncertain region. Two rusting pick-up trucks holed by cannon fire stand guard by the gate. Inside the impact craters left by missile strikes are gouged into the concrete paving. Collapsed storage tanks lean at crazy angles from the intense heat of the resulting fires, which fused together parts of compressors and other high technology equipment. But such sights are the exception in a field which is almost back to business as usual. Mr Mustafa al-Adsani, manager of production and export operations for KOC, says rehabilitation of the damaged wells is almost complete. Six hundred have been re-worked and 140 new ones have been drilled. Only a few more damaged wells remain to be repaired. The rehabilitation of processing and storage facilities to pre-war levels is also nearing completion. Surface facilities in Burgan and the other Kuwaiti oil fields are now capable of handling 2.8m b/d, according to Mr Adsani. Oil storage capacity, which dropped to 3m-4m barrels in the aftermath of the war, is back at the pre-war level of 15m barrels. The damage done to Burgan below the ground is less easy to ascertain, however. Industry experts say the maximum blow-out rate of the field was 6m barrels a day, more than three times the average daily production currently being achieved in the UK sector of the North Sea. More than 1bn barrels of oil were lost, the equivalent of what the oil industry would class as a highly prized 'elephant' field elsewhere in the world. The long-term impact on the reservoir of the uncontrolled release of such large volumes of oil is under study, with the first results due later this year. Some press reports have speculated about the extent to which water movement resulting from the Iraqi actions within the reservoir may affect eventual recovery rates. But the reservoir 'appears to be in remarkably good shape,' according to Western experts familiar with the field.</p>

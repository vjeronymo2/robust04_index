			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein shows it can win friends and influence people: This week's events demonstrate that members of the IRA's political wing are moving in powerful circles behind the scenes There have been plenty of occasions in the past year when the extent of Mr James Molyneaux's influence over the pace and shape of the Northern Ireland peace process and efforts to forge a durable political settlement in Ulster have been underlined. Perhaps the best illustration was the setting up earlier this year of a Northern Ireland select committee. This was a move the Ulster Unionist leader and his party colleagues had long pushed for. This week it was Sinn Fein's turn to demonstrate the power of its influence, as the British government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether members of the IRA's political wing would be invited to an important Belfast investment forum. Thursday's acknowledgement that a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would be invited followed threats by several US institutions and corporations to boycott the conference unless Sinn Fein was included. This pressure was augmented by Congressional supporters of the Irish republican cause who urged the US administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, to attend unless London modified its initial stance that Sinn Fein would not be invited. As one knowledgeable observer of the peace process observed in the wake of the climbdown, Sinn Fein is more than just a party representing a small minority of the electorate in Northern Ireland. The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the setting of an earlier-than-expected date for the start of talks between Sinn Fein and government officials, in effect entailing that they had to start before the conference on December 13 and 14. The government said on Thursday it would start talks on December 7. However the talks were put back 48 hours last night at the request of Sinn Fein. There has been a widespread impression that the handling of the invitations was botched by the government, with the effect that efforts to drum up much-needed investment at the conference risk being overshadowed by politics. Sinn Fein councillors on the two local council committees whose members are being sent invitations include Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the organisation's northern chairman and a leading political strategist. If Mr McLaughlin does attend, the economic news emerging from the forum would have to be important indeed to distract attention from his presence at a conference to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The two committees whose members are now to be invited to the conference are the development committee of Belfast City Council and the city marketing committee of Londonderry City Council. According to the Northern Ireland Office, a total of six Sinn Fein councillors are on the two bodies.</p>

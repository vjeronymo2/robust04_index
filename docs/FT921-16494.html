			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Progress in South Africa SOUTH Africa starts the new year on a hopeful note. Progress in constitutional talks, coupled with tentative moves towards an interim government, represents the most important step in the country's transition to democracy since the release of Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) leader, nearly two years ago. The agreement on a set of constitutional principles, endorsed by delegates attending the inaugural session of the Convention on a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), is in itself encouraging. While the principles adopted are taken for granted in western democracies, they represent a revolutionary change for South Africa, incorporating as they do commitments to an adult franchise and a multi-party system, a bill of rights and an independent judiciary. But equally significant were the efforts to find common ground for the management of South Africa's transition to democracy. In an historic recognition of black political rights, President FW de Klerk offered black South Africans seats in the country's parliament as a step towards what he called the 'expeditious' creation of 'a government that is broadly representative of the people'. He also agreed that proposals for new legislation drawn up at Codesa and approved by consensus would be implemented by the current parliament, where the ruling National Party has a comfortable majority. Given that the working definition of consensus is the joint approval of delegates from the National Party and the ANC, the government can exercise a veto. Important concession Nevertheless, it represents an important concession. It marks an acknowledgment that effective power is shifting from parliament to the convention, attended by 19 parties covering most of the political spectrum, with representatives from all races. Taken together, the moves could form the basis for the resolution of two key ANC demands: the creation of an interim government, and the election of a constituent assembly to draw up the new constitution. Even though the two sides differ on its duration - government envisages five years or longer, the ANC no more than 18 months - the framework for a transitional administration is taking shape. Formidable problems remain, however. Hopes for an end to political violence have been set back by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's refusal to attend the opening session of Codesa, although his mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party was represented. Chief Buthelezi has no significant support beyond his ethnic base, but his capacity to play a spoiling role is considerable. Potent force Meanwhile, the extreme white right wing is a force to be reckoned with. There will not be another general election under the current constitution, and, in theory, the promised referendum seeking approval for a new one need not be held before 1994. But the pace of change is such that Mr de Klerk may feel obliged to test white opinion well before then. Failure to do so could increase the danger that extremists, convinced that they reflect the views of a majority of whites, will be tempted to mount a violent last ditch resistance to change. But perhaps the most difficult hurdle is in the constitutional arena. For all the progress on principles, a fundamental divide has yet to be bridged. There is nothing in the ANC's public position which suggests that it is prepared to accept a system short of conventional majority rule. Mr de Klerk, on the other hand, has made it clear that he expects proportional representation in parliament to extend to an entrenched role for the National Party in the executive arm of government. Underlying these issues is the depressed state of the economy marked by rising unemployment and a growing crime wave which exacerbate political tensions. Given the complexity of their problem, South Africa's leaders have made remarkable progress. But the next steps on the road to democracy may prove to be the most difficult.</p>

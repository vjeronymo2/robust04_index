This </F> Is the Price at Which the Sarajevo Authorities Are Trying To  Provoke Foreign Interference"]    [Text] Do you remember the Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda  movie "Twelve Angry Men"? A youth accused of murder is in the  dock. The jury must bring in a verdict of "guilty" or "not  guilty" -- a unanimous verdict, moreover. Otherwise, according  to the law, the jury will have to reconsider the case until they  all, to a man, reach the same conclusion.    The jury member played by Fonda voted against a conviction  and...found himself alone. By the end of the movie, at the cost  of an incredible effort, he succeeds in changing the jury's  mind. A "guilty" verdict proves groundless -- it is based on  questionable evidence and is passed by jurors who treated the  accused either with indifference or with prejudice. When doubt  is interpreted in the accused's favor, this does not mean that  any court is taking his side in advance. It is the democratic  norm. So we had only to publish an item on the UN experts'  report which did not fit in with the version about the Bosnian  Serbs' involvement in the blast for the West at once to assign  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA to the "pro-Serbian camp." One Russian  newspaper called our article on this subject "provocative."    Right from the start of the Yugoslav conflict KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA  has not aimed to please anyone or win plaudits. We have always  been interested only in the real situation and the conclusions  to be drawn from it. This is the usual approach among the  military. So it is unscrupulous, to say the least, to interpret  our desire for objectivity as a manifestation of "pro-Serbian"  (London's THE TIMES) sentiments or, equally, of "pro-Muslim" or  "pro-Croatian" sentiments in the Russian Army. In our analysis  we rely only on facts or on assessments by professionals. For  example, we basically share the assessment of British General  Michael Rose, commander of the "blue helmets" in Bosnia, who  recently said in a BBC interview: "It is surprising that the  (Muslim) formations which have refused to submit are trying to  sabotage the cease-fire agreement (reached on the day the NATO  ultimatum was put to the Bosnian Serbs -- S.S.) and thus prolong  the suffering of their people in Sarajevo." Only, unlike Gen.  Rose, we assert that it is not a matter of "formations which  have refused to submit." It has, all along, been the tactic of  the present leadership of the Bosnian Muslims to provoke  military intervention from outside.    This conclusion is not unfounded and is based certainly not  on "reports by the Serbian TANJUG state agency" but on  long-standing observations and repeated personal conversations  with Muslim and Serbian leaders in Sarajevo as well as with  representatives of the UN forces in the Bosnian capital."  [quotation marks as published] As an argument we publish for  the first time a highly eloquent document with minor  abridgments. It is the text of a report by Canadian Gen. Lewis  Mackenzie, first commander of the UN force's Sarajevo sector, to  Marrack Goulding, UN under secretary general for peacekeeping  operations. The document is dated 14 July 1992.    "1. The situation in Sarajevo is continuing to deteriorate  despite the arrival of humanitarian aid and its distribution in  blockaded regions. We are keeping the airport open at the cost  of an almost unacceptable degree of risk. Everything could  collapse overnight.    "2. The UN force is being subjected to a slander campaign  by the (Muslim) Presidency. But their leaders, including the  president (Izetbegovic), deny this. Meanwhile the campaign of  persecution is highly effective. The attitude of people on the  Presidency's side to us is extremely negative. There have  already been several incidents directed against our officers and  men while they were discharging their official duties.    "3. My conversation yesterday convinced me once and for all  that the president will agree only to military intervention or  death for 'his' people as a final solution (his words). Over  the past few days many opportunities for talks have presented  themselves, which he rejected. He also rejected proposals from  functionaries of his party, the SDA (Footnote) (Party of  Democratic Action), wanting to meet with the Serbs. The  necessary preparations had been made, but the president decided  not to approve a meeting until there was a cease-fire throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina. My attempts to persuade him to meet with  the opposing side at a working level, in order to discuss the  details of demilitarizing the Dobrinja region, came up against a  solid wall. He made it clear that, if the international  community is not prepared to intervene, then he is prepared to  'die twice' rather than have dealings with an 'aggressor.'    "The situation in Sarajevo points to the Presidency's desire  to maintain the current crisis. The majority of the Serbian  guns are silent, although the Serbs are not free of accusations  either. As for the Presidency, they are continuing to provoke  exchanges of fire in an attempt to improve their tactical  position. It is rather difficult to prove this, although a  trend can definitely be traced.    "Shelling in Sarajevo is now considerably less frequent,  although the Presidency is continuing to exploit the myth that  shells are being lobbed into the city. This does not tally with  reality but is a version published by someone who expects  foreign military aid.    "On the other hand, the Serbs propose that we station 'blue  helmets' at all their positions, right down to the smallest  subunit. This is an attractive idea, but I do not possess  adequate resources or the mandate.    "The situation will probably deteriorate unless military  intervention is undertaken. I personally, however, consider  such a step impractical. Disappointed as a result of unrealized  expectations, the Presidency's forces will continue attacking  the `blue helmets' in an attempt to portray matters as though  the Serbs are to blame. The artillery shelling of the  headquarters building last night, which could be repeated, was  probably carried out from the Presidency side's positions. I am  most anxious for the military observers in the regions of  concentration of heavy arms. They are isolated and are virtually  sitting targets.... I believe that the time for tough decisions  has come. For obvious reasons they cannot be adopted here.  With best wishes, Mackenzie."    So, how did the Sarajevo leadership's tactic turn out for  the  Bosnian Muslims themselves? The hopes of military intervention  were drawing now nearer, now more remote, but people were still  dying. Ethnic cleansing was continuing, and numbers of both  Muslims and Serbs, who were inconvenient to the West, were  falling. But the Muslims remain the side which has suffered  most. The number of dead among them long ago topped the 300,000  mark.    As for the role of the mass media in this whole game, this  is  a separate topic. Probably never before in the history of  conflicts has Joe Public been subjected to so many lies and so  much disinformation. Following the television reports of the  "Serbian shelling" of a bread line in the Old Town, the UN  Security Council met and announced sanctions against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. It later came to light that the people  had died as the result of a mine laid by Muslim extremists.  London newspapers reprinted a UN experts' report on this, and  the anti-Serbian campaign eased off a little. Then the  emaciated figures of "prisoners of Serbian camps" appeared on  the television screen. But, following inoculation with another  dose of hatred, it came to light that the shots had been  falsified, etc.    Suffice it to say of the role of official European diplomacy  only that an ethnic war on an unprecedented scale in  Bosnia-Herzegovina had been predicted 100 percent by experts in  the event of a recognition of Bosnia's independence before all  the contradictions had been resolved around the negotiating  table. Bosnia's second-largest -- the Serbs -- disagreed  categorically with secession from Yugoslavia. The majority of  the Muslim population then was also in favor of a peaceful path.  It was international recognition of Bosnia that gave the  original boost precisely to the "party of war" headed by  Izetbegovic. Now the moderate politician Fikret Abdic, who won  300,000 more votes than Izetbegovic in the prewar election  precisely on a platform of interethnic concord, has been forced  to fight Izetbegovic's gunmen for the right to conclude a peace  with the Serbs and Croats. Meanwhile the prospects for peace in  Bosnia remain hazy.    Of course we should agree with French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe. After all, the most important thing is not to  ascertain who was to blame for the recent tragedy in the  Sarajevo market; the important thing is that people should no  longer suffer shelling. But, as experience shows, to strive for  that by increasing pressure on one of the warring sides and,  still more so, by putting an ultimatum to it means playing into  the hands of extremist forces among the Bosnian Muslims and  pouring oil on the flames of the Bosnia conflict.</p>

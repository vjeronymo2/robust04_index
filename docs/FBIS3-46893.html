Hata told a press conference after the year's first cabinet  meeting that the government intends to set the price at levels  which can meet consumers' demand for less expensive rice. The  price of domestic rice "will be the yardstick" for that of  foreign rice, he said.    Hata added a ministry panel, the Rice Price Council, will be  called soon to give its views.    Japan plans to import a total of 1.9 million tons of rice by  the end of March. The imports, the first in a decade, were  forced by poor harvests last year -- the worst of the postwar  period -- due to the unusually wet and cool summer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>   [Text] Ankara--Although there is a temporary hush over the  Kurdish region of northern Iraq, it belies the tension that  continues to simmer between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP)  and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Until the  cease-fire between the KDP and PUK was signed earlier this week,  violent clashes erupted dividing the two groups and creating an  atmosphere of instability in the area. All the while, the  separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in  Turkey, had been stepping up its own efforts to seize the  initiative in the region.    In fact, Turkey is worried that the PKK might be  manipulating  the conflict by providing aid to the PUK. This fear reportedly  led Turkish officials to warn the PUK not to collaborate with  the PKK during the KDP-PUK meeting held in the Turkish border  town of Silopi on Monday [6 June].    Despite Turkish worries, the PKK has maintained that it is  making considerable efforts to end the clashes between the  feuding Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. Yet it is clear that  the PKK has been exploiting the instability caused by the  clashes to expand their activities and influence in the region,  by holding meetings, making declarations and distributing  propaganda in favor of the organization's separatist ideology.  Their targets are the Turkish fugitives that supposedly fled  the fighting in southeastern Turkey to find safer havens in the  border towns of northern Iraq. The PKK apparently sees the  Turkish refugees as a valuable resource and potential force to  be tapped into in the future. Sources close to the PKK have  confirmed this view, saying that the refugees could later join  in the PKK's struggle against the Turkish state.    PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, trying to draw attention to his  organization, asserted that the problem of the Kurds is now an  international problem and added that the establishment of peace  in the region depended on the resolution of the Kurdish problem  in Turkey. He also claimed that the people of the "North" and  those of the "South" had united following the migration of  Kurdish-origin Turks to northern Iraq.    Taking his vision of a united "North" and "South" one step  further, Ocalan introduced the concept of a "Greater Kurdistan"  and reportedly contacted the KDP and PUK in an attempt to  interest them in the idea.    After the emigration of approximately 20,000 Kurds from the  regions of Turkey close to the border, neutral observers say  that these emigrants might join in the clashes in the future.  "These people, who fled when their villages and their houses  were burnt down, are already living through a war. Most of  their children are among the guerrillas and they might join in  the fighting too," say the sources. Whether they do or not  remains to be seen, but it is obvious that Turkey will have some  difficult questions to answer when international talks on the  20,000 emigrants begin.    The PKK aims to gain strength in the North with the  migration  to Northern Iraq. All the migrants are people whose houses and  villages had been demolished in military operations and who are  claimed by Turkish officers to be supporters of the PKK. It is  most likely that such people will be force into the arms of the  PKK.    The PKK is in a difficult situation after the destruction of  the villages from which the organization obtains most of its  logistic support. Its declared aim of concentrating its  activities in areas known as "pilot regions," fits with the  strategy of a "Greater Kurdistan."    It is known that the PKK is in agreement and collaboration  with the PUK and that the KDP is much concerned by this  collaboration. Turkey shares the same feelings as the KDP, as  the Peshmergas of the KDP are not skilled in warfare. Indeed,  the PKK has a clear superiority over both the KDP and the PUK in  this sense and this is the underlying reason for all the  anxiety. In addition to this, the Turkish military faces  problems in initiating operations in Northern Iraq as the PKK  shifts its forces there. The migration of people from border  regions to deep inside Iraqi territory will make matters even  worse. It is even predicted that the UN might intervene with  the situation in such a state of confusion.    Another development that gives encouragement to the PKK is  the interest shown by certain groups within the KDP towards the  PKK. It was stated that the Peshmergas that were sent to the  Turkish border began cooperating with the PKK 2-3 months later  and that the situation deteriorated as more Peshmergas arrived  in the region. Rumors said that around 600 families were to  emigrate from Halepce to Turkey because of the clashes between  the KDP and the PUK. Even though they have not been  ascertained, these rumors are in accord with Ocalan's  declarations. Ocalan says, "There are Northerners who went to  the South. The North has already united with the South." This  statement reflects the primary condition of the PKK for the  application of the strategy for a "Greater Kurdistan." The  important thing for PKK members is not the action taken by the  leaders or the organizations but the relations between peoples.  Significantly, the PKK have left a door open to the KDP. "We do  not want everything for ourselves. The important thing is the  harmony between the ideals for Kurdistan. We would even support  Barzani if he achieves this. The important thing is unity,"  they say. The PKK hopes to profit from the situation created as  the groups in the KDP that regard the PKK with sympathy put  pressure on Barzani.    The PKK claims that the establishment of peace in the Middle  East depends on a solution to the Kurdish problem, now assuming  the dimensions of an international issue. For that reason the  PKK is trying to seize the initiative in Northern Iraq.  However, if we consider that four large countries--Turkey,  Iraq, Iran and Syria-- are involved in this issue, we can only  wait and see whether these efforts will succeed or not. We  ought to deliver PUK leader Talabani's message: "Do not fear  our collaboration with the PKK." The region continually gives  birth to new developments. In Turkey one hears the words, "PKK  members are also our children." Could this be interpreted as a  good omen?</p>

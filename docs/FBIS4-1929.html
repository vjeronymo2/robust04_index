			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Sun Chen pointed out on 23 March  that in accordance with the policy of reduction-in-strength, the  troops of the republic's armed force will be reduced from the  current 498,000 to 400,000 in the next 10 years. After the  reduction, the current combat capacity will be maintained with  better weaponry, more firepower, and greater mobility. He  stressed that it is absolutely essential to maintain the minimum  requirements of security defense strength.    The portion of the National Defense Report 1993-94 released  by the Ministry of National Defense [MND] on 23 March dealing  with national defense troops notes that the number of troops has  dropped from 503,000 to 498,000, a reduction of 5,000, in the  past year. The 10-year reduction-in-strength plan that starts in  1994 projects that in 10 years the number of troops will be  reduced to 400,000. The White Paper notes that troop draw-down  will be accelerated in the next nine years.    The number of males that can be drafted has been dropping  steadily in recent years. The MND will use more civilian and  women personnel in the future to reduce its dependence on  enlistees.    National Defense Minister Sun Chen said that in view of the  aforementioned major changes in manpower, the armed forces will  maintain its current level of combat readiness by upgrading its  weaponry. To meet this need, we have made active efforts in the  past two years to purchase such high-performance fighters as  F-16's and Mirage 2000's.    Sun Chen also emphasized that a nation's combat readiness is  not determined by its armed forces alone. Rather, it is  determined by the nation's overall resources. If too much  manpower and resources are spent on national defense, it will  have an adverse effect on the nation's economic development and  will prove ill-advised in the long run. Therefore, it is  necessary to strike a balance between the short and long terms  and reduce the troops as a percentage of the whole population.    Sun Chen said: The National Defense Report notes that the  ratio of the troops as a percentage of the whole population will  drop to 1.7. The defense budget will also drop as a percentage  of the general budget of the central government, the budgets of  governments at three levels, and the GNP. It is hoped that, in  spite of the percentage drop, the absolute defense expenditure  figure -- and the resources spent on the maintenance of national  defense -- will continue to grow as a result of fast economic  growth.    We have our own standards for assessing the minimum  requirements of national defense strength. The purpose of our  military is to defend our country and our people's safety. We  are not in an arms race against the Chinese Communists.  However, we need to maintain the minimum needs of national  defense as a guarantee for our safety.</p>

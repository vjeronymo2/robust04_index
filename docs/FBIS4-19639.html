			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Karl-Ludwig Guensche report: "Kliningrad as a Test"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian  Social Union) will meet with representatives of German  enterprises in Kaliningrad today. He wants to familiarize  himself with projects of the Trust Agency East European Advisory  Office that are being supported by the Federal Government.  Waigel is coming from St. Petersburg where he attended the  annual meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Bank  for Reconstruction and Developments. During his stop in  Kaliningrad, he will also discuss the current state of the  establishment of the free trade zone with the head of the  Territorial Administration, Jantar.    In the meantime, the four foreign-policy experts of the  CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union],  Bundestag members Wilfried Boehm, Hartmut Koschyk, Friedbert  Pflueger, and Christian Schmidt, have thought about  Kaliningrad's future role. A "document on the current state" by  the foreign affairs working group of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group  states that the Kaliningrad region is a "number one all-European  security problem." The area has been an "extremely isloated  military colony for the past 50 years." A preservation or the  expansion of the military concentration would "certainly trigger  fears of Russian military predominance," it might provoke  military countermeasures, disturb the peaceful development in  the Baltic states and in the whole of Central Europe  considerably, and "basically endanger Europe's entire security  architecture after the end of the Cold War."    For this reason, the future of the Russian part of eastern  Prussia does not only concern Russia alone, the CDU/CSU  officials stressed. The West European states should try to  remind Russia of its responsibility and ensure the gradual  reduction of the military presence in the Kaliningrad region.  The CDU/CSU politicians pointed out that the influx of Russian  soldiers and weapons that are being withdrawn from Germany and  "parked" in Kaliningrad may add to the danger that Kaliningrad  might become a "crisis region." Already, at this point, 200,000  men are deployed there. A regional arms race might develop.  The three Baltic states in particular might feel "even more  encircled than today."    The measures that have so far been taken by the Russian  Government to ensure a peaceful development in the region are  not sufficient in the view of the CDU/CSU officials. Thus, it  is the task of the West Europeans to try and exert influence.  This is particularly necessary at a time when Russia is  defining its security policy anew. Even if Yeltsin should  succeed in implementing his reform course, one must proceed from  the premise "that the military component will continue to remain  a decisive factor of Russian policies." Thus, there will be no  opportunity for a complete demilitarization of the Kaliningrad  region in the foreseeable future. Yet the West must ensure that  this territory will only become an outer defense bastion within  the framework of a general defense concept to protect Russian  territory.    Russia's behavior in this region will be a test for the  entire policy of Russia. The Russians must be asked to enter  into a security-political dialogue with their neighbors. The  Bundestag members suggested drafting joint solutions with the  Russians within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, the CSCE, and the European Council.</p>

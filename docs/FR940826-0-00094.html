			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Weight and volume equivalencies based on cup burner data are much less meaningful for streaming agents than for total flood agents. One needs to consider performance of the agents and equipment in larger-scale standardized tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Use of CFCs and HCFCs in Portable Extinguishers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this notice, EPA is clarifying the relationship between CAAA section 610 and section 612 regulations. Under section 610(b) (58 FR 4768; January 15, 1993), CFCs are banned from sale or distribution in all portable fire extinguishers. Under section 610(d) (58 FR 69637, December 30, 1993), HCFCs in pressurized dispensers are banned from sale or distribution. However, section 619(d) excludes HCFCs which are part of an installed `system,' and therefore exempted total flooding systems and those streaming applications which incorporate fixed, automatic systems (58 FR 69646). Further, section 610(d) only allows the sale of a portable fire extinguisher containing HCFCs where other agents are not suitable for the intended applications. Suitability includes the commercial availability of the agent and the ability of the agent to suppress a fire in progress without damaging the equipment requiring protection (58 FR 69648). Because alternatives are available for residential consumer uses, section 610(d) banned the sale and use of HCFCs in portable fire extinguishers for residential consumer applications. However, in commercial (including industrial and military) settings, the variety of hazards are too broad to make a standard rulemaking, and therefore under section 610(d) EPA has established industry-based mechanisms for controlling the sale of HCFCs to commercial users and owners of watercraft and aircraft. Because section 610(d) already bans CFCs in portable fire extinguishers and HCFCs in residential applications, it is not necessary for them to be listed as unacceptable under SNAP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCFCs and HCFC Blends that are listed as acceptable under SNAP, but that are not acceptable under section 610(d) in residential streaming applications are: HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;124, [HCFC Blend] B, [HCFC Blend] C, and [HCFC Blend] D. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. New Listing Decisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Acceptable Substitutes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Streaming Agents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) HCFC&hyph;124._HCFC&hyph;124 is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFC&hyph;124 has an ODP of 0.02, a 100-year GWP of 440 and an atmospheric lifetime of 7 years. Its extinguishment concentration, based on cup burner tests, is 7.0 per cent, while its cardiotoxic level (LOAEL) is 2.5 per cent in the dog, with no effect (NOAEL) apparent at 1.0 per cent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actual exposures were assessed using personal monitoring devices, and the Agency concludes that likely exposure levels from its use as a streaming agent do not exceed safe levels when used in a well ventilated area. The manufacturer of portable extinguishers using these agents should include cautionary language on the label indicating the need for ventilation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This agent is subject to regulations under section 610(d) of the CAA, which stipulates that HCFCs may only be used in portable fire extinguishers where other commercially available agents are not as effective for the fire hazard. Under section 610(d), HCFCs may not be used in residential extinguishers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) [HCFC Blend] C._[HCFC Blend] C is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This agent is a proprietary blend of HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;124, HCFC&hyph;134a, and an additive. The cardiotoxic LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC&hyph;123 is, respectively, 2.0 per cent and 1.0 per cent; the LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC&hyph;124 is 2.5 per cent and 1.0 per cent; and the LOAEL and NOAEL for HCFC&hyph;134a is 8.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent respectively. While the manufacturer may, in the future, conduct personal monitoring studies of actual exposure levels of this agent, previous studies conducted for pure HCFC&hyph;123 and for pure HCFC&hyph;124 have shown that exposure in the breathing zone does not exceed cardiotoxicity values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ODP of both HCFC&hyph;123 and HCFC&hyph;124 is 0.02 while HCFC&hyph;134a has no ODP since it contains no chlorine. The respective GWP values for HCFC&hyph;123, HCFC&hyph;124, and HCFC&hyph;134a are 90, 440, and 1200, relative to CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , while their respective atmospheric lifetimes are 2 years, 7 years and 16 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

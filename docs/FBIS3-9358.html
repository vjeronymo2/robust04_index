Fifty jurists of the commissariat  and two members of the DLK [Kosova Democratic Alliance]  Presidency, the Benelux branch, Ramadan Gashi and Gani Azemi  took part in the meeting.    The DLK representatives pointed out that due to the terror  and continuous violence in Kosova, many Albanian youngsters are  forced to leave their country and seek temporary asylum in the  Western states. Moreover they are under the Serbian threat for  violently being called up in the Serbian Army and then sent to  Bosnia and Croatia.    Referring to this campaign, Mr. Gashi and Mr. Azemi said  that  "the Albanian people in Kosova are under a permanent threat,  thus concrete measures must be undertaken in their defence."</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Aid group plea for Uruguay Round losers Developing countries which stand to lose from a Uruguay Round trade agreement, among them many impoverished African nations, should be compensated with extra aid, trade preferences and debt relief, according to Christian Aid, a church-sponsored aid agency. Mr Peter Madden, the charity's trade policy adviser, yesterday called for negotiation of side agreements to the Round accord which would cushion the potential losses for some developing countries, mostly poor food importers. 'It is not right that the losers - overwhelmingly the poorest countries of the world - should bear the costs of the agreement which brings so many benefits to others,' he said at the launch of Winners and Losers, a report detailing the Round's impact on developing countries. A recent study by the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development put the overall income gain from the Round at an annual Dollars 213bn by 2002, but this conceals a loss for Africa of Dollars 2.6bn. Other losers include Indonesia, some Mediterranean states and Caribbean nations. Christian Aid notes that 'unequivocal losers' fall into four overlapping categories: African, Caribbean and Pacific nations which get trade preferences under the European Union's Lome convention. The value of these preferences will fall as tariffs are lowered to all, squeezing access to the EU market. Net food-importers who will face higher prices for farm products, at least in the short term, as EU and US agricultural export subsidies are cut. Over 100 of the world's 132 developing countries are net food importers, reflecting the extent to which huge farm subsidies in the west have put Third World farmers out of business. Exporters of cocoa and coffee, prices of which are predicted to fall. Countries lacking the capital, knowledge and technology to exploit new trading opportunities. Mr Madden, the report's co-author, said the 116 nations taking part in the Round should negotiate compensating side agreements before the accord is formally signed next April. These should cover compensation for lost markets, help to meet higher food prices, assistance with the costs of complying with new fair trade rules, and debt relief. The Uruguay Round package includes a draft ministerial declaration on the problems of net food importers, which refers to the possibility of additional food aid and IMF and World Bank loans for countries in difficulties. But Mr Madden said the language was vague and more specific commitments were needed.</p>

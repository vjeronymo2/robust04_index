			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Fire and Acts of God included - The fortunes of the Ecclesiastical Insurance Group GOD MAY have had a hand in its creation, but Ecclesiastical Insurance Group finds that most of its current concerns are rooted firmly here on earth. It is scarcely ruffled by the Pounds 2m it estimates will be paid out as a result of the IRA bomb 12 days ago which damaged six churches in the City of London. It is confident that its diverse portfolio should absorb any short-term impact on premiums. A statement issued shortly after the bomb blast was more preoccupied with the damage to church heritage and 'irreplaceable' stained glass than with the claims it would be required to meet. 'Mercifully,' it said, 'the organist at St Helen's, Bishopsgate, who was playing the organ at the time of the explosion and was showered with glass was uninjured although he was severely shocked.' The aura of the Church of England still hovers over the company, which was founded in 1887 by senior members of the Anglican hierarchy and still insures 95 per cent of its churches. However, divine inspiration has not left the company safe from the problems facing its secular competitors. It declared losses of Pounds 2.16m for the six months to last June, and of Pounds 640,000 for the last full year - much of it the result of the 1990 storms and other natural catastrophes. Ecclesiastical paid out more than Pounds 3m to York Minster after fire damage caused by lightning in 1984 - unleashed, some people suggested, by the enthronement two days' earlier of the controversial Bishop of Durham. It is also contributing to the costs caused by the crane that collapsed on to the roof of St James Garlickhythe in London last year. Mr John McArdell, who joined the company straight from school in 1948 and is now deputy managing director, lists a number of 'standard perils' triggering its policies, with wind damage, frozen pipes and lightning strikes high among them. Acts of God are all covered by Ecclesiastical's policies. But those motivated by Mammon are rather more of a drain on its resources. Vandalism and arson are both on the increase, while one in three churches are now affected each year by theft of items such as lead roofing, offeratory boxes and pews. The company employs 75 surveyors and valuers around the country, well-versed in their appreciation of historic buildings, who quantify premiums and assess payments when claims are made. The Ecclesiastical Buildings Fire Office, as it was originally known, remains true to its Victorian roots and objectives: to conserve for the Church profits from insuring its property. On top of its original motto  - 'For the church' - its modern slogan is 'Insurance you can believe in.' The board is still dominated by Anglican clergy, and its various subsidiaries are all ultimately owned by Allchurches Trust. The trust is able to recover the tax paid on the dividends and distribute the money to church causes. The religious backdrop has not blurred a good eye for business, however. Dividends to the trust have grown sharply, totalling Pounds 16m since it was created, Pounds 6m of which was generated in the last five years. Ecclesiastical's investment portfolio mirrors that of other insurance companies. It has boosted premium income with new products, such as contents cover for vicarages and motor insurance for the clergy. In 1988, it launched the Amity Fund, an ethical unit trust investing in companies which contribute to 'the quality of family and community life'. The company is not exempt from unholy competition, however. Alongside the larger general insurers, Methodist Insurance, Congregational &amp; General and United Reform Church Insurance all vie to cover the buildings of their own denominations. 'The stock of churches is not expanding and the Church is under a lot of financial constraints,' says Mr McArdell. 'We try to run church insurance near to break-even. The market is very competitive.' As a result, the company launched a programme of diversification in the 1970s and now has 10 offices in the UK and three in Canada. It has also moved into more general types of insurance, using its expertise in historic buildings to capture the business of more than 50 per cent of all independent and public schools, as well as a growing number of nursing homes and charities. But the ethical philosophy remains, reflected in initiatives such as subsidies to keep premiums charged to vicars in inner cities to levels in lower risk areas. 'We are wholly independent of the Church of England,' says Mr McArdell, 'but would hope everything we did would be approved of by it.'</p>

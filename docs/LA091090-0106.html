			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE SINGER'S TALENT BELIES HIS RELATIVE OBSCURITY;  </P> <P> JAMES INTVELD PROVED HIMSELF READY FOR THE PRIME TIME SATURDAY AT PEPPERS  GOLDEN BEAR WITH A ROLLICKING 11-SONG SET.  </P> <P> The music business has a lot to offer mystery-lovers, what with little industry  perplexities such as, "How can bands have million-selling records and nothing  to show for it?" and "How come it currently costs less to make a CD than an LP  but the CD still retails for $5 more?"  </P> <P> One mystery particular to Orange County is, "How come the Garden Grove-raised  James Intveld isn't a star and doesn't even have a recording contract?"  </P> <P> In an industry rife with clone-band tax writeoffs, one would think there's at  least a little room for a performer as excellent, complete and distinctive as  Intveld proved to be in his set opening for Jamie James at the new Peppers  Golden Bear on Saturday.  </P> <P> While Intveld is following an entirely different course than Stockton-bred  Chris Isaak, there are some comparisons that can be made between the two.  </P> <P> Intveld isn't yet as unique a stylist as Isaak, but both have a knack for  taking early-roots rock influences and giving them their own timeless stamp.  And like Isaak, Intveld, with his underfed James Dean looks, certainly has that  video-ready quality the industry loves. The 30-year-old singer's only problem  may be that he's been toiling for so long in the trendy Los Angeles scene that  the industry now takes him for granted.  </P> <P> But Intveld certainly hasn't let a sense of inertia creep into his work.  </P> <P> Backed by a propulsive trio of bassist Greg Boaz, keyboardist Rick Solem and  former X drummer D.J. Bonebrake, he delivered a shaking 11-song set Saturday.  </P> <P> Intveld's strongest suit is his songs. He has a fine knack for melding a raw  rock sound -- there are touches of everything from Gene Vincent to the  Yardbirds -- with a persuasive, hook-laden pop sensibility.  </P> <P> On his "Thinking About You," that combination resulted in an ebullient pop song  that sounded somewhat like a grittier Traveling Wilburys. "Tracy," co-written  with keyboardist Solem, mixed that pop surety with a strain of melancholy,  while the Bo Diddley-beat "That's Me" was every bit as cocky and wild as its  self-assertive chorus.  </P> <P> Though Intveld once needed a lead guitarist to properly flesh out his songs,  these days he's got both rhythm and lead duties amply covered with his red Les  Paul guitar.  </P> <P> His vocals had both an appealing reedy quality and enough power -- especially  on the ballad "Such a Lonely Night" -- to convey his emotion above an overloud  band mix that often obscured the actual lyrics.  </P> <P> It would be nice to say that his performance stunned the crowd, but a goodly  number of people in the Bear only seemed to be there waiting for the post-show  disco music to start up.  </P> <P> Although the new club appears to have the technical amenities down, its  double-duty concert/disco setup may make it a difficult place in which to  seriously appreciate music.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUPLES (62) SLAYS THE COURSE;  </P> <P> GOLF: HE HAS 10 BIRDIES IN RECORD-TYING ROUND AT RIVIERA AND HE SHATTERS THE  54-HOLE TOURNAMENT MARK WITH A 197. BUT MORGAN AND MEDIATE AREN'T FAR BEHIND.  </P> <P> Fred Couples has been successful on the PGA Tour, a player who is often in  contention and high on the money-winning list.  </P> <P> However, as skilled as he is, it's generally believed that he hasn't always  played to his potential.  </P> <P> Couples reached that potential and then some Saturday at the Nissan Los Angeles  Open at the Riviera Country Club.  </P> <P> He tied the course record with a nine-under-par 62 to take a two-stroke lead  into today's final round.  </P> <P> Moreover, his 54-hole total of 197, 16 under par, set an L.A. Open record for  three rounds. Chip Beck held the previous record at 199 in 1988.  </P> <P> With many in a crowd of 35,650 cheering him on, Couples finished with a  flourish.  </P> <P> His seven-iron second shot on the 447-yard 18th hole landed only two feet from  the cup.  </P> <P> "That was fantastic," said the 30-year-old Couples, who then tapped in for his  10th birdie of the afternoon.  </P> <P> Couples started the day four strokes behind Michael Allen, the second-round  leader, but he made up ground in a hurry with six birdies on the front nine  along with one bogey.  </P> <P> He had four more birdies on the back nine to tie the course record set by Larry  Mize in 1985.  </P> <P> "This is the best I've ever played for three rounds," said Couples, who is  known as Boom-Boom for his length off the tee.  </P> <P> Riviera has been a fast track for the pros this week because of the warm  weather, gentle breezes and with the greens holding shots.  </P> <P> So sub-par rounds are routine. Rocco Mediate, 27, and Gil Morgan, 43, a  two-time L.A. Open champion, will be playing in the final group with Couples  today.  </P> <P> Mediate, shooting for his first tour victory, shot a four-under par 67. Morgan  had a 65. They're at 199, tying Beck's 54-hole record that was broken by  Couples.  </P> <P> Allen, who held the lead for 36 holes, got off to a shaky start when his tee  shot on the par-five, 501-yard first hole landed out of bounds on the top of a  hospitality tent.  </P> <P> He got a double bogey on the hole, but recovered to shoot a one-over-par 72.  Nonetheless, he's at 203, one stroke behind Hale Irwin (64) and Hal Sutton (67)  and six back of Couples.  </P> <P> "It was just one of those days," said Couples, who lived in Newport Beach for a  while, but now makes his home in Palm Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it was a flawless round, but every time I looked up the ball  was going where I looked," he said. "Obviously, I know I can't shoot 62  tomorrow, but I need to play well and that's all I'll be thinking about."  </P> <P> Neither Mediate nor Morgan were surprised that Couples shot a 62, saying that  he's capable of it.  </P> <P> For all of his talent, though, Couples has only three tour victories in nine  years, the last coming in the Byron Nelson tournament in 1987.  </P> <P> However, he has been a member of the Ryder Cup team, had five top-10 finishes  in 1989 and has earned $1.7 million the past three years on the tour.  </P> <P> Couples said Friday that he doubted that anyone would shoot a score as low as  63, which Allen did in the first round Thursday.  </P> <P> So Couples came back with a 62, which he said was his best competitive round.  </P> <P> "I don't know why," said Couples. "However, it's the best I've ever hit my  irons and I don't believe the pins were as tough (placement) as they were the  first two days."  </P> <P> Asked to describe his birdie on the 18th hole, which is uphill and is regarded  as one of the most demanding finishing holes on the tour, Couples said:  </P> <P> "My drive landed in the first cut of the rough and I had a good lie and was 156  yards away. The pin was on line with trees. I hit it just enough to catch the  green and it spun sideways down toward the pin.  </P> <P> "It was the shot I was trying to hit, but it was a fluke that it was two feet  away."  </P> <P> There was nothing fluky, though, about his round. And if he shoots 66 or better  today, he will break the 72-hole L.A. Open record of 264 set by Lanny Wadkins  in 1985.  </P> <P> Asked about the high expectations for him, Couples said: "A few times my mind  hasn't been in it, but most of the time my golf is as strong as my game will  let me play."  </P> <P> Couples and Morgan have been in contention on the final day in other years. For  Mediate, it's a relatively new experience.  </P> <P> He was in the final group at Pebble Beach recently, but faltered by shooting a  77 in a tournament won by Mark O'Meara.  </P> <P> "Today was a huge test for me," Mediate said. "If you shoot a high score,  you're gone. Now I have a chance, but I was nervous on the first tee."  </P> <P> Mediate stumbled, though, on the 413-yard 12th hole, where he took a double  bogey.  </P> <P> But he recovered quickly -- and spectacularly -- on the next hole, a par-four  measuring 420 yards. His five-iron second shot from 176 yards away took one  bounce on the green and rolled into the cup for an eagle.  </P> <P> "I took an extra club, choked down and hit it as hard I can and it went in, "  Mediate said. "It surprised me."  </P> <P> He then got two birdies on the last five holes to finish with his 67.  </P> <P> Mediate said his 14-under-par score for three rounds is his best showing in his  five years on the tour.  </P> <P> "I feel like I want to feel," he said. "I'm having fun and I'm looking forward  to the challenge."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Five players were grouped at 204 -- Peter Persons, Tom Sieckmann, Corey Pavin,  Peter Jacobsen and Tony Sills. Mark Calcavecchia, the defending champion, is at  208 after shooting 69 Saturday. . . . Pat Fitzsimons, who won the L.A. Open in  1975, was in contention Thursday with a 66. Since, he's had a 76 and 67 and is  at 209. . . . Fred Couples, playing in the L.A. Open for the 10th time,  considers it a must stop for him on the tour. He finished seventh in last  year's tournament, five strokes behind Calcavecchia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEADERS  </P> <P> Riviera Country Club -- Par 71  </P> <P> Fred Couples 68-67-62 -- 197  </P> <P> Gil Morgan 67-67-65 -- 199  </P> <P> Rocco Mediate 65-67-67 -- 199  </P> <P> Hale Irwin 71-67-64 -- 202  </P> <P> Hal Sutton 68-67-67 -- 202  </P> <P> Michael Allen 63-68-72 -- 203  </P> <P> 5 tied at 204  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Freedom Front has said in a statement issued in  Pretoria the fact that ballot papers were not available in white  areas of Alberton early this morning calls into serious question  the freedom and fairness of the election. The front said it  suspects that the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] is  being deliberately unhelpful. A complaint in this regard is to  be handed to the IEC today.</p>

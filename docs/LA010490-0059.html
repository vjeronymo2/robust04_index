Officials are planning an all-day picnic April 21 at Carlton J.  Peterson Park.  </P> <P> The event, proposed by City Council members John Forbing and Gary Werner, will  include a softball tournament, food bazaar, citizen recognition awards,  children's games, races and relays and a tree-planting ceremony. The City  Council on Tuesday night appointed a committee to plan the activities, but  members said they expect the project to be a communitywide effort.  </P> <P> Diamond Bar, which has 45,000 residents and encompasses 8,000 acres of rolling  hills, is the 86th city to be incorporated in Los Angeles County. It is one of  the fastest-growing communities in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P></p>

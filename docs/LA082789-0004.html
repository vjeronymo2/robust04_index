			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: NO REGRETS;  </P> <P> DEFINING THE ESSENCE OF A MAN BY THE THINGS HE'S CHOSEN NOT TO DO  </P> <P> CLAIRE WEINBERG,my travel agent, was reflecting the other day on things that  she and her husband haven't done. She specified four things. They have never  bought a lottery ticket; they have never been camping; they have never had room  service, and they have never used an automatic teller.  </P> <P> I couldn't tell whether her attitude toward these lapses was one of regret,  pride or, simply, wonder. At a certain age, one tends to review one's life and  worry that one has been passed by by the mainstream.  </P> <P> If we have led decent lives and have clear consciences, we are more likely to  regret the things we haven't done than those that we have. On the other hand, I  have never used an automatic teller, and I don't regret it. I am rather  intimidated by such machines.  </P> <P> I did buy a lottery ticket that week when the payoff was up to $40 million or  something close to that. It occurred to me that $40 million would actually  change my life, though I wasn't sure that $1 million or even $10 million would.  </P> <P> For a mere $1 million, I doubted that I would even quit my job, as most winners  do. I was more interested in seeing what I would do with $40 million than with  actually having it. I was curious about untapped urgings, about what changes in  my character that great riches might work.  </P> <P> Fortunately, I never found out.  </P> <P> I have been camping and I have had room service. Given a choice, I'd take room  service. I have never understood why anyone would deliberately resort to a  Neanderthal life style for a weekend on the pretext of having fun. My idea of  camping out is to order room service in the Santa Barbara Biltmore or some such  retreat and lie in bed, watching while the waiter wheels a table into the room  and lays out the white napery and the silver flatware, pours hot decaf, takes  the lids off plates of scrambled eggs and bacon and then unfolds a copy of The  Times.  </P> <P> If I were Mrs. Weinberg and her husband, I would certainly court an opportunity  to have room service. Avoiding it is self-denial of the most Spartan sort.  </P> <P> I can't think of many things I would like to do that I haven't done. I have  never owned a Porsche, an Alfa Romeo, a Ferrari or a Rolls-Royce, and I am not  especially eager to. I have been to most of the capitals of the Western world,  but I have never been to Asia. I have seen the Parthenon but not the Pyramids.  </P> <P> I have stood in battle; I have had a coronary bypass; I have fathered two  children; I have published eight books; I have read half the works of  Shakespeare; in my youth I was a 108-pound wrestling champion of the Whittier  YMCA.  </P> <P> I never graduated from college; I have never learned to fly; I have never  finished Will and Ariel Durant's "Story of Civilization"; I have never been  baptized; I have never made a parachute jump; I have never been divorced; I  have never been invited to the White House by a President.  </P> <P> Most of the things I haven't done I haven't done because I didn't want to  (except being invited to the White House). There are a great many more things I  don't want to do than things that I do. That is perhaps the only serious  difference between my wife and me. She is an adventurer. She will try almost  anything. If there are any unexplored regions left in the upper Amazon, she  would love to explore them. Her appetite and her energy are boundless. Also,  she is fearless. She simply does not believe that anything bad can happen to  her.  </P> <P> On the contrary, I am more timorous and contemplative. I'd rather sit in the  comfort of my living room and see the Pyramids on TV than make that arduous  trip to Cairo. I have no desire to ride a camel. I do not enjoy air travel. I  do not want to see France from a balloon. I did enjoy our cruise up the Danube,  but that was because there was nothing to do but lie in a deck chair and watch  the castles go by.  </P> <P> But this morning, I got a Diet Coke out of a machine at the car wash. Maybe I  could learn to operate an automatic teller.  </P></p>

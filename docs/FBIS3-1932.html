			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Chieh-hung (7115 3381 1738): "Chen Yun Stresses </F> Steadiness and Prudence in Economic Construction"]    [Text] Sources said: In recent years, Chen Yun has been  basically living in a place beside Xi Hu in Hangzhou for  recuperation, but he is very concerned about the orientation of  economic development and reform. He has expressed his views on  many occasions since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee held in last November.    The sources also said: Wan Li, former chairman of the  National People's Congress Standing Committee, specially pointed  out when chatting with retired veteran cadres in Beijing that  once the Gang of Four collapsed, Chen Yun had resolutely asked  for permission to let Comrade Xiaoping resume his post. Later,  he gave his support to Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. As far as party life is  concerned, it is normal to have different views on certain  concrete policies and measures, which should not be considered  as factional infighting.  <H3>  The Scale of Construction Must Be in Line With Our National  Strength </H3>   The sources added: On the eve of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Chen Yun wrote a letter  entitled "My Several Views" to the Central Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee. He spoke of five points in his  letter:    1. The leading body of the CPC Central Committee with  Comrade  Jiang Zemin at the core is strong and capable, it has done a  good job.    2. We must enhance party building and heighten the ideology  of building a clean government on the people's behalf and treat  it as our party's long-term task.    3. We must educate the whole party and, in particular,  cadres  at the provincial (ministerial), prefecture, and city levels,  and resolutely get rid of localism, departmental selfishness,  and sectarianism.    4. It is true that speed is a major consideration in  economic  construction, but benefits are of paramount importance. It is  true that economic construction should procede on a large scale,  but it must be in line with our national strength. This is  precisely a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts.    5. Reform must be founded on self-reliance and the principle  of building China well. Only when we build China well can we  become independent and autonomous, vigorously develop China, and  be in an invincible position.  <H3>  Do Not Alter the Principle of Treating the Publicly Owned  Economic Sector as the Mainstay </H3>   Chen Yun stressed on many occasions since last January that  in reform, the principle of treating the publicly owned economic  sector as the mainstay cannot be altered because it concerns the  overall system of the state. He said: I fully support the  principles and policies set by the central authorities. That  is, key state enterprises and large and medium enterprises which  have a bearing on our national economy and the people's  livelihood can only be strengthened, rather than weakened, in  reform. We must watch out for losing and doing damage to  state-owned assets. He pointed out: We must try to find out  what is meant by a socialist market economy. We can never  indiscriminately copy others' experience, but can only practice  it in a selective and partial manner. Whether or not the system  is good should be proved in practice, and never should we rush  headlong into mass action.    Chen Yun also said: I agreed with what is said by some  comrades. That is, we cannot allow foreign businessmen to run  airports, ports, highways, railways, mines, and other important  strategic resources. We must be far-sighted and cannot be in a  passive position. We cannot say foreign businessmen can invest  in whatever they wish. The United States, Canada, European  countries, Japan, and South Korea also place restrictions on  foreign investment in accordance with their national conditions.    Chen Yun stressed: There are three things which serve as the  key to the development, progress, and stability of the whole  country, that is, the CPC's own building, rural development and  utilization of rural labor force, and an urban inflation rate  which can be sustained by most citizens. If we fail to solve  and handle well any of these over quite a long period, troubles  will come.    Chen Yun suggested that the central authorities should  focus,  in a planned way, on the development of a number of impoverished  provinces and regions. He said: We have implemented reform for  15 years, we should place this problem on our agenda and try to  solve it. We can never neglect it, and we can no longer wait.</p>

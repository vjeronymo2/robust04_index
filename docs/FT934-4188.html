			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / How to Spend it: Sweet treats that make for an easy Christmas - Desserts which require little preparation If I have my way, 1993 will be a no-pudding Christmas. I shall concentrate my culinary efforts on first and main courses and end with the simple splendour of fine cheeses and a personal variation on les treize desserts - a selection of favourite fruits and sweetmeats. Elvas plums, marrons glaces and stem ginger in syrup are the triumvirate of sweetmeats without which no Christmas sideboard looks dressed properly. Chestnuts and ginger have never been hard to come by, thank goodness, but Elvas plums, traditionally imported along with port for the Christmas market, have been elusive in recent years. That they are now on sale again is cause to rejoice - and is due in part to the Weekend FT. A year ago, I wrote in a column that I hoped Elvas plums would, unlike the previous year, be obtainable for Christmas 1992. A reader, an Englishman living in Portugal, rang me straight away. He told me Elvas production had plummeted, distribution in Portugal was erratic and exports had stopped. But he and his family had bought one of the two factory farms still operating and hoped to revitalise it. Their first harvest, sugar-preserved in the traditional artisan manner and packed into wooden boxes lined with lace-paper, was ready for despatch. They would be happy, he said, to supply my local delicatessen and any other shops I might like to suggest. Fired by the enthusiastic reception for these tentative consignments, the company Conservas Rainha Santa has redoubled its efforts this year. And providing you buy soon, your sideboard need not lack Elvas plums this Christmas. For your nearest stockist, contact the importer, Porters (tel: 0423-322323; fax 0423-322335) Figs are another fruit I associate strongly with Christmas. In Amalfi, they are split and stuffed with chopped walnuts and tangerine peel, threaded onto skewers interleaved with bay, and dried. Exquisite but not, so far as I know, available in the UK. Alternative fig delicacies that are on sale in Britain include southern Italian delicacies imported by Patricia Michelson of La Fromagerie, in north London (071-359-7440). Available from her shop and by post are aromatised preserved figs; figs soaked in rum and coated with dark chocolate; plain figs (also clementines) coated in thick dark chocolate; and a stunning confection known as fig balls. The size of small cricket balls, these are dried figs soaked in honey and fruit juice to make them agreeably moist, packed into a round, and wrapped in vine leaves. She recommends them with cheese, and adds that they could possibly be used as an alternative Christmas tree decoration. Chocolate-coated Calabrian figs can also be bought from the Algerian Coffee Stores in central London (tel. 071-437-2480, fax 437-5470). From Spain come fig wheels - small, round cakes of pressed figs layered with almonds and sprinkled lightly with aniseed. A prune and walnut version is also available from the same importer, Brindisa, which can be contacted for your nearest stockist (tel: 071-403-0282; fax 071-403- 5044). Brindisa also imports some lovely turron or torro made by a Catalan company called Alemany. Torro Granulat (known as Jijona by some other producers) is an addictive, halva-like ground almond bar with lovely texture. Torro Massapa crema is a smooth almond paste flavoured with vanilla under a burnt sugar coating. The nuts are top quality, making it more nutty than sweet. Returning to something more British, two companies vie in the 'favourite fudge' stakes: the Toffee Shop in Penrith, Cumbria (0768-62008) and Wards of Adisham, Kent (0227-720596). Both sell the lovely stuff by post, and fudge fans may consider acquiring a box from each for a little serious comparative tasting this Christmas. As for chocolates, Carlo Melchior, of Chittlehampton, makes very fine truffles and praline. For families who may feel cheated if denied plum pudding, a witty solution could be to serve individual ones such as Melchior's gobstopper-size chocolate truffle plum puds filled with brandy-soaked festive fruits and topped with a sprig of marzipan holly. Melchior also confects amazing chestnut chocolates: dark chocolate filled with soft praline, encased in a green almond paste husk. (tel: 0769-540643; fax 0884-761115). On a less calorific note, few things are prettier or easier to make at home than physalis, or cape gooseberry petits fours. Pull back the paper lantern petals gently to reveal the small orange berry and dip it into melted chocolate glossed with a little butter (or into warm fondant, if you prefer). I like to leave about half the fruits undipped to show off their bright colour and the unadulterated sweet-sour taste. Christmas would not be Christmas without pyramids of clementines - so much more intensely fruity than tangerines - and bowls of walnuts and hazels. Now is the time to search junk shops for strong and attractive antique nutcrackers. Few things are more irritating than just one pair between a party of would-be nut-eaters. Tissue-wrapped amarettis have been my favourite Christmas biscuits in recent years, but the chicest choice this year will undoubtedly be the brand-new Duchy Originals - gingered biscuits which are just beginning to trickle into the shops. Organic quality and royal label apart, these are a high-quality nibble and deserve to be savoured slowly. They are pleasingly crisp and not too sweet, with an agreeable background nuttiness of malted wheat studded with succulent chunks of faintly lemony Australian stem ginger. The biscuits are made by Shipton Mill near Tetbury, which can be contacted for the name of your nearest stockist (0666-505050; fax 0666-504666).</p>

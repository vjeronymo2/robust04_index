			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal from the </F> Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv ]    [Text] Four hours ago, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev arrived on a lightning visit designed to help Israel and  the PLO resume negotiations. At this very minute, he is meeting  with Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, at the  Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Kozyrev has brought a personal  message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    The Russian minister has brought no new proposals, contrary  to anticipation in Israel prompted by his observations in Moscow  about proposals unacceptable to Israel, such as a second Madrid  conference and an armed international force in the territories.  Emerging from his meeting with Peres a short while ago, he  rejected these proposals. Asked about the second Madrid  conference concept, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  answered as follows:    [Begin Kozyrev recording, in English] What we have to do  right now is to save the process as it is and finish the first  stage, that is, Gaza and Jericho negotiations and implementation  of [word indistinct]. And after that probably we might wish, or  the parties might wish to consider (?having) not revision, but  review conference, that is resumption of Madrid, not something  different from [what] Madrid was. [end recording]    [Segal translates above and continues] As soon as his  meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is over, Kozyrev will  leave for Tunis where he will meet with PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat.    [Reporting on the Kozyrev-Peres meeting, Jerusalem Qol  Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 11 March adds: "Officials who  participated in the meeting received the impression that Russia  and the United States are coordinated with regard to Moscow's  wish for greater involvement in the political process."    [A related report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  1400  GMT on 11 March states: "Speaking after his meeting with Peres,  the Russian foreign minister said Moscow is in favor of an  international presence in the territories, but it does not  insist on an armed presence.    ["Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said Israel appreciates  Russia's part in the attempt to promote negotiations. He noted  that the ties between the two countries have recently become  closer."]</p>

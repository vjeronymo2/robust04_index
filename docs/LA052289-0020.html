			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> COMPOSERS' COMPETITION WINNERS PERFORM AT USC  </P> <P> For most of the past decade, the National Assn. of Composers USA has made a  fetish of providing recognition to young musicians willing to specialize in  contemporary music. Friday night at USC, two of the winners in these Young  Performers' Competitions displayed their expertise.  </P> <P> Soprano Jennifer Cable and flutist Rachel Rudich offered a short but  substantial program of works by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Raoul Pleskow, Marshall  Bialosky, Harvey Sollberger, Miriam Gideon, Brian Ferneyhough, Ursula Mamlok  and Lee Hoiby; their performances proved clarified and bracing.  </P> <P> Rudich's playing of Sollberger's "Riding the Wind," Parts II, III and IV, for  solo flute (1973-74) seems to exhaust the possibilities of extended techniques  for the instrument while contemplating musical materials that invite  reconsideration. Here, one had to admire the flutist's deep virtuosity and  probing seriousness, just as one had to marvel at her ability to memorize, play  and dance a complicated Stockhausen score.  </P> <P> Cable, sympathetically supported by pianist Phillip Young, negotiated the  myriad difficulties in 11 songs by five contrasting composers. Of particular  interest were Bialosky's touching "Three Short Songs for Voice Alone," to  Dickinson texts, and Gideon's tortured, restlessly atonal cycle, "Poet to  Poet." Mamlok's "Daybreak" and two Hoiby songs reminded us that neo-Romanticism  is alive and well. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

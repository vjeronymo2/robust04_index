			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Fleet sails uncharted waters: Life under two flags on the Black Sea MOORED in Sevastopol's historic harbour, the anti-submarine ship Skoryi ('Quick') flies the red, white and blue Soviet naval flag, whose hammer and sickle represents a country which no longer exists. The flag is an oddly appropriate symbol for the Black Sea fleet, which has been consigned to limbo by the unstable compromise Ukraine and Russia have achieved after a five-day struggle for control of the fleet. The conflict over the former Soviet Union's most powerful warm-water naval force, which includes 350 ships, 150 aircraft and 28 submarines with nuclear capacity, marked a low point in Ukrainian-Russian relations. Unable to enforce their rival claims to the fleet or to hoist their national flag on its ships, Ukraine and Russia have suspended their decrees. The fleet has reverted to the shaky status quo ante - the Commonwealth of Independent States. That is fine with the Skoryi's 34-year-old captain, Andrei Reshetov. 'If we are forced to divide the fleet there will be chaos. No-one will benefit,' he says. 'It would be better not to have to divide anything.' Captain Reshetov's ship is the ninth to bear the name Skoryi; he says the original was built by Russia's first naval enthusiast, Peter the Great. But Captain Reshetov holds with a different tradition. He emphasises that the Black Sea fleet was 'Soviet, not Russian', and portraits of Lenin are ubiquitous aboard his ship. Bristling with missiles, the 20-year-old Skoryi is half-way in size between a corvette and a destroyer. It is designed primarily to fulfil strategic tasks in the Mediterranean, hunting submarines and attacking aircraft. Over lunch in the wood-panelled officers' mess hall, where the same congealed noodles are on offer as are served to the enlisted men, it is evident that Captain Reshetov and his officers are primarily concerned about preserving the strategic functions of their ship. A Ukrainian takeover poses a certain threat, given Ukraine's vow to become non-nuclear and restrict its fleet to the Black Sea. Nonetheless, most officers say they will serve whichever republic acquires political control over the fleet, although on the Skoryi they expressed a preference for Russia. Below decks, where bunks are stacked in threes, sympathies swing the other way. Most recruits have been drafted from Ukraine and even the ethnic Russians among them say they hope the fleet will become Ukraine's. Deputy captain Igor Prutskov sums up his ship's predicament: 'What are we to do - raise the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag at the stern and the Russian tricolor at the bow?'</p>

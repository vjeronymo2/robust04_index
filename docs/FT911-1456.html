			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Early poll called in New South Wales NEW South Wales, the only Australian state with a conservative government, will go to the polls on May 25, Mr Nick Greiner, the premier,announced yesterday. Mr Greiner called the election 10 months earlier than necessary because of the refusal of the Labor-dominated Upper House of Parliament to pass industrial relations legislation ending compulsory trade unionism. However, the timing reflects an attempt by the governing Liberal/National Party coalition to capitalise on the problems of Labor governments at federal level and in most of the other states. Mr Greiner will contrast his claim that the state will balance its budget this year with the virtual disappearance of the federal government's forecast ADollars 8bn (Pounds 3.7bn) surplus, and the serious financial problems of Labor-run Victoria and South Australia. The coalition will be helped by a Royal Commission into alleged corrupt relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia, which is damaging Labor. Labor needs a 5.3 per cent swing to win the 13 seats necessary for victory, but trailed the coalition by seven points in the latest Morgan Gallup opinion poll. Mr Bob Carr, the state Labor leader, will try to insulate the campaign from Labor's problems elsewhere by concentrating on allegations of false government accounting, and minimising appearances by federal Labor leaders. However, his strategy received an early blow yesterday when Australian Ratings, the local credit agency, reduced Victoria's credit rating to AA from AA plus, and criticised the state government's financial management. Labor's problems in other states have helped the Greiner government recover strongly from a difficult first two years in office, when spending cuts and controversial industrial relations and education initiatives provoked widespread protests. A coalition victory in New South Wales would provide a solid base for a conservative assault on Labor state governments over the next two years, and at the next federal election, due by March 1993.</p>

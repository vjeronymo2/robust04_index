			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE JOLTS BAY AREA  </P> <P> In between emergency responses from our fire station, I watched the heroic  efforts of our brother and sister firefighters in San Francisco as they  attempted to suppress the fires and rescue people trapped in structures. The  mayor had put out a call for all off-duty fire fighting personnel to  immediately report to their fire stations.  </P> <P> While watching the coverage, my mind kept drifting back to an obscure article I  had read earlier in the day. This article described how San Francisco Mayor Art  Agnos had reduced the San Francisco Fire Department staffing by 76 positions  four months earlier. I kept waiting for someone to ask Agnos about these  reductions, but no questions were forthcoming.  </P> <P> There is no doubt that the remaining personnel of the San Francisco Fire  Department would give their all during this major disaster, but when the dust  is settled, I am sure they will ask Agnos if he still feels the same way about  his cuts in the fire department -- and I can't wait to hear his answer!  </P> <P> DALLAS JONES  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P> <P> Fire Fighters Local 1014  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Labour accuses government of buying votes: Poll gives Tories two-point lead as Kinnock steps up attack MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday stepped up his efforts to pre-empt a pre-election Budget tax cut as a new opinion poll showed the Conservatives holding on to a two-point lead over Labour. The opposition leader warned that the government was playing its last electoral card by trying 'to buy votes with borrowed money'. In a speech to parliamentary candidates in Birmingham, he went on to stress the voters' choice between Labour's plans to invest in improved public services and 'the economics of embezzlement'. To the government's embarrassment, his comments were echoed by Mr Cecil Parkinson, former Tory chairman. He told a BBC radio interviewer that voters were 'not prepared to be bribed' by excessive borrowing. Mr Parkinson's remarks came as clear evidence of behind-the-scenes divisions among Tory backbenchers about the best shape of a Budget, now thought certain to be the starting-gun for the general election campaign. The claims were brushed aside by Mr John Major. Interrupting a tour of the East Midlands, the prime minister told reporters it was time Labour clarified its tax and spending plans which remained 'a mystery piled on an enigma'. For Tory campaign managers, there was considerable relief in a new Gallup/Daily Telegraph opinion poll showing the party's lead had dropped just half a percentage point on last week in spite of relentless opposition attacks on the continuing recession. The figures gave the Conservatives 39 (-1 point), Labour 37 (- 1/2 ) and the Liberal Democrats 19 (+1 1/2 ) - a stark contrast with yesterday's NOP poll that put Labour four points ahead. Both parties disputed the accuracy of the findings, with Labour arguing that Gallup exaggerated the Tories' strength and the Conservatives claiming that the reverse was true of NOP. Earlier, Mr Kinnock had expressed regret that Labour was not more than four points ahead. But he added in a BBC interview that fear of the recession did not 'naturally make people lunge for change.' Labour's recovery to neck-and-neck from just 28 per cent support in 1983 left him certain of an election victory, he said. In London, senior Tory ministers shifted their target to Labour's nationalisation plans, claiming their opponents supported 'massive state intervention and interference'. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, cited as evidence comments by Mr Frank Dobson on Wednesday that a Labour government could use its 40 per cent shareholding to impose directors on the boards of the electricity utilities. However, the Labour energy spokesman was unrepentant yesterday, adding that a government would also be within its powers to halt the building of new port facilities planned to handle coal imports. Today, Mr Major will take the pre-electoral battle to Glasgow where he will spearhead a new Tory drive to discredit the arguments for a devolved parliament or full independence. Yesterday, Mr Tom King, defence secretary, used a visit to Aberdeen to warn that 'the catastrophic effect' of independence would mean the loss of 45,000 jobs in the armed services and the defence industries.</p>

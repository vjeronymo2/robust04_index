			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH TRIAL SECRETS CURBS TWICE REJECTED;  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT. TO SEEK SUPREME COURT ORDER AFTER BEING REBUFFED  </P> <P> For the second time in two days, a panel of appellate court judges on Friday  rebuffed efforts by the Justice Department to delay the trial of former White  House aide Oliver L. North.  </P> <P> Government lawyers, however, will try to get an unusual weekend order from  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to postpone the trial.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that Justice Department attorneys will file  legal papers today asking Rehnquist to grant a stay in North's trial, which is  scheduled to resume Monday, until the Supreme Court can review the department's  arguments that tighter restrictions need to be imposed to prevent state secrets  from being revealed in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Thornburgh complained in a statement that U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell  "unfortunately . . . has chosen not to follow the provisions" of the 1980  Classified Information Procedures Act governing the handling of sensitive  evidence at a trial.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Procedures of His Own'  </P> <P> "Instead," said Thornburgh, "he has adopted procedures of his own which do not  provide the needed assurances of protection to sensitive matters."  </P> <P> Gesell has established broad categories for what may and may not be revealed in  court but, out of concern for North's right to a fair trial, has shied away  from allowing government security experts to screen every piece of evidence  North wants to introduce.  </P> <P> Thornburgh issued his statement after Justice Department officials had renewed  their efforts in the U.S. Court of Appeals to stop resumption of the trial,  contending in new papers that North's attorneys may reveal national security  secrets in their opening statements to the jury Monday.  </P> <P> Justice Department officials have not suggested what items they are referring  to, but North has indicated he wants to apprise jurors of other foreign covert  operations besides the Iran-Contra events in which he participated and which  had presidential authorization.  </P> <P> Gesell completed selecting a jury of nine women and three men Thursday but  postponed swearing them in until all legal problems could be resolved. He told  them to return Monday.  </P> <P> Justice Department attorneys have argued in their two days of filings that  Gesell must be ordered to screen in advance the disclosures of defense  attorneys based on advice from government security analysts.  </P> <P> The appellate judges reiterated Friday that Thornburgh has no standing to try  to alter Gesell's guidelines for use of the documents, but they noted that the  attorney general has authority to withhold specific top-secret documents or  other sensitive evidence if he deems that its disclosure would harm national  security.  </P> <P> Such an extreme action could abort North's trial altogether.  </P> <P> The judges agreed with contentions by Gesell and by independent counsel  Lawrence E. Walsh that Thornburgh could not intervene in trial procedures  because Walsh, and not the Justice Department, is in charge of prosecuting  North under provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. That act sets up a  court-appointed special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute present or  former high government officials.  </P> <P> In its latest filing, the Justice Department was critical of Walsh, who has  publicly split with the department by endorsing guidelines established by  Gesell. Walsh has declared that political appointees in the department have no  right to intervene in his prosecution.  </P> <P> The department charged in its brief that part of the current problem results  from Walsh's "reluctance to insist that statutory requirements (of the 1980  Classified Information Procedures Act) are followed and his apparent  indifference to the national security consequences of the course now being  pursued."  </P> <P> Last month Thornburgh, who heads an inter-agency committee of security  analysts, determined that sensitive government documents needed for North's  trial on conspiracy and theft charges in the Iran-Contra scandal could not be  provided without compromising U.S. secrets. As a result, Walsh and Gesell  decided that those principal charges must be dismissed from the case, leaving  North to stand trial on 12 lesser counts, including alleged destruction of  documents and alleged false statements to Congress and a presidential board of  inquiry.  </P> <P> The latest government brief, signed by Assistant Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis  Jr., who heads the department's criminal division, said it is urgent that  North's trial be prevented from resuming until a higher court can weigh the  department's arguments.  </P> <P> "Unless this court grants the government's motion for a stay, it is likely that  on that date (Monday) highly sensitive items of classified information will be  revealed by the defense in its opening statement, causing irreparable damage to  both the national security and foreign affairs interests of the United States."  </P></p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Long-dated Treasuries advance after testimony Longer-dated US Treasury bonds advanced yesterday after congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman produced no unpleasant surprises. The price of short-dated paper was down slightly. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 higher at 95 15/32 ,with the yield slipping to 6.596 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note eased  1/32 to 99, to yield 4.527 per cent. The market's reaction to remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was restrained, in sharp contrast to the volatility of recent sessions. In his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy, he told lawmakers that real short-term interest rates were likely to increase, but he gave no indication of the timing of the central bank's next move to lift its target for the Fed Funds rate, now at 3.25 per cent. Mr Greenspan stressed, however, that a failure to tighten 'in a timely manner' would lead to an unnecessary rise in long-term rates on the financial markets. Despite his vigilant tone on inflation, long-term bond prices fell during the first hour of testimony. When a significant sell-off failed to materialise, however, the market quickly reversed course. After several false starts, the long bond pushed well into positive territory during the afternoon. The short end, however, remained weak. Amid the attention focused on the Fed chairman's comments, a bigger-than-expected decline in consumer confidence this month went largely unnoticed. The Conference Board, an industry association, said its index fell to 80.8 for February, from a revised 82.6 in January, and compared with a consensus forecast of 83. In Europe, bond markets stabilised after their recent sharp falls, but trading conditions remained volatile. While some traders reported cautious buying by professional investors, most said activity remained thin. According to Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International, the European bond markets are beginning to build a base from which they can rally. 'Now that Treasuries have begun to stabilise, the European markets can focus again on their own fundamentals, allowing them to push ahead,' he said. Most observers expect a sustainable European bond market recovery to be triggered by the next cut in the Bundesbank's rate for securities repurchase agreements. The rate has again been fixed at 6 per cent for today's repo allocation, but is expected to fall once the wage talks in the German engineering sector have been resolved. Like most European markets, UK gilts had a rollercoaster session. The short end came under pressure following a report from the UK Treasury panel of advisers, known as the six wise men, which showed divisions over the need for further cuts in interest rates. The long end of the yield curve strengthened slightly, supported by continental European markets. Nevertheless, gilts underperformed bunds, with the 10-year spread over Germany widening to 90 basis points from 85 basis points on Monday. The market's firmer tone boosted hopes that today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 7 per cent gilts due 2001 would go smoothly. German government bonds ended a volatile session slightly higher. In after-hours trading the bund future rose further to close near the day's high of 97.95, up from 97.36 on Monday. Traders now are awaiting January M3 money supply numbers, expected this week. Although most traders expect them to lie above the Bundesbank's target range, 'a bad number could cause a kneejerk sell-off,' said one dealer. French bonds ended little changed, in line with most other markets. The notional long bond futures contract on Matif closed at 127.54, up 0.02 point. Japanese government bonds firmed in Tokyo and continued to strengthen in London as speculation of a cut in the 1.75 per cent official discount rate intensified. Easing talk was fuelled by the release of a worse-than-expected diffusion index and the announcement that the Bank of Japan will publish its quarterly Tankan economic report on March 1, earlier than expected. The June JGB futures contract rose 0.14 point to 112.39 in Tokyo but rose further to 112.80 in late London trading.</p>

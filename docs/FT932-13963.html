			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Personal View: Clinton joins the interventionists American reactions to the industrial challenge from Japan in the 1990s resemble those of Europeans to the challenge from the US in the 1960s - as Robert Reich, President Bill Clinton's US secretary for labour, has stated. It is not surprising therefore that the US administration should emulate Europe in its industrial policies. Mr Clinton is proposing that more federal funds should be available to finance the development of industrial technology, with the emphasis on areas where industry is supposed to be threatened by foreign competition - such as aircraft motors and supercomputers - or where developments are expected to generate wider benefits, such as a national high-speed computer network and technologies to reduce environmental damage. These policies are not entirely novel for the US; both Republican and Democratic administrations have financed large and expensive development projects - such as satellites, rockets, supersonic airliners and synthetic fuel plants - nearly all of which have been failures, as a recent study by the Brookings Institution emphasised*. The tax credit for industrial research and development expenditure, the most expensive part of President Clinton's new package, dates back to 1981. But the scope of the 'technology support programme' is greater than anything seen previously and, although it is relatively modest at some Dollars 3.4bn a year, the presidential rhetoric that has accompanied it suggests that there may be more to come. The policies therefore seem to represent a break with those of Republican presidents, and to augur competition with Europe and Japan on subsidies. In all three regions there are now governments which believe they ought to do something to improve industrial performance. Experience in the US as well as Europe suggests that the effects of the new programme are likely to be trivial; and the most beneficial are likely to be the cheapest, such as improving advice on technology available to small companies. The expensive tax credit for industrial research and development is unlikely to have much effect on industrial performance, although it will have an effect on the amount of expenditure described as R&amp;D in companies' tax returns. In any case, increasing industrial expenditure on R&amp;D does not in itself improve performance; R&amp;D is an input, not an output. This programme is backed by many academic studies, some of whose authors, such as Robert Reich, Laura Tyson, and Lawrence Summers, are now members of the administration. But the arguments they use to justify subsides are not convincing. Summers, under-secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury, has argued that the high wages in capital - and R&amp;D - intensive industries represent 'excess rents', because these earnings cannot be explained by the available information. Foreign subsidies, such as those to Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, are then said to transfer rents, and so economic welfare, from the US to the subsidising countries. But unexplained differences in pay may reflect unobserved differences in quality, so the rents could be imaginary. Summers' arguments do not show that subsidies would improve economic welfare; but they would transfer money from taxpayers to employees of subsidised companies. This group of academics also alternates between confidence that its results are relevant to policy, and recognition of the difficulties of implementing an industrial policy successfully. The recognition by Tyson, the chief White House economist, of these difficulties led her to recommend that support should be limited to generic research. Governments cannot easily intervene to improve industrial performance. It may seem that some wonderful new technology is failing to be exploited; but there is usually a good reason for this. And if a government offers grants to industry, it will soon learn that the cheapest finance is the preferred source. The government will then find that its funds are often replacing private funds, and the true effect of its largesse is difficult to establish. To a European observer, it is strange that the US government should think industrial innovation needs more government help. American industrial weaknesses seem more related to the number of large and arthritic companies than to lack of innovation; and increased government intervention could weaken the entrepreneurial spirit that has made the US the world leader in new industries such as microprocessors, personal computers and biotechnology. Mr Clinton may be tackling the wrong problem. The author is an economic consultant *D R Cohen and R G Noll. The Technology Pork Barrel, Brookings, 1991.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SKINHEADS, PUNKS PUSH ANTI-RACISM MESSAGE TO PEERS  </P> <P> Jason has been a skinhead since he was a teen-ager, dressing the part and  advocating the strong working-class ethic that has been at the heart of the  movement since it began in England back in the late 1960s.  </P> <P> Jason, 22, grew up in Ocean Beach and works as a tool grinder for the company  where his father works and where his uncle worked before him.  </P> <P> Although he has stopped shaving his head, the tattoos etched on Jason's arms --  one reads "skin," the other "head" -- make his allegiance clear, if often  misunderstood.  </P> <P> "I've got people at work who won't talk to me because they classify me as a  skin and that I'm racist," said Jason, who asked that his last name not be  used. "I'm a skinhead, but I'm not racist."  </P> <P> Jason and his 22-year-old wife, Dawn, a self-proclaimed skinhead since the 10th  grade, are members of the new San Diego chapter of Anti-Racist Action, a  national anti-racist organization of skinheads and punks.  </P> <P> Although the group has been here only for the past six months, members are  plastering pockets of San Diego with "Smash Racism" posters and scattering  flyers at music shops to explain what they're all about, give directions to  their twice-monthly Sunday meetings and invite people to attend.  </P> <P> About 40 people -- including blacks, whites, Latinos, Cubans and Jews -- have  been attending the meetings, held wherever room can be found, members said.  </P> <P> Organizers hope a Nov. 10 self-promotion concert to be held near the San Diego  State University campus will also attract people.  </P> <P> Although Anti-Racist Action is new to San Diego, the group has chapters  scattered all over the country, including New York, Chicago and other cities on  the West Coast, said Leonard Zeskind, research director for the Center for  Democratic Renewal in Kansas City, which monitors extremist groups that espouse  racial hatred.  </P> <P> "The ARA is a legitimate anti-racist youth group," Zeskind said. "Any  anti-racist strategy that is serious has to talk to them (skinheads) in terms  that are their own language and by their own peers."  </P> <P> In addition to spreading the word that punk and skinhead groups were  anti-racist from their beginnings, this loosely knit core of people wants to  clean up the local punk music scene, where concerts and shows have been  littered by racial incidents.  </P> <P> "When I go to a show and the dance floor -- as it is lightly called -- is  dominated by two or three people who like to wear swastika T-shirts and are  built like football halfbacks, and they decide to dominate a show, it affects  me and other people," said ARA's San Diego founder, 38-year-old George Matiasz,  who is not a skinhead but has been part of the punk scene since 1979. The  group's aim is "to educate people that racism isn't cool and to take control of  your own scene."  </P> <P> What the group hopes to eventually accomplish doesn't stop there, however. Once  it has more members and is more organized, Matiasz said, it plans to hold shows  with music, poetry readings and other entertainment to raise money for  community groups or political causes that are anti-racist in nature.  </P> <P> Matiasz, a longtime activist in political movements and what he calls  anti-authoritarian issues, said he felt it was time somebody tackled the racism  problem.  </P> <P> "I wanted to deal with the issue," he said.  </P> <P> "It's the basic thing of doing by example. It's not good enough to have the  truth but to make an example of your life and your scene."  </P> <P> The skinhead movement began in the late '60s as a clique of working-class kids,  both white and black, who, through their dress code of work boots, shaved heads  and jeans, promoted the tough working-class image they wanted to be affiliated  with, said Eric Anderson, a professor at Yakima Valley Community College in  Washington state, who wrote his master's thesis on skinheads in 1987.  </P> <P> The skinheads were also a reaction to the hippies who came out of the middle  class about the same time.  </P> <P> The racist stigma traditionally attached to skinheads came about during the  1970s, when the economic situation in England worsened and the working class  with which the skinheads had always identified became a class without work,  Anderson said.  </P> <P> Some skinheads turned their resentment toward black and immigrant workers  because they believed they were taking jobs away from them, he said.  </P> <P> People familiar with Anti-Racist Action say it can work to keep young people  from joining racist skinhead groups.  </P> <P> "There are lots of people in the scene who aren't full-blown racists but throw  around racist slurs," said another group member, a 24-year-old who calls  himself Stinky Panch. "It would help to tell people not everybody likes to hear  those words and maybe keep people from becoming Nazis."  </P> <P> Racist skinheads are often neo-Nazis who condemn homosexuals, communists,  minorities and others they fear are contaminating America and threatening the  American way of life, Anderson said.  </P> <P> Although they haven't had any problems yet, Matiasz and others in the San Diego  ARA said they fear they might one day have a run-in with some of the white  supremacists who follow men such as Fallbrook's Tom Metzger, national leader of  the White Aryan Resistance.  </P> <P> "Whenever you do good work, you hurt someone, and we're going to try to hurt  racists," Matiasz said. "And these people are not known for their genteel  attitude."  </P> <P> Metzger said he has merely befriended racist skinheads and is not their leader.  </P> <P> "Tom Metzger is not the guru of the skins, never was and never claimed to be,"  he said.  </P> <P> For now, group members say, they want to start doing more than just talking  about fighting racism.  </P> <P> "We just hope to grow and get anything done possible," said Stinky Panch.  "Anything is progress."  </P></p>

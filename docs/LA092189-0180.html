			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Neiman Marcus Group Inc.: The Chestnut Hill, Mass., retailing concern reported  fiscal 1989 profit of $25.3 million. In 1988, the company posted a profit of  $4.8 million using a now-discontinued accounting method; its 1988 profit would  have been $15.5 million using its new method. Revenue increased 20% in 1989 to  $1.5 billion. The firm said earnings for the year were reduced by the inclusion  of results from Horchow Mail Order Inc., which had a "disappointing"  performance following its acquisition. Each of the company's other divisions,  including Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, had "significantly improved  results."  </P></p>

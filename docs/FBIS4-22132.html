			<p>BFN     [Text] Diyarbakir/Ankara -- Turkish commandos, supported by  warplanes and military helicopters, have expanded their  operation in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq and will remain in  the region for a major part of the summer, official sources said  on Monday. They said approximately 5,000 troops had already  entered Iraq where at least 60 Kurdish separatists have been  killed over the past six days. Witnesses in Sirnak said  hundreds of paramilitary village guards were aiding the troops  amid an intense buildup of soldiers and land vehicles on the  Turkish side of the border. Military officials said the  cross-border operation targeted camps of the outlawed Kurdistan  Workers' Party (PKK) and concentrated on the Sivi and Haftanin  regions in northern Iraq, immediately opposite the Turkish towns  of Cukurca and Uludere respectively.    The crackdown started last week with a massive land and air  operation launched on the Gabar mountains and the Mezi border  region which the PKK has been using as a main base. Officials  said on Sunday that an important rebel depot was discovered on  the Gabar mountains and troops had seized nine mortars, seven  antiaircraft guns, three rocket launchers, 61 assault rifles, 70  antipersonnel mines, 98 grenades and approximately 170,000  rounds of ammunition. Over the past weeks, Turkey seized some  400 tons of foodstuff also stockpiled by the PKK.    Sources in Diyarbakir said, meanwhile, that a majority of  Kurdish civilians in the Gabar region had evacuated their homes  and crossed the border into northern Iraq. There were  unconfirmed claims on Monday that prior to the Turkish  crackdown, PKK forces in Gabar had also moved out.    Reports coming from the clash zone on Monday said that while  land and air operations continued in Shive and Haftanin, air  force jets and helicopter gunships had attacked PKK hideouts in  the mountainous region of Derkar and in Kanimasi.    Officials said the operation within Iraq would continue  until  operations in southeastern Turkey came to an end. One source,  who asked not to be identified, pointed out that the logistic  support lines of the PKK were being cut and the presence of  Turkish forces in the border area, some five kilometers into  Iraq, prevented militants from entering Turkey or escaping to  the Kurdish-controlled area.    Turkey recently deployed around 100,000 fresh troops to the  Southeast and has a total of approximately 400,000 security  personnel including soldiers, policemen, intelligence officers  and village guards to fight the separatists there.    Sources in Diyarbakir said on Monday that new military  trucks  were arriving in the region every day with weaponry being  deployed to the flat areas around the Iraqi border, close to the  southeastern province of Sirnak.    Meanwhile, a newspaper has said that all military forces in  Sirnak were attached to a division under the command of Gen.  Orhan Gencler. Sabah newspaper said on Monday that the number  of brigades in the region had been increased to four, including  one armored brigade.    Terrorism experts in the capital, Ankara, believe Turkey's  armed campaign in the Southeast will gain momentum until August  in the form of a pre-emptive strike against the rebels before  they launch their own "summer offensive."    Turkish Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures promised earlier  that  the PKK would be crushed by this summer at the latest and Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller has said that Turkey has no alternative  but to break the backbone of terrorism.    At least 11,000 people, including hundreds of Kurdish  civilians, have died in the 10-year-old conflict during which  human rights violations have escalated on both sides.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] China's top dissident Wang Juntao yesterday vowed  that he would not be silenced by Beijing and would fight for the  freedom of his "comrades-in-arms" who were still in jail. In an  interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr Wang made it  clear that he would continue to speak his mind although he had  been warned by Beijing not to engage in "activities against the  interest of the motherland" before he left Beijing.    Mr Wang was freed and arrived in New York on Saturday for  treatment for hepatitis after serving five years of a 13-year  jail term for organising the 1989 pro-democracy movement -- an  accusation denied by Mr Wang.    According to Mr Wang, labour reform officials warned him  that  they would be watching his activities abroad. "But I asked them  what is the interest of the motherland? The interest of a few  individuals doesn't equal to the interest of the motherland...  The interest of the motherland is the interest of the majority  of Chinese people," he said. "They said I have not been  reformed well. But I told them it was not I who needed to be  reformed, it was they who should be," the defiant activist said.    Mr Wang declined to give a direct answer on the  controversial  debate over China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status.  But he stressed he would make public his position when he was  ready. "It is their (the U.S. Government) business to deal with  MFN. But I can't make up my mind before I find out what is the  wish of the majority of Chinese people on this issue," he said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide before June 3  whether  to extend China's MFN status this year although it is widely  believed that the President will do so after Mr Wang's release.    Mr Wang said he agreed to leave China because he feared that  if he turned down the offer, it would jeopardise the chance of  other dissidents who might want to leave.    Having served less than half of his 13-year sentence, Mr  Wang  is one of three dissidents allowed to leave for medical  treatment in the US. The other two are physicist Fang Lizhi and  labour activist Han Dongfang. Before his release on Saturday,  Mr Wang was told by his captors that he was being freed because  "the U.S. Government has requested it and it was agreed by the  Chinese Government." It was understood that the U.S. Government  had also put forward the names of at least four other jailed  dissidents: Chen Ziming, Ren Wanding, Liu Gang, and Bao Tong --  generally believed to be in poor health and either in prison  clinics or hospitals.    Mr Wang also expressed concern about dissident journalist  Gao  Yu who was arrested in October for allegedly leaking state  secrets to foreign publications. A verdict on her was expected  this week.    Although Mr Wang said he was aware that China had banned Mr  Han from returning to the country, he believed there was no  reason for Beijing to refuse him. "I have done nothing against  the law in China. And I will not do so even now I am out of the  country. There is no reason why they should not allow me to  return to my country," he said. "To do so would be a violation  of international convention," he added.    On his time in jail, the 35-year-old activist said  conditions  were so poor that he had to initiate 21 hunger strikes in five  years to protest against his ill treatment.</p>

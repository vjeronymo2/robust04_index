			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 TELEDYNE EXECUTIVES CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY, BRIBERY;  </P> <P> FIRST DEFENSE FRAUD PROBE TRIAL OPENS  </P> <P> The first trial in the federal government's massive Ill Wind defense fraud  inquiry opened Monday with prosecutors alleging that the case against three  Teledyne Industries Inc. executives is "about bribery, about cheating, about  lying."  </P> <P> The executives went on trial in U.S. District Court here, 2 1/2 years after  federal agents began gathering evidence that defense consultants were bribing  Pentagon officials for inside information on military contracts.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the defendants told the jury that their clients were unaware of any  illegal activities by consultants hired to help Teledyne obtain a $24-million  Pentagon electronics contract.  </P> <P> On trial are George H. Kaub, a vice president in charge of contracts at  Teledyne Electronics, a unit of Teledyne Industries based in Newbury Park,  Calif.; Eugene R. Sullivan, Teledyne Electronics' former vice president for  finance; and Dale Schnittjer, the current Teledyne Electronics vice president  for finance.  </P> <P> They were indicted on Jan. 6 on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery  of a public official. Each faces at least 50 years in prison and fines of $1.5  million. All three have been suspended with pay, a Teledyne spokesman said.  </P> <P> In his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert J. Dehenzel Jr. said the  government would prove that the three Teledyne executives participated in an  elaborate scheme to bribe a Navy official to obtain confidential data on Navy  plans to buy the electronics gear, which is used to test radar sets on  aircraft.  </P> <P> Dehenzel cited extensive wiretapped conversations between the Teledyne  executives and the consultants as proof that the Teledyne officers were aware  that the consulting fees they authorized were used to corrupt the Pentagon  procurement process.  </P> <P> At one point, the prosecutor said, consultant William L. Parkin of Alexandria  pressed Schnittjer for payments for his confederates in the scheme.  </P> <P> "Nobody works for nothing anymore," Parkin allegedly told the Teledyne  executive in one wiretapped telephone conversation. "It takes a lot of  spaghetti and meatballs to grease the skids on some of these things."  </P> <P> Four individuals and two companies -- including Teledyne -- already have  pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy, fraud, bribery and filing false  statements in the case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $8.4 Million in Penalties  </P> <P> Teledyne admitted its role in the conspiracy last month and agreed to pay fines  and reimbursements of as much as $8.4 million.  </P> <P> The company blamed its involvement on its former Washington marketing manager,  Michael Savaides, who also has pleaded guilty to charges in the case. Woodland  Hills, Calif., defense consultant Fred H. Lackner and Navy Deparment  electronics procurement supervisor Stuart E. Berlin also have admitted to the  federal charges.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the three Teledyne executives acknowledged that the procurement  system had been corrupted but said that their clients were unaware of the  conspiracy and had in fact been its victims.  </P> <P> "This conspiracy was directed at Teledyne as much as at the government," said  George O'Connell, representing Sullivan. "This was a conspiracy not only to  defraud the United States but to conceal, to actively hide from Mr. Sullivan  what they were doing."  </P> <P> Prosecutors alleged that Sullivan, Kaub and Schnittjer agreed to pay Parkin  $160,000 for his role in helping Teledyne obtain the Navy contract.  </P> <P> Although Parkin has admitted using the money to pay Lackner and Berlin for  inside information on the contract, the Teledyne executives contended Monday  that they had no idea what he was doing.  </P></p>

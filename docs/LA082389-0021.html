			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L. A. BACKS EXTENSION OF HILLSIDE HOUSE LIMITS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council unanimously endorsed a proposal by Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky on Tuesday to extend existing limits on house sizes into more  hillside areas of Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> The council directed the city Planning Department to draft an ordinance calling  for a yearlong ban on houses that cover more than half of their lots or exceed  30 feet in height. During that ban, the Planning Department would study the  problem of large houses and propose a permanent solution.  </P> <P> Once drafted, the ordinance must be approved by the council.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said his action was prompted by the parking and traffic problems  that occur when houses fill their lots on narrow hillside streets. He and  community activists have also expressed concerns about a developer's plans to  build up to 20 houses along Hopevale Drive.  </P> <P> In his motion, Yaroslavsky said he wanted to "avoid the irreparable damage that  may occur in this area without some restrictions."  </P> <P> A spokesman for developer CTC Management said the firm has not finished its  plans for the land but does not intend to build houses that are  disproportionate with lot sizes.  </P> <P> The ordinance is to include properties bordered by Mulholland Drive, the San  Diego Freeway, Valley Vista Boulevard and Dixie Canyon Avenue. The council had  approved the same limits in May for a strip of land in the middle of that area.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Pat Robertson vs. Puppeteer: Evangelist Pat Robertson charged Thursday that a  children's puppet show featuring simulated oral sex was performed last week at  an Atlanta arts festival allegedly subsidized by the National Endowment for the  Arts.  </P> <P> Robertson said the puppet show, performed at the Atlanta Arts Festival last  Friday before 800 people, including children, featured "approximately five  minutes of simulated foreplay between two puppets followed by an exhibit of  oral sex acts." His Christian Coalition in Chesapeake, Va., responded by  generating 27,000 petitions demanding that the NEA be abolished and sending  them Tuesday to every member of Congress. Robertson's claims were vigorously  denied by the NEA, the Georgia state arts council and puppeteer Jon Ludwig of  Atlanta. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

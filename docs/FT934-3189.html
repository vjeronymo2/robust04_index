			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Civil service opened to bidding: Government gives go-ahead to privatisation of 140 Whitehall agencies The government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the privatisation of large parts of the Whitehall machine by inviting bids for more than 140 executive agencies. The agencies currently employ 430,000 civil servants, almost 80 per cent of the civil service, on activities ranging from the payment of benefits to the servicing of the armed forces' equipment. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, said the civil service could be reduced within a few years to a core of 50,000 policymakers buying in public services from both the public and private sectors. The move represents a victory for cabinet ministers favouring radical reforms of the civil service. Numbers of white-collar civil servants rose last year, while the market-testing programme has produced much smaller savings than expected. After pressure from the Treasury and Downing Street, much greater emphasis is now to be put on privatising public services instead of creating new agencies. Each existing agency will also be considered for privatisation when it comes up for the three-yearly review of its progress. Outsiders will be invited to participate in these reviews, in effect inviting them to come forward with bids. To increase private-sector interest, the reviews will be announced so that bids can be made. A white paper published yesterday on the agencies lists 92 *something in here (HP) * already in operation, 36 of which are currently under review. A further 24 will be reviewed next year. The names of 36 new agencies are also listed - mainly in defence - where outside interest would be welcomed. Ms Elizabeth Symons of the First Division Association, the top civil servants' union, described the proposals as a clear departure from government policy so far. 'They are dressed up to look innocuous but herald a full-scale privatisation of everything from defence communications to core activities like the Crown Prosecution Service,' she said. 'This is a time-bomb ticking away under the responsible provision of public services controlled by ministers accountable to parliament.' However, there was a welcome for the new approach from contractors. Mr Charles Cox of Hoskyns, the information technology company, last month criticised the tendering process for being too prescriptive and discouraging innovative bids. Last night he said he was very pleased to see that the government had taken contractors' criticisms to heart. Mr John Staples of EDS-Scicon, part of the world's largest contracted services provider, said that he would review the list with great interest. 'This offers a new way of getting value and quality into the public services, by focusing more on the services to be delivered than on how they are currently done,' he said. Mr Rod Aldridge of Capita said that it was a natural development in extending the scope for competition in providing public services. Private future, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

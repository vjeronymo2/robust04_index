			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma </F> Committee for Economic Policy, by Yelena Tokareva; place, date  not given: "I Am for Order in the Economy and Finance"]    [Text] Sergey Yuryevich Glazyev, age 33, chairman of the  State Duma Committee for Economic Policy. Doctor of economic  sciences. Author of 100 works on questions of the economic  development of Russia and the USSR. Since the early nineties he  has been working on problems of the structural crisis in the  country's economy. Author of the monograph "Theory of the  Long-Term Technical and Economic Development of Russia and the  USSR." Less than a month ago, S. Glazyev organized  parliamentary hearings in the State Duma on questions of the  crisis in our economy and programs for emerging from it. These  hearings were attended by virtually all the authors of programs  for emerging from the crisis: from Academicians Shatalin and  Petrakov to Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, and  Saburov, now premier of the Republic of the Crimea.    [Tokareva] Sergey Yuryevich, you act like a man who knows  his way in a fog. Could you formulate briefly and comprehensibly  your amendments to the recent economic course which we know by  the name of "shock therapy"?    [Glazyev] The amendments have been generally recognized.  They were in evidence at the parliamentary hearings. And in the  president's message. First -- the need to pursue an active  structural policy. In our conditions, where there is a  technological, mixed economy in which hopelessly outdated  production facilities exist alongside new ones, while the latter  are oriented toward state demand, it is impossible to achieve  market equilibrium quickly. Without an active state policy of  conversion to a modern, high-tech industry, the modernization of  obsolete production facilities, and incentives for the growth of  new facilities, it will be impossible to clamber out of the  spiral of recession. Market equilibrium will be achieved at the  cost of the destruction of the scientific and technical complex  and the loss of potential for future economic growth.    Second. The imposition of order in the state sector of the  economy. Today, with a view to reducing the budget deficit,  items of expenditure on science, education, and health care, on  which our society's future is directly dependent, are being  axed. Yet nobody is worried about efficiency in the utilization  of state property or the income from its privatization.    Third. The imposition of order in state finances. I do not  believe a single country with a market economy has experienced  such a voluntarist approach to regulating the money supply.  This also applies to the cavalier treatment of the state  budget, where mistakes in the correlation between income and  expenditure amount to several orders of magnitude, and a balance  is achieved through self-interested manipulations involving the  arbitrary sequestration of expenditure and the control of credit  emissions for the refinancing of commercial banks.    Unless these obvious gaps and shortcomings in the  government's economic policy are eliminated, it will be  impossible either to halt the decline in production or to get  inflation down. Whether by orthodox methods of macroeconomic  regulation, or by heterodox methods involving price regulation.  Although either of these could prove productive in combination  with an active policy in the three above-mentioned areas.    Let me explain. An active economic policy is called active  precisely because it makes provision for purposeful actions. In  particular, it may use such instruments as the state order,  targeted federal programs, and, where necessary and possible,  price regulation. If such a policy is not pursued, we must  reconcile ourselves to living with galloping inflation, rapidly  destroying production, which cannot develop in conditions where  price correlations are constantly changing. It should, however,  be borne in mind that price regulation may be successfully  applied by the state only when the purpose of the regulation is  clear. When the period for which it applies is clearly defined.  And when the consequences are reliably predicted. A temporary  price freeze may be used as one component in a wide package of  measures in the event that a policy of drastically reducing  inflation is chosen.    It is obvious today that the style of combating inflation  used over the past two years is not producing the desired  results. We can see that the task set at the beginning of the  year, of achieving a reduction in inflation to a level of 3-5  percent a month, cannot be achieved by using only the  instruments of limiting the state budget deficit and regulating  credit emissions, and the inflation rate is hovering around 20  percent a month, a level we are now accustomed to. The reasons  for this are also clear. The toughening of monetary and credit  policy in the aforesaid two parameters provokes stubborn  resistance at microeconomic level, as manifested in the  nonpayments crisis and pressure from the regions and commercial  banks with a view to obtaining ever more credits. A periodical  and tough monetary policy is supplanted by a constant stream of  credits and state expenditure.    As a result, instead of the desired 3-5 percent inflation a  month, we are seeing inflation hovering between 10 and 25  percent a month. There is no sign of a clear dependence between  credit and monetary policy and the inflation rate. For more  than two years now we have been in a rut, pursuing one and the  same goal, which appears unattainable. It is time to wise up.    [Tokareva] What is the alternative?    [Glazyev] There are several tried and tested means of  combating inflation. For instance, an agreement on rigorous  discipline and self-restraint on income by the economic agents.  It is necessary to seek a rationalization and clarification of  the Central Bank's credit policy and to have a budget based on  reliable forecasts and a properly functioning state sector, both  of which should play an important stabilizing role in the  economy. If, of course, we really want to suppress inflation  quickly.    [Tokareva] And after that? Although, to be honest, I do not  believe in quick methods. Inflation has been building up for  five years. It will take five years to cure it, too.    [Glazyev] After that, if we succeed in reducing inflationary  expectations, we can reduce the interest rate on credits from  200 percent to 15-20 percent, carry out a de-indexation of  incomes, ensure compliance with contract discipline, and  stabilize the macroeconomic situation.    [Tokareva] Why has this path not been taken?    [Glazyev] Because it requires major efforts. An enormous  effort by the entire state apparatus. The policy that has been  pursued requires no effort at all. That is simpler and, strange  as it may seem, more profitable. Though not, of course, for the  state.    [Tokareva] During the discussion of the president's message  in the Duma, you said that the Cabinet is rejecting all  amendments to the current course.    [Glazyev] Not rejecting, but not accepting. The prime  minister has formally adopted the president's message for  execution. And the existing government program formally accords  with the president's message. The problem is that there is a  huge gulf between the government program of August, the recent  government statements which we have heard, and actual practice.  Programs exist, you can read them and rejoice in the authors'  good intentions, but reality goes on in its own sweet way.    [Tokareva] Maybe the executive hierarchy feels rather weak  and is therefore not embarking on great deeds?    [Glazyev] Of course, executive discipline is lacking, as are  qualifications and political will. Therefore we continue to  insist on a clear action plan. We are glad that the president's  message coincided with our recommendations on questions of  economic policy. But we need a plan consisting of measures for  implementation by specific persons. Accountability. A time  scale. Only thus will words become deeds.    [Tokareva] But nowadays we do not have a party that can use  fear to call its members to account.    [Glazyev] The president has sufficient levers to make the  government implement the domestic policy he has proclaimed.</p>

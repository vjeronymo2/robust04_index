			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Break-up of British Gas urged: Watchdog wants division into 12 regional companies to reduce domestic prices A CALL for the wholesale break-up of British Gas as a way of reducing prices for household customers came yesterday from the industry's regulator. The radical proposals to introduce more competition have plunged the relationship between the company and Sir James McKinnon, director-general of the industry watchdog Ofgas, to a new low. British Gas called his suggestions 'a smash and grab raid' on its business that would cost Pounds 3bn over 10 years. The proposals call for British Gas to be broken into 12 regional marketing companies with a separate gas purchasing arm. The regional companies would not have British Gas's current monopoly over domestic supply, opening up the market for rivals. The regulator, who has waged a battle of attrition against British Gas's market power, wants the break-up in addition to hiving off the company's pipelines and storage system. 'It's a logical development,' Sir James said. 'If there is any desire to give domestic customers some kind of choice, this is the route to go.' He believes that more choice will lead to lower prices. 'It must be for customers themselves to decide how much they want to pay for the kind of gas supply services they require,' he said. Sir James's proposals were made in a submission to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and released to the public yesterday. The commission is reviewing the structure of the gas industry after previous rows, and is due to make its report next month. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, who was yesterday giving evidence to the commission on why the company should not be broken up, predicted that Sir James's proposals could lead to price increases of up to 15 per cent. He called the proposals 'superficial and poorly argued', and questioned 'the irresponsibility of a body that is supposed to be responsible'. British Gas said that to dismember its business would cost Pounds 166 on average for each customer as well as Pounds 1,500 per shareholder, although it gave no indication as to how the costs would break down. The company also said the industry would face disruption for 18 months. Ofgas claims that the cost of the break-up would be closer to Pounds 250m than the Pounds 3bn cited by British Gas. Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council which represents domestic customers, said he was 'astonished' by Sir James's proposals. 'I wonder whether real competition can exist for the punter. Am I really going to have the same choice as I have between Sainsbury and Tesco? I suspect not.' British Gas has 30 rival companies already supplying industrial customers. Many of these, including the regional electricity companies, are keen to enter the domestic market. But British Gas says its competitors would not have the same safety standards or an obligation to maintain supplies. According to the company, its break-up could also mean that customers furthest from the east coast gas terminals would face higher prices.

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEW GUIDES OFFER FRESH GLIMPSES OF L.A. SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A RESULT OF PROPOSITION 98, THE 'REPORT CARDS' COVER 13 CATEGORIES,  INCLUDING ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND AVERAGE CLASS SIZE.  </P> <P> More than a quarter of the students at Taft High School, a school in the upper  middle-class community of Woodland Hills that has won national academic honors,  are Latino.  </P> <P> Nineteen percent of the students at North Hollywood High School earn A's in  their English classes, the same percentage as fail.  </P> <P> And San Fernando Junior High hands out 100 awards for student achievement each  month and 1,006 awards for citizenship during each grading period.  </P> <P> Parents and prospective home buyers interested in informational tidbits such as  those about San Fernando Valley schools could get them beginning Thursday by  asking for "report cards" that every school in the Los Angeles Unified School  District is supposed to have available. The detailed, six-page reports cover 13  categories that include academic performance, dropout rate and average class  size.  </P> <P> The student accountability reports, part of the Proposition 98 school funding  initiative approved by voters in November, 1988, are a consumers' guide to the  district, giving anyone interested in getting to know the district better a  complete picture of individual schools.  </P> <P> Much of the information in the reports has been available from different  sources, but this is the first time it has been compiled in one document, said  Lu Hishmeh, a district administrative consultant who helped schools put the  data together.  </P> <P> "The parents and the community should have those kind of facts and figures  about our schools," Taft Principal Ron Berz said.  </P> <P> The information in the reports is for the 1988-89 school year. The reports are  available at individual school offices, and some principals said they will send  the evaluations home with students.  </P> <P> But on the first day that the reports were to have been available, some school  office workers were reluctant to release them. Others seemed not to be aware of  the reports. District officials said they will tell regional superintendents at  a meeting today that the reports are to be given to anyone who asks for them.  </P> <P> A random cross-section of San Fernando Valley schools shows that:  </P> <P> * High school enrollments appear to be declining while junior highs and  elementary schools are growing. Enrollment at North Hollywood High School, for  instance, has dropped from 2,500 in 1985-86 to 2,218 in 1988-89. Enrollment at  Sylmar Elementary School has grown from 759 to 936 during the same period.  </P> <P> * Class sizes generally average between 26 and 32 students, at or below state  guidelines.  </P> <P> * Suspensions and expulsions at Taft High School in 1988-89 were among the  highest in the Valley. Suspensions numbered 533, and 23 students were expelled.  </P> <P> "We run a pretty tight ship here at Taft," Berz said. North Hollywood suspended  245 students and expelled one. Birmingham High School in Van Nuys suspended 539  students but expelled none.  </P> <P> * Latino enrollment at San Fernando Junior High, which is 92.7%, is among the  highest in the Valley.  </P> <P> Bob Plog, head counselor at Mulholland Junior High in Van Nuys, said he thought  that the evaluations were a good way to introduce parents to the nuts and bolts  of a school, but the best way to evaluate a school is to visit it.  </P> <P> "Casual observation is not shown on the report," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOSSETT'S GONE GONZO;  </P> <P> THE TOUGH GUY PLANS A FUNNY BAD GUY IN HBO'S WACKY WESTERN  </P> <P> Intimidating. No-nonsense. Dramatic.  </P> <P> These words best describe Oscar- and Emmy Award-winning Louis Gossett Jr.'s  screen personae. That is until "El Diablo," HBO's comedic Western adventure,  which premieres Sunday at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Gossett plays an aging gunslinger named Thomas Van Leek who helps a young  schoolteacher (Anthony Edwards) rescue a beautiful young pupil from the  clutches of the evil outlaw El Diablo. Van Leek chews tobacco and carries an  arsenal of guns.  </P> <P> Van Leek is a definite 360-degree turn from Gossett's Oscar-winning role as the  tough drill instructor in "An Officer and a Gentleman." He's not above shooting  his enemies in the back to save his own skin. He puts cotton in the sensitive  ears of his old horse every time he becomes embroiled in a gunfight.  </P> <P> "I had a ball doing stuff like that," Gossett said gleefully while relaxing on  the leather sofa in the living room of his Malibu home. "For me it's a chance  to be funny. It's not like 'Officer and a Gentleman' or 'Iron Eagle.' I got a  chance to put tobacco in my mouth and get cantankerous and have fun."  </P> <P> "Very, very good actors come out of the woodwork to do comedy," said Peter  Markle, who directed "El Diablo." "We always knew Tony (Edwards) was funny, but  not Lou. I think he aged himself about 15 years and adopted this gravely voice  as this gunslinger in his waning years. It's an excellent part and Lou is a  real pro. He reminded me of Gene Hackman (whom Markle directed in "Bat 21"). He  has a great sense of humor."  </P> <P> Before production began, Gossett created a history for Van Leek. "The history  came with putting the wardrobe together," he said, petting one of his two cats.  The actor opted for an old buffalo soldier cap, a makeshift military jacket and  worn boots. "He's upwards of 60 and he's a gunfighter that's still alive. How  do you do that? You don't give him a chance to face anybody. You shoot them in  the back. That's how you survive. I got a gun for every occasion and three on  my horse. You show your enemies that and most of the time they back off. He is  weather-beaten and cantankerous. All of a sudden, he becomes fleshed out."  </P> <P> Gossett has been searching for roles that will get him away from his stern  image. "I am going against 'Officer and a Gentleman,' " he said. "When I go  around the world, people want me to look and act like that all the time."  </P> <P> Though Gossett has agreed to star in a sequel to both "Officer and a Gentleman"  and "Iron Eagle," he turned down a series version of "Officer" and a commercial  featuring his character. "It was a lucrative commercial," he said, "but I would  have been stuck. The series would have been flat."  </P> <P> Actors, Gossett maintains, are divided into two groups. "There are people who  get discovered at 21 and they look young and wonderful," he said. "Then 20  years later they are still trying to play the same part. It's terrible for your  system. Then there are the Henry Fondas, the Jimmy Cagneys and Sean Connerys.  They are the ones that grow gracefully in front of the camera. That is much  healthier."  </P> <P> At 54, Gossett is happy and healthy and wants his roles to reflect that. "I  want to stay as versatile as possible," he said. "Versatility is synonymous  with longevity."  </P> <P> Gossett is not above taking smaller roles in low-budget features or cable  movies such as "El Diablo." "I did one movie for Lifetime, 'Sudie and Simpson,'  " he said. "It was a wonderful experience. ('Sudie and Simpson" is set to air  Sept. 11). It wasn't a high-budget thing, but the part was wonderful. I think  cable movies expand a career. You don't overload the budget of a movie and you  get a chance to do things that are really relevant. I think 'El Diablo' is a  major movie. It should be seen in the movie houses. It's a big budget looking  movie."  </P> <P> Gossett is eager to ride the range again. " 'El Diablo' was my first big  feature Western," he said. "There are some people in history I would like to  do-James Beckworth, a mountain man who founded the Northwest Passage and became  chief of the Crow nation, and there is Deadwood Dick and Railroad Bill. There  are a lot of wonderful stories."  </P> <P> More importantly, Gossett wants to make audiences laugh. "I would love to do  another comedy," he said. "It was wonderful to be funny. I have been serious  too long. It's time for me to lighten up."  </P></p>

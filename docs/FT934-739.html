			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Major sees economic hope and 20p tax Mr John Major talks up Britain's economic prospects in an interview published today and speaks of his ambition to reduce the basic rate of income tax to 20p. The prime minister said in a Daily Telegraph interview there was the 'overwhelming probability' of a long period ahead of stable growth and low inflation.

But the prime minister declined to set a deadline for achieving this. 'We will wait and see. We have to get the deficit down. It depends on what happens in terms of growth in the economy.' He foreshadowed a series of government initiatives next year to improve inner-city education. These would involve sending in special task forces, or education associations, to run schools identified by the inspectors as a cause for serious concern. Mr Major said that increasingly people would retire with an occupational as well as a state pension. He denied that the state pension would be a trifling amount. 'Our commitment is that the state pension continues and it will continue to maintain its real value,' he said. 'The welfare state is secure. I am not going to move away from the basic tenets of the welfare state or the social security system.'</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Mitsotakis steps down as leader of party GREECE'S outgoing prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, 75, is stepping down as leader of the conservative New Democracy party following its defeat by the Socialists in Sunday's election. The two strongest contenders to succeed him are Mr Miltiades Evert, a former mayor of Athens who launched the city's first private radio station, and Mr Ioannis Varvitsiotis, defence minister in the defeated government. Final election results, announced yesterday, gave Mr Andreas Papandreou's Socialists 46.9 per cent of the vote and 171 seats in the 300-member parliament. New Democracy won 39.3 per cent and 110 seats. Political Spring, a conservative splinter group headed by Mr Antonis Samaras, took third place with 4.9 per cent and 10 seats. The Greek Communist party, with 4.6 per cent of the vote and nine seats, will be the only other party in parliament. Mr Papandreou was expected to announce his cabinet late yesterday. Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, a former labour minister, was expected to take the economy portfolio. Mr Carolos Papoulias was tipped as foreign minister, a job he held during the Socialists' previous term in 1981-89.</p>

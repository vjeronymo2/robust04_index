In a statement to MENA's Damascus correspondent, Qaddumi  said  that it is necessary to expedite the withdrawal from the  Palestinian territories under the commitment made by Israel and  witnessed by the United States on 13 September 1993.    Qaddumi added that it is also necessary to disarm the  settlers and remove the political settlements that Rabin, when  he became prime minister, said were dispensable.    Qaddumi, who is visiting Syria, affirmed that recent events  have proven that the Zionist movement is a racist movement. He  announced that the PLO will ask the United Nations to revive its  resolution equating Zionism with racism, which the United States  has tried to delete from UN records.    Qaddumi emphasized the need to create secure areas at  friction points in the occupied Arab territories, notably in  Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem.    He urged the international community to make serious efforts  to encourage the peace process by adopting prompt decisions to  dispatch international forces to protect the Palestinians living  under occupation and to pressure Israel to make an immediate  withdrawal. He said Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem must be  placed under international protection until the final phase of  the political settlement arrives.    Qaddumi said this final phase must come soon and that there  is no need for a transitional period.    He pointed out that such prompt measures will encourage  Palestinian-Israeli coexistence and warned that delay might  inflame the region and pose a threat to security and peace.    Qaddumi urged the United States, in its capacity as peace  sponsor, to shoulder a great responsibility and take concrete  steps to give impetus to the peace operations, not merely issue  an invitation for negotiations and seek to defuse international  anger by such an invitation.    Qaddumi concluded his remarks by saying that the United  States must adopt concrete measures, via the United Nations, to  provide the necessary protection for the Palestinians and halt  the Israeli settlers' criminal actions. He called for pressure  on Israel to make it disarm the settlers and remove the  political settlements.</p>

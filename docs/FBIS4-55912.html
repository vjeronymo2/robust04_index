			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] On 22 January the Macedonian-language  Skopje daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA begins an 18-part survey of the  most important political parties in The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia (FYROM) called, ``Four Years Since the Formation of  Political Parties in Macedonia.''  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The series begins on page 3 with a 300-word unattributed  introduction.    ``Four years of a pluralistic political environment in  Macedonia has provided the opportunity for some 60 parties to  establish themselves. If such a number did not guarantee any  particular quality in carrying out a struggle for power, it did  testify unequivocably to the striving of the society for  democratic change. Nine months before the second scheduled  democratic elections are to be held, one can safely say that the  political realm reflects the great number of events which have  set the stage for these parties and account for their influence.  From the parliamentary elections in November 1990, when about 20  political entities appeared in an organized way to contest in  the first free democratic elections, through the establishing of  the first multiparty republic-level assembly (in January 1991)  and the formation of the new government of Nikola Kljusev (in  March 1991), through the erasing of the designation `socialist'  from the name of the state and the affirmation of the referendum  for a sovereign and independent state (September 1991), to the  confirmation of the Constitution (November 1991), the number of  parties has increased continually. Those already on the  political scene fought for greater scope and for more adherents.  The process continued after the adoption of the Declaration on  International Recognition (December 1991), after the departure  of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] from our country's territory  (March 1992), after the admission to the United Nations in April  1993, and it appears that they will not lose their intensity  from now until the November elections. However, the well-known  characteristics of our political scene leave five or six  parties in the forefront of the strivings of the citizens for  more rapid democratization and a more successful economic and  spiritual life in the Republic of Macedonia. In a few essays, we  will presentanalyses of the development of these parties in the  past few years, their positions on various topics, and the  extent to which their initial program goals have remained  consistent over time.''  <H5>  VMRO-DPMNE </H5>   In the first of a two-part (second part unavailable)  1400-word essay by Lilica Kitanovska in the 22 January issue on  page 3, entitled ``Uncompromising Attitude As a Boomerang,'' the  VMRO-DPMNE (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity) is  examined.    ``The VMRO-DPMNE is, without a doubt, the party that  exemplifies the beginning of our new political era. From its own  declaration, characterizing itself as `a national party with  comprehensive liberating national-patriotic and democratic  aspirations, pledges, and preoccupations,' this party introduced  and has continued to emphasize an insistence on polarity in the  Macedonian political environment.''    From the time of its founding, 17 June 1990, until today,  the party has never accepted being counted as a ``rightwing  party,'' but it has fought primarily against the parties in  the leftwing block. In the first multiparty elections, the  VMRO-DPMNE gained 38 seats in the Assembly. This party, which  acquired the sobriquet--``most Macedonian''--has as its  overwhelming purpose: ``the struggle for the restoration of the  pride and worthiness of the Macedonian individual, the  Macedonian people, and the Macedonian state.'' ``Its program  includes a plea for a confederation status in the Macedonian  state as the only guarantee for a comprehensive Macedonian  sovereignty and as a basic precondition for negotiations with  neighboring countries for the unification of Macedonia.... And  what does the VMRO-DPMNE mean by unification? According to its  program, `unification entails the complete spiritual, political,  economic, and ethnic unification of the scattered Macedonian  people and a state in a future united Balkan peninsula.''' There  is some ambiguity over whether the VMRO-DPMNE fully recognizes  the existing state borders.    The VMRO-DPMNE's attitude toward the non-Macedonian ethnic  groups is not based on a developed philosophy. In its election  platform, the party called for `a future Macedonian state in  which all national minorities and ethnic groups would be  guaranteed the civil rights prescribed by international  conventions.' ``The VMRO-DPMNE suggested numerous amendments to  the Constitution that conflicted with the preamble by suggesting  a definition of the republic as a state of the Macedonian  people, leaving out the enumeration of the minorities and the  term nationalities and replacing it with the term national  minorities. While most of these changes were not passed by the  constitutional commission, Article 7, dealing with the official  language, was an exception.'' The VMRO-DPMNE may have indirectly  supported a spontaneous demonstration against the adoption of  the Constitution and is suspected of not wanting the  Constitution.    Ljupco Georgievski, the leader of the party, served briefly  as Macedonia's vice president, but his resignation made it  easier for him to assert the party's ideological goals. The  party has not been able to compromise or participate in  government effectively.  <H5>  SDSM </H5>   The SDSM, the Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia -- the  party's current name -- is the subject of a two-part essay by  Aleksandar Damovski. The first is a 900-word article appearing  in NOVA MAKEDONIJA on 24 January on page 3, headlined  ``Promotion of Social Democracy.'' The second appears in the 25  January edition on page 3, 1,200 words, and is entitled ``The  Burden of Suitable and Unsuitable Hypotheses.''    Responding to the general changes in political and economic  systems, the League of Communists of Macedonia, which renamed  itself the League of Communists--Party for Democratic  Transformation, participated in the multiparty elections in  November-December 1990, winning 220,759 votes, or 20.38 percent,  and 31 seats (the current number is 28), in second place behind  the VMRO-DPMNE. The party emphasized a civic concept of society  and a slightly different approach to the minority question and  human rights. The party also advocated a role for Macedonia as a  confederative state within the community of Yugoslav peoples;  equality of all citizens before the law; parliamentary democracy  and a multiparty political life; the formation of bodies at the  republic-level to oversee the process of reprivatization; secure  prospects for private initiative; and adequate representation of  the workers in the management bodies of the enterprises.    The party's influence and representation in the governments  (half of the ministers, a prime minister, and the head of state)  is disproportionate to its electoral success. This can be seen  as a double-edged sword because it has also involved the party  in great scandals, classical blackmarketing, classical  racketeering, conflicts of interest, and dubious import-export  deals.    ``In the SDSM program, it was written that `an absolute  priority will be given to privatization in the establishment of  the new structure of ownership. The private structure is  indispensible and should be present in all spheres of life.'''  The party's secretary at the time of the second conference,  Nikola Popovski (who is now the party's vice chairman) pointed  out the dilemna involved in this policy since it conflicted with  the party's traditional social goals; restituting land to former  owners would leave many landless.    ``In his speech at the meeting of the SDSM's central  committee in December 1993, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski  claimed credit for Macedonia's achievements, especially  international recognition. The country's progress was due to the  party: `If we speak of foreign policy, it is the foreign policy  of President Kiro Gligorov; if we speak of the Constitution, it  is the Constitution of Frckovski, Popovski, and Kitanovski; if  we speak of privatization, it is the privatization of Jane  Miljovski.'''    The SDSM evolved from a party trying to successively to  preserve ties with Federal Yugoslavia, then a Yugoslav  confederation, and finally an independent state. As far as the  ethnic question is concerned, the party remains committed to the  civic orientation exemplified in the Constitution. ``According  to Branko Crvenkovski: `We know that the people want the  Constitution to say that it is a state of the Macedonian nation,  that they had another state, that they had a mother state....We  know that that earns points and that it is the easiest way to  reach voters, but we are consciously taking another path.'''  <H5>  PDP </H5>   The Party for Democratic Prosperity, the PDP, is the subject  of a two-part essay by Panta Djambazoski. ``Formation in an  Overly Sensitive Period,'' is the title of a 1,200-word essay  appearing on 26 January, on page 3; ``The Governing Coalition  Alters the Activity,'' appearing in the 27 January issue on page  3, running 1,200 words, is the title of the second essay.    ``The Party for Democratic Prosperity, headquartered in  Tetovo, is the largest party of Albanians in our country. It was  registered on 25 May 1990 and, like the Social Democratic Party  of Macedonia, is a party with the longest official existence in  the Republic of Macedonia after the breaking of the political  party monopoly of the League of Communists. In fact, the party  began to form itself much earlier with the gathering of the  people who would lead political activity, and with the founding  meeting of the PDP, which was convened on 14 April 1990 when the  Law on Political Parties and Associations was passed. On the  same day, in the village of Djepiste, the Assembly of the party  was held. Nevzat Halili was elected chairman, and Mithat Emini  secretary.''    ``The PDP is a civic party according to its program. The  main  party body is staffed with Albanians, but one of the founders of  the party was the well-known Skopje lawyer, Dusko Apostolski.  According to Chairman Halili, the purpose of the PDP was `for a  political party to confidently assert for the first time the  colletive demands of Albanians, Muslims, Turks, and others for  true equality and democracy.' However, as time passed and as new  ethnic parties (of Turks, Muslims, Romanies, and others), the  PDP has become a single ethnic party in its practice,  activities, and membership and leaders.''    The essay continues that at the time of the PDP's founding,  there was a sense of euphoria among the Albanians as they  participated in mass meetings. There was also a sharp division  between those who were for it and those opposed to it. The PDP  was also perceived as having as its only goal, a greater  Albania, and its activism coincided with that of the  nationalistic parties among Macedonians. ``At the PDP's first  congress in February 1992, Chairman N. Halili said that `many  extremist Macedonian political parties welcomed the founding of  the PDP with accusations and denigration in the communist  style....they were not for democracy ... but for the supremacy  and hegemony of the Macedonian people.'''    The still unpublished PDP program calls for the complete  political, economic, and ethnic rights and liberties of all  people. ``The party recognizes the territorial integrity of  Macedonia, viewing it as a state of all national collectives, of  all citizens--Macedonians, Albanians, Turks, Muslims, Vlachs,  Romanies, and others. The national collectives which have all  the characteristics of a people [narod], such as history,  territorial compactness, language, alphabet, culture, and  tradition, should be thought of as a people and should have that  `constitutional status.' The PDP favors a free market economy;  privatization, including private education; improvement of  agriculture; emancipation of women; and the freedom of citizens  to have a religion. The PDP advocates equality of languages and  alphabets of the ethnic groups in all state bodies and  institutions, and free instruction in the mother tongues. The  PDP favors the complete integration of Albanians in Europe and  demands the protection of the appropriate European  institutions.''    ``In the first multiparty elections, the party won 22 seats;  on average, for each seat, the party won 7,900 votes, and a  total of 263,800 votes for all candidates. In the parliament,  the PDP parliamentary group entered a coalition along with a  single representative of the other Albanian party, the People's  Democratic Party [Narodna Demokratska Partija, NPD].  Representative Djeladin Murati became one of the vice chairmen  of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. During the  interparty parliamentary negotiations, the PDP was dissatisfied  because it got one vice chairmanship in the parliament and one  ministry in the government, although it had demanded that at  least one of the three primary positions in the three highest  state bodies be given to the PDP, as well as at least three out  of six deputy ministerial positions.'' After a year and a half,  Branko Crvenkovski formed a party government, including the PDP  as a coalition partner. The PDP received a deputy prime  ministerial position in the government, five ministerial  positions, and more deputy and assistant ministerial positions.  ``But there remains considerable discontent among the leaders of  the party because of the still unfulfilled program goals. This  is perhaps one of the reasons for the recent party split.''    ``The PDP began to build its political image with an  expression of a certain degree of distrust and phobia toward the  state and its institutions.'' That led the party to boycott the  1991 census, which now necessitates a new census. The boycott  could be considered a big mistake by the PDP because a  substantial portion of the population saw it as disloyalty to  the state, even while the PDP began to participate in  government.''    Another decisive event was the referendum for political and  territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia. ``In a formal  sense, the PDP did not organize the referendum, but it did not  oppose it. On the contrary, it explained that it would respect  the will expressed by the people and would undertake a  commitment to achieve autonomy. This position was espoused also  at the PDP's congress. Afterwards came explanations to the  effect that this prescription was not meant to be frightening;  that it would be applicable only to th equal use of language and  alphabet by Albanians wherever they might live in Macedonia. At  the same time, there was an opposing view that this autonomy  should be established literally and in classic institutions. It  was also explained that, to the extent that the question of  Albanians was not resolved, they would seek to constitute  autonomy within the borders of Macedonia. Such an explanation  was even given by the head of the parliamentary group, Muhamed  Halili. In an interview with our newspaper, Secretary Mithat  Emini explained that eventually autonomy would be achieved  through the institutions of the Macedonian state. But for a  member of the presidency, Mahi Nesimi, autonomy would be a  `strange condition' in which some Albanians would enjoy autonomy  and others would remain outside it.'' It is precisely this issue  that divides the leadership structures and has contributed to  the current split.    ``The PDP representatives did not vote for the adoption of  the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia; this is another  argument of those who wish to see the party banned. But in any  case, the democratic public was also irritated because this was  the first constitution of an independent and sovereign  Macedonia. That position taken by the parliamentary group was  explained by Secretary Emini: `The Albanians, believing that  Macedonia was also their country, expected and endeavored to  make the Constitution reflect their natural and legitimate right  to be equal as a people in their country and to be a  state-forming people.''' There were other disturbing signs, such  as ``N. Halili's recommendation at the 1992 Congress that  Albania should not recognize Macedonia as long as Macedonia did  not recognize Kosovo as a republic and the participation of M.  Halili as a member of Albania's delegation at the 1993 CSCE  meeting in Prague, at which the Albanians voted against the  admission of Macedonia to the CSCE.''    ``The demands of the PDP could be summarized as follows:  changing the Constitution; equal admission of Albanians to  middle schools and opening the Pedagogical Department to  Albanians; at least 4-5 hours of Albanian-language programming  on Macedonian television; representation of Albanians at all  levels in the state bodies; and a population census carried out  under international supervision.''    The author concludes that the tension between the PDP's  goals  as a party in the coalition and its role as an ethnic movement  remains serious. It has contributed to the split between the  ``hard'' faction, led by Menduh Thaqi, and the ``soft'' faction  of the parliamentary representatives, ministers, and some  members of the presidency. The PDP faces competition from the  NPD and the Albanian Democratic Union - Liberal Party (ADS-LP).  <H5>  Liberal Party </H5>   A two-part essay by Zoran Petrov appears in the 28 and 29  January editions of NOVA MAKEDONIJA, both on page 3. The first,  1,400 words, is entitled ``At a Distance from Both Left and  Right''; the second, 1,700 words, is headlined ``In a Continual  Misunderstanding with the Center.''    ``In many ways, one of the most specific and most  characteristic party in the Macedonian pluralistic environment  is the Liberal Party. The party built its own identity and image  as a truly democratic, progressive force but has been unable to  escape such accusations as `imported,' `faceless,'  `bureaucratic-managerial,' `greedy for power,' and `a party that  was the prolonger of a defeated opposition in an already  unstable Yugoslavia.'''    ``On the other hand, the Liberals from their emergence until  today have been in a latent but continual conflict with  everything around them, constantly stressing that their  proposals, ideas, and projects are being by-passed, that their  contribution is being disregarded, or, in one word, they have  been treated unfairly. The rivalry with its coalition partner  the SDSM, which recently became more pronounced, represented a  serious threat to the survival of the current government, but  even the news media were not spared from accusations from the  Liberals that they were under the influence of the SDSM. Thus, a  seemingly contradictory situation developed within the Liberal  Party itself. On the one hand, the `fat rewards' required them  to participate in the executive branch, especially in the three  significant governing bodies (dealing with foreign affairs,  economics, and health), and, on the other, they were constantly  in a dissatisfied and critical mood toward that same  government.''  <H5>  ``In the Beginning Was Ante Markovic'' </H5>   ``The Liberal Party was founded on 5 October 1990 with the  name and symbols identical to the then Union of Reformist Forces  of Yugoslavia (SRSJ), under the leadership of SFRY [Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Prime Minister Ante Markovic. At  the time, it was obliged to distinguish itself from the SRSJ  branches in Serbia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro, and  Vojvodina, so the Macedonians registered themselves as an  autocephalous party and avoided formally introducing themselves  as a `daughter' from the center in Belgrade; they would not just  exist as a Yugoslav political substitute. However, the influence  that the then Yugoslav prime minister exerted through this party  was unambiguous, not only as the father of the SRSM [Party of  Reformist Forces of Macedonia] program and its clear economic  orientation, but also without a doubt vis-a-vis the electoral  body in Macedonia where Markovic visited several times during  the election campaign. The indisputable fact is that the  popularity of the leader of the Federal Executive Council led  directly to the electoral success of the SRSM, resulting in the  seating of 18 representatives from this party in the Assembly of  the Republic of Macedonia. As is known, Markovic soon fell from  power, and the SRSM was left alone to establish, defend, and  propagate its political identity and image in new conditions. It  is noteworthy that only in Macedonia, where the reformists had  gained the greatest number of seats in the republic-level  parliament, did the reformists survive, whereas in the other  former Yugoslav republics, they suffered a complete fiasco.    ``It is interesting that in the first elections, this party  performed favorably in Kavadarci, where it captured all three  seats; in Negotino, it won one seat; in Kocani and in Stip, two  out of three seats respectively; in Bitola, the party won three  out of nine seats; one seat each in Prilep, Kumanovo, and  Venica; and in Skopje, the SRSM won three out of 32 electoral  districts. It should be remembered that the SRSM had entered an  electoral coalition with the Young Democratic-Progressive Party,  whose leader was Risto Ivanov, and with a certain Association of  Artisans from Stip. The SRSM's definitive assimilation into a  political party came at the first annual assembly in July 1991  when the party renamed itself: Reformist Forces of Macedonia -  Liberal Party (RSMLP). With respect to the electoral results, we  can see another curious phenomenon. Namely, it is currently the  only group in the Macedonian parliament whose number has  grown--by one member (from its ranks only Djulistana Markovska  left, while Blagoja Ckartovski and Dimitar Trpenovski joined  them); in any case, this is an indicator of the internal  stability and cohesion of the party.    ``Otherwise, the final defining of the party that introduced  the completed phase of its maturation came at last year's  regular assembly in June when the RSMLP decisively launched its  new name: Liberal Party of Macedonia. This step was logically  followed by the so-called New Between-Elections Program of the  Liberal Party; this is the completed elaboration of the party's  initial program.''  <H5>  ``Firmly for Strengthening the Economy'' </H5>   ``An unambiguous accomplishment of the LP, which is in  fourth  place in terms of numbers in the Macedonian parliament, is its  favorable position in the government. Besides the position of  chairmanship of the Assembly, which is held by party leader  Stojan Andov, the LP members of the government are: Stevo  Crvenkovski, foreign minister; Gordana Siljanovska, minister  without portfolio; Petrus Stefanov, minister of the economy; and  Jovan Tofovski, minister of health. In addition, there are four  deputy ministers from the LP in the ministries of internal  affairs, development, science, and culture. Until his  resignation a little over a month ago, Risto Ivanov held the  position and functions of a deputy prime minister in the  Government of the Republic of Macedonia. All of this showed that  the party had a place and a strong need to actively participate  in the government and to share in Macedonia's internal and  external policies. It is characteristic of this party that,  while it is perhaps an active initiator of new ideas and  projects, this is the feature that leads to misunderstandings  and disputes with its coalition partners.''    The LP's program has become more precise over time, but its  basic orientation toward a democratic process, civic rights, and  economic development on the basis of private ownership and the  market. ``The party has begun to delineate five overarching  goals:    ``1. Realization of the Macedonian state's turn toward the  establishment of free, equal, economic and political empowerment  of citizens and individuals;    ``2. Restoration of the social system on the basis of the  civic status of the individual;    ``3. Europeanization and global modernization of Macedonia's  productive, economic, social, and cultural models and ways of  life;    ``4. Establishment of a strong, highly productive, and  efficient economy which, through private and collective  enterprise and market mechanisms, will be included on an equal  basis in the world market and in European integration;    ``5. Restoration of a single Macedonian cultural-ethnic  sphere through the opening of borders and the democratization of  relations in the Balkans, as well as the resolution of the  question of national rights and status of the Macedonian people  in neighboring countries, and the internationalization of this  question.''    The author says that the LP has attempted out of necessity  to  portray itself as a party of the center, keeping a ``hygienic  distance'' from the nationalists and ultra-leftist parties.  While the LP thinks that it represents the true interests of the  Macedonian people, opinion polls show that the popularity of  this party is falling steadily. Despite the LP's standing as a  serious political exponent and generator of ideas, its  representatives have been accused of ``flirting with the  opposition'' in some discussions and some votes in the  parliament.  <H5>  ``Serious Conflict With the Ministry of Internal Affairs'' </H5>   Two issues particularly concerned the LP after it entered a  governing coalition with the SDSM, the PDP, and the SP,  Socialist Party. One was to transform the Public Accounting  Service. According to the author, the PDP regarded this  quasi-government organization as an impediment to privatization.  This position, however, led to difficulties within the coalition  and public criticism that the LP was simply trying to protect  its enterprises and directors. The second issue that led to poor  relations among the coalition partners was connected with  transforming the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVR), which the  LP viewed as ``an institution, in form, staffing, and structure  a legacy from the old concept of the `real socialist state.'  Further, the police exert great influence in the shaping of  political life and the `creation' of a polical atmosphere in the  economy, in some political parties, and even in some news media  establishments.'' The dispute between the LP and the MVR reached  its culmination last September when the LP abstained from voting  during the interpellation concerning the work of Internal  Affairs Minister Frckovski.    The article continues, relations among the coalition members  had come under strain even earlier. For example, in an interview  with the Belgrade daily BORBA, Stojan Andov said, ```The  democratic processes in Macedonia are at a standstill.''' He  supported that position by noting that the systemic laws  required by the Constitution were being postponed. ``Later, in a  16 November interview with NOVA MAKEDONIJA, Andov said, `We  think that the relationship with our party is inadmissably bad.  Their pushing us to one side is a factor and our people have  been suspicious of some basic measures. Such a strategy was  developed by those circles in the SDSM that have been  endeavoring to get rid of the Liberal Party. They believed that  the Macedonian voters should be divided into those whose views  are to the extreme right and those who are social democrats!'''  The struggle continued from July to the first of October, and  the public became convined that there was a serious conflict  between the coalition partners, as well as quarrels over  leadership positions in the ministries and directorships,  including those in the mass media, and finally, a symptom of a  profound government crisis.  <H5>  ``Someone Is Profiting From Us'' </H5>   The article continues that the LP has also had internal  conflicts, but has been characteristically lucky in that they  have not attracted much attention from the public. For example,  assembly representative Djulistana Markovska left the party  after accusing party leader Andov of absolutism and of working  exclusively with a small clique. Last August, Andov was also  involved in a scandal involving an accident with an official  Mercedes on the Skopje-Tetovo road and the subsequent police  disclosures about the incident.    Moreover, the LP became the center of attention in the  confrontation between Zoran Krstevski, the director of the  public enterprise ``Makedonija'' for airport services and  coordinator of the LP parliamentary group, and Antoni Pesev,  then Minister of Urban Planning, Construction, Communications,  Transportation, and Ecology. The dispute concerned supplies of  aviation fuel. One of five bidders was the company of Risto  Gusterov, a member of the leadership committee of the LP and a  well-known businessman. According to a memorandum prepared for  Minister Pesev, the choice of Gusterov would be prohibited  unless the required management committee of a public enterprise  was formed. After Krstevski openly expressed his opposition to  excluding Gusterov's private company, the minutes of the meeting  compiled by the Ministry, which were then leaked, showed that  the Liberals, through their influence in ``Makedonija'' were  attempting to evade the government's policy.    The author mentions another scandal, involving former Deputy  Prime Minister Risto Ivanov, who was also a member of the  highest leadership body of the LP. Ivanov wrote a letter to the  township public prosecutor and the district court in Skopje II  last September, ``requesting to be informed about the process of  a criminal case, as well as the basis for the arrest warrant  against a judge from the district economic court in Skopje, who  was accused of taking a bribe. In his reply, the chairman of the  court expressed constrernation about the tone of Ivanov's  letter, reminding him of the constitutional separation of powers  among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Only a  few days later, Minister of Justice Tuse Gosev repeated the  judge's argument, characterizing the entire proceeding as a  result of `Deputy Prime Minister Ivanov's legal ignorance.'''  This led to Ivanov's resignation.    ``Despite the disagreements, confrontations, and affairs,  the  LP should be seen as a real and potentially active political  factor in the country with a clear ideological perspective. Its  motto--the adept will succeed with us--is attractive to a great  number of well-known intellectuals, successful businessmen, and  entrepreneurs who have joined its ranks.'' The LP is also the  only party in Macedonia which is accepted internationally, being  a member of the Federation of European Liberal, Democratic, and  Reform Parties. As far as the approaching elections are  concerned, Stojan Andov relies on the electorate's intelligence.  He views ``the disinformation against the LP as evidence that  certain circles in the country are frightened by the party's  prospects in the coming election.'' Despite this, Andov says  that an electoral coalition with the Social Democrats is  possible since both parties support the democratic development  of Macedonia.  <H5>  Socialist Party </H5>   A two part essay by Emil Sterjevski appears on 30 and 31  January, both on page 3--the 1,000-word ``From a Union to a  Transformed Party,'' and the 800-word ``Is It Hard To Be A  Coalition Partner?''    ``Many dilemnas have followed the transformation of the  `broadest front of the progressive forces' of the working people  of Macedonia into the Socialist Party of Macedonia.'' One basic  problem was the fact that many of its members were  simultaneously connected with the League of Communists. There  was also a problem of collective membership and the difficulty  of deciding whether to be a party or a movement.  <H5>  ``Discontinuity or...'' </H5>   Kiro Popovski, chairman of the Socialist Party of Macedonia,  SP, refers to the ``deep roots and tradition'' of socialism,  going back 100 years to the time of Delcev, Glavinov, and Karev,  as well as the days of the People's Liberation Front during  World War II. On 28 September 1990, at the founding meeting in  Skopje, the party adopted the compromise name, Socialist Union -  Socialist Party, and a draft program, statute, and emblem was  chosen for the elections. ``In the first multiparty  parliamentary elections, the SP ran and won four seats  independently, and won one seat in conjunction with the Union of  Reformist Forces of Macedonia, and one seat with the cooperation  of the Party for the Complete Emancipation of the Romanies.  Their share in the parliament thus amounted to five percent of  the total. That is also the share that it has in the governing  coalition; it also has 12 percent of the total members of local  assemblies in the Republic.'' In that parliamentary election  campaign, the SP promoted the idea of ```a sovereign and  democratic Macedonian state as an equal economic, political, and  social entity in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans, and in Europe.'''  Between the first and second rounds of the election, the SP  agreed to a cooperative arrangement with the Union of Reformist  Forces.    At its June 1991 congress, Popovski reaffirmed the view that  the only choice was a democratic way to discuss a new  Yugoslavia, as an association of equal republics as sovereign  states. There was sharp criticism of nationalist tendencies and  the misuse of patriotic feelings by various parties in their  promotional efforts. ```Macedonia should be seen as a  nation-state of the Macedonian people and the common homeland of  all citizens. Multiethnic relations imply ethnic and religious  toleration.'''    Unlike other parties, the author says the SP has not had  internal disputes. Membership has been relatively stable.    He continues, the SP is the smallest and most loyal member  of  the governing coalition, but it has sometimes been left out of  negotiations among the partners. The SP's share in government  positions is one deputy chairmanship in the Assembly and one  minister in the government.    The SP has recently sketched out its version of  privatization, calling for 20 percent of the shares of the  enterprises to be given free of charge to the respective  workers. The SP's problem is how to overcome its faceless image  and to sharpen its distinctiveness as a party of the left, while  remaining amenable to a coaltion of the center, occupied by the  SDSM and LP. It eshews nationalism as a retrograde phenomenon.  <H5>  Labor Party </H5>   A 1,300-word article by Emil Sterjevski appears in the 1  February issue on page 3, entitled ``Results Better Than  Investment.'' Sterjevski writes, continuing the tradition of the  workers' movement, the Labor Party (RP) emerged as a new party  in 1990. In the first multiparty elections, it won 3.4 percent  of the vote, which was below the threshold for entering the  parliament. Despite the class connotations of its name, the RP  did not use aggressive rhetoric in its election campaign, nor  has it resorted to such language since then in its press  communiques.    On 24 June 1990, the RP held its initial assembly. It waited  until August to register officially. According to its statute,  the RP should hold its next party congress in June 1994. Krste  Jankoski, the party leader, says that the RP began its political  activity with no supplies, infrastructure, or personnel. By  making the best of minimal means in the election campaign, the  RP came out surprisingly well. Jankoski claims that the  membership is stable and well distributed in terms of levels of  education. The majority of the members are those who have been  the most marginalized and hurt by the so-called transition  period; they are also from the middle and lower social strata.    ``The RP, in fact, does not appear attractive for the  reasons  mentioned above.'' Yet, it was one of the few parties which in  the beginning was not preoccupied with the controversial issue  of Macedonian statehood and nationality. ``In its program, which  has remained unchanged since the elections, the RP considered  the inviolability of the territorial sovereignty of Macedonia as  follows: `The RP pledges itself to Macedonia as a common  homeland of equal citizens and communities, regardless of  whether they live in Macedonia or anywhere else in the world.'  At that time, the party favored a `Yugoslavia as a federation  and community of free and sovereign peoples who should  consensually and equally determine the bases for a common  life....''' The RP supported the referendum on independence. Its  position on the ethnic issue favors the conception of a civic  state, rather than a purely national one and the protection of  the rights of minorities according to international conventions.    ``In July 1992, as well as in July 1993, the RP organized  meetings under the provocative slogan: `We have nothing tell the  government.' The meetings elicited varying reactions from the  public and political entities and also led to internal friction.  The deputy chairman and some of his supporters registered a new  party with the name, Labor Party of Macedonia.''    Along with its priority on fairness to workers, the RP is  against what it calls ```the unprincipled privatization of  socially-owned capital, its destruction, and plundering without  an accounting to its initiators.''' The RP is not against  privatization per se, however. It opposes ``neoliberal''  privatization schemes that it views as leading to a Latin  American type society with a small minority of wealthy people  and an impoverished majority.    The author concludes that the RP appears to have a stable  core of support--about 2.9 percent according to BriMa polls. Its  expectations for the coming election are slim, however.  <H5>  Democratic Party of Turks </H5>   The 2 February issue of NOVA MAKEDONIJA carries a 1,000-word  article by Aleksandar Danovski on page 4, headlined ``An  Association Is Transformed Into a Party.''    ``The beginning of political organizations among the ethnic  groups in the country following the trend--one party, one  people--produced something unique when it involved the Turks.''  The Turks already were organized in a Democratic Union of Turks  (DST), which was removed from the register as a civic  organzation on 17 July 1992. On 16 October 1992, it registered  as a political party under the name, Democratic Party of Turks.  Its leader was Erdogan Sarac.    The party soon came to public attention through its role in  the dispute over education in the Turkish language in the town  of Zupa, in Debar township. On 8 April 1993, the party  complained of discrimination and called on Turks to resettle in  Turkey if conditions did not improve. Some local problems were  described as tantamount to a ```genocide of the Turks in  Macedonia.'''    At the same time, however, the DPT called on the Turkish  minority to support the referendum for a sovereign and  independent state, the new constitution, and the process of  recognition. The party also appealed for the resolution of  problems through dialogue and through institutions in the system  in keeping with the Turkish community's traditions of tolerance  and peacefulness.    Toward the end of 1993, there was an internal dispute over  allegations of mistakes by Serac and others in the party  leadership. The DPT's meeting was closed to journalists, and  Serac claims that there was complete agreement about the party's  leadership.  <H5>  Movement for All-Macedonian Action </H5>   A 1,300-word article by Emil Sterjevski appears on page 4  entitled ``The Program Achieved, the Members Lost.''    ``One of the first political parties to appear on the  pluralistic political scene was the Movement for All-Macedonian  Action--MAAK. In addition to its name, the lion as a protective  symbol, and a political program, MAAK behaved very radically.  The public was simply divided when the question arose over  sympathy toward a party with such a nationalistic orientation.  MAAK was registered in the first half of June 1990, and, at  about that point, there was talk about two parties--MAAK and the  League for Democracy--attracting and dividing Macedonia's  intelligentsia along nationalistic or civic lines.''    ``MAAK defined itself as th fatherland party of the  Macedonians and of all citizens of Macedonia `regardless of  their social, ethnic, or religious adherence, who accept the  Proclamation and the Program Declaration and Manifesto of MAAK  for a Free, Independent, and Sovereign Macedonia.' The Movement  for All Macedonian Action came forward with the position that  `the Macedonian people will not permit themselves to be seduced  in games whose goal is the re-establishment of some abbreviated,  asymmetrical Yugoslavia;' this was contained in its program  before the parliamentary elections. The party considered 12  August 1913 [the date of signing of the Treaty of Bucharest,  dividing Macedonia among Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria] as the  day of the Macedonian national catastrophe.''    ``For MAAK, 1990 was the year of `political action.' After  its founding assembly at which only a working presidency was  elected (February 1990), members of a National Committee were  elected one month later, and on 2 August - Ilinden [St.Elias's  Day, anniversary of the 1903 uprising against the Turks] in  Prohor Pcinjski, the Manifesto for a Free, Independent and  Sovereign Macedonia was proclaimed. MAAK also demanded the  withdrawal of our specialists from Kosovo and the departure of  the JNA. In Prilep, they commemorated the anniverary of the  death of Metodija-Andonov-Cento, and in Ohrid, they marked the  1000th anniversary of the Samuil Kingdom.''    ``A year later, MAAK held the second part of its assembly  and  proclaimed the Declaration on the Demilitarization of the  Republic of Macedonia. The result of all these signs of  incongruence with mainstream views was a fiasco - not a single  seat in parliament, but representation in almost half of the  opstina councils. Some parties could have been satisfied with  those results, but not the proud Movement for All Macedonian  Action.''    ``On 12 November 1990, the so-called National Front,  comprising MAAK, VMRO-DPMNE, the People's Party, and the  Agrarian Party, was formed. This turned out to be a tactical  mistake for MAAK because the party had assumed that it could set  policy for the Front.'' MAAK also suffered from internal  contradictions, especially over the arrival of U.S. soldiers as  part of the UNPROFOR in 1993, which was at odds with MAAK's  views on demilitarization.    In September 1992, MAAK began a campaign to collect  signatures for a petition calling for early parliamentary  elections. The party got 128,000, to which the VMRO-DPMNE was  supposed to add 30,000 in order to reach the 150,000 stipulated  by the Constitution. Little seems to have come of this effort.  MAAK appears to be losing members to other parties, particularly  the VMRO-DPMNE and the Democratic Party.    MAAK's position on the ethnic Albanian question is described  by Deputy Chairman Levko Djambazovski: ```The Macedonian people  in their own state should restore the relationship between the  state and the minority. But the minority does not feel any  attachment to the state; they only demand rights. They should  enjoy all the rights that minorities are accorded by  international conventions, but rights are founded on  reciprocity. The Constitution should be respected. If something  should be changed, the Macedonian people should change it if  they consider that necessary. Changes made because of dictates  from outsiders, especially from blood enemies of the country  would mean trampling the dignity of the people and demonstrating  the immaturity of the state.'' As yet, MAAK does not have a  developed economic platform, but it tends to favor support for  the agricultural sector.  <H5>  Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies (PCERM) </H5>   In a 1,400-word article on 4 February by Lilica Kitanovska  on  page 4, entitled ``Party for Social Emancipation,'' the author  writes: ``In its election program, the Party for the Full  Emancipation of Romanies [Gypsies] stated that the party has a  profoundly humane and democratic Macedonian and Yugoslav  character, that it would share equally in government, and that  it is prepared for a dialogue with all progressive forces, as  well as to support changes in the economy and the programs of  the Federal Government of Yugoslavia. PCERM would also struggle  for a better life for the unemployed and for the stability of  Macedonia and Yugoslavia within the borders of Europe, and vice  versa! This is only part of the confused way of presenting its  demands for a place in the sun under the new democratic  conditions with which the Romanies rushed about, demonstrating  their lack of preparedness while strongly showing their desire  to seize the initative. However, as Faik Abdi, the popular  representative and leader of the PCERM says: `It was very  difficult to persuade Romanies to join the party. According to  Abdi, the Romanies were afraid of parties; they thought they  would be sent to prison for forming a party! They were convinced  that someone should defend them, teach them, identify things for  them....So, that is why we formed the PCERM. We explained to  them that, after a protracted analysis, we had come to the  conclusion that we are the most backward part of the population  and that no one would undertake to integrate us into the social  mainstream without distinguishing where we live.'''    ``Thus, in the second half of 1990, the first party of  Romanies was formed, but up until the elections, it was unable  to develop additonal structures. There were only some branches  in Skopje and its suburbs, Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, and  Kumanovo. According to Abdi, it was determined that the Romanies  were the most illiterate, the most frequent users of public  welfare, the earliest to marry, and, all in all, the Romanies  needed a genuine struggle for emancipation.''    ``PCERM mainly saw emancipation through improving living  standards.'' It proved difficult to make progress in this area.  However, Abdi could point to some success. ``For the first time  in history, Romanies were brought into the constitution of a  state, and not as an ethnic group or national minority, but as a  nation which lived along side with the Macedonians and could  consider the country as its homeland.'' The significance of this  step was lost on some people who, criticizing PCERM's passivity,  formed another party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).    According to Kitanovska, conflicts between the two Romany  parties concerned the use of flour donated by enterprises and  distributed by Abdi, who was accused of absolutist tendencies  and of diverting some of the charity. The DPP also thought that  Abdi's solution to the introduction of bilingual education for  Romanies meant acquiescence in the slow pace of change.    Up to now, PCERM has generally adhered to official  government  policy. As its only representative in the assembly, Abdi has  earned the sobriquet ``cushion'' because he steers a course  between the government and the nationalist opposition. ``Not so  much by the force of his arguments, as by his desire to calm the  passions of the opponents, Faik Abdi has often succeeded in  cutting the discussions, which because of their sterility should  be relegated to the background.''    ``The best demonstration of the loyalty of this party to  Macedonia is its support for the referendum in which it  mobilized 98.3 percent of the Romany electorate to vote.  However, that positive aspect of the PCERM was interrupted by  the party's indulgence in talk of a new state with the name  Romanistan in March 1993. In a letter sent to Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, there was a call for an order creating an area in  which Romanies from all over the world could find a home where  they would be welcome.'' To date, PCERM has not officially  renounced this idea, which seemed justified in its view by the  merciless genocide of the past, but the party has nothing  against the current residence of the Romanies in Macedonia.    The writer asserts that a final cause of friction between  PCERM and ``non-Romanies'' concerns the number of members of  this ethnic group in Macedonia. PCERM claims that there are no  less than 220,000, while the 1991 census put the number at  52,000. PCERM explains the discrepancy as a result of the  mistrust of Romanies toward Macedonian census takers and the  Romanies' lack of organization. The Romanies were also said to  have accepted the officials' description of them in exchange for  paved roads in their neighborhoods. PCERM deserves credit,  however, for its moderation since it is essential that the  Romanies be integrated into society. It is also significant that  the agreement with the German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen for  the resettlement of Gypsies who claimed asylum in Germany also  puts the Romanies in a position to put forward their demands.    Although the PCERM now has a membership of 36,000, Abdi  worries about the divisive effect of elections and the spawning  of new parties trying to attract the Romany constituency.  Despite this danger, he forecasts a parliamentary group of six  or seven Romany representatives in the new Assembly. As to  whether PCERM would have a working alliance with the Socialist  Party again, things appear less certain. According to Abdi,  PCERM would ally with those parties which can contribute to the  realization of PCERM's goals.  <H5>  League for Democracy </H5>   A 1,300-word article by Zoran Petrov, entitled ``Neither  Communism Nor Nationalism--Democracy Here,'' was included in the  3 February edition on page 4.    Petrov says that the League for Democracy made its debut on  the pluralistic stage with great pomp and attracted the cream of  intellectual and progressive civic circles. It is the only  political organization that does not fit into the scheme of  these essays since its existence ended 10 months ago. However,  from the standpoint of its significance, influence, and  contribution to the development of democracy in Macedonia, the  League has earned respect and a distinctive place in Macedonian  political life.    On 21 November 1989 the party's platform was made public,  and  on 11 February 1990 the constituent assembly of the League for  Democracy was convened in Skopje. The party was registered on 8  July 1990. It held its first congress on 21 November 1992. It  was disbanded in May 1993. Although the League failed to gain  representation in parliament, it was active outside the Assembly  and demonstrated its interest in participating in the creation  of Macedonia's domestic and foreign policies.  <H5>  ``Eschewing Wooly Language'' </H5>   The League's enduring image was that of a classic, or  old-fashioned, civic party, non-nationalistic, self-critical,  not secretive, and responsible in its internal operations. It  was also anti-communist and focused on the ideal of Macedonia as  a state governed by rule of law. Along with its demands for  denationalization of property, the League advocated the return  of church property to the Macedonian Orthodox Church,  privatization of socially-owned property, local self-government,  changing the name and symbols of the Macedonain state from the  socialist ones, and reform of the criminal code. According to  its 29 June 1990 platform, the League was also the first to  suggest rehabilitation and restitution for those sentenced by  the Communists and for the principle of reciprocity in relations  with neighboring countries.    Despite all this, the first parliamentary elections were a  fiasco for the League even in the first round. With the  exception of two or three candidates, no one received the  required number of votes for the run-off. The League won one  seat on the local council in Sveti Nikole. The party filed  complaints to the Supreme Court concerning the electoral  process, citing especially procedures in Kumanovo and Kratovo.  The League managed to bring these problems to the attention of  the public and to induce the prosecution of a case involving  financial irregularities during the campaign on behalf of the  SKM-PDP, SPM, and SRSM.    ``The League was also the first party to publish its  positions, ideas, and recommendations in its own newspaper,  DEMOKRATSKI FORUM, the first issue of which appeared on 29 June  1990.'' The party's public image was greatly influenced by its  chairman Djordji Marjanovic, a professor of criminal law at  Skopje University's Law Department, who criticized the  government and certain conditions and tendencies in the country  in a forthright manner and without mincing words. His  description of the current governing coalition as ```a  politically contradictory debachery of the Macedonian  crypto-communists and Albanians nationalists''' is now famous.    In the fall of 1992, in two of three parliamentary  by-elections, the League did surprisingly well. In the 111th  district in the Skopje region of Centar, League candidate  Aleksandar Tortevski came in second after Nikola Popovski of the  SDSM, and ahead of VMRO-DPMNE and LP candidates. The League's  candidate placed third in the 90th district in Gazi Baba.  Despite these signs of popularity, the League disbanded itself  half a year later.  <H5>  ``Last Stop: The Democratic Party'' </H5>   As Marjanovic explained in the July 1993 issue of  DEMOKRATSKI  FORUM, the League for Democracy merged with the Petar Gosev's  Democratic Party, sacrificing its individuality and centrist  orientation for the sake of the evolution of a rule-of-law state  and for the well-being of the Macedonian people. The Democratic  Party was formed in April 1993 by Petar Gosev, former chairman  of the SKM-PDP who left its successor organization the SDSM. In  addition to the League, the Ilinden Free Democrats, who had left  the VMRO-DPMNE; the Party of the Greens; and the Revival Party  of Ohrid joined the Democratic Party. The League contributed six  people to the 15-member Republic Council of the DP. The  Democratic Party, led by three representatives on the Republic  Council--Petar Gosev, Mihail Panovski, and Risto Jovanov, is  actively preparing for the November elections.  <H5>  NPD </H5>   Penta Djambozoski is the author of a 1,200-word essay  appearing on page 4 on 6 February, entitled ``In the Shadow of  the Ethnic Brother.''    ``The People's Democratic Party, headquartered in Tetovo,  was  registered on 1 August 1990, and its constituent assembly was  held a fews days before on Sunday when Iljaz Halimi was elected  chairman and Ibrahim Bedredin secretary.'' The party's activity  is intended to promote the ethnic demands of the Albanians in  Macedonia and to establish their status as a state-forming  people.`` The NPD is almost universally considered radical even  when compared to the largest ethnic Albanian party, the PDP. It  is important not to minimize the significance of the NPD on the  Macedonian political scene because it achieved notable results  in the first multiparty elections. The NPD entered the  Macedonian parliament with one seat in the PDP-NPD coalition and  with a significant number of representatives in the city  councils in Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, Kicevo,  and Struga, where it is in a coalition with the PDP. Indeed, the  NPD's political and party activism did not perhaps meet a  corresponding interest from the public, thus extending a hand to  the mass-based PDP was a necessity for the party to have a more  influential role on our political scene.''    Djambozoski writes, in general, it should be noted that the  NPD has not been careless, particularly in dealing with the most  essential questions, such as relations with key government  bodies and arguments over the status of Albanians. It has,  however, been sharply critical of the government. ``Under the  guidance of the NPD and PDP, the 1991 census and the Referendum  on the Future of Macedonia were boycotted by the Albanian  minority. The NPD asserted that the number of Albanians in  Macedonia amounted to somewhere around 40 percent of the entire  population. But this party reacted even more sharply with  respect to the adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of  Macedonia than its arguments in favor of a tolerant dialogue  seemed to imply. With uncompomising and strident language, the  NPD depicted the Constitutional Commission as `a tailor of the  Serbian agenda in Macedonia,' compared living conditions in  Macedonia (at any rate those of Albanians) with those in Serbia,  and set forth the prognosis that `the Constiution will be the  obituary for the Republic of Macedonia.''' From the beginning  of its activities, the NPD placed great hopes in the courts and  in the international community, which ```would treat Macedonia  as it had Serbia''' with respect to human rights.  <H5>  ``Evaluating the Program'' </H5>   ``In 1992 the Constitutional Court of Macedonia had many  interesting but complicated tasks to perform in reviewing the  constitutionality of the party's program, that is, the Political  Declaration of the NPD.'' Besides the question of deciding  whether that Declaration predated the Constitution. There was  also the problem of whether toleration of dissent included  changing the political system in a legal way. ``Considering that  the declaration contained terms such as genocide, assimilation,  and terror, a determination had to be made concerning whether  the declaration's intent was to achieve the status of Albanians  as a people on the way to political agreement or a decision to  seek a common ethnic association and the formation of a single  Albanian state in the Balkans!'' That would be contrary to  Article 20, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, but the  Constitutional Court did not attack the NPD, suggesting instead  that it alter the program.    ``A year and a half later, the NPD proposed a definition of  Macedonia as a state of equal citizens with a bicameral  parliament and the possibility of it becoming a federation. This  suggestion was placed in the context of the International  Conference on the Former Yugoslavia in Geneva. The NPD decided  in favor of a democratic and sovereign state of citizens and  equal nations--the Macedonian and the Albanian--with other  nationalities and ethnic groups living there. Certainly, the  position of the NPD with respect to the status of the Republic  of Macedonia on the international level should be remembered:  the NPD was against Macedonia's recognition and admittance to  the CSCE [Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe].  This was at the same time the Republic of Albania justified its  blocking of Macedonia's CSCE membership because of the  `inequality of the Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia.'''  <H5>  ``A Dose of Populism'' </H5>   ``At about that time, the NPD sent an open letter to the  President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov with the  observation that `the faith of Albanians living in Macedonia in  state institutions, including that of the republic's presidency,  will soon disappear entirely' because of the disregard for the  justified demands of the Albanians. The element of populism in  the political behavior of this party and demonstrated in this  letter is striking because it is addressed to all Albanians.  When the issue of the constitution came up, the NPD proposed and  supported a draft for cantonization and repeatedly denied the  statement that `the Albanians do not demand autonomy.''' It is  also notable that the NPD does not issue statements in the name  of its members, but in the name of Albanians in the Republic of  Macedonia, despite the existence of the PDP and the Albanian  Democratic Union - Liberal Party.    The NPD views the affair of the paramilitary organization of  Albanians and the arrest of eight members, including a former  PDP official, with suspicion that it was meant to coincide with  trials of Albanians in Kosovo and that the jailed individuals  are victims of political machinations by the governing coalition.    ``In anticipation of the second parliamentary elections, the  NPD is already thinking of more advantageous electoral results.  Some of its positions expressed ealier can now be realized in  view of the great political schism in the largest ethnic  Albanian party, the PDP. Thus, the NPD reiterates that the  membership of the PDP in the governing coalition (the NPD is not  in the governing coalition although its only parliamentary  representative is in the coalition group PDP-NPD) presents a  defeat and a great political mistake because `from that  government, the Albanian people endure not only discrimination,  but also stern repression.''' This leaves the question of  whether the NPD will cooperate with the PDP in the November  elections in doubt.  <H5>  Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia </H5>   A 1,200-word article by Aleksandar Damovski appears on page  4  of the 7 February issue, headlined ``Lost Coordinates.''    ```The idea of forming our party arose about May or June  1990, when many political parties were being formed in Macedonia  and the Bolshevik system was collapsing. But, at that time, the  Serbs in Macedonia were not able to assemble to form a party.  There was eagerness among the people. The old regime was still  apreading indoctrination and embraced the ethnic freedom of the  Serbs in Macedonia....yielding to international public opinion,  international media, and domestic opinion, the government  decided to register our party on 16 March 1992.'''    ``In the above statement, Boro Ristic, then chairman of the  Democratic Party of Serbs (DPS), answered the question about the  origins of the party in the first issue of SRPSKA REC, a  bulletin of the city committee of the Association of Serbs and  Montenegrins in Macedonia.'' The founding of the party was  accompanied by the marketing of the idea of a threat of  ```national and spiritual annihilation.'''    The DPS's policies have been complicated by the fact that  the  party ``has constantly been turning for guidance toward the  north,'' that is, toward Serbia. One sign of this is that the  party leadership cooperates with representatives of the Serbian  media in Skopje, rather than with the Macedonian media. The  author continues that as a result of the party's activities,  there have been direct clashes between the police and a militant  section of the party. The conflicts frequently occur in the  village of Kuceviste in the Skopje region. Following an incident  there on New Year's Eve, the DPS declared at a press conference  that ``to the extent that discrimination against the Serbs is  not resolved in a democratic manner, we will be obliged to take  measures to protect ourselves, among which we will consider help  from our motherland.'' The party has also announced the forming  of a crisis staff and the organization of a referendum to  clarify Macedonia's status and the defining of the Serbs as a  constitutent (state-forming) people. A day earlier, on 15  January, there were calls in Kuceviste: ``Long Live Arkan!,''  ``Long Live Seselj!,'' and ``Serbia, Serbia!''    In such an atmosphere, the political evolution of the DPS  was  prolonged. Contacts were kept with Pahomije, the Serbian  Orthodox Bishop in Vranje, and demands were made for religious  services in Serbo-Croatian, even in villages with no Serbs. The  party also expressed its dissatisfaction with the 1991 census,  claiming that there were 200,000-300,000 Serbs in Macedonia,  instead of the official count of about 40,000.    ``A very unexpected development came in August 1993 when a  representative of the Macedonian Government, Internal Affairs  Minister Ljubomir Frckovski--whose resignation the DPS had  demanded in the wake of the `New Year's celebration' in  Kuceviste--signed an agreement with DPS leader Ristic to resolve  the disputed issue of the status of the Serbs in Macedonia. This  was also under the auspices of Gerd Ahrens, who was responsible  for ethnic issues in the framework of the Conference on the  Former Yugoslavia. One of the principal demands of the DPS was  the inclusion of the Serbs in the Constitution as a nation; this  was to be accomplished in 18 months.'' The agreement was soon  denounced by ```a radical current.''' This group became  stronger, and Ristic resigned, citing ```strong outside  influence in the creation of party policy, especially by the  Socialist Party and Radical Party, both from Serbia, as well as  from the Serbian Orthodox Church, whose five senile seniors from  the Holy Archepiscopal Synod are unable to recognize the  existence of the Macedonian people, the Macedonian nation, and  the Macedonian Orthodox Church.''    ``After the election of Dragisa Miletic as chairman of the  DPS, and after the party's short-lived turning toward the real  terrain where it found itself, the DPS returned to its old  coordinates. Whereas it had used the word `Macedonia,' it now  employs only `VJRM' [FYROM]; it does not respect basic human and  religious rights. The press conferences are held only for  journalists from the Serbian media who reside in Macedonia.''  Instead of entering the Constitution as a state-forming people,  there are accusations of ```ethnic and spiritual annihilation  and assimilation.''' For the new chairman, Miletic, ```The Serbs  in Macedonia are part of a nation whose president is Slobodan  Milosevic.'''  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The final, 1,200-word, article in the series, by ``V.R.,''  appears on 8 February on page 4, and is entitled ``Losing Ground  After the Elections.''    ``V.R.'' writes, the period from the beginning of 1990 until  the first multiparty elections (November-December 1990) was the  time for intensive registering of political parties. Seeing  their chance in the pluralistic environment, some playing the  card of democratic change, others appealing to national  feelings, in all about 20 parties emerged with their own  programs and candidates in the elections. The majority, however,  did not succeed in securing a place for their representatives,  either in the republic-level parliament or in the township  councils.`` The process of establishing new parties did not end  after the elections. On the contrary, many new parties were  registered and there were cases in which internal disagreements  or conflicts over ideas led to the formation of new parties with  almost the same names. At least on paper, some 60 parties now  exist.    One of the parties, which succeeded in winning two seats in  the republic-level parliament, a party that has probably now  been forgotten, according to the writer, by most Macedonians, is  the Party of Yugoslavs. Today, their representatives in the  assembly are Risto Kelesov, who won a majority in Kumanovo, and  Risto Stamenov, a candidate for the party from Strumica. The  party, which was registered at the end of May 1990, emphasized  at the time of the elections the need to maintain the integrity  of the Yugoslav federation. Since then, the Party of Yugoslavs  has held two congresses, the first in May 1991 and the second in  June 1993. At the second congress, the party issued a program  and statute and changed its name to Party of Yugoslavs in  Macedonia - Yugoslav Unionist Civic Alliance (PJM-JUGA).  Political groupings with similar programs and names can be found  today in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Today, the  main prescription of the party is reduced to pledging to restore  the Yugoslav federation in some form with mutual recognition of  all the former Yugoslav republics.    ``In the short period between the first and second rounds of  voting in the first multiparty elections, the so-called National  Front, comprising four nationalist parties--the VMRO-DPMNE,  MAAK, the People's Party of Macedonia (NPM), and the Party of  Peasants of Macedonia--briefly entered the scene. Today, much is  said about who profited and who lost in the formation of the  Front during the period of nationalistic euphoria. The NPM  evolved from the `United Macedonians' Association, which was  formed in February 1990. It held its first assembly the same  day, 12 April 1990, that the Law on Political Parties was  adopted. Its first, and as yet only, congress was held on 26 May  1991, and Vladimir Stefanovski was elected chairman. The new  party chose the name People's Party of Macedonia at that time.  According to Stefanovski, the NPM is nationalistic, but not  national-chauvinistic. The NPM does not spread enmity toward  others; it advocates love toward one's own nation.'' The NPM was  the first to use the sun emblem which is now used on Macedonia's  flag. Although the party now views joining the National Front as  a mistake, it was the initiator of the front. In the first round  of the elections, the NPM won 27,000 votes, or about two percent  of the total votes cast, placing it in eighth place among the 19  competing parties. When its agreement with the National Front  fell through, the NPM urged a boycott of the second round.  Today, the NPM's membership is about 2,000.    ``Another member of the National Front was the Democratic  Union - Party of Peasants of Macedonia. Based in the village of  Gorni Podlag in Kucani and Novo Selo in the Strumica region, the  party was registered at the beginning of June 1990. Dimitar  Galev was elected chairman.'' Disappointed at the election  outcome and the short-lived National Front, the party seems  inactive today.    ``The first party to register on the pluralistic Macedonian  scene was the Social Democratic Party of Macedonia. It came into  being with great ambitions, above all for the promotion of  social democracy in Macedonia and with a cadre of intellectuals  who would make their debut in the elections. Slavko  Milosavlevski was elected as the first chairman of the party.''  After the party's poor showing in the elections, it has become  rather inactive. The current chairman is Tihomir Jovanovski.    The writer concludes, considering the still unresolved  issues  of party financing and opportunities for conducting electoral  campaigns, the situation as Macedonia approaches the November  elections appears fluid, with some 60 parties now competing for  support.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / S&amp;P queries Lloyd's credit rating STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the leading US credit rating agency, has questioned the quality of the financial security of the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Mr John Gardner, managing director of S&amp;P's insurance ratings service, said: 'There is too much uncertainty regarding Lloyd's to apply a specific rating, but the insurance market does not appear to offer the highest level of security.' He added: 'All we are saying is it is not triple-A any more. There is no danger whatsoever of Lloyd's ceasing to to trade.' Mr Gardner's evaluation is based on public information. S&amp;P has not assigned Lloyd's a rating on its ability to pay claims as it did not have access to unpublished data. Lloyd's losses amount to more than Pounds 6bn in the last five years, while its capital base has fallen from Pounds 11.1bn to Pounds 8.7bn since 1990. It recently reported its worst-ever annual loss of Pounds 2.9bn for 1990. S&amp;P began analysing Lloyd's in 1991 and started a syndicate-evaluation service last year, monitoring the performance and financial strength of the more than 200 insurance syndicates which trade at the market. Several syndicates which received the lowest S&amp;P rating of one star have subsequently ceased to trade. Mr Gardner said that developments at Lloyd's over the last two years had been worse than S&amp;P had anticipated. He added: 'I don't think we had the slightest perception about how bad the losses were. Many people involved as underwriters and brokers have long regarded Lloyd's security as a non-issue, believing it to be immune from the kind of financial duress that can lead ultimately to policyholder claims not being met.' Mr Gardner said that in recent years 'rose-tinted' assumptions about Lloyd's future security had become 'untenable'. 'Lloyd's may provide good security, but as they say in the Scottish courts, the case is not proven.'</p>

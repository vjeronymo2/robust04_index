Recipient Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Prepare and evaluate bulk cultures of specific T lymphocytes and T cell clones from humans and/or non-human primates. Include evaluation of functional capabilities, phenotype, major histocompatibility complex restriction, and epitope specificity. Focus on understanding the role of T cells in protection against HPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Investigate the relative roles of cellular and humoral immunity in recovery from hantaviral disease in general and HPS in particular. Investigate the ongoing antibody response, T cell infiltrates in the alveolar septae of the lung in deceased patients, and the non-cytopathic replication of HPS viruses in causing disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In accordance with current hantavirus biosafety procedures, perform studies in appropriate BSL&hyph;3 and BSL&hyph;4 containment facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Analyze all results in collaboration with CDC. Present/publish all significant findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

(Not Weighted)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications are subject to Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications. Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC for each State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should send them to Edwin L. Dixon, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Room 314, Mailstop E&hyph;18, Atlanta, GA 30305. The due date for State process recommendations is 30 days after the application deadline date for new and competing continuation awards. (A waiver for the 60 day requirement has been requested.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process recommendations it receives after that date. Indian tribes are strongly encouraged to request tribal government review of the proposed application. If tribal governments have any tribal process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Edwin L. Dixon, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Room 314, Mailstop E&hyph;18, Atlanta, GA 30305. This should be done no later than 30 days after the application deadline date for new and competing continuation awards. The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for tribal process recommendations it receives after that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Health System Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 93.283.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Submission and Deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The original and two copies of the application, Form PHS&hyph;5161&hyph;1 (Revised 7/92), must be submitted to Edwin L.

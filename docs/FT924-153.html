			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Frankness makes gloomy read: The warnings in the leasing company's prospectus The extent of the difficulties facing GPA Group in securing a satisfactory agreement with its banks and aircraft manufacturers was spelt out in a prospectus issued in the US shortly before Christmas. Harris Investment Management, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based Harris banking group which bought Dollars 45m (Pounds 29.6m) of GPA notes in a private debt placement in June, recently exercised its right to enable the notes to be traded publicly. This forced GPA to file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, by the end of the year. The prospectus, which was filed on December 11, shows that the group's core business of leasing has suffered since the group was forced to abandon its Dollars 800m flotation in June. For the three months to June 30, 1992 - the latest publicly available figures - profits from aircraft leasing fell 54 per cent, from Dollars 24m in the same quarter the previous year to Dollars 11m. Since then GPA says it has suffered a 'general deterioration in the credit quality' of its leases. The prospectus goes on to warn that the current difficult environment in the civil aviation industry has resulted in the group having a higher proportion of non-revenue earning aircraft. At the end of November the group had 36 unleased aircraft and owned four McDonnell Douglas DC8-71 aircraft which were unavailable for lease, out of a total of 409 aircraft on its books. GPA was also recently forced to repossess 13 Boeing 737s from Vasp, the Brazilian airline, although some of these have already been released. To help lessees in financial difficulty, GPA has rescheduled some lease rentals for periods of four to 24 months. At the beginning of the month four lessees were being allowed deferrals of rent, maintenance and miscellaneous payments totalling Dollars 32m. The group's share of providing debtor-in-possession financing loans to America West Airlines, a customer of GPA which filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, is around Dollars 70m. According to the prospectus, 14.9 per cent of the group's 409-plus aircraft were not earning revenue. GPA's advisers yesterday pointed out that the prospectus contains 'the most pessimistic and gloomy' portrayal of the company and parts of it were already out of date. As of last Friday the company said only 34 aircraft were not earning revenue. It is confident it will find new leases for most of the aircraft still not not earning revenue. The group admits that it will make a loss for the half-year to the end of September and for the year ending March 1993. But it blames this loss primarily on the cost of cancelling its flotation, estimated at around Dollars 23m in legal fees, and the cost of the refinancing plan aimed at deferring up to Dollars 1bn of debt payments, expected to be more than Dollars 20m. Nonetheless, the information contained in the prospectus is likely to cause some concern to shareholders and lenders. Mr Jack Hersch, director of research at M. J. Whitman, the Wall Street firm specialising in bank debt trading, believes that the prospectus highlights the areas of concern for the core lenders. 'Given the problems facing its core business (leasing) the banks must be concerned with the company's ability to maintain the value of the collateral in a depressed aircraft market,' he said. GPA's financial advisers do not pretend that it is easy to conduct talks about its future with its creditors amid a deterioration in the airline and aircraft industry. However, they remain confident that final agreements on deferring billions of dollars of aircraft will be announced shortly. The prospectus warns that its talks with aircraft manufacturers are conditional upon GPA reaching agreement with its bankers regarding the restructuring of its borrowings and upon agreements with shareholders regarding new equity financing. It adds: 'There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or that the agreements will not be modified as part of the ongoing conditions.' Most of GPA's shareholders are still waiting for the talks with bankers and aircraft manufacturers to conclude before considering whether to take part in any future equity financing. One of GPA's shareholders said he reluctantly concurred with the prospectus that as things stand there is no assurance that the talks with bankers or aircraft manufacturers will be successful.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GPA: TWO QUARTERS COMPARED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Dollars m Qtrs ended June 30                  1991           1992            % 1991 and 1992                         Q2             Q2       change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- REVENUES Aircraft leasing                     176            221         +26% Aircraft sales                       297            541         +82% Fees, commission etc                   2             15        +650% GROSS PROFIT Aircraft leasing                      24             11         -54% Aircraft sales                        35             31         -11% Fees, commission etc                   3             18        +500% Sales and admin costs                 11             14         +27% Share of joint venture income         12              4         -67% Pre-tax income                        63             50         -21% (before minority interests)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: GPA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

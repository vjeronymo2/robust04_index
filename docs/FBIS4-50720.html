			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- Secretary-General Hsu  Shui-teh of the Kuomintang on Thursday [19 May] released an  article attributing Taiwan's political and economic achievements  to the able leadership of President Li Teng-hui.    Hsu wrote the article, entitled "Opening a New Era With  Wisdom and Courage," to mark the fourth anniversary of Li's  inauguration.    In the article, Hsu says Li has successfully led Taiwan in  pushing ahead with political reforms while maintaining high  economic growth during the past few years.    "Taiwan is now using its political success and economic  strength to make a breakthrough in the diplomatic arena and  exercise its influence in the mainland with its market-oriented  reforms," the article says.    Hsu said Li's major achievements have been implementing the  constitutional reforms initiated by the late President Chiang  Ming-kuo; adopting a flexible policy in order to expand Taiwan's  diplomatic arena and increase its presence in the international  community; and reducing cross-strait tension through increased  exchanges with the mainland.</p>

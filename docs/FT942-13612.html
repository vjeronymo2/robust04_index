			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Old glories as new - A company that restores everything from cups to crowns If by any chance you have an old master lurking about the house that could do with a good clean, a sculpture that has been bashed about or a fine piece of porcelain that has been spoilt by a chip, then Plowden &amp; Smith are the people for you. Restorers to many a royal palace and personage (they have just finished creating all the new mounts and settings for the crown jewels) there is scarcely a precious item that they cannot tackle. Plowden &amp; Smith specialises in repairing anything from a cracked cup to a more than life-size statue. They love a challenge and besides restoring the old and the bashed to the good-as-new they are also experts at producing immaculate copies of great works of art. The Middelham jewel, for instance, found near York about 10 years ago, declared part of the Queen's bounty, sold for Pounds 1.4m and now residing in York museum, left its finder feeling a bit bereft. Plowden &amp; Smith came to the rescue with a perfect copy for a fraction of the price. Then there are stately home owners who, strapped for cash, decide to sell a fine original sculpture, fountain or other heirloom and ask Plowden &amp; Smith to fill the gap with a replica. The original Warwick Vase, for instance, bought for Warwick Castle, 8ft high and around which a conservatory was specially built, was sold by the last Earl to the Burrell collection in Glasgow. The conservatory then looked forlorn without its pride and glory. Madame Tussaud, the new owner of Warwick Castle, commissioned a replica which now fills the gap. A visit to the workshops in Putney is like browsing through a museum. On the day I visited there was the hat Charles I gave to the people he stayed with on his way to his execution - wonderfully embroidered in green and pink with a metal thread running through it. Plowden &amp; Smith were fashioning a stand for it so it could be displayed. So impressed was I that I consigned two well-loved Mary Potter oils of my own to their tender care - both, they told me, needed cleaning (though I had not realised it, so slowly did all the dirt accrue). Seeing a cleaned and an uncleaned patch side by side showed me just what 20 years in London does to pictures - the newly cleaned pictures have gained life and vitality and are now protected by an invisible fine protective coating. They will mend frames and leather cases, mother-of-pearl bowls, avant-garde sculpture, (they are trying to get hold of human nails from a mortician for Pfeiffer, the American artist, who uses human hair and nails in his sculptures), metal-work, furniture. The workshop houses many different skills - for instance a military travelling companion, from 1815 and in a poor state of repair, needed work on the wood (from the furniture department), on the leather (decorative department), on the lock (metal-work), on the mother-of-pearl (also decorative department) and on the porcelain (ceramics). One of the remorseless bits of logic in the restoration world is that it costs as much to restore something of little value as something expensive because the labour and often the materials are the same. There is a minimum charge of Pounds 50 but otherwise estimates are always given in writing before any work is embarked upon. Estimates are largely worked out on the basis of the time it will take to do the work. And the strangest project? 'Without a doubt,' says Anna Plowden, 'it was to remove the mould from the human tattoos taken off French sailors at the end of the 19th century in the Dutch East Indies. We treated it just like leather.' Plowden &amp; Smith, 190 St Anne's Hill, London SW18. Telephone 081-874-4005.</p>

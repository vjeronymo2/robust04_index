			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Buthelezi wants more concessions Conservative Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday said the offer of a separate regional ballot, made to the right wing Freedom Alliance on Thursday, would not be enough to draw his Inkatha Freedom party into April's all-race elections. 'The double ballot by itself is quite meaningless if regions do not have the autonomy which cannot be interfered with by the constituent assembly,' he said. But he left the door open to further talks, saying the ballot compromise showed further concessions were possible. The ANC had previously insisted it would never drop its insistence that voters should have only one vote, for both national and regional assemblies. Faced with the threat of violence from the right wing, the ANC dropped this insistence. Thursday's offer to the Freedom Alliance was partly designed to call the bluff of Chief Buthelezi, who has recently implied the double ballot was the greatest obstacle to Inkatha participation. The ANC has demanded the chief commit himself to negotiate flexibly, before making further offers. The Freedom Alliance, government and ANC are to meet again Monday. One Alliance negotiator, Rowan Cronje of the Bophuthatswana homeland, yesterday suggested negotiations could go beyond Saturday's deadline, the date by which parties must register for elections. If Alliance parties register provisionally on Saturday, they could gain a further 20 days for talks before candidates' nominations are due. But though some parties may choose this route, it is unlikely Chief Buthelezi will do so.</p>

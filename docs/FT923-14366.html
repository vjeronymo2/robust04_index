			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexico's 'outstanding' oil find PETROLEOS MEXICANOS has discovered an offshore oil well described as having 'outstanding hydrocarbon reserves'. The well was found in the Sonda de Campeche sea area and is expected to produce about 14,000 barrels of crude a day and 2.6m cubic feet of gas. This is roughly double the average production of existing wells in the Sonda de Campeche. The well is located 95 km (60 miles) north-east of Ciudad Carmen and is 55 metres (180 feet) deep.</p>

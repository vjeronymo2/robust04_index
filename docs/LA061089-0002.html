			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR FINDS NO GROUNDS TO TRY OCEANSIDE OFFICIAL  </P> <P> A special prosecutor hired by the city of Oceanside will not seek charges  against Councilman Sam Williamson, who was accused by a political adversary of  violating the city's campaign ordinance during his reelection bid last  November.  </P> <P> After completing a seven-month investigation this week, Beatrice Kemp, a former  state deputy attorney general, said on Friday that there was insufficient  evidence to prove that the second-term councilman "willfully and knowingly"  violated the campaign laws.  </P> <P> "The ordinance demands that I prove he had demonstrated specific intent to  violate the campaign rules," Kemp said. "I looked at each of the allegations  and determined that I would not be able to amass enough evidence to prove there  was willful and knowing violation of the ordinance.  </P> <P> "Based on that determination, I decided not to prosecute," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conflict of Interest Cited  </P> <P> Kemp was hired after City Atty. Charles Revlett removed his office from the  case, citing a conflict of interest because of his familiarity with Williamson.  </P> <P> After he won reelection, Williamson was accused by Jim Willis, a rival  candidate, of failing to accurately disclose campaign donations and accepting  contributions exceeding the limits set by the city's campaign law.  </P> <P> Kemp declined to discuss the details of allegations made against Williamson and  said: "I don't see any reason to go line-by-line. Overall, I determined there  was not enough evidence to prosecute. I'm not going to talk about specifics."  </P> <P> But Kemp said there was no evidence that Williamson received contributions  exceeding the city limits. At times, however, the councilman did fail to report  donations in a timely manner, Kemp said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Report Listing Ralley Late  </P> <P> "For example, the cruise (a rally held on a charter boat to kick off  Williamson's campaign) was in July, but the report listing that item was filed  in January," Kemp said. "In between that time, three reports were filed. Did he  follow the strict letter of the law? No."  </P> <P> Earlier in the investigation, Kemp hinted that ambiguous language in the  ordinance could make prosecution difficult.  </P> <P> Williamson denied the allegations when they surfaced. The statute, adopted in  May, 1988, established campaign reporting requirements and curbed contributions  by an individual or an organization.  </P> <P> The ordinance states that no person can contribute more than $250 to a  candidate, and that no political action committee or any other organization can  give more than $500 to any candidate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Ill Feelings Toward Anybody'  </P> <P> "I don't have any ill feelings toward anybody," said Williamson, after his  exoneration. "I realize accusations were made, and as false as they were, I  realize the process demands that they be checked out. And it's been proven that  they were strictly untrue."  </P> <P> There was no evidence to substantiate charges that Williamson undervalued the  non-monetary contributions of the charter boat cruise and rental of his  campaign headquarters in a campaign disclosure form, according to Kemp.  </P> <P> Williamson had been accused of undervaluing items so that they would fall  within the limits of the campaign ordinance.  </P></p>

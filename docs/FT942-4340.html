			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Staff bodies to meet for anti-performance pay campaign Two of the most powerful staff representative bodies in the health service will meet next week to discuss a joint campaign against the introduction of performance pay, the annual consultants' conference of the British Medical Association was told yesterday, John Willman writes. Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA senior hospital doctors committee, said the government's plans to introduce performance pay were dangerous. Leaders of the BMA, which represents 80,000 doctors and surgeons, will join leaders of the 300,000-strong Royal College of Nursing in opposing the plans. Mr Chawner warned that allowing trusts to determine performance pay would end national salary scales because some would not be able to afford the cost of bonuses.</p>

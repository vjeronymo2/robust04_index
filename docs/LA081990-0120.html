			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIALIZED MEDICINE ISN'T THE ANSWER  </P> <P> Re "Shame on County's Doctors? No, Shame on State's Medi-Cal" (Letters, Aug.  12): Craig Myers has laser-pointed the entire society as the culprit of our  health-care system. Our society remains a frozen embryo typifying the '80s era  of wants without efforts.  </P> <P> Yes, everyone wants the best and latest medical care, but nobody wants to pay  for it.  </P> <P> However, doctors can no longer afford to shoulder what should be the society's,  and more specifically our county's, responsibility. Most people, though,  readily perceive that their medical expenses are too high but do not realize  how costly it is to operate a medical office or hospital. In my own office,  employee salaries, benefits and state-mandated assessments alone account for  nearly 40% of my gross income.  </P> <P> Since, as Myers pointed out, Medi-Cal pays hospitals an average of only 61%  (probably even less to doctors) of the cost, we must then make up the  difference from the others. The resultant escalation in health insurance costs  propels yet more people out of our health-care system.  </P> <P> No wonder many in our country are crying for some form of socialized medicine  even when the socialist societies are reaching out for a solution from  perestroika. However, to allow the politicians to control our health-care  system is like asking the Iraqi to protect Saudi Arabia from the Kuwaiti  Voluntary Army. Before we opt for socialized medicine, we must ask ourselves,  "Postal Service or Federal Express?"  </P> <P> DR. JOHN T. CHIU  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

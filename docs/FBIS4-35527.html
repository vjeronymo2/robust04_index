			<p>BFN     [Text] The first representatives of the Palestinian  Authority will arrive in Jericho next week. This was said by  sources in Jericho to our correspondent Moti Amir. Among those  arriving will be Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] and Nabil Sha'th.  Meanwhile, 18 offices for the use of the Palestinian Authority  members -- including an office for Yasir 'Arafat -- have been  completed in Jericho. Our correspondent notes that the  Palestinians will also set up a special office in Jericho for  handling the intifadah victims.    [Earlier on the same newscast, it is noted that "the closure  imposed on al-Ram yesterday -- after the security forces killed  the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist who has killed  Shin Bet officer No'am Kohen -- was lifted today."]</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Airbus welcomes chance for wider role - FT reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show The decision to form a military subsidiary for the European Airbus commercial aircraft consortium could speed up the transformation of Airbus into the Boeing of Europe. The move, announced yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show, is designed to integrate the European future large military transport aircraft programme (FLA) into the successful Airbus commercial aircraft manufacturing and development system. This integration would boost the FLA's chances in its competition against Lockheed of the US and its new generation Hercules transport aircraft. A decision is also expected to have broader implications for the restructuring and consolidation of the European aerospace industry. Airbus would gain access to the military market to match its bigger rival Boeing, whose defence operations account for around 20 per cent of its annual turnover. 'There is no better framework for the new military transport aircraft in Europe than Airbus,' said Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of Aerospatiale, the French company with a 37.9 per cent stake in Airbus. The creation of the military subsidiary for Airbus represented a 'tremendous chance and challenge' for Airbus, he added. Although Airbus has secured 30 per cent of the world's civil aircraft market, it is under increasing pressure from Boeing, which yesterday announced further moves to improve productivity and customer services. 'A challenge for Europe and Airbus is to become every day more competitive versus Boeing,' said Mr Gallois. The integration of the FLA project within the Airbus structure was one important step. Apart from broadening Airbus activities into the military sector, the proposal could also form the framework for expanding Airbus activities into other new commercial aircraft sectors. Moreover, it is positive news for new collaborative ventures with other international partners in programmes ranging from smaller turbo-prop and regional aircraft to the development of a new generation of 600 to 800 seat Jumbo jets. The new Airbus military subsidiary would enable other European companies currently not part of the Airbus consortium to participate in the European aircraft group. At present, Airbus partners include Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain. The new military subsidiary would also involve the participation of Alenia of Italy and the other associate partners in the FLA military transport project, including Belgian, Portuguese and Turkish aerospace companies which are not Airbus shareholders. Although Airbus partners are still in discussion with Boeing over collaborating on the possible joint development of a new super Jumbo, Airbus is this month also due to start marketing its own A3XX 600 to 800 seater Jumbo aircraft projects. This programme could involve a number of partners outside the consortium, and senior Airbus officials suggested these could be grouped into a separate Airbus subsidiary, similar to the military subsidiary Airbus is proposing for the FLA. At the same time, other subsidiaries could be set up to integrate the European regional turbo-prop and jet manufacturers in a market suffering from excess capacity and many competing projects. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, also confirmed the Airbus partners were setting up a separate financial company to support the company's sales and marketing drive, as well as proposing to create a new aircraft asset management group to monitor the worldwide Airbus fleet and remarket used aircraft. 'The development of an active market for used aircraft will play an increasingly important role for Airbus,' he said. While considerable political and institutional obstacles remain to the conversion of the existing Airbus structure into a public limited company, the establishment of a military subsidiary and, eventually, other subsidiaries, could open the way for a transformation of the Airbus system to reflect its main US rival, Boeing.</p>

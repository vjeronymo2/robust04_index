			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REASON AND RHETORIC ON FLAG BURNING AND FREE SPEECH  </P> <P> It is possible to love America and hate the flag. I love America because it has  taken great steps toward meaningful democracy, has taken in millions of  immigrants from less-fortunate nations and has, for the most part, allowed its  citizens to speak freely.  </P> <P> I hate the flag because it has become a shroud to conceal the crimes of  militarists, would-be kings, racists, deadbeats and ethnocentrism.  </P> <P> Through assiduous propaganda, American society has forged a false connection  between "support" for the flag and patriotism. True patriotism requires no  symbol, rather it is demonstrated and fulfilled by deeds.  </P> <P> The kind of patriotism that I associate with the flag is the kind to which  Samuel Johnson referred in saying, "Patriotism is the last refuge of a  scoundrel."  </P> <P> The danger to freedom is not from those who burn flags, but from those who wrap  themselves in them.  </P> <P> DAVE McCOMBS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

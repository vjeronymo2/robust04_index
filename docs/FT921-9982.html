			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: Wellies to keep you covered WELLY-Waders are designed to meet all welly needs in one fell swoop. The idea came to Nicholas Stafford-Deitsch one day when he went walking in the country in his usual country attire of wellies and anorak. It started to rain and he arrived home with the trousers above the welly and below the anorak cold, wet and uncomfortable. When he had dried out, he set about inventing the Welly-Wader. Its chief charm is that converts from being a standard-size welly into a thigh-high wader more or less in seconds. Anybody who spends days out and about in the country will see at once how useful this is. For those who walk or shoot, it means the area between the top of the boot and the bottom of the jacket can be protected if it starts to rain; for those who fish, the thigh-high extension protects them when they get into deeper water. The boot is made much like most good-quality wellies to which a PVC/polyester-lined fabric is welded. When the leggings are not at full stretch, they sit neatly round the top of the boot enclosed and protected by a poppered cuff. Its colour is - what else? - green. Stafford-Deitsch has patented the idea and the Welly-Waders are made specially for him in Denmark. They come with two different sorts of soles: cleated for everyday use, and with tungsten studs for those who might be wading in rivers with slippery stones. Sizes are 6-12 and they cost Pounds 54.95 for the cleated version and Pounds 64.95 with the tungsten studs, both prices inclusive of postage and packing. Buy them directly from the Edington Development Co., Dairy House Farm, Edington, Westbury, Wiltshire BA13 4NP (tel. and fax 0380-870-076). Traditional heavy-duty, galvanised-steel water butts, made in England and embellished with a cast-lead plaque are sold by Simon Griffiths of 16 Main Street, Kirby Muxloe, Leicester LE9 9AL (tel. 0533-393-594). All are exact copies of 17th and 18th century models (except for the fact that, originally, they were made of solid lead) and they can be ordered with or without tap or lid. The numbers and letters on the plaque itself can be altered to accommodate the year and the owner. Allow eight weeks for orders. Price from about Pounds 750 (carriage extra).</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abdallah Kuraydim: "Inauguration of New 'Asir </F> Provincial Government Building in Abha"]    [Text] Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the Saudi minister  of interior, the day before yesterday (Thursday) inaugurated the  new provincial government building of the province of 'Asir, and  those present during the inauguration included his deputy,  Prince Amad Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Prince Khalid al-Faysal,  governor of the province of 'Asir.    Construction of the building cost more than 140 million  Saudi  riyals [SR] ($37 million) and took six months, and the building  occupies a total area of 36,000 square meters. It consists of  six towers that are connected to a series of roads and other  buildings. Each tower is six stories high, and the building has  parking areas and is equipped with the latest in communications  technology, office equipment, computers, and informational  technology. The building is built in the style typical of the  province of 'Asir and its capital city Abha. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  has learned that the estimated total expenditures for the  building and its annexes was about SR310 million. The total was  this high because it was necessary to compensate the owners of  the real estate adjacent to the building, to prepare the ground  surrounding this area, and to increase the surrounding planted  green-belt area.    The office of Engineer Ziyad Zaydan supervised the  implementation of the project and worked on its architectural  designs. The firm that implemented the project was the al-  Buraydi Commercial and Contracting Corporation, and the  project's cost was SR80 million. The inside furnishing and  equipping of the building was done by the two firms Bayt  al-Riyad and Kawkash [name as transliterated], which were paid  SR40 million for the job. The design of the building  incorporated a new architectural concept that is in keeping with  Saudi Arabia's distinctive heritage and that has the ability to  develop and change from the architectural point of view in  accordance with future needs.    The complex consists of two parts--the provincial government  building and the building housing the principal auditorium for  meetings. The latter contains amphitheaters planted with thick  greenery in the form of a series of rising planted  amphitheaters, and it also has a reflecting pool and several  water fountains.    The total area of the province of 'Asir is 40,000 square km,  and the province has a total of about 700,000 inhabitants. The  city of Abha is located on a mountainous highland near the Red  Sea in the southern part of Saudi Arabia, it has a distinctive  climate, it is small and is characterized by a quiet life, and  it has many beautiful natural views. Abha is a rather  densely-packed city, is located in a saucer-shaped elevation,  and is surrounded by mountains and a green area, and there are  many winding streets and roads both inside the city and on the  sides of the highland area.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belgian foreign affairs minister has confirmed  that there have been Belgian civilian victims in the clashes in  Rwanda: Three Belgian civilians were killed on 7 April. This  was learned only today: The precise circumstances of their death  are not yet known.    Following on from these serious disturbances in Rwanda, and  in particular in Kigali, people sometimes wonder about the role  of the Belgian troops who have been there for several months as  part of the UN peacekeeping forces, as soldiers of UNAMIR [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda]. But, like all UN troops, these  Belgian soldiers have a very strict mandate from the United  Nations. On television this lunchtime in the (Mise au Point),  Foreign Minister Willy Claes stressed once again the extension  of the mandate of the UN forces in Rwanda:    [Begin Claes recording] I believe that we really were not  wrong when we sent the troops. We were one of those promoting  the peace process, and we have to back it up now. As far as I  am concerned, I think the mandate was too restricted, and we  need a thorough debate on the UN mandate, and therefore, on the  implementation of this over restrictive mandate. Also, the  weaponry was insufficient. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Farouk Chotia] </F>   [Text] Having lost his stranglehold over Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi last weekend issued thinly veiled threats to the  monarch, questioned his loyalty to the Zulu nation and projected  himself as being more powerful than the king.    By contrast, the ANC rallied to the defence of Zwelithini,  promising to protect him in the face of Buthelezi's "insults" by  enshrining his rights in the national constitution -- including  a guarantee that the IFP-controlled KwaZulu/Natal provincial  legislature would not have power to withhold his salary.    The 24-year relationship between Zwelithini and Buthelezi  has  reached a turning-point, with the nephew finally elbowing his  uncle off the royal throne in Nongoma.    Informed sources painted a picture of Zwelithini as fearing  Buthelezi. Said one source: "The king told the ANC delegation  at one of their meetings that he does not want to return to the  tyranny and terror he has faced. Those were his exact words."    An elated ANC Natal Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimande said  this week that Buthelezi has lost his two "main pillars of  support" -- the KwaZulu government and the king.    Buthelezi denied there was "any clash or argument of any  kind" between himself and the king. But he went on to accuse  the ANC of trying to "worm its way into the king's confidence".    Observers believe that without Zwelithini's backing, the  IFP's hand in upcoming constitutional talks will be considerably  weakened.    At a watershed rally in Umlazi last weekend Buthelezi  downplayed the significance of the monarch.    "The only way forward for the Zulu kingdom and for all the  people in KwaZulu/Natal will come from you, the members of the  IFP," he said.    Buthelezi revealed that the former KwaZulu government had  spent almost R7-million [rand] on Zwelithini's five palaces,  more than R2-million to provide him with labourers, more than  R500,000 to assist him in developing "modern farm undertakings"  and "to date we have actually spent over R4-million on securing  His Majesty's personal position and on supplementary  requirements around his person".    Stoking emotions of betrayal among IFP supporters, Buthelezi  told the crowd: "In a very real sense, this was your money. It  was the people's money ... It was money you, as ordinary people,  gladly forewent in favour of that money being spend on schools,  hospitals and health."    Buthelezi projected himself as being more powerful than  Zwelithini, saying he had "elevated" the monarchy to a position  "other Zulu kings have failed to achieve".    He added that he was also "behind the fact that Zwelithini  has emerged as a "modern" king. Buthelezi also raised the  possibility of another king in his lifetime, even though he is  65 years old and Zwelithini is 20 years younger. "I am loyal to  His Majesty and I will die being loyal to whichever Zulu king  walks in the footsteps of great Zulu kings ...," he said.    He also reminded the monarch that he would be reliant on the  KwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature for the "large budgets" he  would need to maintain his "kingly way of life".    To overcome the loss of the monarch, observers believe the  IFP could attempt to rebuild an alliance with the National Party  -- particularly its Western Cape region -- to demand greater  federal powers. Observers believe that the IFP's chances of  winning local government elections next year have also been  significantly reduced.    As a counter-strategy, Buthelezi may fight Zwelithini for  the  loyalty of chiefs through IFP-control of the KwaZulu/Natal  provincial legislature.    Sources said Zwelithini was determined to ensure that his  chiefs adopted a non-partisan role in the ANC-IFP conflict. He  fired the first salvo in this direction when he attended the  inauguration ceremony of a chief in Mtunzini shortly after the  April poll and voiced concern that some chiefs were "abusing"  their powers.    Sources revealed that moves were afoot to convene a private  meeting between several chiefs -- including ANC KwaZulu/Natal  parliamentarian chief Zibuse Mlaba and chief OT Xolo, a former  KwaZulu deputy minister who has ditched the IFP -- and  Zwelithini.    Sources said Zwelithini might also call a meeting of his  chiefs to encourage them to adopt a non-partisan role. Sources  also said that while Zwelithini had no plan to publicly denounce  Buthelezi, he would strip him of his status as "traditional  prime minister" by excluding him from the Royal Council he plans  to form to advise him on political and other issues.    The sources said a senior prince who has played a pivotal  role in encouraging the king to break away from Buthelezi was a  strong candidate for the post of traditional prime minister.    But Buthelezi has strongly suggested that even if the king  sacks him, he will continue to perform this function. At the  Umlazi rally, he claimed he was "born" to inherit the post.    To boost his claim, Buthelezi is increasingly interfering in  the politics of KwaZulu/Natal in his capacity as "traditional  prime minister", giving orders to the elected premier, Frank  Mdlalose. He has brought Gideon Zulu, a prince loyal to him,  into the provincial cabinet and pushed for Ulundi as the  province's capital with far greater vehemence than Mdlalose.    By having Ulundi as the capital Buthelezi hopes the IFP will  retain its image as a Zulu traditionalist party at a time when  Zwelithini has ditched them. Observers believe Zwelithini has  indicated his preference for Pietermaritzburg by attending the  opening of the provincial legislature in the city while  boycotting a ceremony where Buthelezi was to have "presented"  the KwaZulu/Natal cabinet to him.    At the weekend Buthelezi also set out to smash the king's  credibility among IFP loyalists by questioning Zwelithini's  decision to replace his KwaZulu bodyguards with members of the  Defence Force.    Sources said Zwelithini's changing of the guard had stung  Buthelezi the most: he has lost his eyes and ears in the Royal  House, making it possible for the monarch to convene what  Buthelezi called "clandestine" meetings with ANC leaders and  surround himself with non-IFP princes.    Buthelezi said the move had taken place before the election  when Zwelithini told him of a phone call he received from  ex-minister of foreign affairs Pik Botha, warning of "threats of  his life" and the need to "tighten up" security. Buthelezi  suggested that the King's life was now in danger.</p>

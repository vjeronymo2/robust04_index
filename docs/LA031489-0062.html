			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Today" co-anchor Bryant Gumbel and weatherman Willard Scott were in the same  studio Monday for the first time since the leak two weeks ago of Gumbel's  private memo that criticized Scott and others on the NBC show. No mention was  made of the much-publicized memo. The high-spirited Scott kissed Gumbel on the  cheek, then jovially needled him while talking about the different kinds of  animal foods made by the Purina company. "They make it for the complete horse,  so you wouldn't be interested," Scott said. Gumbel appeared somewhat  nonplussed. "I had to do something," the weatherman explained, laughing. Scott,  on vacation last week, had been scheduled to do his part of Monday's show from  Washington. But "Today" executives decided to bring him to New York  instead.ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Motor trade deficit soars THE TRADE deficit in the motor industry almost trebled last year to Pounds 2.8bn from Pounds 1bn in 1991 under the impact of a sharp rise in the value of imports. Automotive products ac-counted for a fifth of the total UK visible trade deficit of Pounds 13.8bn and for more than a third of the Pounds 7.6bn deficit last year on manufacturing exports. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was 'likely to be some time' before the full effects of sterling's devaluation would be felt in the industry's trade balance. Devaluation had enhanced the competitiveness of UK products, it said, but exporters had been unable to take full advantage of the improvement 'because of the contraction in many of the main UK export markets'. The value of motor industry exports rose by 3 per cent last year to almost Pounds 11.1bn, but was overshadowed by an 18 per cent rise in the value of imports to almost Pounds 13.9bn. In the final quarter of the year the motor industry trade balance fell into a deficit of Pounds 226m compared with the short-lived surplus of Pounds 121m achieved in the corresponding period a year earlier, the first quarterly trade surplus since the early 1980s. The society said the recent trend in exports of automotive products had been 'more encouraging' with an 11 per cent increase in the value of export earnings in the final quarter to Pounds 3.2bn. But this improvement was also offset by an acceleration in the value of imported automotive products in the final quarter, which rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 3.4bn. There was a sharp improvement in car exports in the final quarter of last year with a 34 per cent rise in value to Pounds 1.4bn and a 22 per cent year-on-year increase in volume. For the whole of last year the value of car exports rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 4.06bn, but the volume of exports declined by 3 per cent. The improvement in the final quarter reflected in particular higher exports by Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, and by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, which started production last autumn of a second model range at its Sunderland assembly plant. The deterioration in the motor industry trade balance last year and in the final quarter was caused above all by the sharp increase in the value and volume of imports of cars and parts and accessories. Car imports rose by 20 per cent in value to Pounds 6.5bn and by 15 per cent in volume to 942,020. The value of imports of parts and accessories rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 6bn. Exports of parts and accessories rose by 4 per cent to nearly Pounds 5bn.  ----------------------------------------         UK MOTOR TRADE (Pounds M)             January-December  ----------------------------------------                  Exports  ----------------------------------------                            1992      1991  ---------------------------------------- Cars                      4,064     3,872 Comm. vehicles              899       829 Parts and accessories     4,956     4,766 Others*                   1,156     1,250  ----------------------------------------                  Imports  ---------------------------------------- Cars                      6,543     5,453 Comm. vehicles              775       595 Parts and accessories     6,013     5,192 Others*                     536       482  ---------------------------------------- Trade balance  ---------------------------------------- Cars                     -2,479    -1,581 Comm. vehicles             +124      +234 Parts and accessories    -1,057      -426 Others*                    +620      +768 Total balance            -2,792    -1,005  ---------------------------------------- *Includes agricultural tractors, dumpers, trailers, caravans, industrial works trucks and freight containers.  ---------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and Customs and Excise  ----------------------------------------</p>

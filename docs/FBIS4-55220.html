			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kalina Stancheva] </F>   [Text] [Stancheva] The cabinet meeting ended a few moments  ago. Prime Minister Berov thinks that against the background of  the support he had in overcoming the five no-confidence motions  proposed so far by the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], the  sixth such motion will have the same fate. This opinion,  expressed by Professor Berov at the cabinet meeting, was  reported by his spokesman. It was also reported that since the  prime minister has not yet submitted to the National Assembly  his proposed personal and structural changes in the cabinet, the  no-confidence motion debate will apparently precede those  changes, unless the National Assembly decides differently when  it adopts its agenda. [passage omitted]    The topic of allowing foreign equipment to cross Bulgarian  territory recently became a permanent item on the cabinet  meetings' agenda. This time the relevant commission, in which  representatives of several ministries participate, submitted,  and the cabinet approved, a text which proposes to the National  Assembly to adopt the following provisional decision, until the  Constitutional Court rules on the matter:    Except in cases related to the stay or passing of foreign  troops on or through Bulgarian territory, something that  requires the permission of the National Assembly, noncombat  flights of foreign aircraft will be allowed in accordance with  the provisions of the Law on Civil Aviation. The entrance of  foreign vessels or submarines in Bulgarian territorial waters,  or visits to open ports, will be allowed in accordance with the  Law on Sea Territory. In other words, in both cases the  decision will be adopted by the executive power.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Surprise interest rate cut boosts markets The Bank of Spain yesterday sent the markets soaring and bolstered the peseta with a surprise quarter-point rate cut that brought the benchmark intervention rate down to 8.75 per cent, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The cut came as unions planned to bring the country to a standstill in a 24-hour general strike tomorrow. The move apparently reflected confidence by the monetary authorities that domestic recession has bottomed out, that headline inflation, which stood at 4.9 per cent last month, will fall to 3.5 per cent later this year and that currency turmoils are unlikely in coming months. The Madrid Bolsa index, which has been gaining in the past months, rose to a record 343.81 high before easing to close at 342.94, up from 339.01 on Monday. The peseta, under pressure following the Banesto bank crisis, had by late afternoon strengthened to Pta80.93 to the D-Mark. World Stock Markets, Page 41</p>

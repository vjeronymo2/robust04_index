			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fertilizer Subsidy Was Increased </F> 17-80 percent"]    [Text] The coalition government, which did not want to  raise the price of fertilizer prior to the elections, has  implemented the second subsidy for fertilizer. After the  increase on January 15, the amount of subsidy the producing  companies received for nine different kinds of fertilizer was  increased by 17-80 percent. After the rescission of the price  hike for fertilizer in December the second subsidy increase was  adopted for fertilizer producers so that the increase in foreign  currency exchange would not be reflected in prices.    The subsidy increase, which was implemented so that farmers  could buy affordable fertilizer, will be applied in the spring  to the nine most commonly used kinds of fertilizer. The  decision of the Council of Ministers regarding the subsidy  increase, which is applied to nine different kinds of  fertilizers, and the increase, which fluctuates from 17 to 80  percent, was published in yesterday's RESMI GAZETE [OFFICIAL  JOURNAL].    According to the publication, the subsidies of the ammonia  sulfate went from 475 to 855 lira and triple super phosphate  went from 700 to 2000 lira. In addition to this, the subsidies  of ammonium sulfate rose from 270 to 770 lira, ammonium nitrate  from 620 to 1060 lira, urea from 500 to 950 lira, diammonium  phosphate from 1250 to 2000 lira, "20.20.20" composition  fertilizer from 1000 to 1350 lira, and the "15.15.15"  composition fertilizer to 1390 lira.</p>

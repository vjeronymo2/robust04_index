			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The perception that this rule will lead to unlimited imports with a resulting decline in llama and alpaca values is not supported by our current information. As previously discussed in this rulemaking document, llamas and alpacas from Chile will undergo a quarantine of at least 30 days at an APHIS quarantine facility at a port listed in &sect;92.403. While allowing these animals to enter though a facility other than HSTAIC could allow greater numbers of llama and alpaca imports from Chile, this rule will not permit unlimited imports. Currently, the only animal import center that would be able to accommodate more than a few llamas and alpacas at a time is the New York Animal Import Center (NYAIC) in Newburgh, New York. Realistically, NYAIC could handle at most 1,200 llamas and alpacas per year. Keeping in mind that there are already over 70,000 llamas in the United States, we do not believe that the addition of 1,200 llamas per year would cause such a rapid decline in U.S. llama and alpaca prices as to have a significant adverse effect on the U.S. market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our research shows that import demands favor and will continue to favor high-quality llamas and alpacas. The U.S. llama and alpaca market has been in decline since about 1989. The market volatility exhibited by the U.S. llama industry, including extraordinarily high prices as well as dramatic price declines, is characteristic of a new and growing industry. However, the 1993 auction year saw solid prices and some very strong sales. In the Spring Celebration Sale, which was reported to have the highest averages for any consignment sale, the females averaged $9,185 and the males averaged $6,485. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Also, it was reported that, at a 1993 auction of llamas from Peru, the highest quality llamas were sold within 60 seconds. These reports, and others, indicate the growing ability of U.S. llama breeders to discern between superior and inferior animals. They also indicate the increase in market maturity and greater selectivity on the part of breeders, resulting in firmer price levels. In short, according to market reports, prices seem to be stabilizing of their own accord. We expect that the long-term impact of importing more foreign breeding stock, which will increase selection and improve the domestic herd, will help stabilize and ultimately enhance llama and alpaca prices_not depress them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Llama Life, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Winter 1993&hyph;94, Number 28, pp. 1 and 34.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter noted that the proposal's regulatory flexibility analysis appears to relate solely to llamas, but that llama and alpaca statistics on number of animals, breeders, prices, and imports are very different. Our research indicates that the U.S. alpaca industry is in much the same position as the U.S. llama industry was in several years ago_a new and growing industry. The U.S. alpaca herd is considerably smaller than the U.S. llama herd, and alpacas command higher prices than llamas. However, we do not believe the impact of this rule on the U.S. alpaca industry will differ significantly from the impact on the U.S. llama industry for the reasons previously discussed in this rulemaking document. Most alpaca owners will be purchasing additional alpacas for breeding purposes, and the availability of high quality imported alpacas will benefit the industry by improving the domestic herd.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asked for a restriction which would limit the number of llamas and alpacas imported from Chile each year to 100 animals per importation and only two importations per year. The commenter suggested that this restriction be in effect for 5 years, after which time the economic stability of the U.S. llama industry could be reevaluated to determine if the market can handle an influx of Chilean llamas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated previously in this rulemaking document, we do not expect this rule to result in importations of llamas and alpacas from Chile on a scale that would flood the U.S. market. Although we consider the economic impact of our regulations in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, we do not have statutory authority to establish regulations for the purpose of stabilizing the U.S. market for llamas and alpacas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters disputed APHIS' assertion that the regulations concerning use of HSTAIC are excessively burdensome. Among the requirements for importing animals through HSTAIC (found in &sect;&sect;92.430 and 92.522), an importer must participate in a lottery to allocate space in the facility for each calendar year. In the past, we have received approximately 230 applications to use HSTAIC during a particular calendar year. Of the total number of applicants, only two or three may actually be able to use HSTAIC in a given year. Further, use of HSTAIC is expensive_it generally costs $1,092 per head for an importation of llamas or alpacas through HSTAIC. As cited in the proposed rule, importers will save approximately $700 per head by shipping llamas and alpacas though a U.S. animal import center other than HSTAIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements for use of HSTAIC are not excessively burdensome when disease concerns warrant the high security quarantine offered there. However, given the FMD-free status of Chile and the other countries listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;94.1(d)(1), and given the findings of the Argentine study on FMD in llamas and alpacas, the requirements are in excess of those that are necessary to prevent the introduction of communicable diseases of livestock into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhaya: ``AES Will Charge You Up With </F> Health'']    [Text] I've got a bean-sized capsule on my palm. It has a  microprocessor inside. This little ``bean'' is called a  self-contained electrostimulator (AES). It's a unique  article--you can't find anything else like it in the world--that  came into being through the joint efforts of medical specialists  (chiefly surgeons) and electronic specialists over a decade ago.  But only doctors and patients of the elite clinic of the Health  Ministry's Main Administration No. 4 knew about it. Today the  AES is becoming available to simple mortals.    Electrostimulation has already been used extensively for a  long time in different areas of medicine. But it was a long time  before the simple of idea that the body needed to be acted upon  by electric pulses from within came into someone's mind. It was  this idea that was brought to life by the creators of this  electronic pill--the AES.    As we know, the central nervous system generates certain  pulses with which all organs are controlled. The moment some  breakdown, or ``error'', occurs in this body control system, a  particular disease arises. The task of the AES is to travel  through the whole body (10 meters of intestines) in 25-36 hours,  find the damaged or ``sleeping'' components, and awaken  them--activate them and restore their operation by means of  electric pulses. After this the capsule is eliminated from the  body in the natural way.    This electronic pill was initially intended for use chiefly  in surgery. The probability of complications--paralysis or  paresis of the intestine--is high after any complex abdominal  operation. Surgeons know all too well how high mortality  following such complications is. Consequently it was no accident  that several of our most prominent surgeons (including  Academician Petrovskiy at the Surgical Institute and Professor  Lukomskiy at Medical Institute No. 1) were among the first to  actively begin using the AES in therapeutic practice.    Having undergone the required clinical tests in the  country's  leading clinics, the AES began to be used in the Fourth  Administration's closed clinics in 1984. The cherished capsules  were made at a certain military plant in limited quantities,  because they are very expensive, as is true by the way of any  complex microelectronic device. Nonetheless, over a period of 10  years the pill was used around 2 million times to treat  thousands of patients. Among its regular users were certain  ``ruling elite'' whose faces were seen every day on official  documentary footage.    No side effects were established for the AES. And new  miraculous properties of the magic capsule were continually  discovered.    It was found that the besides having a local effect on the  most highly damaged components (parts of the intestine, the  liver, or duct systems), the AES has a powerful influence upon  the entire body as a whole, in a sense enlivening some  ``sleeping'' forces in the individual. The body undergoes  detoxification--wastes are eliminated from it. Circulation  improves, and immunity and performance increase. In serious  stressful situations the electronic pill relieves depression and  fatigue, and raises vital tone. It is therefore absolutely no  surprise that the capsules were so popular among our elderly  government officials.    Prolonged use of the AES confirmed that stimulation helps to  reveal chronic prostatitis complicated by impotency. Research  conducted by Professor Balabolink at the Endocrinology Institute  revealed that lipid metabolism indicators normalize in the  presence of sugar diabetes (the non-insulin dependent form). One  of the most important results of the work of the electronic pill  is its positive effect upon hypertension and atherosclerosis.  Finally, the AES proved itself to be indispensable in military  field surgery and in emergency medicine--there are times when  only the stimulator can revive a person from a coma or shock.    Let me emphasize one more time: The AES does not introduce  anything foreign into the body, anything alien to it, because  the pulses the pill produces already exist in the individual,  and are generated by our nervous system.    Research on electrostimulation is continuing. Judging from  everything, new surprises await us in the future. But it is  already clear that the AES affects aging processes. There are  serious grounds for suggesting that it can and must be used to  prevent oncological diseases. It is becoming increasingly more  obvious to medical specialists that the electronic pill is  essentially needed by everyone. Nonetheless, the future of this  miracle of micro-engineering is under great doubt.    As often happens in our country with any innovation, the  electronic capsules are having a hard time making their way to  the people. The O.K. to make wide use of the AES was obtained  with the help of the Medical Equipment Administration of the  Russian Ministry of Health. But the Fourth Administration--the  chief user of the electronic pill--no longer exists. Practically  no one in other clinics knows about it, and hospitals don't even  have enough money for the most elementary medicines, not to  mention microelectronics. Converted enterprises of the  military-industrial complex have lost their former might, and  each day new problems are faced in production of the  electrostimulators, which is currently being conducted by the  Ecomed Scientific-Production Association.    The existence of the AES has already long been known beyond  the borders of our fatherland, and the innovation has been given  its proper assessment. It is fully possible to sell the  discovery there--buyers could be found right now. And no one  would be especially amazed by such a sale--the world has already  become accustomed to our practice of selling off our unique  technologies and inventions generously for a pittance. However,  today's creators of the electronic pill, who invested many years  of their lives into it and who are deeply convinced that this is  to be the medicine of the 21st century, stubbornly want to save  their invention for Russian fellow citizens. Such are the  strange people who are caring for this fabulous electronic bean.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] With regard to the reasons that necessitated a  cabinet reshuffle, Information Minister Dr. Jawad a-'Anani has  said:    [Begin al-'Anani recording] We all know that His Majesty  King Husayn is eager to have strong cooperation between the  legislative and executive authorities. In order to promote the  Jordanian economy and upgrade the level of its performance and  achievement, and also to work out the appropriate legislation  required by the coming phase, stronger cooperation between the  legislative and executive authorities must be effected. This  explains the primary reason for the cabinet reshuffle and the  nature of this reshuffle.    Moreover, we know that the entire region will witness  developments that have begun to surface as a result of the peace  process and the events taking place in the region. In fact,  this will basically make Jordan the focus of attention. Jordan  will have a clear and effective role in these events. This  requires us to pool, unify, and concentrate all our resources  and direct them toward continuously making Jordan a strong and  impregnable country under its Hashemite leadership. In brief,  these are the most important reasons for the cabinet reshuffle.  [end recording]</p>

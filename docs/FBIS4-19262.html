			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Riitta Vainio: "Used T-72 Tanks Need Extensive </F> Renovation"]    [Text] Niinisalo--The used East German T-72 tanks left over  in East Germany and purchased by Finland are in need of  extensive renovation. According to general staff estimates, it  would cost more to thoroughly overhaul the tanks than it would  to buy new ones.    So far, new radio equipment has been added to the  Russian-made tanks in Finland.    In the summer of 1992 Finland bought not quite 100 used T-72  battle tanks from Germany. Prior to that, Finland had bought the  same kind of tanks from Russia, which has already updated its  own tanks by adding shielding, among other things, to them.  <H5>  Finland Was Biggest Buyer </H5>   Germany sold the tanks because they were not compatible with  the NATO equipment used by the German armed forces. It would  have cost nearly as much to scrap the tanks in Germany as  Finland paid for them. Finland used to be the biggest buyer of  East German weapons.    According to the experts, the T-72 is slow in comparison  with  the latest Western tanks and its cannon has a shorter range. The  most recent comparison was made during the Persian Gulf war.    According to the General Staff Ground Forces Department,  there is not yet a concrete plan for renovating them. However, a  long repair list has been outlined. The most important item is  an increase in firing effectiveness. The tank's ability to  operate in the dark has to be improved, its armor has to be  increased, its communications equipment replaced, and its  shielding improved.    The general staff nevertheless emphasizes that the T-72 is  fully serviceable even in its present condition.    The purchase of these used tanks from Germany two years ago  was justified, among other reasons, by the fact that the tanks  were in good condition and that some of them were later models  than the T-72's previously purchased from Russia.</p>

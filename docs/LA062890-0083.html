			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOUISIANA;  </P> <P> 'TOUGHEST' ABORTION LEGISLATION PASSED  </P> <P> The Louisiana House gave final approval to what is considered the toughest  anti-abortion legislation in the nation and sent it to Gov. Buddy Roemer.  </P> <P> It would allow abortion only to save the life of the mother and decrees prison  terms of up to 10 years at hard labor for doctors who perform other abortions.  Roemer has said he will veto the bill because it bans abortion in cases of rape  or incest. Each side contends it has the votes to prevail in any attempt to  override a veto.  </P></p>

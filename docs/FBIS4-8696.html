			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Popularity of Party List Leaders"] </F>   [Text] Compared to February, 4 percent more people were  able to decide in March whom they would welcome as government  head out of 10 party list leaders. Gyula Horn's advantage  increased by the same proportion, which is a little higher than  the incidental fluctuation, while the other changes are within  the error margin, this can be learned from the latest Median  public opinion survey that was carried out under MAGYAR HIRLAP's  commission [between 18 and 23 March on a sample of 1,200 adults].    The electors' knowledge about the main actors in politics is  increasing. In January hardly any of the surveyed people were  able to identify the party affiliation of all 10 list leaders,  while the proportion of the fully informed people increased to  11 percent by March. Only the knowledge about the party  affiliation of Zoltan Kiraly [chairman of the Social Democratic  Party of Hungary, MSZDP] did not increase. More than 700,000  people (9 percent) learned the name of Gabor Kuncze [list leader  for the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] between February and  March, 5 percent of people learned the name of Tamas Nagy  [chairman of the Agrarian Federation], and the generally  well-known politicians also became somewhat better known. All  this means that the campaign has an effect on people and an  increasing number of them are paying attention to the political  actors.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Who Should Be the Prime Minister of the Next Government?

Out of the 10 list leaders, the popularity of six  decreased to a lesser or greater extent, especially among those  people who do not want to vote for the party of the given list  leader in May, and among those who do not yet have an  established party preference. Therefore, as knowledge about the  politicians is increasing, views on them are becoming more  polarized.    The scandal at the radio probably damaged Peter Boross's  popularity. Two-thirds of people were informed about this case,  and two-thirds of these people considered the dismissals unjust.  Among these people, the prime minister's popularity is 14  points lower than among those who do not have an opinion on this  event, and 22 percent lower than among people who considered the  dismissals rightful. The popularity of [Republic Party  Chairman] Janos Palotas and Zoltan Kiraly has also faded.  Rather than their popularity benefiting their parties, the fact  that they entered the election battle heading relatively small  parties seems to have damaged their prestige.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Popularity of Party List Leaders Among Those Who Know the Politician, March 1|  |994 (percent)                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |                         |Change                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gyula Horn               |63                       |+1                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Janos Palotas            |59                       |-5                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Viktor Orban             |56                       |-1                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gabor Kuncze             |55                       |-3                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zoltan Kiraly            |55                       |-5                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Laszlo Surjan            |54                       |-3                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peter Boross             |47                       |-5                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tamas Nagy               |47                       |-5                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jozsef Torgyan           |31                       |-2                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Istvan Csurka            |26                       |+1                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      With the help of cluster analysis, people who were able to  asses the majority of politicians can be put into five  categories. Cluster analysis is a mathematical-statistical  method that classifies people in such a way that the difference  should be minimal between those who are in one group on the  basis of their sympathy for list leaders, while the difference  between the groups is maximal. The members of the various  groups differ in their political views and their tastes. People  in the same group are mainly similar to each other in their  receptiveness to a political style.    People who do not reject any of the politicians are in the  first group. Even the assessment of Jozsef Torgyan [chairman  of the Independent Smallholders Party, FKGP] and Istvan Csurka  [cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] are  average. These people obviously respect the fame and authority  of politicians. The proportion of this group in the electorate  is 25 percent. This type is somewhat more common (30 to 33  percent) among people living in villages, in the 50 to 59 age  group, the voters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], and  those who do not have established party preferences. The same  proportion (23 percent) of this group would like to see Horn as  prime minister as Boross.    For the second group, the opposition politicians -- except  for Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats,  Fidesz] -- are generally attractive. The popularity of Horn is  exceptionally high, while the government members are unpopular,  and Torgyan and Csurka are the two most disagreeable list  leaders. These people are influenced by left-wing sentiment in  their views on the politicians and they presumably reject the  frightening, authoritarian, and extreme attitudes. Their  proportion is also 25 percent. This way of thinking is somewhat  more common (30 to 38 percent) among people in Budapest, those  between the ages of 40 and 49, and university graduates. Some  52 percent of MSZP supporters and 36 percent of SZDSZ supporters  are in this group. Sixty percent of these people would welcome  Horn as prime minister and 16 percent would welcome Kuncze.    The popularity marks of Orban, Palotas, and Kuncze are  higher  than the average in the third group while the prime minister and  especially the chairmen of the MIEP and the FKGP are very  unpopular. These people obviously are open to liberal politics  and reject the political style based on emotions. Their  proportion is 22 percent but this is somewhat higher (27  percent) among people between the ages of 30 and 39 and among  middle-school graduates. Some 45 percent of Fidesz voters and  37 percent of SZDSZ voters belong to this group. Similar  proportions of this group (20 percent each) would like to see  Horn, Kuncze, Orban, and Palotas as prime minister.    For the fourth group, only Boross and Laszlo Surjan  [chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party, KDNP] are  acceptable politicians. They respect authority, they are  pro-government, but they reject the extreme right-wing attitude.  Their proportion is 17 percent, but one-third of pensioner age  people can be found here. Forty-seven percent of MDF voters and  43 percent of KDNP voters belong here. Boross would be welcome  as prime minister by 45 percent of them and Surjan by 11 percent.    Finally, the fifth group consists of people among whom  Torgyan and Csurka are exceptionally popular, but Boross's and  Surjan's popularity is also above the average. The majority of  these people feel antagonistic toward the other list leaders.  They are obviously influenced by their right-wing attitude in  assessing the politicians, and they are susceptible to a  political style that affects the emotions. Their proportion is  11 percent. Very few people from Budapest or those with higher  education (3 to 6 percent), while 22 percent of the unemployed  are in this group. More than half of the FKGP's and MIEP's  supporters belong here. Torgyan is seen by one-third of them as  suitable to lead the new government, Boross by one-quarter,  Surjan by 10 percent, and Csurka by 6 percent.</p>

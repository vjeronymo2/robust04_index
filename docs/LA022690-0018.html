			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> U.S. SENIORS RALLY AFTER SLOW START  </P> <P> Don Bies set the pace with his three-under-par 69 as the United States rallied  from a slow start Sunday at Sarasota, Fla., to win its third consecutive  Chrysler Cup.  </P> <P> The U.S. seniors beat the International team in four of eight final-round  matches and tied three for a 53.5-30.5 victory at the Tournament Players Club  at Prestancia.  </P> <P> The Internationals began the day needing to win five matches for a victory, but  they won only one.  </P> <P> The first seven U.S. players to tee off bogeyed the opening hole. That included  Bies, who quickly fell two shots behind Roberto DeVicenzo in the first match of  the day but rallied with five birdies to win, 69-72.  </P> <P> In the second twosome, Dave Hill of the United States had three birdies in the  final seven holes to beat Bob Charles, 70-72.  </P> <P> The other U.S. winners were Lee Trevino, who breezed past Peter Thomson, 69-83,  and Chi Chi Rodriguez, who beat Billy Dunk, 73-77.  </P> <P> Ken Green shot a one-over-par 72 on the Royal Hong Kong golf course and won the  Hong Kong Open by four strokes.  </P> <P> Green, a Ryder Cup player from West Palm Springs, Fla., had a tournament total  of eight-under par 205 in the 54-hole tournament that was shortened because of  rain.  </P> <P> Tied for second at 209 were Brian Watts and Danny Mijovic of Canada. They also  shared the day's best score at four-under-par 67.  </P></p>

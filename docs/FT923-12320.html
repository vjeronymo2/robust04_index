			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Legitimate defence Sir, In your edition of July 9, you published a photograph of a policeman pointing a pistol at a French truck driver at the wheel of his vehicle. Because the caption did not make it clear, it should be said that the policeman was not the aggressor. The truck driver had in fact been threatening to run him down, and the policeman's action was therefore a legitimate defence. Paul Quiles, Minister of the Interior and Public Security, Place Beauvaux, Paris 8e</p>

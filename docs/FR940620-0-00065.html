			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a primary tool for the review of the quality of emission inventory submittals, the USEPA has developed three levels (I, II, and III) of emission inventory quality assurance review checklists. The Level I and II reviews are used to determine that all required components of the base year emission inventory and its associated documentation are present. These reviews also evaluate the level of quality of the supporting documentation and data provided by the State and assess whether the emission estimates were developed according to current USEPA guidance. The Level III review evaluates 10 crucial aspects and the overall acceptability of the emission inventory submittal. Failure to meet one of these crucial aspects would lead to disapproval of the emission inventory submittal. The 10 crucial requirements of the emission inventory submittal are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. An Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) must be submitted by the State and approved by the USEPA. In addition, a Quality Assurance (QA) plan contained within the IPP must have been implemented and documented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The emission inventory submittal must contain adequate documentation showing the procedures and input data used and the input data sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The point source portion of the inventory must be complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated in accordance with current USEPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The area source portion of the inventory must be complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The area source emissions must have been calculated in accordance with current USEPA policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The biogenic emissions must have been calculated using USEPA's PC-Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (PC-BEIS) or other equivalent techniques in accordance with current USEPA guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) estimates used in the calculation of on-road mobile source emissions must have been developed in accordance with USEPA guidance and must have been adequately documented in the inventory submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The MOBILE emission factor model must have been correctly applied to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Non-road mobile source emissions must have been prepared in accordance with current USEPA guidance for all of the non-road source categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The base year emission inventory may be approved if it passes the Level I, II, and III reviews. Detailed Level I and II review procedures and questions can be found in the ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 27, 1992. Level III review procedures and criteria are specified in a memorandum from David Mobley, Emission Inventory Branch, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to the Chief of the Regulation Development Branch, Region V, et. al., title ``Final Emission Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,'' October 7, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing and submitting SIP revisions, including the base year emissions inventory submittal. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each SIP revision submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Final approval of the emissions inventory will not occur until the State revises the emissions inventory to address public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Indiana's Emission Inventory Submittals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 15, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) submitted the final, adopted base year ozone precursor emissions inventories for the Evansville, Louisville, and South Bend/Elkhart ozone nonattainment areas. On February 14, 1994, the City of Indianapolis (acting for the State of Indiana) submitted the final, adopted base year ozone precursor emissions inventory for the Indianapolis ozone nonattainment area. The emission inventory submittals cover the emissions of VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO for the following ozone nonattainment areas: Evansville (Vanderburgh County); Indianapolis (Marion County); Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart (Elkhart and St. Joseph Counties). (The emission inventories for Lake and Porter Counties, the only other ozone nonattainment areas, will be addressed in a separate rulemaking action.) In addition to emissions from the ozone nonattainment areas, the submittals also cover VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO emissions from major stationary sources (with actual emissions for any of the covered pollutants equal to or in excess of 100 tons per year) in all counties located within 25 miles of the ozone nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to developing the base year emission inventories, the State of Indiana developed an IPP as required by the USEPA. This IPP was approved by the USEPA in March 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions contained in the emission inventories cover the general source categories of stationary point sources (or simply point sources), area sources, on-road mobile sources, off-road mobile sources, and biogenic sources. Emission inventory summary tables in the submittal include a more detailed source category breakdown as requested by the USEPA. All emission summaries were accompanied by documentation covering the sources and values of input data and by sample calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine up-to-date point source emissions, the State and the City of Indianapolis, respectively, sent emission inventory questionnaires to all facilities contained in the State's Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) and to all sources which hold an air emissions permit issued by the State or by the City of Indianapolis. The City of Indianapolis for Marion County and the State for Vanderburgh, Clark, Floyd, St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties. The questionnaires contained all key data fields necessary to calculate typical summer weekday emissions. To assure full coverage of emitting point sources, the State also consulted other data sources, such as manufacturer's listings, newly issued construction permits, and other databases, including Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III, section 313 summaries, and the Toxic Release Inventory. Similarly, the City of Indianapolis also consulted other data sources and utilized direct company inquiries to assure the completeness of data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The point source portions of the emission inventories include detailed facility-specific emission listings with emissions determined at the segment level and at the facility total level. Point source emissions at these source levels were listed for all facilities in the ozone nonattainment areas with emissions of VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  equal to or greater than 10 tons per year or with emissions of CO equal to or greater than 100 tons per year (facilities with less emissions were also included in the point source portions of the emission inventories). Exceedance of the emission cutoff for VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or CO resulted in the reporting of VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO emissions for a given facility. Point source emissions were calculated using emission factors contained in AIRS or using techniques outlined in the approved IPP. Emission factors used were generally obtained from the AIRS Facility Subsystem (AFS), AP&hyph;42 Compilation of Air Pollution Emission Factors, National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program emission inventory, direct stack test data, and other USEPA guidelines. The point source listings included with emission inventory submittals (on file at the Region 5 office) identify the emission factors, source activity levels or throughputs, operating schedules, control equipment efficiencies, and rule effectiveness estimates (a default 80 percent rule effectiveness level was used for most sources) used for each facility and facility segment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): General Motors slips as Dow holds ground Wall Street AFTER Monday's sell-off, US share prices continued to weaken across the board yesterday, especially among secondary stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.42 at 3,193.32. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed 1.41 lower at 419.27, while the Amex composite eased 2.54 to 384.29. The Nasdaq composite index, again faring worst as investors took profits gained in recent weeks, lost another 6.94 to 627.07. Turnover on the NYSE was 187m shares. There was little economic news of substance yesterday, and attention was fixed on the monthly meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Recent economic reports have shown that the recovery has gathered pace since the summer, and yesterday analysts did not expect the policy-making FOMC to sanction another cut in interest rates. General Motors slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30 1/2 in turnover of 1.6m shares on a newspaper report claiming that the company knew about the vulnerability of its pick-up trucks to fires resulting from fuel tank ruptures in 1983, but that it did not take action to rectify the problem until five years later. GM already faces more than 100 lawsuits related to the fuel tank design, and the market fears that the number will rise. Arkla jumped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 9 5/8 in heavy trading after the company entered into a pact to sell its exploration unit to Seagull Energy for Dollars 402m. Arkla also planned to sell some properties to repay debt, and was considering selling its Louisiana Intrastate Gas subsidiary. JWP fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 3 1/4 after the company said it anticipated making a third-quarter loss of Dollars 162m following restructuring and other non-recurring charges which total Dollars 135m. ADRs in British Airways dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 after the airline announced a 23 per cent decline in second-quarter pre- tax profit and a 6.8 per cent drop in passenger yields in the first six months of the year. On the Nasdaq market, Borland International slumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 24 3/4 in turnover of 4.1m shares after the securities house, Lehman Brothers, downgraded the technology stock from 'outperform' to 'underperform'. Other leading technology stocks also ran into heavy selling. Apple gave up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 , Microsoft fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 90 and Sun Microsystems dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 . Canada A late selloff sent Toronto share prices lower in active trading. On preliminary data, the TSE 300 index shed 17.92 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close at 3218.47, as declines led advances 345 to 209. Volume was 39,117,000 shares.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Japan offers war atonement scheme Japan took a further sign-ificant step yesterday in its efforts to atone for second world war aggression with a pledge to spend Y100bn (Pounds 656m) on historical research and cultural projects to promote peace in Asia. 'It is imperative for us Japanese to look squarely to our history with the peoples of neighbouring Asia and elsewhere,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, who yesterday unveiled the 10-year programme, beginning next year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. However, a foreign ministry official emphasised that the handout marked no change in the policy of refusing further official government compensation for individual war victims and their families. Japan argues that this was formally settled by the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty. The new money is instead earmarked for the creation of a historical war document centre in Japan, vocational training centres for women in neighbouring Asian countries and youth exchange visits. 'We have no intention of reopening war claims,' said the official. As a result, Mr Murayama's scheme is unlikely to defuse continuing claims from British and Dutch prisoners of war and Korean women forced into prostitution by invading Japanese troops. These claims are irritants to Japan's painstakingly slow attempt to raise its profile in international affairs and to bolster relations with increasingly valuable Asian neighbours. South-east Asia has formed Japan's largest export destination for the past three years and is its fastest growing investment location. Three successive Japanese prime ministers over the past year have issued various statements of regret and apology in a campaign to normalise relations with Asia. Mr Murayama returned recently from a four-country Asian tour, largely devoted to trying to atone for the past, during which he was told by the Malaysian government that Japan should cease apologising. The effect of Japan's apologies has been spoiled by outspoken lack of contrition from Japan's right wing, including two cabinet ministers sacked over the past six months for trying to justify Japan's wartime actions. In contrast to Germany, Japan's national consensus against its wartime record is shaky. Undeterred, Mr Murayama yesterday repeated apologies to women forced into prostitution and reiterated 'profound remorse' for suffering caused by Japan. He also said the government aimed to settle 'as soon as possible' the plight of Koreans stranded in the Russian island of Sakhalin after the war and wages owed to Taiwanese soldiers in the Japanese army, two other constraints on Japan's relations with its Asian neighbours. The government estimates that 43,000 Koreans, used for hard labour by Japanese forces, were left in Sakhalin when it reverted to Moscow's hands after the war. It faces 2.4m claims from Taiwanese for savings and unpaid wages worth Y600m at 1945 prices.</p>

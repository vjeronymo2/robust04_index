			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SECTION TEAMS IN RUNNING FOR TITLE  </P> <P> There will be a strong San Diego presence at Woodward Park today at the State  Cross-Country Championships, though the attention of the Division I race  centers on teams from the Central and Southern sections.  </P> <P> Madera High of the Central Section will try to become the first non-Southern  Section boys' team to win the state Division I cross-country championship, and  the Agoura girls' team will try to break its streak of three consecutive  runner-up finishes.  </P> <P> Madera and Agoura, the state's top-ranked boys' and girls' teams and ranked  third and second, respectively, in the nation by The Harrier magazine, won  their section Division I titles last Saturday.  </P> <P> The San Diego Section figures to be nipping at the heels of the Agoura girls,  though, as section champion Mt. Carmel bids for its first state title.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel, known as the Red Wave because all seven of its runners finish  within a minute of each other, is ranked second in the state in the Kinney  Cross-Country Poll and fourth nationally. Junior Susan Scott won the section  title Saturday as six Sundevils finished in the top 10. Only the first five  runners for each team score. Mt. Carmel set a large-school section record with  27 points.  </P> <P> The Sundevils -- fourth in the state meet last year -- were second in the  Sweepstakes race at the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational.  </P> <P> The Agoura girls, who won at Mt. SAC, will be looking to unseat three-time  champion Palos Verdes. The Chargers have already upstaged the Sea Kings three  times this season -- including the Southern Section Division I final.  </P> <P> Seniors Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande and Agoura's Deena Drossin are the  individual favorites for the Division I titles. Quintana finished second to  three-time titlist Bryan Dameworth of Agoura last season and Drossin has  claimed two of the last three championships.  </P> <P> In the boys race, San Diego High School, which upset three-time section  champion Poway, will try to foil Madera's hopes.  </P> <P> Poway's boys, which had three runners in the top five before falling off in the  section finals, is represented in both the boys and the girls races.  </P> <P> Two San Diego Section teams must be considered favorites in the other girls'  races. San Pasqual and La Jolla are ranked No. 1 in the state.  </P> <P> La Jolla, which won the Division II title in 1989 with the third-best score in  state meet history (88 points), is competing for the Division III title. The  Vikings are led by section champion Julie Schoene, who helped La Jolla win the  section final with a near-perfect 17 points. Six runners finished in the top  eight.  </P> <P> San Pasqual is competing in Division II and also had six runners finish in the  top eight, including second-place Deanna Hadley.  </P> <P> San Diego's best hope for an individual title is Fallbrook sophomore Milena  Glusac. She finished ninth in 1989 in the Division I race, but competes this  year in Division II.  </P> <P> In the boys' races, No. 2 Helix should challenge for the Division II title No.  1 Fair Oaks Del Campo.  </P> <P> In Division I, Newhall Hart, the state's No. 2 boys' team, will race Madera for  the third time this season after finishing second to Madera in the Stanford and  Mt. SAC invitationals.  </P> <P> "I think we can beat Madera," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. "I think we're  the No. 1 team in the state."  </P> <P> L.A. City Section champion Belmont and runner-up Woodland Hills Taft could  contend with Oxnard Channel Islands for a top-five finish.  </P> <P> The new divisional format for the state meet -- which categorizes schools by  enrollment -- also places three of the nation's fastest girls in different  divisions.  </P> <P> Drossin, Becky Spies of Livermore and Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village  Westlake, the top three finishers in the Division I final a year ago, will  compete in Divisions I, III and II, respectively, making it possible for each  runner to win a state title.  </P></p>

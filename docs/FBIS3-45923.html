In addressing the conference, Jiang Zemin, general secretary  of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out: Propaganda and  ideological work has a close bearing on the cause of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all  levels must attach great importance to this task. They must  strengthen their leadership and shoulder responsibility in this  regard.    He stressed: Propaganda and ideological work requires arming  people's minds with scientific theories, guiding them with  correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and  inspiring them with outstanding works so that generations of  socialist-minded people who have lofty ideals, who are ethical  and educated, and who have a high sense of discipline can be  constantly trained and cultivated, and so that during the great  cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we  will have a powerful ideological guarantee and the support of  the media.    Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding  Guangen,  Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin,  and other comrades attended the conference, which was chaired by  Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat,  and head of the Propaganda Department, of the CPC Central  Committee.    The main agenda of the conference is to study ways and means  to intensify and improve ideological and propaganda work under  the new situation, doing so under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and that of the party's basic line, by following  the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and by following the principle of  being firm in carrying out material construction and promoting  socialist ethics at the same time.    In his speech, General Secretary Jiang Zemin focused on  issues in three respects: first, the importance of intensifying  propaganda and ideological work during the new period; second,  the basic guidelines and major tasks of propaganda and  ideological work; and third, the party must intensify and  improve its leadership over propaganda and ideological work.    Jiang Zemin said he hoped that the conference will enable  party leaders at all levels and comrades working on the  propaganda and ideological front to have a clearer idea of the  task of overall importance, achieve a consensus of views, and  work earnestly with higher morale so as to create a new  situation for propaganda and ideological work, and do an even  better job of rallying and inspiring the vast number of party  members and people to push forward the cause of reform, opening  up, and modernization.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: The basic policy of the work of the  whole party is, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  that of the party's basic line, to fully implement the  guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and its  third plenary session; speed up the building of the socialist  market economic system; maintain the sustained, fast, and  healthy development of the national economy; safeguard social  stability; and promote social progress in all sectors. The most  important mission of the party is to seize the opportunity to  deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote  development, and maintain stability. All party comrades must  understand this mission of overall importance, obey and serve  this mission, and take the initiative in accomplishing the work  in all fields as required by this mission.    Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the basic  guiding principle for all party projects. Comrades working on  the propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to this  basic guideline and use it as the guide for all their work.    Jiang Zemin said: Today and in the time to come, we must pay  special attention to the work in four respects. First, the most  important task of the propaganda and ideological front is to arm  the minds of all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  Second, we must persist in implementing the party's basic line  and in providing public opinion with the proper guidance.  Third, we must make ideological education a success to bring up  people who have lofty ideas, who are ethical and educated, and  who have a high sense of discipline, so as to expedite socialist  spiritual construction. Fourth, we must adhere to the course of  serving the people and socialism, uphold the principle of  letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of  thought contend, foster the main theme, and bring about a boom  in socialist literature and art.    Jiang Zemin stressed: While promoting socialist spiritual  construction through propaganda and cultural work, we must do  several things. First, we must give top priority to its social  results [ba she hui xiao yi fang zai shou wei] and integrate  economic and social results on this basis. Second, we should  approach our nation's traditional culture and culture from  abroad with a scientific attitude. Third, we must persist in  spiritual construction and place emphasis on construction and  better management.    Jiang Zemin also fully endorsed the results achieved by the  comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front. He  said: The vast number of comrades on the propaganda and  ideological front are loyal to the cause of the party and the  people, and they have accomplished a good deal of work in  publicizing the party's basic theory and basic line; in  promoting reform, opening up, and modernization; and in  promoting socialist ethics, and they have made significant  contributions in those areas.    Jiang Zemin stressed: The Central Party Committee trusts the  contingent of propaganda and ideological workers, and the party  and the people have high hopes for them. Under Comrade  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, I hope that you will make every effort to  achieve even greater success, press forward, and work hard to  bring propaganda and ideological work to a new level.    Present at the conference were responsible comrades and  propaganda department directors of party committees of various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government's jurisdiction, and responsible persons  from various central departments and committees.

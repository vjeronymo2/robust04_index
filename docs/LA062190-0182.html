			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLET TRIES TO BE BEST IN HER FIELD;  </P> <P> TRACK: THE UCLA JUNIOR, WHO WON NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE DISCUS AND SHOT PUT,  IS SETTING OLYMPIC-SIZE GOALS FOR HERSELF.  </P> <P> The pleasant demeanor of UCLA's Tracie Millet makes it difficult to believe at  first what her coach, Art Venegas, says about her.  </P> <P> Venegas, weight events coach for the Bruin men's and women's track and field  teams, said that Millet, who recently won NCAA championships in the shot put  and the discus, is "the meanest athlete" he has ever coached.  </P> <P> To set the record straight, Millet, a junior from the state of Washington, is  not fond of kicking small dogs or tearing the wings off flies. When Venegas  says that she is mean, he is merely calling her a tough competitor.  </P> <P> "What sets her apart is her competitiveness," said Venegas, who has been with  the UCLA track and field team for nine years.  </P> <P> "I have seen so many athletes who just dazzle you in practice. They have their  technique down, (have a good) attitude and (demonstrate) strength and training.  They're just perfect and ready to take on the world.  </P> <P> "But on the day of a competition, they just fold. They tighten the noose around  their necks.  </P> <P> "Tracie is definitely a pressure performer. When she's really mentally up, she  is awesome. When a meet comes she is very fierce. She is very tough when a meet  is on the line, and she dominated the NCAAs."  </P> <P> Millet, who went to high school in Auburn, Wash., was awesome when she  performed before family and friends this year at the Pacific 10 Conference  championships in Seattle.  </P> <P> She set school records as she won the shot put with a throw of 53 feet, 9 3/4  inches and the discus with a toss of 190-2. Her mark in the discus was the  second-best ever by a Pac-10 performer. Arizona State's Carla Garrett had a  198-5 throw in 1989.  </P> <P> At the NCAA meet in Durham, N.C., she was not quite as awesome, but still  dominated her competitors. In the discus, her mark of 183-9 was more than 18  feet farther than that of her nearest competitor, Rachel Lewis of Minnesota,  who had a final toss of 165-5. After shot putter Christy Barrett of Indiana  State took a second-round lead with a throw of 53-2 1/2, Millet edged her for  the championship with a mark of 53-6 3/4.  </P> <P> Her two national titles were firsts for a UCLA woman at an NCAA meet. Evelyn  Ashford won national championships as a Bruin sprinter in the 100- and  200-meter dashes in 1977, but that meet was under the auspices of the  Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. The championships were also  firsts for Millet; she was third in the discus in her freshman and sophomore  years.  </P> <P> Millet said that setting personal records in the shot and the discus before  family and hometown fans at the Pac-10 meet in Seattle was "by far probably one  of my best track experiences." She said that, although she finished first in  both events at the NCAAs, she did not approach that meet with the same fervor  that she had in the conference meet.  </P> <P> She also said that her successful but long collegiate season made it "hard to  get motivated" for last week's USA/Mobil National Track and Field  Championships, a qualifying meet for the Goodwill Games, which will be held in  Seattle in July.  </P> <P> She qualified for the final in both the shot and discus in the USA meet at  Cerritos College, but she finished far back in the field in both events and  won't be competing in the Goodwill Games. Connie Price of the Nike North Track  Club won the discus at 191-6, and Millet, competing for the World Class Club,  was eighth at 171-1. Price also won the shot put with a mark of 60-10 3/4 and  Millet was ninth at 50-1 3/4.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, she had an excellent season, and her two NCAA titles will not be  forgotten.  </P> <P> "We've had some excellent (women) athletes at UCLA, (including) -- Flo Jo  (Florence Griffith Joyner) and Jackie Joyner Kersee, but none of them won two  individual NCAA titles," Venegas said. "That's a unique thing."  </P> <P> Her setbacks at the USA meet won't deter her from a goal of making the U.S.  national team and competing in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona.  </P> <P> Venegas said that Millet was "a little overmatched" at Cerritos College but  that she has "an excellent chance of making the Olympics, particularly in the  discus. She probably just has to keep her head focused and maybe put on a  couple of extra pounds (on her 6-foot, 185-pound frame). She has an outside  chance in the shot."  </P> <P> He said that she will have to increase her range in the shot to about 60 feet,  which still would not guarantee her a spot on the national team, and that she  should make the team in the discus if she improves from her best mark of 190-2  to about 210 feet.  </P> <P> "She is an up-and-coming discus thrower, and I know the top girls are already  noticing her presence," he added.  </P> <P> Millet said that she has been able to put on the pounds that are necessary to  weight throwers, but that she has had some difficulty turning the additional  pounds into muscle.  </P> <P> She said that Venegas has been "on my case to gain weight and threatened to  make me a distance runner." She said that she drinks high-protein milkshakes to  maintain her weight and lifts weights and runs to harden her body. But she said  it requires constant effort to maintain that regimen.  </P> <P> Doing what is necessary to be a top weight thrower, including watching what she  eats and getting enough sleep, doesn't leave much time for studies or a social  life, she said. But she is determined to stay with it and reach the Olympics.  </P> <P> She said her goal is to weigh about 185 but to look like 160. She said that she  hopes to reduce her body fat to less than the 16% it measured in the fall of  1989, the last time she was tested.  </P> <P> Venegas said that no one wants to put on fat and that throwers have to be  "athletic and lean. The only overweight person allowed on the program is me."  </P> <P> Top-flight competitors have to work hard and make sacrifices, "but they gain  things that other persons never aspire to," he said. He said that Millet will  be rewarded for her hard work when The Athletic Congress, the governing body of  amateur track in the United States, sends her and other college throwers to  compete this summer on a three-week tour of Europe.  </P> <P> Millet said that she might take a redshirt season at UCLA next year. She would  use the year to work toward a goal of breaking the college records in the  discus, shot and javelin the following season. She qualified for the NCAAs in  the javelin, but she said that she didn't compete in the event because she  didn't "want to risk the strain and stress on my body."  </P> <P> She thinks that her chances of breaking the three college records after a  redshirt year "are pretty good with Art's coaching and understanding. All it's  going to take is a lot of work.  </P> <P> "I'm awkward, and I need a lot of coaching. But I have the potential. I've gone  from not knowing to a better understanding of how to throw."  </P> <P> Venegas might call her awkward, but he would only be kidding her. "Without a  doubt, she's the best (woman) thrower I've had at UCLA. . . She's just  scratching the surface of her talent."  </P></p>

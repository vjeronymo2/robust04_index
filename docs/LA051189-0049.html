			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS PANEL WIDENS PROBE OF WRIGHT'S FAST OIL PROFIT  </P> <P> In a new setback for Speaker Jim Wright, the House Ethics Committee decided  Wednesday to expand its investigation of an unusual Texas oil well deal that  gave him a quick profit of $340,000 last year, although other investors in the  well still have not made any money from it.  </P> <P> The panel apparently was not satisfied with an explanation of the complex  transaction provided last week by Morris D. Jaffe, a San Antonio financier and  veteran Democratic Party fund-raiser, and his son, Douglas, who have termed it  an "entirely legitimate business deal."  </P> <P> Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) said additional witnesses would be  called to give testimony next week on the so-called Sabine Lake investment by  Mallightco, a firm in which Wright and his wife, Betty, held a half-interest.  Dixon did not provide any names.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handled by Blind Trust  </P> <P> Although the decision appeared to be a blow to Wright's hopes for an early end  to the 11-month-old investigation, Mark Johnson, a spokesman for the Speaker,  said:  </P> <P> "We still don't think Sabine Lake will lead to anything. It was entirely  handled by the blind trust set up by the Speaker and approved by the Ethics  Committee."  </P> <P> In other developments, Wright's lawyers Wednesday asked the panel to drop the  major charges against him on grounds that the committee ignored its own rules  and legislative history in approving the "statement of alleged violation"  against the Speaker.  </P> <P> His attorneys said there is no legal basis for one charge that he schemed to  evade a House limit on outside earnings by bulk sales of his book because of a  "total exemption" for book royalties in the ethics standards.  </P> <P> They also argued that lawmakers never intended that a person like George A.  Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth developer and friend of the Speaker, would be  considered a person with a "direct interest" in legislation. Wright is accused  of improperly accepting $145,000 in gifts from Mallick, who, according to the  accusation, had such an interest.  </P> <P> Acting on other requests filed Tuesday by Wright's expanded defense team, the  panel agreed to provide him immediately with any evidence that would tend to  clear him of the allegations and modified a previous rule that would make  witnesses at the preliminary inquiry more available for interviews by the  defense.  </P> <P> But the committee rejected his plea to prevent the committee's special counsel,  Richard J. Phelan, from having informal contacts with panel members unless one  of the Speaker's lawyers was present.  </P> <P> Wright and his attorneys argued that Phelan, a Chicago lawyer hired especially  to run the investigation, was having an undue influence over the committee  during one-on-one dinners with several of its members.  </P> <P> Dixon excoriated Wright's expanded team of defense lawyers for charging that  Phelan had distorted testimony of witnesses and shown poor legal scholarship in  his 276-page report that recommended the filing of charges.  </P> <P> The accusations, according to Dixon, are "totally inaccurate, totally wrong and  an exercise in bad judgment by the respondent's attorneys." Asked whether his  remarks also applied to Wright, who made a similar stinging attack on Phelan on  Tuesday, Dixon declined to comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comment From Jaffes' Lawyers  </P> <P> In the Sabine Lake inquiry last week, attorneys for the Jaffes said they were  not aware of Wright's involvement when the Jaffes sold a 4% interest in the  well to Mallick, who was acting on behalf of Mallightco. Mallick and his wife  owned the other 50% of Mallightco.  </P> <P> Most of Mallightco's interest in the well -- 2.5% -- was transferred to a West  German firm for a loan of $440,000 that was to be repaid only from drilling  revenues. Despite favorable geological reports on gas reserves, however, no  production followed, despite $4 million worth of drilling, and the well was  capped last September.  </P> <P> After deducting about $90,000 of the loan proceeds for drilling costs, the  remaining $350,000 was transferred to Mallightco on May 10, 1988. Wright's  shares in the firm were bought from his blind trust for about $340,000.  </P></p>

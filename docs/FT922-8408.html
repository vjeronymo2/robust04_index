			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Accountancy firms to expand China ventures ARTHUR ANDERSEN and KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firms, plan to expand their joint venture networks in China by opening offices in at least two other cities within the next year. Both firms are considering developing operations in Shanghai and Guangzhou to complement their first joint ventures approved by the Chinese authorities last month. Mr Eoghan McMillan, Arthur Andersen managing partner for Hong Kong and China, said the venture was considering opening branches in Shanghai and Guangzhou, possibly also in Shen Zhen. Peat Marwick signed documents formally approving a joint venture with a firm of certified public accountants in Beijing to be called KPMG Peat Marwick Huazhen on April 25 after two years' discussions with the Chinese. Arthur Andersen finalised a similar deal two days later, to be called Arthur Andersen Hua Qiang. The ventures have allowed foreign accountants to certify statutory audits on companies operating in China. Certification is required for tax returns and enterprises joining the Chinese stock market.</p>

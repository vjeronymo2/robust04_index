			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Nintendo Corporation of America and some  60 video game cartridge companies formally called on U.S. Trade  Representative Office to keep Taiwan included on the special 301  priority watchlist.    (Vansaw), legal adviser to Nintendo, pointed out that as  Taiwan is still allowing the export of fake Nintendo video game  products all over the world, Taiwan still remains the world's  major source of fake products.    Yesterday, the Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of  Economic Affairs lodged a strong protest over Nintendo  Corporation of America's request of the U.S. Trade  Representative Office to blacklist Taiwan on the special 301  priority watchlist and over the release of a newsletter in which  Nintendo accused Taiwan's manufacturers of heavy involvement in  the production of counterfeit products. (Cai Nian-sen), head of  the Third Division of the Board of Foreign Trade, pointed out  that as Nintendo Corporation of America's charge against Taiwan  is baseless and as Nintendo showed no sincerity in cooperating  with Taiwan's practicing an export inspection system involving  Taiwan's computer products, it has to bear the responsibility  for the serious counterfeiting of its products.</p>

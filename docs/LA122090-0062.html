			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER GETS OK TO PARE DOWN SIZE OF HOUSING PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: TO THE DISMAY OF HOMEOWNERS, A COUNCIL MEMBER CHANGES HER MIND AND  SAYS KEN DOTY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ON HIS  PROJECT.  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council appeared Tuesday to have cleared the way for  developer Ken Doty to submit new plans for a controversial subdivision in  Glenoaks Canyon before new hillside building guidelines are adopted.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to allow Doty to scale down his plan to build 25  million-dollar houses on 30 acres off Sleepy Hollow Place and submit an  alternative proposal before the city toughens its development regulations.  </P> <P> The council also indicated that it will overturn its Dec. 4 decision to reject  the environmental impact report for Doty's 25-house proposal. That could save  the developer six months to a year in processing an alternative plan, city  officials said.  </P> <P> Glenoaks Canyon homeowners, who have battled with Doty for more than a year  over his Sleepy Hollow plan, expressed dismay at the action.  </P> <P> "It was a real surprise," said Joe Bridges, vice president of the Glenoaks  Canyon Homeowners Assn. "I'm disappointed in their decision to change the vote.  I thought Doty had ample time to consider a smaller subdivision and had refused  to do so."  </P> <P> Doty's plan was one of four proposed projects exempted from an 18-month ban on  hillside development passed in March so officials could develop new rules  covering grading, ridgeline preservation and other issues.  </P> <P> The council, after a late-night public hearing Dec. 4, voted 3 to 2 to reject  the 25-house proposal and to not certify its environmental review. Members said  they wanted to see fewer houses and less environmental damage in the canyon.  They also said the review did not include all reasonable alternatives as  required by state law.  </P> <P> The decision effectively stopped Doty from filing a new plan before the  hillside building ban is lifted in October, after tougher regulations are  adopted. It required him to do a new environmental review, which can take a  year or more, City Atty. Scott Howard said.  </P> <P> But Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg, who with Mayor Larry Zarian and Councilman  Carl Raggio earlier had defeated Doty's plan, this week changed her mind.  </P> <P> She directed city staff members to prepare documents that will allow the  council to certify Doty's original environmental review. The council next week  is expected to schedule public hearings in January before formally  reconsidering the report.  </P> <P> Bremberg and Councilmen Jerold Milner and Richard Jutras are expected to  approve the review. Zarian and Raggio have indicated that they will again vote  to reject it.  </P> <P> Bremberg said she changed her position because she did not realize that she  could reject the 25-house tract but approve the environmental report. She said  she still opposes any proposal that will affect the canyon's ridgeline but  believes that the original report will accommodate an alternative plan.  </P> <P> "I think that other alternatives can be presented in the framework of the  environmental report," Bremberg said. "I don't see the point of keeping this  thing going for another two years. Let's get it over with."  </P> <P> The council's vote Tuesday to extend Doty's exemption from the ban will apply  only to Doty's project and not to the three others in the hillside development  pipeline. Howard has said making an exception for only one developer would  leave the city on shaky legal ground.  </P> <P> Last week, Doty told council members that his plans could be scaled down but  refused to say by how much. Doty had maintained for more than a year that any  subdivision smaller than 25 houses would be financially unfeasible.  </P></p>

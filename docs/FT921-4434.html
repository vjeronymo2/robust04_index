			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley spurns new offer from Redland STEETLEY yesterday recommended its shareholders to reject an improved offer from rival building materials group Redland. It said the marginal improvement in Redland's share offer had been eroded by the fall in the company's share price on Friday. It added that a full cash alternative proffered by Redland was only 2 per cent higher than the previous partial cash alternative. Redland's share price yesterday rebounded 11p to 458p, reflecting the market's view that it will have achieved a good deal if it succeeds in getting Steetley at this price. Its offer of 87 Redland shares for every 100 of Steetley last night valued the group at Pounds 640.3m or 398.5p a share. The company had previously bid 85 Redland shares for every 100 Steetley shares. Steetley's share price yesterday rose 7p to 387p. Mr David Donne, Steetley's chairman, said: 'Redland's illusory increased bid is both inadequate and unacceptable. Steetley shareholders will benefit from Steetley's recovery and future prospects by retaining their shares and rejecting the bid.' He said Redland was seeking to acquire Steetley when the company was at the bottom of one of the worst downturns in the UK construction market. This was despite Steetley having outperformed Redland in growth of profits, earnings and dividend for 10 years. Steetley said the offer price took no account of the potential earnings growth when the UK, US and Spain, moved out of recession. Mr Robert Napier, Redland's managing director said: 'Redland's increased and final offer provides Steetley shareholders with significant increases in capital and income as well as opportunity to share in a world class building group with enhanced growth prospects. The combination of Redland and Steetley has overwhelming commercial logic supported by annual savings of up to Pounds 30m before tax, the full benefit of which will come through in 1993.'</p>

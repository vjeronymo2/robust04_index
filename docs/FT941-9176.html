			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / People: Richard Lutyens Richard Lutyens, who died at the age of 45 last Saturday, first came to attention in the City as one of Sir Siegmund Warburg's bright young men. He joined Warburg in 1972 and had been made a director before he was 30 - a distinction shared with Sir David Scholey, Warburg's current chairman and John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell. A great nephew of Edwin Lutyens, the British architect, Lutyens was recruited to Warburg by Bernard Kelly and quickly caught Sir Siegmund's eye. Ron Chernow notes in his book, The Warburgs: a family saga, how Rothschilds tried to exclude SG Warburg from a Eurobond issue for an American client. Sir Siegmund, who prided himself on his memorandums, ordered his young employee to search the archives for a memorandum covering a verbal agreement he had made with Rothschilds 15 years before. Lutyens found it and Rothschilds backed down. Lutyens' diligence was soon rewarded with a seat on the Warburg board. However, he quit Warburg in 1982 and after spells with the United Gulf Investment Company and Goldman Sachs, he was made a managing director of Merrill Lynch Europe and helped build its European equity business. After three years with Merrill, he went off to establish a small merchant banking boutique, with John Campbell and Bill Dacombe, two merchant bankers who had once worked together at NM Rothschild. Lutyens used his strong connections on the continent to persuade Mercapital, the Spanish merchant bank, to take a stake in Campbell Lutyens Hudson in 1990, and he remained non-executive chairman of the 16-strong firm until his death. His funeral is on Friday at 10am at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, London W1.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Jana </F> Pankovcinova and Robert Kotian on 12 April; place not given:  "Risks of Previous Political Developments Have Not Been  Overcome"]    [Text] [SME] What made you devote such a large part of  your speech to internal party affairs of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] while presenting the Slovak  Government Policy Statement [to the Slovak parliament on 12  April]?    [Moravcik] What happened in the HZDS went beyond the  framework of internal party affairs, in my opinion. I tried to  explain this in my speech. I believe it is important for  citizens to understand this and for them to understand also the  logic of current developments. I think that the risks of  certain developments we witnessed here have still not been  overcome.    [SME] Your former party colleagues have accused you and the  government of having personally participated in the policies of  the HZDS and the former government. Was their criticism voiced  in the parliamentary debate warranted?    [Moravcik] My leaving the HZDS was the logical culmination  of a string of events. The HZDS took a different course than we  intended when formulating its program. For this reason, I  believe that what I did was unavoidable.    [SME] On what did you base the assertion in your speech  today that the HZDS has been misleading its voters since 1992  and that it has lost some of its voters?    [Moravcik] The HZDS electoral program submitted to voters  two years ago was diametrically opposed to the reality of HZDS  policy. The program was to a large degree liberal, while the  practical policy of the HZDS leans toward extremism. There is a  clear discrepancy here.    [SME] How important is the approval of the government's  Policy Statement from the viewpoint of the IMF mission and its  approval of a loan for the Slovak Republic?    [Moravcik] The Policy Statement lays down principles that  have been agreed to by IMF and World Bank experts. They  consider this program positive from the viewpoint of the further  economic transformation of the Slovak Republic so that its  approval will facilitate further talks.    [SME] Are you confident that your government will obtain the  required confidence from the National Council of the Slovak  Republic?    [Moravcik] I assume that we will find sufficient support in  parliament.</p>

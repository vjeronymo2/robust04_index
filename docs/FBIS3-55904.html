			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the Latvian-Russian talks on army withdrawal,  representatives of the Russian delegation have submitted new  proposals on the legal status of the Skrunda radar station as  well as a proposed new five-year deadline for the withdrawal of  the Skrunda radar. This was told today to reporters by Sergey  Zotov, head of the Russian delegation.    The Latvian side is at the moment acquainting itself with  the  new Russian proposals. The Latvian delegation believes that the  facility should be non-military. Russian representatives,  however, oppose that.    Speaking about the resumption of the talks in general after  yesterday's incident between the leadership of the Vidzeme  district of Riga and two generals of the Russian army, Zotov  explained that one of the aims of the person responsible for the  provocation was to disrupt the talks and to hinder the effort to  reach agreement between Latvia and Russia on troop withdrawal.  With this, suspension of the talks would have been only in the  interest of the person responsible for the provocation.    The talks between representatives of the Latvian and Russian  delegations on troop withdrawal will continue tomorrow.</p>

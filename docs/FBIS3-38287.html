The two-day meeting, called by the Conference on Security  and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) ministerial conference in Rome last  December, is discussing ways of helping countries such as  Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Hungary, Romania and  Ukraine which have been hard hit by the UN-imposed sanctions.    The European Community offer, in line with its programme of  economic assistance to East Europe, aims to help set up a  special transit corridors between these countries for trading.    The corridors, which could be set up next summer, would  include special customs clearance at borders for priority-rated  heavy goods vehicles.    One corridor could link Austria to Greece and Turkey,  another  Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and the Ukraine.    Each of the countries would offer special border crossing  facilities to speed up the movement of non-Yugoslav-related  freight.    An international conference might be held to organize the  details of such a set up.    The European Commission has also suggested looking for new  routes around Yugoslavia to free up present clogged roads.    Countries affected by the embargo either border Serbia and  Montenegro -- under UN sanctions because of their perceived role  in fomenting the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- or are affected by  restrictions on traffic on the River Danube.</p>

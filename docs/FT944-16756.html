			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Police chief raps funding reform A proposed new government formula for funding the police is 'fundamentally flawed', Mr Jim Sharples, Merseyside chief constable, warned yesterday. Merseyside Police Authority yesterday held an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis. Mr Norman Williams, the Tory chairman, said the cuts 'defy logic', and is seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. The Merseyside force believes it is set to become one of the worst victims of the new formula. Mr Sharples has warned Mr Howard and other ministers that the formula would have too detrimental an impact on Merseyside when implemented on April 1 next year. Among factors used in the formula are recorded crime, which has been dropping on Merseyside for eight years, and population, which has also declined steadily. He warned: 'If you begin to tamper with the strength of that force or reduce its effectiveness then there must be some impact on the crime figures.' Faced with the loss of Pounds 13m from his budget, Mr Sharples said at least 500 of his 4,600 officers from all ranks, but mainly constables, would have to go, along with 100 of his 1,000 civilian support staff.</p>

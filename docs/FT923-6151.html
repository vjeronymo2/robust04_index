			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: ANC plans company competition authority Sir, Much of what Sir Alan Walters and Mr George Guise, say about South Africa's economic problems (Personal View, August 19) is unworthy of serious discussion. They are, for instance, under the strange impression that the domination of an economy by a small number of large, privately owned corporations is the same thing as socialism. But they have correctly diagnosed one of South Africa's problems: domination of the economy by 'the interlocked interests of the five conglomerates which account for more than three-quarters of the market capitalisation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange'. They point out that this leads to inefficiency and a lack of effective competition. The African National Congress agrees with them that, in order to ensure the unleashing of the full productive potential of South African industry, it may well be necessary for conglomerates to be broken up or subject to a regulatory framework which makes them accountable for the power they wield in the economy. Sir Alan and Mr Guise believe that, to achieve such a break-up, it is necessary only to abolish some unspecified regulatory obstacles to takeover bids, whereupon foreign predators, such as Lord Hanson, will undertake the restructuring of the economy. This simplistic notion ignores the fact that takeover bids have produced the present conglomerates. The ANC will establish an effective competition authority with power to order, where necessary, the break-up of monopolies and to vet takeover bids, blocking those which would operate against the public interest.

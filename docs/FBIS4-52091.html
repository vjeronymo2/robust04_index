			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 5 -- More than 100,000 telephones  have been installed in this biggest commercial city of the  country, a four fold increase over the figure in early last  year. As a result, there are now 3.7 telephones for every 100  people but this is only one-fifteenth the ratio of European  countries.    According to sources from the city's post and communication  office, more than USD 50 million has been invested over the past  year in an automatic exchange system. One of the major projects  is the installation of an underground cable system. On  completion the project can provide a million telephones to the  local subscribers by 2000.    The director of the Municipal Telephone Company predicted  that his company will have 200,000 more subscribers by the end  of this year. [sentence as received] The number next year is  expected to be ten times bigger than the 1992 figure. In  addition, other services have been developed such as cellular  mobile telephone, trunked radio mobile telephone, and card  phones. Vietnam plans to have one telephone for every 100  people next year compared with three telephones per 1,000  persons at present, and three telephones for every 100 people by  2000, Said Dang Van Than, general director of the General  Department of Post and Telecommunications.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the  Presidential Council, has explained that the military situation  on various fronts is going in favor of our Armed Forces, the  forces of constitutional legitimacy. He added that what is  helping our Armed Forces decide the situation militarily against  the secessionist elements in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is  the fact that large numbers of the forces that were under the  control of these elements have joined the ranks of the forces of  unity and legitimacy.    In a news conference held today, which was attended by a  number of Arab and international newspaper, news agency, and  radio correspondents, he said that the Armed Forces are now  close to the area of Dar Sa'd, overlooking the city of Aden, and  that they are continuing their advance toward the dens of the  gang that rebelled against legitimacy. He pointed out that the  situation in the governorate of Abyan was decided in favor of  our Armed Forces on the day before yesterday, and that fighting  has come to a complete halt in all combat areas in this  governorate.    Fighting is now confined to the governorates of Lahij and  Aden, where the forces of unity and legitimacy will soon finish  their tasks in the two governorates. In this regard, brother  'Abd-al-Ghani asserted that the military base under the control  of rebels and secessionists in the area of al-'And in the  governorate of Lahij is about to fall into the hands of the  Armed Forces, which are conducting a firm siege on this base.    He denounced the criminal action that the rebellious and  secessionist gang is carrying out by launching missile attacks  on the capital, Sanaa, and on the governorates of Ta'izz and  al-Hudaydah. These attacks targeted national and vital  institutions. The objectives they sought by shelling these  institutions were not achieved, and their evil wish foundered,  so the missiles fell on mountains, hills, and valleys, as well  as on some residential areas, he added.    Asked about the mediation efforts of certain states, the  brother Presidential Council member said: For our part, we  always announced that we support dialogue; we called for  dialogue, and we committed ourselves to its results. We are  also constantly committed to democratic policy, the  constitution, and legitimacy. However, the rebellious and  secessionist leaders in the YSP rejected dialogue. We now reject  foreign mediations because what is taking place is an internal  affair between legitimacy and those rebelling against it.  Moreover, we vehemently reject mediation efforts that regard the  conflict as one between two different regimes. This is because  the conflict is one, the country is one, and the legitimacy  exists in the House of Representatives, which was elected by the  people on 27 April 1993.    Within this context, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani expressed great  appreciation for the sentiments of the Arab brethren and friends  throughout the world toward what is happening in our country.  He asserted that there would be a Yemeni solution to the  problem because the conflict is one between legitimacy and the  rebellion against it. The world states should support  legitimacy and democracy in our country, he added.</p>

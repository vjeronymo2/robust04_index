			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Farmers may seek review of quotas The National Farmers' Union is considering applying for a judicial review of the way the government has handled the allocation of spare quotas for sheep farmers this year. Rationing of quotas has left some farmers in severe hardship, the union said. 'We have taken independent legal advice and believe there is a case for a legal challenge about the way the ministry has handled European Union rules on the quota reserve,' said Sir David Naish, NFU president. A union official said: 'We have a lot of members who are extremely annoyed.' Farmers need a high enough quota from the government to cover all the animals in their flocks if they wish to apply for EU subsidies. The government retained some quotas to award to new entrants to farming, producers expanding their businesses and others who felt disadvantaged. But the Ministry of Agriculture was deluged with applications. By rationing extra quota and awarding it chiefly to upland producers, the government has left some 5,000 disgruntled applicants. Mr George Dunn, rural economics adviser at the Country Landowners' Association, said many were in genuine hardship and some would be forced out of business.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (17): Agriculture faces a crisis / A look at government plans to revive the sector Iqbal Mustafa is disillusioned with agriculture. He has tried cotton, grain and horticulture on his 150-acre farm in Punjab. Now he has put the land to a new use - housebuilding. One of Pakistan's small group of entrepreneurial farmers, Mr Mustafa warns: 'The industry is stagnating. Production cannot keep pace with population growth. There are not enough development funds, no infrastructure for getting goods to market, and rural education has totally collapsed.' It is a gloomy assessment of a country in which agriculture employs more than 50 per cent of the working population and accounts for 24 per cent of its GNP. For modern, efficient farming, Pakistan needs to consolidate agricultural land holdings. But rapid population growth is restricting the amount of land available. Moreover, feudal landlords, whose power is based upon keeping people on the land, resist change. Mr Mustafa's verdict is all the more depressing because he is not citing personal grievances, but the findings of the prime minister's Task Force on Agriculture, set up last year to assess the state of the industry and proposals to widen the tax net to include farmers for the first time. The task force - bringing together politicians, farmers and rural interest groups - told the government that agriculture was facing a crisis, which was exacerbated last year by a sharp fall in cotton production, the country's principal cash crop and largest farming export. Output peaked at 12.8m bales in 1991, but fell to 9.1m bales in 1992 and to 7.9m bales last year under the twin impact of heavy rain and viral infections. The dismal performance by the cotton sector which, together with textiles, accounts for more than half of Pakistan's total exports, pegged agricultural growth to a modest 2.6 per cent. The disproportionate effect of two years' poor weather and virus problems underlined the structural difficulties of an industry in which only cotton and livestock have outstripped population growth over the past 10 years. Prolonged dry spells in wheat-growing areas, meanwhile, could reduce yields by more than 6 per cent this year; and rice farmers, who saw output increase 28 per cent to 3.99m tonnes last year, are uncertain whether there is a ready market for any excess produce. Pakistan's inability to feed itself, let alone develop a commercially-minded farming community, has been further hampered by the absence of an organised seed industry; intermittent or non-existent power and water supplies; and increasingly fragmented land holdings. Together with the drain on foreign exchange reserves caused by food imports and the reluctance of some feudal landlords to improve conditions for villagers, it adds up to a massive structural problem for a government already constrained by heavy defence and debt servicing costs. Even so, Mr Shah Mehmood Qureshi, parliamentary secretary at the ministry of agriculture and former chairman of the Agricultural Task Force, is undaunted. He says the government is determined to solve the malaise - 'we have no option but to implement new initiatives. The government is in office because of strong support from a rural population let down by its predecessors.' The Bhutto government has tailored agricultural policy to the main recommendations of the task force, which identified four broad strategies to transform the industry: The development of a demand-driven industry using credit to boost production, along with aid for a new processing industry. Reducing the transfer of resources from agriculture to other sectors. Fresh investment in rural infrastructure and the formation of new institutions to monitor the policy framework. So far, these policies have been dominated by the decision to make farmers pay income and wealth taxes, levied by provincial authorities and the federal government respectively. Collecting those taxes, however, could run into opposition from feudal landlords, whose patronage plays an important part in the careers of some politicians. 'I had a feeling I was going to be lynched when I first proposed it,' says Mr Qureshi. Other new initiatives have also run into problems. Plans to offer farmers credit to buy low-priced tractors, imported from Poland and Belarus, have prompted strong resistance from local manufacturers, which argue that it would lead to large-scale losses. Government critics, meanwhile, claim that increased fixed procurement prices for main crops and new credit facilities for small farmers could lead to abuse of the reform process. Wheat farmers, who saw production rise from 14.7m tonnes to 16.4m tonnes last year, have enjoyed price increases of almost 20 per cent, while sugar cane prices have risen 14 per cent. 'We must reduce govern- ment intervention in agriculture,' says one lobbyist. 'Support prices were designed to save farmers from ruin, rather than generate profits.' Others ask where the government will find the resources to fund schemes, such as those to improve the rural road network, computerise land records and ensure year-round fertiliser supplies. Upgrading rural roads would cost Rs240bn alone, according to the Agricultural Task Force, and a further Rs120bn is needed for education in outlying villages. Although some of the demands will be met by the government's Social Action Programme, Mr Qureshi admits that it will not cover the full financial requirements - likely to run into 'billions of dollars'. Nevertheless, he claims Pakistan could become self-sufficient in food production within five years if the government implements measures to modernise the sector. But if it fails to raise poor farmers above subsistence level, or reduce the reliance of richer farms on state hand-outs, there could be a far-reaching upheaval in the industry. That process may be accelerated if this year's cotton crop falls short of government targets of 9.5m bales. Most industry analysts expect a crop of no more than 8.5m bales, and the Small Landholders and Farmers Association has warned that heavy rain and pest problems could leave full-year production languishing at about 5m bales. Mr Mustafa, who helped draft the task force report, suggests that rapid contraction of the industry could be a blessing in disguise - forcing a shake-out of inefficient and loss-making farms and increasing the pressure for land reforms. Changes, to make land acquisition and disposal easier, would allow more efficient farms to expand, he says. But successive governments have avoided tackling the issue. 'What Pakistan needs is fewer, more technically advanced farms supplying higher quality produce,' he says. 'The problem is that land in this country is associated with political power, rather than commercial potential. That won't change overnight.'</p>

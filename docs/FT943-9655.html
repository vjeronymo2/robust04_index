			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Watchdog raps opt-out schools over cash controls Serious failures in financial management by grant-maintained schools in England have been identified by the National Audit Office, thepublic-spending watchdog. The office examined 70 schools which have opted out of local education authority control and taken over their own budgets. It found that 10 had no overall development plan, 23 had not prepared plans looking ahead more than a year and 38 had not placed their plans within a financial framework. Sir John Bourn, who heads the National Audit Office, also found that many governing bodies had failed to appoint properly independent responsible officers - intended by legislation to take on functions broadly similar to non-executive directors - while the quality of external auditing was variable. Sir John said 16 schools had responsible officers who were 'insufficiently independent owing to their involvement in day-to-day financial matters'. Responsible officers at 28 of the schools were failing to fulfil at least an element of their intended function. Schools failed to guard against conflicts of interest, with 22 of those surveyed not keeping an updated register of pecuniary interests. At one secondary school, the wife of the information technology manager owned the company employed to install a computer and software. The school was unable to show that governors had been made aware of the potential conflict of interest. When contracts were put out to tender, schools were not always able to prove that value for money had been obtained, with 21 of those examined failing to retain details of the tenders they had obtained. The quality of external auditors' work, which played a 'key role' in regulating grant-maintained schools, was variable, with auditors of two schools failing to report 'significant deficiencies' subsequently discovered by the National Audit Office. Time spent auditing at schools varied from four hours to 14 staff-days, while audit fees charged to secondary schools varied from less than Pounds 1,000 to more than Pounds 6,000. Applying information technology to school management also proved difficult, with one school reverting to manual accounts after trying two separate computer packages. Of the schools that did use computers, 26 did not make full use of their software packages, while 16 needed to provide more training for their finance staff. From now on, the office will review opt-out schools' performance annually. Value for Money at Grant-Maintained Schools. National Audit Office. HMSO. Pounds 8.95.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Small decline reported in rate of company failures THERE IS little prospect of UK economic recovery before spring next year according to figures on business failures released yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer. The number of companies becoming insolvent in the second quarter of this year was 1,911 compared with 2,074 in the first quarter, a drop of 8 per cent. They stood at 1,969 in the second quarter last year. But Mr Clive Brand, senior economist with Trade Indemnity, warned that the decline was minimal and had been predicted by the company since July last year. 'We should not read too much into it,' he said. 'The trend is fairly stable for the year as a whole. We can take some encouragement that failures appear to have levelled off. There will be no recovery until next spring at the very earliest.' He estimated that failures in 1993 would be 10 per cent lower than this year, although the improvement could be jeopardised by any interest rate rise. The figures show the number of failures among the companies that are customers of the more than 5,000 clients for which Trade Indemnity writes insurance. Failures were greatest in the building and construction sector, in engineering and metals and retail and wholesale distribution. They were lowest in chemicals, food and agriculture. The west Midlands secured the greatest reduction in failures compared with the previous quarter while figures continued to rise in the north of England and Scotland. The statistics echo the pessimism of Trade Indemnity's most recent quarterly financial trends survey which suggested that 31 per cent of companies are working at less than half capacity. The business review said that extended payment was a big cause of concern, although the situation had not deteriorated any further during the last quarter. Domestic invoices are being paid on average 26 days late and export invoices 28 days late.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government has declared illegal the  proposed national industrial action planned for Thursday [9  June] by some categories of employees of NEPA [National Electric  Power Authority]. The minister of state for power and steel,  Elder Wole Oyelese, told a Radio Nigeria Correspondent in Lagos  that the proposed action was uncalled for. He explained that  the employees were only out to create unnecessary problems for  government. He reminded them that government will not hesitate  to take drastic action against anyone who attempts to frustrate  efforts aimed at installing peace and harmony in the country.  The minister stated that everything has been done to forestall  any disruption of electricity supply by unscrupulous elements.</p>

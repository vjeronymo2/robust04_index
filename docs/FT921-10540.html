			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft sells housebuilder for Pounds 7m Whitecroft, the building products, lighting and textiles group, has sold the housebuilding division of its George Longden Estates subsidiary to a management buy-out as part of its plan to withdraw from property development. The sale, for a total Pounds 6.95m, includes the repayment of borrowings of Pounds 5.07m and an initial cash payment of Pounds 1.06m which will reduce Whitecroft's borrowings by Pounds 6.13m. A further Pounds 820,000 in cash will be paid one year from completion. Whitecroft has retained some part-exchange houses and an almost completed development in Cheshire which is expected to realise a total of Pounds 4m. In the year to March 31 1991 the division achieved profits of Pounds 697,000 and net assets at that date were Pounds 3.27m. The managers are supported by 3i, Murray Ventures and Ventures North West.</p>

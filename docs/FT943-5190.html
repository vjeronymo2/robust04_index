			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (13): Tariff packages get more complicated - Mark Newman tries to unravel the cost of a cellular phone Buying a cellular telephone used to be straightforward. UK operators Cellnet and Vodafone had only one set of prices and the same telephone could be used on either network. But since the two introduced new consumer tariffs two years ago, things are more complicated. The UK now has four cellular operators, offering a total of 15 price packages on six different networks. Cellular phones cost from Pounds 25 to Pounds 300, and there are different telephones for different types of networks. If you change networks, the chances are that you will need a new telephone. Choosing a cellular telephone and network is a confusing business. Market research company Romtec estimates that only 3 per cent of those who buy cellular telephones know in advance what network and tariff band they want. A survey of cellular telephone dealers by Cellnet earlier this year found that dealers are involved in 88 per cent of all connection decisions. But they do not always give impartial advice. A dealer is more likely to recommend a network and telephone which generate a high profit margin than a low one. A report this summer by the London-based X25 Partnership shows the total cost of subscribing to cellular telephone services across Europe over three years. Mercury One-2-One and Orange, the two newest UK cellular operators, offer the cheapest services, although their level of network coverage is not as good as Cellnet or Vodafone. There are wide fluctuations in the price of cellular telephones and services in western Europe. Scandinavia is the cheapest region in Europe, and southern Europe tends to be the most expensive. The cheapest service for a high user is offered by the Danish operator Sonofon at an average annual cost of Dollars 708, according to the X25 Partnership. France and Germany are two of the most expensive countries with annual costs of Dollars 1,874 and Dollars 1,728 respectively. The European average is Dollars 1,302. The costs assume 140 minutes of peak-rate usage and 10 minutes of off-peak calls a month. Several operators in Europe now offer services geared to people who make only occasional use of their telephones. These have lower monthly charges but higher call rates than ordinary services. Sonofon again ranks as the cheapest operator for occasional users. A customer who makes 50 minutes of calls a month, of which 25 minutes are at peak times and 25 minutes off-peak, pays Dollars 318 a year over three years in Denmark. This compares with Dollars 433 in the UK, Dollars 591 in Italy, Dollars 783 in Germany and Dollars 1,020 in France. Cellular operators are beginning to offer innovative tariff packages to differentiate themselves from their competitors. Some include free calls in the monthly subscription charge. UK operator Orange has five different monthly subscription packages varying in price from Pounds 15 to Pounds 100. The cheapest package includes 15 minutes of free calls, and the most expensive, 540 minutes. Operators are also starting to offer regional and distance-related tariffs. When cellular services first appeared in Europe, operators had only one peak and one off-peak rate. It did not matter whether the call was local or long-distance. But operators such as Mercury One-2-One and E-Plus, Germany's third cellular operator, are introducing a regional element into tariffing. This is partly because it will take them several years to build nationwide networks. At first, services will be available only in urban areas. In response to competition from Mercury One-2-One, Vodafone has launched its own regional service called MetroDigital. There are five different peak rates according to whether calls are local or long-distance, and if they are made from a rural or an urban area. Calls are charged at half-rate if they are made from the customer's home call - a small area centred around the subscriber's home or office. A sharp fall in the price of GSM telephones since 1992 means that in most countries GSM services are cheaper than those on the original analogue networks. In Germany, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of Europe's 2.5m to 3m GSM subscribers, the retail price for telephones was DM2,000 to DM3,000 when services were launched in 1992. But a combination of price cuts by manufacturers and heavy discounting by German service providers means that the street price of telephones has now fallen to DMI00. There is a large discrepancy in the price of GSM telephones in different countries despite the fact that a telephone sold in one country can be used in any other. The average price of a GSM handportable telephone in Europe is Dollars 557, according to the X-25 survey. But in Austria, Ireland and Italy, telephones cost more than Dollars 1,000. The cheapest markets tend to be those where GSM sales are highest such as Denmark and Germany, or where prices have to be low to compete with analogue network services such as the UK. The growing maturity of the cellular telephone business in Europe is evidenced by a more sophisticated approach to tariffing. Most operators now have a range of packages, aimed at different segments of the market. But potential subscribers should beware. Cellular telephone services are still several times more expensive than fixed network services, and subscribing to a service which does not correspond to your needs could prove an expensive mistake.

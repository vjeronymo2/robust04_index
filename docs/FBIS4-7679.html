			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dan Damian report: "KGB Agents Are Crossing Romania From </F> One End to the Other"]    [Text] After 1990, in addition to Romanian entrepreneurs,  a large number of foreigners, especially from neighboring  countries, came to set up commercial companies. A number of  various companies were set up either with entirely private  capital or in association with the Romanian state.    The majority of these are to be found in Bucharest,  Moldavia,  and Dobrogea. It is interesting that between 1991 and 1993  various "hotel" businesses were set up, which are closed to the  public, offering their services exclusively to certain  categories of foreign citizens. Just such a hotel is to be  found in the city of Galati. If one, as a Romanian citizen, asks  for a room there, one will be politely refused with the words  "We are sorry, but our hotel is closed to the general public."    Moreover, certain analyses show that beginning with the last  10 days in 1993 and over the first months of 1994 the number of  foreign "tourists" coming from neighboring countries trebled,  and more than half of them have remained in Romania for  "business." Similarly, December 1993 represents a record for the  spas in the Prahova Valley regarding the influx of foreign  "tourists" coming from neighboring countries to ski on the  slopes of Clabucet-Plecare and Cota 2,000.    From among the personalities involved in such businesses we  can mention Eduard Hiznichenko, the owner of the Cominet Ltd.  company at 57 Rozelor Street, in the town of Odorheiul Secuiesc,  Anatoliy Ivanov, general director of the Biisik Ltd. Trading  Co., and the Technotours Ltd. company, registered under the  number J 40/6788/1991 in the Commercial Register, represented by  Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu.    Is "KGB the most active intelligence service working on  Romania's territory?" [quote from a 29 March news conference of  Romanian Intelligence Service Director Virgil Magureanu].</p>

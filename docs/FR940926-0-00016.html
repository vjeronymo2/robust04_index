			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new fee is being set at $30.00, consistent with the Department's consultations with Congress before Public Law 103&hyph;317 was enacted. This fee will ensure that the costs of processing passports on an expedited basis, as reflected in the Department's 1991 consular fees cost study, are borne by those who receive that service and that the Department recovers additional costs associated with implementing this fee and eliminating the separate charge for overtime work. (As noted by Congress, for example, up to 60% more time is required to process a passport application on an expedited basis than to provide normal processing services.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If expedited processing is granted, the Department, through the Passport Agencies, will undertake to process the passport within three business days. The expedited service covered by the new fee begins when the application is received by a Passport Agency through personal delivery; by mail; or, if the application is already at an Agency, when the request to expedite is approved. If the applicant's planned departure is within fewer than three days, the Passport Agency may be able to accommodate this shorter period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There will be situations in which expedited passport processing cannot be completed within three days. Such circumstances could include cases in which the applicant does not submit adequate documentation; the applicant is the subject of an unresolved civil or criminal law enforcement matter; or, passport equipment breaks down. The Department expects that these situations will be very rare. In such circumstances, the applicant will be notified and the fee will be refunded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule provides for waiver of the expedite fee in cases where the need for expedited processing results from a mistake by the Department in processing the application. No waiver of the fee will otherwise be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that expedited processing is used only by those who have urgent travel plans, the regulation requires a person requesting this service to provide confirmed tickets or an itinerary showing his or her imminent departure in less than ten days or showing special visa needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule takes effect on October 1, 1994, the beginning of Fiscal Year 1995, the fiscal year covered by Public Law 103&hyph;317. The implementation of this rule as an interim final rule with provision for post-promulgation comments is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3). Delay in implementing this provision of Public Law 103&hyph;317 would be contrary to congressional expectations that the Department will begin collection of this fee at the beginning of FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule does not impose information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866, but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 22 and Part 51 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Passports and visas, Schedule of fees for consular services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 22_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

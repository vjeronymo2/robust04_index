			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "Topic of Current </F> Interest": "The Kind of Liberals We Are"]    [Text] Yegor Gaydar called the adjustment of  reforms--which became inevitable in the environment of  disastrously mounting nonpayments that threatened to bring about  the collapse of our economy--a "new course." However, Gaydar  apparently had not surmised yet that the "new course" would also  signify the bankruptcy of Russian liberalism as the philosophy  of the reforms that were implemented on his initiative. "The  Moor has done his work"--liberalism has performed its "fire  brigade" function, dealing a lethal blow to the command economy  and opening the floodgates to the elements of the market, and  something else should take its place.  <H5>  They Are Fighting `Against' Rather Than `For' </H5>   The picture of a party buildup which was undoubtedly  stimulated by the parliamentary elections, or more precisely  their results, appears to be getting clearer. It is as if  everybody suddenly understood that it is difficult to win  elections without parties, without their local structures.  Unlike what some prominent democrats maintained, referring to  completely different conditions--those of a stable society with  a structure of long duration, and of an American rather than  European type--parties have not at all become a matter of the  past. The struggle "against" still prevails.    However, what is noteworthy here? The fact that parties of a  democratic hue, whether newly built-up or transforming into some  kind of new quality, are still more disposed to fight "against"  rather than "for." Along with other causes, this is the effect  of the previous stage of the struggle, when the strategy of the  entire democratic movement was built on the basis of the  "against" principle--against the omnipotence of the CPSU,  against real socialism, against "the Red empire," and so on.    I am trying to understand the new platform of the Russian  Movement for Democratic Reforms (RDDR). As is known, it suffered  an unequivocal defeat in the elections, failing to make it over  the 5 percent threshold. What conclusion have its leaders drawn?  Gavriil Popov says: "Indeed, I understood as early as after  August 1991 and the choice of a new course that voters would  flee from the fronts of the government, that a backup line  needed to be built which would stop them from fleeing and draw  them toward itself.... However...we put this backup line too  close. People ran past not only us but also Volskiy, Travkin,  and even the Russian Communist Party--they ran all the way to  Zhirinovskiy."    What does this mean if we decipher it? It means that the  RDDR  should have taken up harsh opposition with regard to the ruling  reformers. At the same time, yet another RDDR leader, Anatoliy  Sobchak, stressed: The movement should be based on a commonsense  policy and become a genuinely liberal party. If that is so, what  is liberalism about? About criticizing the government in a  parlance approximating that of Zhirinovskiy? In particular, the  liberalism of the RDDR, as interpreted by Popov, began to merge  not only with a confrontation with the government but also with  anti-Westernism (genuine or affected); patriotic and populist  notes began to be heard in it.    Neither the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] headed  by Sergey Shakhray nor the "Apple" in which Grigoriy Yavlinskiy  sets the tone can be called liberal in the strict sense of the  word, although they undoubtedly include typical liberal  democrats. However, they have the already mentioned  preponderance of "against" motives in common with the RDDR. For  some, it is against the president and the government, for  others, it is against Russia's Choice.    The most powerful democratic bloc, which is currently being  transformed into the Russia's Choice party headed by Yegor  Gaydar, is perhaps the most liberal of all blocs and parties:  putting its stake on owners; market liberalism, and in a sense  even market romanticism; an ode to the bourgeois (in the  favorable meaning of the word). The preelection slogans of  "Liberty," "Property," and "Legality" are typically liberal.  However, recently the weight of arguments "against" has also  increased sharply in this quarter. This has happened due to the  emergence of a new front in the struggle--against the government  of Viktor Chernomyrdin, present and past colleagues of Yegor  Timurovich who do not share his views on the progress of reforms.  <H5>  What Ideals Do We Defend? </H5>   Liberal democracy Russian-style is, in a way, a thing unto  itself. Those who view our indigenous liberalism in conjunction  with, say, Western analogs will certainly end up at an impasse.  For example, when we now refer to the liberal intelligentsia,  the liberal opposition, and so on, we frequently mean the  phenomenon to which Dostoyevskiy referred in his time and which  is characteristic only of us. The great writer and philosopher  emphasized this: "Our entire liberal party (the segment of the  public with a liberal disposition--note by A.K.) has passed the  endeavor by, without participating in it or touching it; the  party merely negated and giggled."    We have many liberal democrats who are only capable of  making  mischief and ridiculing anything and everything as they view the  events in the country following August 1991 from the sidelines,  looking down on them, not participating in real politics and the  affairs of the country in a positive way but merely "negating"  and "giggling," poisoning everything with pessimism and  hopelessness and spreading the catastrophic sentiment. We also  have those who, no sooner had they touched upon the real  endeavor than they got burned and dropped it, cursing everybody  and everything. They are liberal maximalists. Since it has not  gone their way, may the fires of hell consume everything.    A version concerning the so-called conspiracy which has  stirred up our society also indicates that Russian liberalism is  a special phenomenon. It was clear from the very beginning that  this was a provocation. But who brought it into the world (let  us for now ignore the issue of the sponsor), who launched it,  and who advertised it most extensively? Our liberal democrats  from the mass media. For some reason, Yegor Yakovlev resolved to  publish the version in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, and for some reason,  Yevgeniy Kiselev considered it feasible to first familiarize  tens of millions of TV viewers with it through "Itogi" on the  Independent Television channel, and to subsequently endow the  idea of a "conspiracy" with a certain credibility in a string of  other "conspiracies" in yet another edition of "Itogi," using to  this end Dmitriy Furman and Aleksandr Minkin.    This is yet another example of how representatives of the  liberal intelligentsia, in a rather traditional manner, benefit  the forces of counterreform and the adversaries of democracy by  rousing our society and spreading the catastrophic sentiment. We  ourselves provoke, and fertilize the soil for the appearance of  Zhirinovskiys, and we ourselves are later overcome by hysteria  and panic, naturally blaming the authorities for everything. We  truly do not know what we are doing.    Putting it plainly, the rallying ability of liberalism is  poor. For a long time I failed to understand why the leaders of  our democracy did not get around to explaining to people what  kind of society we wanted to build, what our new ideals were,  and so on. After all, our fellow citizens may be suffering even  more from uncertainty, lack of confidence in the future, and  what to them appears to be hopelessness than from economic  hardship.    Later, I understood that raising the issue in this manner is  in principle unacceptable to them (the liberals), it sickens  them. Are any additional explanations needed, given that we live  by the laws of common sense, that the market economy will sort  everything out, and that the mechanism of a rule-of-law state  has been set in motion? Either an excessive workload or some  other cause is preventing the fathers of our liberal democracy  from recalling that even the most liberal society, for example  the American, needs slogans and lofty ideals which mobilize and  rally the citizens. They do not shun patriotism or spit upon the  state.    Since liberalism hardly has a clearly mapped-out positive  social ideal at all (apart from generalities concerning  property, legality, and so on), and since it shuns notions such  as "patriotism" and "statehood," and treats even the notion of  social justice as cheap social populism, it--liberalism--cannot  become a foundation for rallying democratic forces.    The camp of liberal democrats is doomed to disintegration  under pressure from real life. We observed this after August  1991, during the period between 21 September and 3-4 October,  and on the eve of the elections; we are observing this now.  There is no theoretical, ethical, or any other foundation on  which the democratic forces could rally, except for the fear of  a return of totalitarianism. All appeals to those whom we  associate with democratic parties, blocs, and so on, not to feud  or splinter, and instead to rally and unite--they are all a  waste of time. A common platform should be developed first, or  at the very least the scope of common interests for the struggle  "for" rather than "against" should be determined.  <H5>  Everything in Its Proper Time </H5>   It would be incorrect to say that Russian liberalism is  alien  on our national soil. Liberalism is rooted in Russian  history--in social thought and movement. It is inseparable from  the "superfluous people" and "Westernism." Indeed, the dissident  movement which always considered the Western type of democracy  and public life in general to be its model certainly was a  mighty source of liberal ideas.    Undoubtedly, the sudden "flare-up of love" for the West, the  United States in particular, as a response to the hatred  artificially fueled by Bolsheviks played a role, too. This love  made its presence known as early as the period of Gorbachev's  perestroyka. Our naive belief that "the West will help us"  certainly was a factor. Having renounced confrontation, having  removed the "iron curtain," having made major, at times  unilateral concessions to the West, they said, we deserve the  right to have the West respond in kind--to help us rise from the  ruins of postcommunism.    Still, the response to our communist past was the main  reason  for the rise of liberalism in Russia. Since communism was  rejected, its antipode, liberalism, gained favor (even more so  given our national inclination to rush from one extreme to the  other). However, the weakness of Russian liberalism also abides  here.    First, the hopes for Western aid were not justified. Second,  a transition from communism to democratic forms of existence  turned out to be an exceptionally difficult endeavor. Besides,  this transition implemented on the model of a liberal market  economy favored by the West entailed many unfavorable  consequences. Third, the principles of liberalism with their  emphasis on civil rights and freedoms, the freedom of human  personality in all of its manifestations, began to depreciate  quite rapidly at the stage of revolutionary transition from one  social formation to another against the background of the sudden  impoverishment of many people, the unprecedented rampage of  crime and, correspondingly, the aggravation of nostalgia for the  past life in a united state. Fourth, many of our former  liberals, including dissidents, have turned into proponents of  authoritarianism.    In other words, liberalism somewhat prematurely proclaimed  itself to have in hand the situation in Russia, which apparently  is destined first to go through a different historic stage.  Nonetheless, I believe that the tree of Russian liberalism,  which, be that as it may, is deeply rooted in Russian society,  will undoubtedly grow and bear fruit. This will happen, although  not too soon.  <H5>  After All, Yeltsin Is Right Rather Than Gaydar </H5>   In general, a revolutionary transition from one social  system  to another is accomplished, as a rule, under conditions of rigid  authoritarianism or dictatorship. Likewise, a new statehood is  not at all built on the rubble of an empire on the basis of  liberalism.    This is all the more true because the entire previous system  of social orientation and spiritual values has been blown away.  Millions of people have literally become depressed. The  spiritual void has reached threatening proportions. This is  precisely the time to create new myths and new social utopias,  the time for any strong remedy to appear with a view to  overcoming the state of depression of the nation and creating  prerequisites for regular social well-being, if not for  enthusiasm.    Nationalism has turned out to be the strongest idea capable  of playing an integrating role at the initial stage of  postcommunist development in virtually all former republics of  the former USSR. To be sure, nationalism is dubious and  dangerous for Russia in every respect. First, nationalism would  unavoidably grow into great power chauvinism in this country  which has multiple ethnic groups, given the underdevelopment of  the Russian people's ethnic awareness. Second, it would rather  become a disintegrating factor for Russia itself. Third, Russian  nationalism, if it were to pick up steam nonetheless in the  spirit of our ability to be extreme, would inevitably make our  relations with virtually the entire world hostile and would  destroy the process of integration within the framework of the  CIS.    The ideas of patriotism, statehood, our spiritual heritage,  and our best traditions have always been genuine integrators for  Russia, and are certainly ready to be such at present. It  appears to me that Boris Yeltsin has grasped or felt deep down  the need to make the idea of statehood foremost. It was the  mainstay of not only his message to the Federal Assembly but  also quite of a number of presentations that followed.    It is precisely with the idea of statehood and patriotism,  among other things, that a path toward social accord must be  sought. I just do not see another idea. A strong state is a  guarantee of overcoming the crisis faster, a prerequisite for  mounting a vigorous struggle against crime.    However, it is also the most important condition for the  exercise of civil rights and liberties. If a person is afraid  for his life and the lives of his family, if he is afraid to go  out during the evening hours, and has altogether stopped feeling  secure, all talk of democracy, freedom, and so on turns into  irritating demagoguery.    When Yegor Gaydar slights the idea of state regulation all  the more because the most powerful state sector exists and  speaks scornfully about the "advocates of state," I want to  repeat the jocular statement all of us know well: "Yegor, you  are not right."    First, the opinion of the people who in the course of the  elections voiced dissatisfaction with the results of reforms  cannot be ignored. The real weight of radical democrats in our  society cannot be ignored, either. Second, as reforms are being  carried out, we cannot forget about the people. With all the  talk about "lobbying" and credit "infusions" into the  agro-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and  the fuel and energy complex, we somehow lose sight of the fact  that tens of millions of people work in these sectors. We must  not fail to think about their fate hiding behind generalities  about the ineffectiveness of the state sector and the  kolkhoz-sovkhoz system.    At times, it seems to me that Gaydar and some of his  colleagues have just forgotten where they live and work. In the  country that is called Russia, millions of people have  frequently agreed to certain death. However, in the name of  what? Was it for "cash on the barrel?" No! It was in the name of  an idea, but by far not the one known as the "American idea"--a  nice house with amenities, a lawn, affluence, personal  independence, dignity, and so on.    The "Russian idea" is a spiritual idea. Frequently (if not  always) it is steeped in utopianism and the setting of  unrealizable goals. This is the root of many of our troubles. A  change of values should take place which, in turn, should be a  product of a more rational mass conscience, which is what  happened with other (European) nations in their time. This  process is already underway thanks to, among others, the "new  Russians"; however, an entire stretch of social development will  be needed for it to be completed. Nothing will work on the fly,  in a cavalier fashion in this instance. Or else new values will  be rejected and historically progressive reforms will fail, as  happened in Iran under the shah.    We are, after all, a nation of astounding extremes! Just as  furiously as our grandfathers fought the "hateful" capitalism in  the name of the unknown, enticing socialism, their grandsons are  fighting socialism in the name of capitalism, having no real  knowledge of either one of them. The whole point is that appeals  to go back to a stern reality which is based on common sense  cannot be as inspiring as appeals to press ahead and fight for  an unknown bright future.</p>

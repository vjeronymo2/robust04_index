The project, with an estimated cost of 1 million U.S.  dollar,  was an outcome of a recent China visit by Indian National Dairy  Development Board Chairman V. Kurien and Managing Director  Amrita Patel who was in Nanning to attend a seminar on buffalo  milk production.    During their stay in Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang  Minority Autonomous Region, Kurien and Patel held discussions on  dairy development based on buffaloes with local Chinese  officials.    The proposal mooted envisages that the Indian side would  provide design and other administrative knowhow to China, the  sources said.    India is also reportedly to have expressed its willingness  to  give 300 elite buffalo embryos and 50,000 doses of frozen semen  from elite buffalo bulls in order to boost dairy development in  the region.    A diplomat in the Chinese Embassy confirmed that the project  is still waiting for approval by both the governments.</p>

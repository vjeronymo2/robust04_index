			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> GRAY, ROBINSON DISAGREE ON INJURY  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson and cornerback Jerry Gray continue to have differing  opinions on the state of Gray's left knee.  </P> <P> Robinson says it might be just a matter of confidence, but he held Gray out of  the Rams' 17-13 victory over Houston Sunday because he felt it was obvious Gray  "couldn't function" against the Steelers the previous week.  </P> <P> "It's a sore knee that he's been ineffective playing on," Robinson said. "We  want to get him back to where he can be the best he can be. With the present  set of circumstances, he's unable to be effective."  </P> <P> But Gray says he feels fine and is ready to go.  </P> <P> "I'll play this week," he said. "I felt like I could play (Sunday). I did some  lobbying, but coach felt it was better if I waited." JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

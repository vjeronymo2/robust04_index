			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK water As the regulatory squeeze on the water industry gets tighter, shareholders will demand more by way of efficiency. That extends beyond control of operating costs and delivering capital projects within budget. The net debt of the 10 privatised water companies is likely to rise by around Pounds 8bn through the second half of the decade. The cost to shareholders of borrowing at unattractive rates could be great. So far the companies have had access to cheap debt through the European Investment Bank. Perhaps a quarter of all capital spending can also be funded through leasing deals. But the EIB will only lend so much, while underground assets such as pipes are unsuitable for leasing. Bond market borrowing is therefore likely to play a greater role, even though the companies' efforts have produced mixed results. Only Welsh Water borrowed in the public markets when bond yields were at their trough earlier this year. Anglian's Pounds 100m sterling bond issue in December 1990 now looks expensive, although the company's index-linked bond six months before has proved better value. With revenues linked to inflation, index-linked should be an ideal form of finance for water companies. There are tax problems to overcome, but the bigger hurdle may be companies' belief that they can out-guess the bond market on inflation and get cheaper funds by borrowing at fixed rates. Given their dismal record at most activities outside water and sewerage, shareholders might prefer a more risk-averse approach.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Senada Cumurovic -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Cumurovic] The situation in Bihac County, which  is protected by a UN resolution, was first assessed militarily.  Brigadier General Arif Pasalic, assistant to the defense  minister for military affairs, elaborated on the situation.    [Pasalic] In the past 15 days, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor,  assisted by Fikret Abdic's so-called western Krajina forces, has  been conducting an offensive against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  5th Corps. The consequences of this aggression are a great  number of killed and wounded, most of them civilians, and based  on the military situation in the past 24 hours, the  Serbo-chetnik aggressor's lines have moved.... [sentence as  heard]    [Cumurovic] This offensive perpetrated by the aggressor  further complicates the already grave situation in the area  under control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 5th Corps. So  far, 1,500 civilians have been killed, 160 of them children.  Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic discussed the letter that  Fikret Abdic sent to Milosevic and Tudjman, in which he set a  meeting in Velika Kladusa at which issues pertaining to the  status of the so-called west Bosnian Krajina would be reviewed.    [Alispahic] We know that Fikret Abdic and his [word  indistinct] are in touch with these people. Moreover, they have  open support from certain people in these countries [Serbia and  Croatia]. We have uncovered open cooperation with the chetnik  forces, which, together with the western Bosnia army members,  are taking part in the attacks [words indistinct]. This open  cooperation and support that has been extended by the two states  has (?encouraged) Fikret Abdic to launch an open, terrorist  conflict, which has been very damaging for Bihac County.    [Cumurovic] A successful operation of the Bihac (?Security  Service) cut short the terrorist activity of Abdic's group.    The humanitarian situation is critical, particularly in the  past 10-15 days, since the aid deliveries have been suspended.  [Words indistinct] 78 metric tons of food were delivered to  Bihac, while Velika Kladusa received 108 tons of food in the  same period of time.    Only one state delegation has visited this area to date,  stressed Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, because one of the  essential problems is the region's isolation from other parts of  the republic. The Bihac region is also isolated in terms of  communication, since the only way to communicate is through ham  radio operators because reestablishing telephone lines has  proved impossible. There is a possibility of having a satellite  link in the future, explained Minister for Reconstruction and  Development Munevar Imamovic.    At the end of the open part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government session, at which the situation in the Bihac County  was reviewed, a decision was made to call for a UN Security  Council session that would review the situation in the area.  Second, it was concluded that a corridor had to be opened via  Licko Petrovo Selo, which would ensure that aid for Bihac would  no longer travel via Velika Kladusa. Moreover, it was decided to  ask the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to move its warehouses  from Velika Kladusa to Bihac. The proposal to open Bihac  airport was also supported, as was the need to enable the return  of deputies. [sentence as heard] Finally, it was stressed that  the government had so far twice sent humanitarian aid to the  legitimate bodies of authority, and that it had enough aid to  alleviate the grave situation in the Bihac region.</p>

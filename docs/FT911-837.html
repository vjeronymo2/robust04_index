			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Soft drinks war takes on a hard edge - Paul Abrahams on Coca-Cola's plan of attack on the market in the Middle East A NEW conflict is set to bubble over in the Middle East following the decision this week by the Arab Boycott of Israel Office to lift a ban on Coca-Cola. For the two titans of the carbonated beverage industry - Coca-Cola and PepsiCo - are preparing for a long, drawn-out battle. The prize for these prime propagators of US cultural imperialism is a commanding position in a one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Before the Gulf war, the combined effect of the climate, Islam's prohibition on alcohol and a Middle East population explosion, was a 20 per cent growth rate in carbonated drink sales. Although the Middle East represents only 8.5 per cent of the non-US market, it is worth about Dollars 4.25bn a year. This is, after all, a Dollars 90bn industry. The problem for Coca-Cola was that PepsiCo benefited from most of those sales. 'The Middle East is the only major area where Pepsi has market leadership,' admitted Mr Neville Isdell, president of Coca-Cola's division that serves the Arab world. 'Our aim is to redress the balance to the natural order of things: in the non-US market outside the Middle East, Coca-Cola out-scores Pepsi by a factor of four to one.' Optimism overflows at Coca-Cola's Atlanta headquarters. The company claims to have been successful in the few Arab countries where Coke has been available in spite of the ban. The Arab Boycott Office banned its products after Coca-Cola franchised Israeli bottling plants during the 1960s. Mr Isdell points out that Coca-Cola is now level with Pepsi in Egypt after starting from zero in 1979. And after entering most Gulf states two years ago, the group has about 18 per cent market share, according to Mr Isdell. The end of the ban is more than welcome news for Coca-Cola, which was badly bruised during the Gulf war. The Persian Gulf cola campaign witnessed a victory almost as overwhelming as General Norman Schwarzkopf's. While the world's television screens were dominated by images of US troops carrying cans of Pepsi, sightings of Coca-Cola were rare. Pepsi, which has five bottling plants in Saudi Arabia, claims to have sold 95 per cent of the 3m cases of carbonated soft drinks it estimates were consumed by US the military in the Middle East since August. (Each case contains 24 8oz cans.) Coca-Cola disputes Pepsi's estimates, reckoning Coke captured about 30 per cent of the military market. Whatever the true figure, Saudi Arabia was the worst of battle terrain for Coca-Cola, admitted Mr Isdell. Coca-Cola only re-entered the Saudi market two years ago and has no manufacturing facilities there because of a legal dispute with its old Saudi bottler. During the war, the company was forced to import from its plant at Al Ain, far from the front on the Abu Dhabi border with Oman. Pepsi claims it maintained its 87 per cent dominance of the Saudi civilian market during the conflict. To add insult to serious financial injury, Pepsi then scored one of the biggest product placement triumphs in cola war history. When the Iraqis came to sign the cease-fire, the only beverage on the negotiating table other than water was Diet-Pepsi. The reason? General Schwarzkopf, mindful of his waist, has a weakness for the bubbly black stuff. Pepsi executives were jubilant when they saw the bottles, said Mr David Jones, president of PepsiCo in the Middle East and Africa. But the company decided not to exploit its publicity coup, he added. 'Doing a media blitz about our supplies to the US military would be a double-edged sword,' he explained. 'While it might be appealing to our American customers, it might not be so appealing to those in the Middle East whose sympathies during the conflict were a little closer to Mr Saddam Hussein.' Both companies are now preparing to invest in distribution infrastructure. 'We want to make sure a cold product is only an arm's reach from desire,' said Mr Jones. Meanwhile, the cola warriors are hoping for peace in the Middle East. 'To be honest, we prefer supplying locals than armies,' explains Mr Jones. 'It's better for business.'</p>

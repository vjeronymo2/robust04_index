The "quadripartite agreement" allows the Vienna-based  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO) to inspect nuclear  installations of partners to the agreement. The Brazilian  Senate ratified the agreement last Wednesday [9 February],  apparently under pressure from the Federal Government.    On Friday, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said this "will  create a stronger nonproliferation basis to allow continued  cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy."  The Federal Government hopes Brazil will shortly ratify the  Tlatelolco Agreement on creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in  Latin America and the Caribbean, the ministry said. The German  company Siemens-KWU is building the Angra II nuclear power plant  near Rio de Janeiro.    According to reports in the Brazilian press, the Federal  Government threatened to stop nuclear cooperation after 1995  unless Brazil admits IAEO inspectors. At the moment, routine  inspections can only be carried out on appointment and in  certain installations. If there is a founded suspicion of  radioactive material being used for military applications, the  IAEO may also examine the sensitive area of uranium enrichment.  Brazil had repeatedly been suspected of being far advanced into  building a nuclear bomb.</p>

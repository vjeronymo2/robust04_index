			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Wang optimistic despite loss WANG Laboratories, the faltering US computer maker, reported another quarterly loss, but expressed confidence that improved liquidity, further belt-tightening and a new product strategy boded well. Wang, which has been in the black for only one of the past 10 quarters, suffered a Dollars 48.9m loss - 30 cents a share - in the three months to March 31. It lost Dollars 146.6m (90 cents a share) a year earlier. Revenues fell by 16 per cent to Dollars 500m, in line with earlier warnings that a tailing-off in sales of the company's word processors and mini-computers would more than offset advances in its new electronic-imaging products. Mr Richard Miller, chairman, blamed the third-quarter slump on the recession in general and in the computer market in particular. But he noted that cash reserves of Dollars 194m were at their highest for 18 months. He said the downturn had slowed the momentum of Wang's turnround efforts, and that further austerity measures were being considered. Mr George Elling, analyst at Merrill Lynch, noted yesterday that Wang had been late in adjusting to changes in the computer industry. 'It has a major challenge to restructure its overall business,' he said. 'The question is how long the transition will take.' This year, Wang unveiled a strategy called Office 2000, designed to computerise many paper-intensive office jobs. A product line will be designed to allow financial institutions, government departments and other large paper users to scan documents, and then store and retrieve them electronically.</p>

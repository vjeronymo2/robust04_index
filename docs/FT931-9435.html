			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Trusts eye smaller companies SMALLER companies are finding favour on both sides of the Atlantic with the creation of two smaller companies investment trusts. Foreign &amp; Colonial US Smaller Companies is, as its name implies, a trust managed by F&amp;C which will hunt for bargains among the smaller companies in America. It will take the same long-term capital growth approach as F&amp;C's US Smaller Companies unit trust, which leads its sector over five years, and will share the same managers. On standard counter-cyclical principles, this might not seem a good time to dive into the US. According to Finstat, F&amp;C's unit trust has grown by 56.6 per cent over the past six months, a growth rate which is scarcely sustainable. But the dollar's recent rise against the pound accounts for much of the strong performance, and several economists are forecasting that this will continue, although more slowly. James Findlay, manager of the new trust, says the stronger dollar will help smaller companies competing mainly in the US domestic market, providing the conditions for them to out-perform larger concerns, and that economic recovery should allow growth. F&amp;C's management team also believes that many of the strongest performers of the past 10 years, bought on the strength of their brand name recognition, are now over-valued with low yields. This could lead to a switch of funds within Wall Street from larger to smaller companies. In order to limit the risk that the shares will move to a discount to net asset value, F&amp;C is giving the new trust a fixed life of 10 years and attaching warrants that allow the holder to buy shares, at 100p apiece, on November 30 in the years 1994 to 2002. Most investment trusts trade at a discount. The offer period runs until March 5 and dealings will start on March 11. Maximum Pep investment is Pounds 1,500, as the trust does not qualify for the full annual Pounds 6,000 allowance. Minimum subscription is Pounds 500. In the UK, Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, yesterday launched the Pilot investment trust which will target the 1,000 or so smaller companies with a market capitalisation of only Pounds 30m. Rutherford Asset Management, which will run the trust, say that given the recent cuts in interest rates and growing expectations of an improved economy, it expects smaller companies to offer attractive investment opportunities. Pilot's chairman, Sir Peter Michael, who also chairs Cray Electronic Holdings, said that those smaller companies which have survived the recession are particularly well placed to take advantage of an economic upturn. A total of 50m ordinary shares at 100p each are being offered, and Rutherford says Pounds 23m has been raised. Like the F&amp;C trust, the trust has a fixed life. One warrant is attached to five ordinary shares in an attempt to limit the perennial problem of investment trust new issues - that the shares fall to a discount to net asset value. Dealing starts on March 1. Investors would be able to buy shares at 100p from 1994 to 1998 by exercising their warrants. The trust will be wound up in 2000 unless shareholders wish otherwise, in which case its life will be extended for another five years. Shares in the trust qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep allowance but there is no Pep attached to it. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.</p>

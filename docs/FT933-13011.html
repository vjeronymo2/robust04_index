			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Efim decision likely next week FOREIGN bank creditors of Italy's Efim state holding company should know next week whether a majority has voted for legal action against the company, and, possibly, the Italian government. The vote followed a tense 3 1/2 -hour meeting of foreign bank creditors in London last week at which bankers were asked to consider various options, including legal action. The increased tension between foreign bank creditors, which provided about L3,500bn (Dollars 2.2bn) of Efim's total borrowings of about L8,800bn to financial institutions, follows mounting dissatisfaction among creditor banks at the failure to receive initial repayments, a year after Efim was put into voluntary liquidation. Shortly before initial repayments were due at the end of April, a representative of Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator running Efim, said the situation would be frozen until a dispute over swap contracts undertaken by Efim was resolved. The issue has since been overshadowed by the European Commission's refusal to approve the Italian government's repayment plans. However, one banker involved said: 'Even if the Commission gives its approval tomorrow, the Italians will not pay us back until the swaps are sorted out.' The dispute has incensed foreign bank creditors and raised a serious point of principle. Although only one transaction is involved, bankers are trying to reconstruct whether other transactions may be at risk.</p>

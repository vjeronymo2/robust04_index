			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Up to date at the click of a mouse Engineers in manufacturing typically spend around 40 per cent of their time looking for information - everything from Cad drawings to memos - but when they find it they often have no way of knowing if they have the latest version. Now Computervision has launched a product called VirtualStation which aims to solve the problem. This allows users to manipulate and review information spread across multiple systems, sites and storage media from a single workstation. The accumulated information of the organisation is available at the click of a mouse, says Computervision, where previously the user may have needed a workstation, a PC and, perhaps, an Apple Mac to access all the information.

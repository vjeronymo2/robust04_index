			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Liberia's one-week-old Transitional Council has got  down to business today with a bid to seize the political  initiative, even though some important differences between the  three main factions still have to be settled. A new cabinet was  supposed to take office today, with members drawn from the  interim government, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia], and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in  Liberia], just like the council itself, and although that has  been delayed, the council has taken important decisions over the  currency and over the control of Liberia's natural resources.  Miss Nii Nartey Alison reports in this telex from Monrovia:    The Transitional Council declared both the old and the new  $5  notes legal tender throughout Liberia. Until today's  proclamation, the old bank note known as the J.J. -- because it  bears the picture of Liberia's first president, J.J. Roberts --  had been primarily used in areas controlled by Charles Taylor's  NPFL. The new note, the Liberty, has on its face the seal of  the Republic of Liberia and had been the legal tender in areas  controlled by the former interim government of Amos Sawyer.    Prior to the civil war, the J.J. was the medium of exchange,  but it was declared illegal by Sawyer's government when it was  discovered that most bank notes in the country had been looted.  The move, however, was resisted by Charles Taylor. He declared  the Liberty illegal in his enclave.    The council also declared that the National Transitional  Government had full authority over the country's mineral  resources and that only people designated by the state council  could engage in the export of minerals. This proclamation is  clearly designed to stop the NPFL and ULIMO from exploiting the  natural resources within areas they occupy.    Meanwhile, the induction of cabinet ministers is due to be  held today, but it appears that the controversial posts of  ministers of foreign affairs, defense, justice, and finance have  not yet been resolved. Appointees of the NPFL yesterday failed  to show up at a breakfast time confirmation hearing. Instead,  they flew to Gbarnga by helicopter for consultations.    [Later in the cast, BBC World Service in English adds the  following: "The new transitional council in Liberia has  dissolved the three armed factions involved in the four-year  civil war and the previous interim government. Although all  five council members signed the decree, the two ULIMO members  immediately issued a press statement saying it was a violation  of last year's peace agreement. They said it was the  institutions set up by the factions that were meant to be  dissolved, not the factions themselves. The council, which was  sworn in last week to guide the country to free elections, also  declared all natural resources under its authority. A BBC  correspondent in Monrovia said the clause is clearly designed to  stop the former factions from extracting taxes and export duties  for themselves. The council was expected to install its cabinet  ministers today."]</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: Bruised by the cherry pickers - Serious Money Cherry picking may sound like a harmless occupation but in the insurance industry it has led to some consumers finding home and motor insurance difficult to afford and for others, impossible to find. The most recent issue of Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, says that as well as putting up prices often by 'ridiculous' amounts and paying out on fewer claims, some insurers are refusing to quote altogether for those considered a bad risk. This is partly the result of a growing policy of insuring good risks while turning down the rest - cherry picking. Insurance companies can choose whom they insure but in some cases, the selection criteria are being applied over-zealously, it concludes. The problem for many people is that if their insurer refuses to renew their policy they have to declare this in applications to other companies, lessening the chance of finding cover elsewhere. Which? contacted 16 insurers anonymously for quotations on a three bedroomed house in London with two theft claims (for Pounds 900 and Pounds 1,400) in the last year. Only one of the insurers was prepared to quote and when the exercise was repeated, reducing the second claim to Pounds 230, only six companies quoted. Although the research is not rigorous - it is not clear, for example, what type of insurance companies were contacted and some may argue that the sample is too low - the report does draw attention to an increasing problem. If people with a history of just two claims are regarded as 'bad risk', is the UK heading for the type of insurance discrimination which exists in some parts of the US, where insurers are alleged to be engaged in 'red-lining' by refusing to insure commercially unattractive risks, often in deprived urban areas? The Association of British Insurers does not believe that many people find it impossible to find cover. Companies are willing to insure them but at a price which consumers may not be prepared to pay, it says. However, the ABI does agree that insurers have become more selective in the past few years in the risks they are prepared to take on. Insurance companies have reacted to losses due to storm damage in 1990 and subsidence in 1990 and 1991, as well as the rising number of claims. Domestic theft claims rose steadily from under Pounds 300m in 1989 to Pounds 749m in 1992. Property insurance claims more than doubled in a single year from Pounds 1.8m in 1989 to Pounds 4.3m in 1990 but have fallen since. There is another reason why insurers have become more selective. Direct writers, which sell insurance through a combination of telephone sales and mass media advertising, have been a fast-expanding business. Direct Line pioneered telephone-sale insurance and has made handsome profits for its parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland by concentrating on the low-risk market. Others have been only too happy to follow. This has been good news for lower-risk consumers since the increased competition in the market has allowed them to obtain cheaper insurance than before. Large composite insurers have decided, in the main, to pass on the full cost of increased premiums to 'bad risk' customers rather than to subsidise them by putting up premiums for other customers. Given the competitive pressures of the market, the insurers calculated that they would lose the good risk customers to the direct writers. This is where the selectivity has come in. Many insurers have changed the way they rate risks, through measures such as postcode rating to identify areas of subsidence or higher than average crime. However, most of the large composite insurers are back in the black after reaping the benefits of premium rate increases of an average 20 per cent per year in 1991 and 1992 in the home and motor market. Does this mean that premiums will soon come down for higher risk customers? If too many companies are chasing too few good risks, premiums are likely to be driven down, which indicates that there should come a point where the less risky customers are no longer a profitable source of income. Moreover, insurers are likely to find that they will need to be less selective if they want to expand their business. There are already signs that the market is changing. Direct Line is this year to start issuing policies for 'non-standard risks' to motorists and householders who find it difficult or expensive to obtain cover. A number of companies have launched cheaper and less comprehensive cover for higher-risk customers as insurers question how much holders of home insurance policies value some of the extras - such as legal expenses cover or freezer contents insurance - offered as a matter of course. Brokers, the insurance industry's traditional middle men, who were cut out by the direct writers, have ironically become more valuable than before. A good broker will know which insurers to contact for the higher risk customers. In spite of the cherry picking, higher-risk customers should not despair that they are becoming increasingly uninsurable but should continue the time-consuming business of searching for the best insurance.</p>

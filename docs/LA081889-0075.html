			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL WOULD REVOKE CASUAL DRUG USERS' LICENSES  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) announced Thursday that he will introduce  anti-drug legislation that would penalize casual users by revoking professional  and driver's licenses and would give the governor authority to divest state  investments in countries "not exerting their best efforts to stem the flow of  drugs" into the United States.  </P> <P> Condit, who is the Democratic candidate in a Sept. 12 special election to fill  the 15th Congressional District seat vacated by the resignation of Rep. Tony  Coelho (D-Fresno), was joined in announcing the legislation by Los Angeles  County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, a Democratic candidate for state attorney  general.  </P> <P> Condit and Reiner acknowledged that the bill faces an uphill battle with only  one month left in the current legislative session. The broad legislation would  launch an assault in the war on drugs by substantially increasing penalties for  first-time offenders and "hitting them where it hurts the most," Reiner said.  "The casual or so-called recreational user of drugs has been given a free  ride," Reiner said. The proposal would put an end to "the de facto  decriminalization of drugs" that exists under the current system of light  penalties for first offenders, Reiner said.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, professionals holding state licenses, such as physicians  and barbers, would have those licenses suspended for up to one year, and  elected officeholders would be forced to resign, if convicted of drug offenses.  Convicted juvenile users and dealers would lose their driver's licenses until  age 18 .  </P> <P> On a broader scale, the legislation would permanently ban financial  institutions convicted of laundering drug money from doing business in  California. It would also give the governor authority to divest state  investments in countries seen as uncooperative in stemming the flow of drugs  into the United States.  </P></p>

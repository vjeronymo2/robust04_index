Brown, Esq. at the above address; Telephone (703) 358&hyph;1744.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  50 CFR part 32 contains provisions governing hunting and fishing on national wildlife refuges. Hunting and fishing are regulated on refuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the wildlife resource, (3) protect other refuge values, and (4) ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adopting State hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On other refuges, it is necessary to supplement State regulations with more restrictive Federal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities, as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations may be issued only after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird hunting, upland game hunting, big game hunting or sport fishing through publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . These regulations may list the wildlife species that may be hunted or are subject to sport fishing, seasons, bag limits, methods of hunting or fishing, descriptions of open areas, and other provisions as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Previously issued refuge-specific regulations for hunting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishing are contained in 50 CFR part 32. Many of the amendments to these sections are being promulgated to standardize and clarify the existing language of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A proposed rule was published in the July 20, 1994, issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 37134) and comments from the public were solicited. The only comments received were from the Region 3 Office (Service) to point the omission of ``Kirtland's Warbler Wildlife Management Area'' under the State of Michigan. This unit had been opened to hunting on July 27, 1987, but was inadvertently dropped from the listing of open areas. The administrative change has been made to correct this omission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to permit the use of any area within the Refuge System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any purpose, including but not limited to, hunting, fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and public recreation, accommodations and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the major purpose(s) for which the area was established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

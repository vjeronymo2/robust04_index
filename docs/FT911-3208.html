			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Kleinwort p&amp;l will cover Pounds 12m loan loss Kleinwort Benson said yesterday that losses on its loans to Ojai Capital had been fully provided for in its 1990 accounts, writes David Lascelles. The losses amounting to Pounds 12m were disclosed in the group's annual report which was released on Monday. The provisions were included in the Pounds 67m which Kleinwort set aside last year. Ojai Capital was formed by Mr Kenneth McCormick, a former Kleinwort director, to invest in Californian real estate and business start-up ventures. Kleinwort decided last year that the venture was no longer financially viable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--Sources close to the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations expect Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres to visit Cairo on 24 April to supervise the  Palestinian-Israeli talks so as to reach agreement on the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.    The sources said that next week might mark the final round  of  these negotiations, as Peres and PLO Executive Committee member  Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will try to give impetus to the  talks to conclude them. They added that the agreement could  possibly be signed during the first days of May.</p>

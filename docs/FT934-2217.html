			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Production begins of hatchback Carina E Toyota yesterday started production of a hatchback version of its Carina E saloon at its Burnaston plant near Derby, John Griffiths writes. The new model will account for half of the plant's output, which is to rise to 100,000 units next year from 37,000 this year. Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) said the rise would lift the company's spending with its 200 European suppliers to Pounds 380m next year from Pounds 100m this year. The rise is partly due to European content rising ahead of schedule. Mr Yukihisa Hirano, the company's managing director, said that local content would reach 80 per cent by the end of next year, about six months ahead of schedule. It has risen from 60 per cent when the plant came on stream last December to 70 per cent, the company said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Volkovskyy by V. Maevskyy; place </F> and date not given: "We Now Have a Holding Company!"]    [Text] A regulation was recently adopted on  joint-stock holding companies, and, on 16 May, Anatoliy  Volkovskyy was appointed chairman of the board of Ukrresoursy  State Holding Company. A PRAVDA UKRAINY correspondent met with  the new executive and first of all asked:    [Maevskyy] Anatoliy Filippovich, you will have to pardon us  but neither the masses of workers nor I know what a holding  company is.    [Volkovskyy] A holding company is an association of  joint-stock companies that owns a controlling package of stock  in each member of that association. Let us say the ministry is a  purely state organization, while a state holding company  includes not only state enterprises, but also joint-stock and  leased ones.    Reformation of state property in accordance with the  privatization program led to the existence of enterprises with  various forms of ownership. This, in turn, brought about a loss  of state control over branches of national economy; loss of  control over utilization of property and direction followed in  enterprise activity. This likewise occurred in the  material-technical supply field, where there is practically no  government management at all, and there are no new forms  reflecting the market relations yet, even though they are needed.    As a result, mutual ties are lost, organizational unity is  disrupted, volumes of wholesale trade in production-technical  types of products has decreased, and the property of warehousing  complexes, which were built over a long period of time and were  designed for organizing product delivery, has been dispersed.    Wholesale purchases today are not what they used to be. The  state does not subsidize them, turnover is not fulfilled, and  the enterprise itself selects where it is to buy what it needs  and who to work with. There is no one to control that, and  vertical management has been disrupted.    Enterprises have now, on the average, cut their production  by  half. While, in state management, nothing has changed. At the  ministry or in the committee, workers are on a budget. You come  to the office, there is a chair for you, a table, a fountain  pen, and you get paid your wages. This in no way depends on the  lamentable situation at the enterprises. These enterprises,  already incorporated, leased, or private, are all those that  formed a part of the former Gossnab [State Committee for  Material and Technical Supply], and it cannot control them. What  happened is not just a detachment of enterprises from the state,  but a direct break. As a result, a new management organ was  created--the state joint-stock holding company.    [Maevskyy] If I understand it correctly, we do not have  bankruptcies, and a poorly operating enterprise still gets a  subsidy from the government.    [Volkovskyy] There is a concept called clearing up. That is  aid for enterprises. You work for a newspaper and know the  situation with newsprint. At the same time, we have an  enterprise in Zhidachov capable of producing such newsprint.  But, since the coupon today is not convertible, the enterprise  is unable to purchase pulp for itself, and, without that, no  newsprint can be produced. The enterprise is heading toward  bankruptcy not because of its own fault. Who would want it to  close? The newest equipment is available, there are personnel,  and there is a need for newsprint. But, our monetary system and  monetary relations with Russia disrupt everything.    [Maevskyy] They could really provide Ukraine with newsprint?    [Volkovskyy] There are decisions of the Supreme Council and  decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers, but, with our current  situation, all we can do is darn the various holes. Zhidachov  needs a million dollars to replace machinery, the building  already exists, and then start newsprint production. They could  produce 40,000 tonnes. Last year, Ukraine imported 20,000 tonnes  through state deliveries. At present the editorial offices of  many newspapers make direct purchases on their own. Some 80,000  tonnes were consumed.    [Maevskyy] Well, we found out something about the holding  company, now tell us about yourself.    [Volkovskyy] I progressed through life step by step. I was  born in 1938, have a wife and two sons. Served in the army,  worked at construction projects, graduated first from a  construction technical school and then the economics department  at the university. Worked with the oblast planning committee,  then transferred to the oblast supply and sales organization  that was part of the Gossnab system. Later, during  reorganization of that service, I was transferred to Kiev as  head of the main directorate. I assumed my present post after  leaving the position of first deputy chairman of the State  Committee for Material Resources.    [Maevskyy] By any chance, do you engage in sports?    [Volkovskyy] I used to be very interested in skiing during  the winter in Ukraine and when I served in Podmoskovye. I  participated in the All-Union army competitions. At present, I  have no time for sports. My Saturdays and Sundays are busy.    It is necessary to learn to think in a new way, and a new  organization of labor is required. I would like to do everything  possible in order to improve the social sphere. After all, it  makes no difference to the commercial structures who they sell  to, the same markup is made for enterprises, for kindergartens,  and for hospitals, which today have nothing at all--no sheets,  no garments...    [Maevskyy] Or medicines, alas.    [Volkovskyy] Medicines are the concern of the Ministry of  Public Health. In general, the government should take supply  upon itself. I believe that euphoria from the Snickers and Mars  candy shall pass, since our own confectionery products and  sausage have always been better than those from abroad.    It is merely necessary to contribute less to the economics  of  political struggle. It is important not to break all ties for  political reasons. No matter who is shouting or what is shouted,  Ukraine does not have pulp and apatite and never will have them,  there is no rubber. We cannot and should not live in economic  isolation.    [Maevskyy] Thanks for the discussion.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIP BRUISE TO SIDELINE BOWSER FOR KEY GAME  </P> <P> The hopes of the Cal State Northridge men's basketball team rest largely on the  performance of the Matadors' largest player, Todd Bowser.  </P> <P> CSUN, therefore, with its 6-foot, 8-inch, 280-pound junior center seated  squarely on the bench, will be an underdog tonight against Cal State Dominguez  Hills, a team that likely will contend for 1 of the 4 berths in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. playoffs.  </P> <P> Bowser is sidelined because of a deep bruise in his left hip, an injury  suffered Thursday night in a home game against Chapman.  </P> <P> A chase for a loose ball ended in a collision between Bowser and the bleachers  behind the Chapman bench.  </P> <P> Score it a TKO for the bleachers. It took several minutes before Bowser, a  3-year starter, was helped up and led to the training room. X-rays of the hip  taken Friday afternoon at Encino Hospital were negative, according to Jim  Bowser, Todd's father.  </P> <P> Todd Bowser and CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy could not be reached for comment Friday  night.  </P> <P> Northridge was leading Chapman, 30-26, when Bowser left the game with 4:50  remaining in the first half. Chapman rallied to win, 79-74, dropping CSUN to  11-6 overall, 2-2 in conference play.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills also has an 11-6 record. The Toros are 3-1 in CCAA play, their  only loss coming to second-ranked UC Riverside, 59-58, on Jan. 19.  </P> <P> Anthony Blackmon, a preseason Division II All-American, is Dominguez Hill's top  player. He leads the CCAA with averages of 19.5 points and 9.6 rebounds a game.  </P> <P> Blackmon, a 6-8 senior, has been a pain in the hip to Northridge because he  scores a lot of points away from the basket. Blackmon's penchant for the  perimeter made him a tough man-to-man match-up for the bulkier Bowser.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOY REUNITED WITH MOTHER AFTER 8-YEAR SEPARATION;  </P> <P> CUSTODY: A YOUTH LEARNS THAT A HUNTINGTON BEACH WOMAN, AND NOT THE WOMAN WHO  MARRIED HIS DIVORCED FATHER, IS HIS NATURAL MOTHER.  </P> <P> A 12-year-old Huntington Beach boy who was allegedly abducted by his father at  age 4 and taken out of state has been reunited with his mother for the first  time since the incident, police reported Saturday.  </P> <P> The father, Wayne Collinsworth, 30, allegedly left California with his son in  1982 amid divorce proceedings, according to a complaint the boy's mother filed  with Huntington Beach police.  </P> <P> Sgt. Larry Miller said the mother, a Huntington Beach woman whose name was not  released, was reunited with her son Friday at Orangewood Children's Home, the  county's center for abused and neglected children.  </P> <P> Miller did not know whether the boy was at the shelter, saying that he only  knew the child was "placed there" on Friday to "facilitate the reunification  with the natural mother."  </P> <P> Police said Collinsworth has remarried, and the boy had been told that his  father's second wife was his real mother.  </P> <P> "The boy did not know of his real mother and had to be told by Huntington Beach  police that she existed," Miller said.  </P> <P> The mother notified police of the pending case when she suspected that her  ex-husband and the boy had returned to Huntington Beach to live with  Collinsworth's parents.  </P> <P> No arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation.  </P> <P> Neither Collinsworth nor the boy's mother could be reached for comment.  </P></p>

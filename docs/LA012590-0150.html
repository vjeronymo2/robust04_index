			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SUPPORTS MOVE TO ELEVATE EPA TO CABINET;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: BACKERS SAY THAT THE CHANGE WILL ENHANCE THE AGENCY'S INFLUENCE.  LAWMAKERS HOPE TO HAVE THE BILL TO THE PRESIDENT BY EARTH DAY.  </P> <P> WASHINGTON -- President Bush endorsed legislation Wednesday that would make the  Environmental Protection Agency the 15th Cabinet-level department, and leaders  of the drive told him they hope to have a bill ready for his signature by the  April 22 observance of Earth Day.  </P> <P> Speaking at a news conference one day after the legislation was introduced in  both the House and Senate, Bush told reporters he had concluded that  environmental issues "are so important that they must be addressed at the  highest level of government."  </P> <P> His endorsement reflected a turnaround from his initial opposition to expanding  the Cabinet.  </P> <P> The move is expected to have overwhelming support within Congress and the  environmental community. Although the change would be largely symbolic,  supporters said it would enhance the influence of the environmental agency and  its administrator.  </P> <P> "The President's endorsement means that the bill will now speed through the  Congress," said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense  Fund. "It has symbolic importance, certainly, but it is also substantive. By  giving the EPA administrator a seat at the Cabinet table, there will be an  environmental voice that will create a different kind of Cabinet dynamic."  </P> <P> Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a principal sponsor of the Senate bill, had been  discussing the measure with Bush since last June in an effort to get the  President's endorsement.  </P> <P> The measure has bipartisan sponsorship in both houses of Congress. Sen. William  V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) joined Glenn in introducing the Senate version, and Reps.  John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Mike Synar (D-Okla.) joined Frank Horton  (R-N.Y.) and William F. Clinger Jr. (R-Pa.) in offering a similar measure in  the House.  </P> <P> The EPA was created during a surge of public interest in environmental issues  in 1970. After languishing during the early years of the Ronald Reagan  Administration, the agency has come to exercise powerful influence as a  watchdog and enforcer of clean air and water laws.  </P> <P> EPA Administrator William K. Reilly often has attended meetings of the Bush  Cabinet and has operated as a de facto member of the Administration's top  policy councils.  </P> <P> Supporters of the legislation said official Cabinet membership will mean that  environmental considerations will be addressed sooner in national policy  discussions and budget decisions.  </P> <P> In addition, they said, the EPA will be positioned to deal more effectively  with other government agencies, such as the Department of Energy, with which it  has significant conflicts.  </P> <P> Sources said the elevation probably would not result in a significant expansion  of the agency or its functions. And while Bush's endorsement was warmly  received, some lawmakers were quick to note that the step in itself would mean  little unless the administrative rearrangement is accompanied by vigorous  environmental policy.  </P> <P> "It's not enough to just pull an extra chair to the Cabinet table," said Sen.  Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn). "This Administration has to prove this represents a  substantive commitment to policy action, not just a new decorator at the White  House."  </P> <P> The legislation would make the EPA the 15th Cabinet agency, joining the  departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and  Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State,  Transportation, Treasury and Veteran's Affairs.  </P> <P> In addition to making the EPA a Cabinet-level department, the Glenn-Roth bill  would create a Bureau of Environmental Statistics to collect, coordinate and  resolve conflicts in environmental data and establish an interagency committee  on global environmental change.  </P></p>

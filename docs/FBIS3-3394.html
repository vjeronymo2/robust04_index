			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By station reporter Yang Fan; from the "NPC and CPPCC </F> Special Sessions" program -- passages within quotation marks  recorded]    [Text] Listeners and friends, the party and government  have always showed much concern for the productivity and lives  of people in impoverished areas, and attached much importance to  aiding them. Tremendous achievements have been made in the work  since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee. In particular, since reform and opening up, the  party and government have taken various measures to strengthen  work for helping the poor. For example, funds have been  increased and traditional means of helping the poor have been  readjusted and improved to change the nature of such work from a  relief to a development orientation.    It has been proven in practice that implementing  development-oriented work for aiding the poor by taking into  account market demand, relying on scientific and technological  progress, as well as developing and utilizing resources of  impoverished areas to promote commodity production, not only can  solve the problem of inadequate supplies of food and clothing,  but can also help get rid of poverty and encourage prosperity.  Currently, the measures have fairly rapidly changed the outlook  of a considerable number of long impoverished areas.    However, as China is a fairly large country with different  local situations and unbalanced development, progress in some  areas is still fairly slow and a number of people have yet to be  extricated from poverty. In particular, a small number of  people in especially poor areas are still living under very  difficult conditions.    Recently, the State Council formulated a program aimed at  extricating 80 million people from poverty in seven years, and  declared a final war against poverty. During the ongoing two  sessions [the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference National Committee], this  station reporter Yang Fan interviewed State Councillor Chen  Junsheng, head of the State Council's Leading Group for the  Economic Development of Impoverished Areas.    Yang Fan: "Mr Chen, I am a reporter from the China National  Radio. One of our government's major tasks this year is to help  impoverished people. Can you tell us what the government's  tasks are in this regard?"    Chen Junsheng: "The goal of our program for aiding the poor  is to extricate 80 million people from poverty in seven years.  We will help them solve the problem of inadequate food and  clothing. We will help them get rid of poverty and ultimately  become prosperous and achieve a comfortable standard of living.  We should not wait until the next century, but must accomplish  this task within the present century."</p>

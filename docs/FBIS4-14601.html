			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin report: "Algeria: The Terror Goes On"] </F>   [Text] This week another name has been added to the tragic  list of Russian citizens who have died in Algeria. On Monday  Konstantin Kukushkin, the 41-year old driver of our ambassador,  was killed in a suburb of the Algerian capital. His wife  Nadezhda and seven-year old daughter Irina had remained in  Russia.    The dead man was the fifth Russian citizen to have died in  Algeria at the hands of Muslim fundamentalists in the past six  months. The solemn tally was opened on 16 October last year,  when Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Valezhnyy and Lieutenant  Colonel Aleksandr Orlov, instructors at an air defense school in  Laghouat (400 km from the Algerian capital), were killed.  Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Loshchilin was wounded on that  occasion. In December the fundamentalists gunned down a Russian  citizen who was permanently resident in Algeria. On 12 February  this year V. Ovcharenko, a specialist working at a thermal  electric power station, was killed. Now K. Kukushkin has died.    Your ITAR-TASS correspondent has sent the details of this  tragedy. Kukushkin went to the Algiers suburb to buy essential  spares for the embassy's Lada cars. Having made the purchases  he returned to his Toyota minibus which was in a parking bay.  He got into the driver's seat and turned the ignition key. At  that moment two gunmen suddenly appeared (some witnesses say  there were three of them) and opened fire from revolvers aiming  at Kukushkin's head. Two of the shots proved fatal.    In the words of Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department,  the Russian foreign policy department and "other relevant"  departments are now working out a set of additional measures  designed to protect Russia's interests and the security of our  citizens in Algeria. Well, such measures are indeed necessary,  but in my view they should have been worked out long ago. After  all, the fundamentalists did not begin waging their war on the  Algerian authorities just yesterday.    To be fair, though, much has already been done. Since  November 1993 over 1,500 people have been evacuated to Russia.  The Algerians agreed to reinforce the protection of our  institutions, and specialists have been transferred away from  remote locations and housed together. On the other hand, in the  conditions of what is essentially a civil war, no security  measures can objectively guarantee the safety of our citizens  100 percent.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN UP-TO-DATE 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' AT THE REP  </P> <P> Cheers to the San Diego Repertory Theatre for putting the true Christmas spirit  into its 14th edition of "A Christmas Carol" on the Lyceum Stage.  </P> <P> The theater could have trotted out the same wonderful, heartwarming sure-fire  success that "A Christmas Carol" has always been for them -- and goodness  knows, at the end of a tough, controversial season like this past one, they  could have used something safe.  </P> <P> They could have cut costs by dusting off old sets, freshening up old costumes  and pulling out old props. Instead, director Walter Schoen looked at an  oft-overlooked side of Charles Dickens -- his role as a crusader against the  social injustices of his time -- and decided to address the sadnesses of our  own.  </P> <P> Instead of focusing on the poor of Victorian England, Schoen set this year's  "Carol" on a San Diego street where the homeless congregate. The prologue is  simple and brief: Some of the homeless, to keep warm, are burning books. One of  the books, pulled from the fire by a little boy who wants to hear a story, is  "A Christmas Carol." As the boy's mother reads the story, the homeless  community acts it out, using props from the street: a wastebasket with planks  of wood for Bob Cratchit's desk, a shopping cart with a coin changer for a  store.  </P> <P> Once the mother, played with rousing spirit by Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson, begins  reading the story, the script is the same sturdy, satisfying adaptation by  Douglas Jacobs that the Rep has always used.  </P> <P> One of the pluses of the contemporary opening is that it gives the show welcome  room to play with a range of retrospective styles. The dances, smartly  choreographed by Bruce Nelson, range from old English steps to break dancing by  the agile Nelson as Mr. Fezziwig. And the music -- beautifully orchestrated by  Linda Vickerman for one of the Rep's most able singing casts -- moves  effortlessly from gospel singing to old carols to modern pop.  </P> <P> Still, while the Rep's daring deserves praise, Schoen would have been more  successful if he had pushed his concept further.  </P> <P> The director seems to be after a "Man of La Mancha" effect, in which Dickens'  book, like Cervantes' manuscript in "Man of La Mancha," needs to justify its  existence if it is to survive. But he doesn't put enough force behind the idea.  </P> <P> When the boy saves the book from the fire, the man tending the fire just shrugs  instead of scolding him. There is an issue here for the man to raise; when  people are cold, isn't concrete warmth more important than storytelling ?  </P> <P> What needs to be pointed out more forcefully -- obvious as it may be to some --  is that this book is needed to warm these people's hearts even more than it is  needed to warm their hands.  </P> <P> Also, to elicit more sympathy for the homeless who act out the play, one needs  to establish characters -- even briefly -- who can show themselves to be  personally affected by the story in the end.  </P> <P> Why not have someone -- perhaps the small boy's mother -- beseech the vagrant  who is to play Scrooge for an extra piece of bread for her boy who is ailing?  Why not have her plead for the sake of the Christmas spirit, only to be turned  down by the fellow who -- in the true spirit of Scrooge -- doesn't see why  Christmas should be used as an excuse to take away a starving man's last crust?  </P> <P> Why not show the small boy, who does in fact play Tiny Tim, as being sick or  handicapped in some way? And when the story is over, might the man not help him  by offering him something to eat and an arm to help him walk?  </P> <P> Still, what does come through overwhelmingly is that this is a story with its  heart in the right place. The talented cast is a joy, from W. Francis Walters  as a crusty bourgeois Scrooge to Kory Abosada as both Tiny Tim and the youngest  Ebeneezer (a clever touch to help Scrooge identify with Tiny Tim), to Richard  Soto as Scrooge's ebullient nephew, Fred.  </P> <P> Thompson injects a welcome toughness to Mrs. Cratchit as well as to the part of  first narrator (several people narrate as the book is passed from hand to  hand), Damon Bryant lends weighty pain to Scrooge's dead partner, Jacob Marley,  and Maggie Stewart suggests an ethereal, musty air as the gentle Ghost of  Christmas Past.  </P> <P> The contemporary squalor of the sets by Thomas Buderwitz are clever in a  bittersweet way -- the vagrants' imagination of a feast is all wrapped up in  buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Cheez-Its, with empty soda cans  decorating the holiday wreaths. The costumes by Catherine Meachum find common  threads, literally, between contemporary layering of faded cloth and Victorian  layering of the same.  </P> <P> The lighting by John B. Forbes is excellent, and Schoen's direction is inspired  except for the curious beginning in which it is not clear when the play  actually starts.  </P> <P> The play's awkward opening is redeemed by an effective ending in which it  becomes clear that this story about Christmas does not end at the theater  doors.  </P> <P> As the theater crowds exit through a glittering, bedecked Horton Plaza, with  the homeless stretched out not far from the pretty and upscale stores, this  "Christmas Carol" becomes a powerful reminder of how urgently the ordinary  person, like Mr. Scrooge, needs to learn how to keep Christmas in his heart if  anything is to change.  </P> <P> Dickens would have liked this show.  </P> <P> "A CHRISTMAS CAROL"  </P> <P> By Charles Dickens.

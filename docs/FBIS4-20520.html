Biotechnology is also to receive  another G45 million in subsidies from ICES [expansion not given]  funding to improve the knowledge infrastructure.    After three years of negotiations, three ministries, six  universities, NWO and NIABA [Netherlands Industrial and  Agricultural Biotechnology Association] have agreed to set up  and subsidize ABON [Association of Biotechnology Research  Schools in the Netherlands]. During the NBC5 [Fifth Netherlands  Biotechnology Congress], ABON will present an overview of  current and future activities.    The association can count on strong government subsidies.  The five research schools participating in ABON will receive  subsidies of G22 million over five years: G10 million from the  Economic Affairs Ministry, five million guilders from the  Education and Science Ministry, five million guilders from the  NWO and two million guilders from the Agriculture Ministry. The  subsidies will be matched by the participating universities.  The total amount of 44 million guilders will create around 65  full-time research jobs in universities, in DLO [Agricultural  Research Department] and TNO [Netherlands Organization for  Applied Scientific Research].    The investment plan follows the main lines of the project  areas suggested by the NIABA, namely: "structure function  relations," "research of plant resistance," "metabolic pathway  engineering" and "integrated bioprocess development."    The four areas have been elaborated into a number of themes  which are both scientifically challenging and interesting for  the industry. Each area will have one or two research schools  managing the projects. In turn, each school has appointed a  professor to "lead" the projects.    In order to ensure that industry has input into the  activities, ABON will have a "Scientific and Industrial Advisory  Council" which will issue binding advice.  <H5>  Cooperation </H5>   The ABON unites five biotechnology research schools:    -- BioCentrum Amsterdam;    -- Biotechnological Sciences Delft Leiden (BSDL);    -- Experimentele Plantwetenschappen (EPW, of Wageningen);    -- Voeding, Levensmiddelen, Agrobiotechnologie en Gezondheid  (VLAG, of Wageningen);    -- Groningen Biomolecular and Biotechnology Institute (GBB).    The BioCentrum Amsterdam will concentrate on fundamental and  applied research. The connecting theme will be the growth and  development of living organisms including yeast and bacteria.    The BSDL will deal with three areas: industrial plant  biotechnology, environmental biotechnology and industrial  biotechnology.    GBB will concentrate on the atomic structure and function of  biomacromolecules.    EPW will gather knowledge on four themes: the development of  plants and differentiation; disease and resistance to disease;  metabolism and energy location in plants; plant biotechnology.    VLAG will cover the entire agricultural area and more  specifically three core themes: nutrition and health; food  technology and food; food resources and agro-biotechnology.  <H5>  Knowledge Infrastructure </H5>   In addition to the ABON, there is more good news for  biotechnology. Last week the cabinet approved two major  biotechnology projects to strengthen the knowledge  infrastructure: biotechnological soil purification will get G25  million, while biotechnology's material infrastructure can  expect G20 million.  <H5>  Soil Purification </H5>   Universities (including Groningen), large technological  institutes, engineering consultants and companies will  participate in the first project covering biotechnological soil  purification. TNO, Grondmechanica Delft and Heidemij have  developed a program for cleaning up polluted business land on  site, called NOBIS [Netherlands research program for  biotechnological on-site cleaning]. The goal is to develop the  biotechnological clean-up of polluted soil using micro-organisms  to break down the pollution.  <H5>  Material Infrastructure </H5>   The second biotechnology project in ICES is called MIBITON.  The cabinet wants it to strengthen the material infrastructure  of biotechnology research in the Netherlands. MIBITON is a  positive reaction by the cabinet to a proposal from ABON and  NIABA. These two bodies have drawn up a joint investment  program for the coming five years which includes a one-time  boost from the government, the G20 million mentioned above.  This amount will be supplemented with industrial resources  worth around G12.5 million in the form of the revolving fund for  industrial investments. In order to effectively monitor these  investments, NIABA and ABON will set up the PPSB foundation  [public-private biotechnology cooperation] in close consultation  with the government.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DESIGN FOR COMFORT, ENTERTAINING;  </P> <P> MEDITERRANEAN-STYLE, TWO-STORY HOUSE OFFERS MIX OF LUXURY AND PRACTICALITY.  </P> <P> Spectacular Mediterranean styling centers on the two-story, arched, glass entry  of this custom home. Its angular garage, bay windows, hand-detailed plaster  parapets, wood solar shades, tile roof lines and the rooftop deck are blended  to shape the exterior of this four-bedroom, 3,170-square-foot home.  </P> <P> With the needs of a family that enjoys entertaining in mind, the entire first  floor has a layout that provides spatial and visual flow. The  beveled-glass-lighted central entry hall -- with tile floors, curved stairway  and arched porticoes -- introduces visitors to the multilevel living and dining  rooms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> View Through the Arch  </P> <P> The view through the right arch is of the living room fireplace -- framed by  the curving staircase above; the formal room has a clear view and access to the  circular rear garden entertainment patio.  </P> <P> Even a demanding gourmet cook would be at home in this luminous-ceiling,  island-style kitchen. Special features include a marble slab for making pastry,  wine rack, separate island sink providing a second work area, a desk and  bookrack, sliding-glass pass-through window and a pair of venting skylights  over the double kitchen sinks.  </P> <P> The kitchen has direct access to all adjoining rooms, and the hall that leads  from the garage. The exposed-beam-ceiling family-den, located directly off the  kitchen, has a dining nook with a garden view and a pair of doors to both  patios.  </P> <P> The second floor is designed to provide the master suite a maximum of privacy.  Features include a full walk-in closet and built-in dresser, tiled shower with  attached spa open to the bedroom, corner fireplace and private patio with log  storage.  </P> <P> This house was built with a portion of the attic designed as an adult loft, set  over the master closet and rooftop deck above the flat-roofed entry hall. A  spacious laundry is set between two closets for better sound control. The  second and third bedrooms are planned with views and ample storage in mind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plenty of Room for Hobbies  </P> <P> The three-car garage includes two work bench areas, allowing plenty of room for  family hobbies and direct access to the house for added security and ease of  unloading groceries.  </P> <P> Large-scale sample floor plan and exterior elevations for Plan 48805 can be  purchased for $19.95. Fully detailed custom-style working drawings are $98 for  the first set and $68 for each additional one ordered at the same time.  </P> <P> Allow at least four weeks for delivery.

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US call for trade goals with Japan AN IMPORTANT US private sector advisory panel has called on the Clinton administration to negotiate a series of specific trade targets with Japan, aimed at boosting US manufactured exports. Failure to achieve these 'temporary quantitative indicators' within an agreed time span would result either in further negotiated measures or US sanctions, says the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations in a report to the president. With the trade community awaiting a cogent Clinton trade policy, the report is receiving particular attention. It supports only 'restrained use' of trade sanctions, but says they must be used if trade pacts are violated. Although US manufactured exports to Japan have increased at an annual rate of 13.1 per cent since 1989, the rate of increase has slowed dramatically. The bilateral trade imbalance has become 'a lightning rod politically' in the US and it may well become a political problem worldwide for Japan, the report says. At the start of the Bush administration, the committee recommended a programme including fiscal and monetary changes. This eventually became the Structural Impediments Initiative, under which both countries agreed to take macroeconomic steps to improve the trade balance. The panel's latest report says Japan has done well with its Dollars 85bn supplemental budget proposal to stimulate domestic demand. But it urges it to take further steps to reduce Japanese savings, increase consumption and discourage anti-competitive business practices. The US has done less to meet its commitments. Savings and investment have declined as a percentage of gross domestic product and the budget deficit has shown no improvement. 'As long as the US economy remains biased toward consumption and the Japanese. . . . toward production, the US will have a significant trade deficit with Japan,' the report admits.</p>

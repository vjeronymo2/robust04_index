			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL FOR DELAY IN BUYING GUNS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, whose hard-core opposition to gun controls helped get  him elected, on Saturday signed legislation making California the nation's  first state to impose a 15-day waiting period on the purchase of recreational  rifles and shotguns.  </P> <P> Using a phrase reserved for his own pet political initiatives, the Republican  chief executive termed the Democrat-authored bill a "common sense approach" to  deal with criminals and the mentally unstable.  </P> <P> Partisans on both sides of the issue agreed that the legislation will be more  far-reaching than the ban on assault weapons, which was enacted last year,  because the new law will affect millions of ordinary Californians who buy  firearms for sporting purposes or self-protection.  </P> <P> Elated gun control advocates forecast that the action by Deukmejian and the  California Legislature will help overcome heavy resistance to pending federal  gun control legislation.  </P> <P> "I think this is going to provide the momentum we need to pass a sensible  national gun policy," said Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc.  "This enormous victory with such a comprehensive gun law is not going to be  lost on lawmakers across the country, especially in an election year."  </P> <P> But one top official of the National Rifle Assn., whose organization was first  dealt a stunning defeat when California banned military-style assault weapons  last year, sloughed off enactment of the 15-day waiting period bill as  "irrelevant" elsewhere.  </P> <P> "People don't follow California in any knee-jerk reaction," said Richard  Gardiner, Washington-based director of state and local lobbying for the NRA.  "California passed the (assault gun) law, which Gov. Deukmejian signed, and not  a single other state passed anything similar. Not one."  </P> <P> Starting next Jan. 1, the bill by liberal Democratic Assemblyman Lloyd G.  Connelly of Sacramento will extend to hunting rifles and shotguns the 15-day  waiting period long required of handgun purchases. This will make  over-the-counter and private sales of virtually all firearms subject to the  delay while authorities run background checks on the purchasers.  </P> <P> Additionally, criminals involved in gun-related misdemeanors and dangerous  persons involuntarily detained under existing law for 72-hour psychiatric  examinations will be prohibited from buying shotguns and rifles for at least  five or 10 years, respectively.  </P> <P> "It will help save the lives of many innocent victims," Deukmejian said in his  regular weekly radio broadcast. "And it represents a common sense approach to  dealing with the criminal element in our society."  </P> <P> Backers of the bill -- including police chiefs, sheriffs and rank-and-file  officer organizations -- lobbied hard for the measure. They argued that a  15-day wait would provide a "cooling off" period and help curb impulsive crimes  of passion in which family members are often slain.  </P> <P> It is not certain what effect the waiting period will have on gun sales before  it goes into effect in 1991. Last year, gun stores were inundated by  last-chance buyers shortly before the prohibition on assault weapons took  effect.  </P> <P> When he was elected to his first term as governor in 1982, Deukmejian was a  longtime foe of new restrictions on firearms. He strongly sided with the NRA  and other gun owner groups in opposing a gun control initiative on the same  ballot.  </P> <P> That proposal, Proposition 15, would have required the registration of legally  acquired handguns and prohibited most sales of additional new revolvers and  pistols. Deukmejian's opponent, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, endorsed the  initiative. Deukmejian narrowly defeated Bradley and the initiative lost by  nearly a 2-1 margin.  </P> <P> Many analysts have credited Deukmejian's opposition to Proposition 15 and the  support he received from gun owners for his own election victory. But last  year, he shocked both sides by coming out in favor of banning assault weapons  and imposing a 15-day waiting period on long guns.  </P> <P> Political intimates of the governor have said he was profoundly shaken by the  1989 murders of five Southeast Asian refugee children in a Stockton elementary  school yard by a deranged gunman, Patrick Purdy, who wounded 29 other children  and a teacher. Reloading twice, Purdy sprayed at least 105 rounds from his  legally purchased assault rifle into the children and then killed himself with  a pistol, also lawfully obtained.  </P> <P> Although voicing support for the "concept" of the Connelly bill, Deukmejian  during the last two weeks sent puzzling and ambiguous signals about whether he  would sign or veto it. The bill was Connelly 's first gun control measure and  the lawmaker said Saturday that he lost sleep worrying about a veto.  </P> <P> Connelly conceded that the new law will not come close to eliminating  gun-related crimes in California, but based on experience, "we know for a hard  fact that 10,000 folks who otherwise would purchase firearms will be precluded  from doing so."  </P> <P> State officials estimate that about 1 million background checks will be  conducted annually on purchasers of long guns. Already, about 300,000 checks  are run on handgun buyers.  </P> <P> The NRA has argued that waiting periods for gun purchases inconvenience  law-abiding citizens and do not work because criminals get firearms from  illegal sources anyway. The NRA does, however, support proposed computerized  "instant" background checks that would link gun sellers to police records.  </P> <P> In his radio speech, Deukmejian said he will pursue unspecified legislation to  automate the background checks, a proposal favored by Assembly Republicans and  the NRA.  </P> <P> The new law will roll back the waiting period for rifles and shotguns from 15  to 10 days in 1996 in anticipation that an automated system in the state  Department of Justice would be operational by then.  </P> <P> Other gun bills are pending in the Legislature, but their future is uncertain.  One would require prospective handgun purchasers to enroll in firearm safety  classes, while the other would restrict the number of bullets in ammunition  magazines to 15.  </P> <P> Brian Judy, the NRA's California lobbyist, said polls showing public support  for controls reflect a "lack of understanding of the issues and ramifications.  We intend to start getting out our side of the story better than we have, raise  the educational understanding and have an impact in the (1990) California  elections."  </P> <P> Relatively soon, Congress is expected to take up the so-called "Brady bill" to  impose a nationwide seven-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns, and  separate legislation to outlaw the domestic manufacture or sale of assault  weapons or the importation of such arms.  </P> <P> James Brady is the former White House press secretary who was severely wounded  in the 1981 attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Brady and his  wife Sarah, of Handgun Control, have made the bill's passage a personal cause.  </P></p>

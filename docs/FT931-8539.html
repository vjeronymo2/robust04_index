			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris strengthens on hopes of rate cuts MANY continental markets reflected nervousness ahead of last night's State of the Union address in the US, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS built up momentum towards the close with strong performances from the financial sector on renewed hopes of an easing in European interest rates. The CAC-40 index, which had been as low as 1,867 earlier, finished 26.80 higher at 1,904.97, a gain of 1.4 per cent on the day. Turnover was also strong at FFr3.1bn after Tuesday's FFr2.4bn. A slight easing in the Bundesbank's variable money market rate also helped to encourage the belief that interest rates will come down in the short term. UAP gained FFr15 to FFr544, Suez rose FFr7.00 to FFr287.20 and Societe Generale put on FFr2 to FFr626. Rhone-Poulenc, whose 1992 results were well received, saw its investment certificates improve FFr8 to FFr550 while the shares eased FFr1 to FFr548 ahead of entering the CAC on Monday. FRANKFURT recovered from Tuesday's post-bourse fall of about 20 points in the DAX index, following that day's tumble in the Dow. The DAX closed only 10.96 lower at 1,653.26 as selling pressure failed to materialise. Turnover fell from DM7.3bn to DM6.1bn. Dealers said that foreign investors, who had taken their profits on Wall Street, were putting some of their money into the D-Mark via German equities. Siemens, they said, was a case in point as it closed only DM1.70 lower at DM650. Elsewhere there were falls virtually across the board in financials, carmakers and chemicals. In the latter sector, Degussa emerged with less damage than most, slipping DM1.50 to DM358.50 after a 14 per cent gain in December quarter profits was offset by a forecast of nil profits growth for the full year. ZURICH saw selling in chemicals on fears over the President Bill Clinton's planned reduction in US health care costs. The SMI index fell 17.5 to 2,112.9 as Roche certificates slipped SFr70 to SFr4,100 and Ciba-Geigy fell SFr11 to SFr665. In industrials, Brown Boveri and the cement producer Holderbank, fell by SFr50 to SFr3,880 and SFr7 to SFr584 respectively. MILAN, beset by rumours regarding Fiat and Olivetti, came back from a weak opening, the Comit index closing 1.74 lower at 498.53. Turnover was estimated to be in line with Tuesday's L242bn. Fiat has been influencing the market throughout the week as investors continue to ignore the group's denial that it plans either to sell some of its assets, is about to announce a joint venture or that Deutsche Bank is to lift its shareholding. The shares fixed down L150 at L4,949 before rising to L5,270 on the kerb. Olivetti became the latest subject of speculation as some investors took the view that Stet might be interested in the group but, as with Fiat, there was no substance to the reports. Olivetti fixed L99 higher at L2,020. STOCKHOLM saw a decline in Astra following the decline in US pharmaceutical stocks overnight. The pharmaceutical stock had been strong ahead of next week's 1992 results but the B lost SKr13 to SKr689 yesterday, as the Affarsvarlden general index fell 10.6 to 974.0 in high turnover of some SKr1.1bn after Tuesday's SKr724m. Volvo was another big loser with a SKr14 decline in the B shares to SKr380. MADRID reacted to pressure on the peseta, which came under heavy pressure against the D-Mark in foreign exchange markets. The general index closed 0.95 lower at 232.50. AMSTERDAM marked time, Royal Dutch picking up 80 cents to Fl 153.10, following the completion of Opec talks in Vienna, while the CBS tendency index slipped 0.6 to 97.7. ISTANBUL soared 8.6 per cent to an all-time-high of 5,756.49, compared with the previous high of 5,749.69 on August 2, 1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. Turnover also hit an all-time high, of TL800bn. Brokers said that reports of major deposit rate cuts planned by three leading banks, sharp rate falls in the bond markets and cash flooding the lira market due to bulky bond maturities all helped boost demand.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- February 17                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes           Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1115.62    1116.92    1118.17    1118.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1172.10    1173.03    1173.10    1174.86  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Feb 16     Feb 15     Feb 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1123.14    1132.97    1129.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1179.54    1184.15    1181.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1118.18    1118.38    1119.86    1121.77 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1171.80    1172.21    1172.97    1173.51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Feb 11     Feb 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100          1126.71    1121.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1175.45    1171.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1122.32 ; 200 -  1175.86 Low/day: 100 -  1115.62  200 -  1170.25  .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

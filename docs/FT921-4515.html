			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: On the turntable How time flies. Remember a punk band from the late 1970s called the Sex Pistols? Didn't EMI sign up the group and then drop them after the group had released only one record because it was worried about the bad publicity? And didn't Richard Branson's Virgin records then release their album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, which contained a track called EMI? It was not a flattering little ditty and ended with a loud raspberry. Presumably, Thorn EMI now owns the rights to the company song.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Malawi leader rules out resignation MALAWI'S President Kamuzu Banda said yesterday he accepted the result of this week's democracy referendum but that his government would not resign or be replaced by an interim administration, Reuter reports from Blantyre. The life president said the two-to-one vote for multi-party rule presented voters with a choice of political systems but did not give the opposition the right to form a transitional government. 'What the people of Malawi have said in this referendum is that they want other political parties to be formed in this country to compete with the (ruling) Malawi Congress party,' Mr Banda said in a radio broadcast. Opposition leaders rejected his statement, accusing him of clinging to power and violating the spirit of the referendum.</p>

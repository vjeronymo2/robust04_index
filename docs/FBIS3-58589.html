The Swiss Foreign Ministry made  the announcement without providing details, but an investigating  judge says he is continuing enquiries, hoping for new  developments in the affair.    France reneged on previous extradition pledges and expelled  the two wanted men last year. The expulsion caused a diplomatic  row between France and Switzerland and the Swiss justice  minister, Arnold Koller, said on Wednesday that Switzerland  would raise the subject with the Council of Europe, if  necessary. He said France should explain why the Iranians were  not extradited as originally agreed. The two Iranians are  wanted in connection with the killing of an Iranian opposition  leader, Kazem Rajavi, in Geneva nearly three years [as heard]  ago.</p>

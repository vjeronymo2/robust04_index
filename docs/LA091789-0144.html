			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: RESISTING THE PULL OF TRADITION;  </P> <P> JASMINE BY BHARATI MUKHERJEE (GROVE: $17.95; 190 PP.)  </P> <P> We receive periodic messages -- daily, it sometimes seems -- to the effect that  the line between our First World and the Third World grows less and less  distinct.  </P> <P> The news from the urban slums and ghettos, the fragility of the suburbs, the  swamping of public systems of education and health, the widening gap between  rich and poor, corruption or laxity in the IRS, the savings and loan industry  and the housing agencies, the drug and AIDS epidemics -- all these suggest that  the control of life that we always thought of as marking a developed society is  slipping away.  </P> <P> The messages come in; we hear them but don't really absorb them. Each new one  -- the video of a hanged Marine colonel, for example -- is a new shock. "Yes,  there is a world out there," we think, and the thought dissipates.  </P> <P> Bharati Mukherjee's novel, "Jasmine," is an artful and arresting distillation  of these messages. A Hindu woman flees her family's poverty, and the Sikh  terrorism that bloodies her village and claims her husband's life, and comes to  the United States.  </P> <P> After a time in New York -- only a foreign eye could fix the world of the Upper  West Side with such hilarious and revealing estrangement -- she moves to a  small town in Iowa. In corn and hog country -- now prey to farm foreclosures  and despair -- she marks with unsparing brilliance the symptoms of a new Third  World.  </P> <P> "Iowa's dull and flat," a New York friend had protested when he heard she would  move there. "So is Punjab," she replied. It could be the epigraph for this  unsettling and finely written book. Jyoti -- moving westward, she becomes  successively Jasmine and Jane -- is an immigrant of a different kind.  Traditionally, America thinks of its immigrants coming here in order to be able  to say: We are you. Jasmine's message is: You are us.  </P> <P> Mukherjee interweaves Jasmine's past and present, juxtaposing her childhood and  growing-up in the Indian countryside with her time in New York and her present  life in Iowa. The juxtaposition, which can be breathtaking, serves to fortify  her comparisons. Her childhood took place amid the collapse of a millennial way  of life. In Iowa, her symbol for America, a briefer but even more powerful way  of life is ending.  </P> <P> Jasmine is a rebel; she will not get caught. She flees India and, at the end,  she will flee Iowa. The book begins when, at age 7, she refuses to accept the  prophesy of a holy man that she will become a widow and an exile. He swats her  and she falls down, gouging a hole in her forehead. The scar, she insists, is  her third eye, denoting wisdom.  </P> <P> She is precocious, beautiful and arrogant. She feels the pull of tradition,  both in India and in Iowa; but she will not let it pull her down. She can look  both ways -- her argument to a New York physicist for the submersion of the  individual will in the mind of God is comedy that singes -- but ultimately she  moves one way: On.  </P> <P> Her wavering, though, gives richness to the book. She defies her traditionalist  father, who wants her to marry a farmer, and insists on studying. When she  meets an independent-minded young man, Prakash, she marries him in totally  untraditional fashion. In their brief married life, though, he must constantly  challenge her to go beyond the customary role of the Indian wife.  </P> <P> After youth comes violence. Prakash is killed by a Sikh bomb on the eve of  emigrating to the United States. Jasmine goes instead, entering Florida as an  illegal. The ship captain who smuggles her in rapes her in a motel; she stabs  him to death. The incident is horrifying but she tells it with fatalistic  levelness. All experience is experience.  </P> <P> In New York, she gets a job as an au pair to a trendy academic couple. Taylor  and Wylie treat her, to her astonishment, as a member of the family. Since  their daughter, Duff, is enrolled in a progressive kindergarten, her duties are  light. She finds herself earning $40 an hour as a language tutor to students in  the Asian studies program at Columbia.  </P> <P> It is an idyll but, as she puts it: "In America nothing lasts." Wylie falls in  love with Stuart, a Columbia colleague of Taylor's, while out  Christmas-caroling on the upper West Side. "Taylor's such a sweetheart," she  tells Jasmine, "and there's Duff and Stuart's three kids, but this is my chance  at real happiness. What can I do? I've got to go for it, right?"  </P> <P> Jasmine might have stayed -- she and Taylor have fallen in love -- but one day  she sees the Sikh, who killed her husband, selling ice cream in the park. It is  a premonitory hint of Third World infiltration. She flies to Iowa; in America's  heartland, she will surely be safe from history's turbulence.  </P> <P> But Iowa is not what it was. Desperate farmers attack bankers or commit  suicide. Bud, a local banker, has come back from a trip to the Far East with a  radically enlarged outlook. He is smitten with Jasmine, and she moves in with  him after he leaves his wife. Not only that; they adopt Du, a Vietnamese  refugee.  </P> <P> Jasmine tries to become "Jane," but it's no use. A farmer on whom Bud is  foreclosing shoots him in the back. He is confined to a wheelchair; Jasmine  must not only nurse him but offer him sexual relief in a highly complex  fashion. "I will do it," she says stoically.  </P> <P> "Care-giver" is indeed part of her divided nature, but only part. When Taylor  comes to get her -- it seems a hastily contrived ending -- she goes.  </P> <P> If Jasmine as a small and high-strung Goddess of Flux is comical in New York,  she is devastating in Iowa. Her level voice delicately but relentlessly brings  out the contradictions of a world trying in vain to resist or ignore the  passing of its self-confidence.  </P> <P> Bud is the perfect symbol. He is all-American yet he has left his all-American  wife to take an Indian mistress and adopt a Vietnamese son. He believes  passionately in farming but forecloses on the farmers.  </P> <P> In Mukherjee's tale -- glib and a trifle haughty, sometimes, but always  absorbing -- he is America itself; believing sincerely in its own good life and  good intentions, yet crippled to paralysis by the retribution that life takes  on any empire of faith that fails to move on with it.  </P></p>

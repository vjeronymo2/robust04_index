			<p>BFN     [Text] Jericho, West Bank, May 30 (AFP) -- Around 2,000  supporters of the Muslim fundamentalist group Hamas marched  through the autonomous enclave of Jericho on Monday [30 May], in  the first such demonstration since Palestinian self-rule.    Palestinian sources said the marchers, who converged on the  town from around the Israeli-occupied West Bank, went on to hold  a public meeting in a mosque.    Brandishing the Koran, the Moslem holy book, and waving  flags, they called for the "liberation of the whole of  Palestine." However, they steered clear in their slogans of  attacking the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal, which Hamas rejects.    Dozens of Palestinian policemen stood by, but there were no  incidents, the sources said. It was the first Hamas  demonstration here since the police took over Jericho in mid-May.    The Israeli army closed off access to the enclave for  Israeli  civilians to avoid incidents, military sources said.</p>

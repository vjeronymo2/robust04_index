			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Gambro rises 25% to SKr176m GAMBRO, Sweden's leading medical equipment manufacturer, announced yesterday a 25 per cent rise in its profits after financial items, to SKr176m (Dollars 29.8m), for the first three months of the year. Sales were up 10 per cent to SKr1.48bn. Mr Berthold Lindqvist, the company's president, said the favourable performance stemmed partly from the continuing integration of the US medical equipment company Cobe, acquired in 1990. He also attributed the improvement to product launches in recent years, rationalisation measures, and expansion in markets where Gambro had been active. He added that the company expected income for the year to exceed 1991's figure of SKr594m.</p>

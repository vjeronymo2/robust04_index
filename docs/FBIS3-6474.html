The "NSL" in South Korea is an anti-communist fascist law of  the worst kind in history, the article says, and goes on:    It is an anti-national, anti-reunification evil law that  defines the same fellow countrymen as the enemy and totally  denies national unity. It is a fascist law that most ruthlessly  tramples and cracks down upon the people's desire for  independence, democracy and reunification in South Korea.    The "NSL" defines all the organizations and population of  the  northern half of the country, the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and all the  progressive overseas Koreans living in different parts of the  world as "anti-state organizations" and "members of anti-state  organizations" and regards them as objects of "punishment".    It is a crime and a disgrace of the nation to have such  anti-national, anti-reunification evil law like the "NSL" that  denies the same fellow countrymen.    Terrorism, murders, unwarranted arrests and killing tortures  against dissident political forces and guiltless people  committed by fascist dictators in South Korea up until now were  "legalized" as a whole under the notorious "National Security  Law".    Unless the ill-famed "NSL" is abolished in South Korea, the  independence and democratization of society cannot be realized,  nor can the reunification of the country be achieved, nor can  human rights abuses be uprooted in South Korea.    The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors, however, are intending  to maintain the notorious "NSL" in a bid to incite North-South  confrontation and block the reunification of the country and to  further strengthen their "civilian" fascist rule in South Korea.  Kim Yong-sam is, indeed, a traitor to the nation who is pursuing  the treacherous policy against the nation, reunification and  democracy more maliciously than any preceding dictators of the  successive military dictatorial "regimes" did in South Korea.</p>

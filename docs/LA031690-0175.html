			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT DENIES HARRIS' APPEAL OF EXECUTION  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court today denied the appeal of condemned killer Robert  Alton Harris, making his April 3 execution at San Quentin more likely than  ever.  </P> <P> The convicted double killer is set to be the first man to die in San Quentin's  gas chamber in 23 years.  </P> <P> Harris is expected now to head quickly to federal court to press his argument  for a delay in his execution.  </P> <P> "We think the court's decision is the correct result. We are pleased the court  denied his request," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, head of the state's  death penalty unit. "Mr. Harris has had a substantial opportunity over the last  11 years to litigate these issues.  </P> <P> "We assume there will be some effort to take the case to federal court and we  are prepared to cover that should it arise," Gillette said.  </P> <P> Harris, 37, must persuade a federal judge there is enough merit in his current  appeal to halt the execution long enough to hear more detailed arguments or to  order the new penalty hearing Harris has requested.  </P> <P> Harris also has a separate request for clemency set for hearing by Gov. George  Deukmejian on March 27 at San Quentin.  </P> <P> The governor, who authored the state's death penalty law while attorney  general, is considered unlikely to reduce Harris' sentence to life in prison.  </P> <P> Harris and his brother, Daniel, bent on stealing a car to use in a bank  robbery, abducted two teen-age boys in the parking lot of a fast-food  restaurant and drove them to a rural spot outside San Diego.  </P> <P> The boys were shot by Robert Harris, who later drove back to his girlfriend's  apartment and purportedly ate the boys' leftover hamburgers while joking about  the killing.  </P> <P> The state's high court rejected the argument by lawyers for Harris that his  years as the object of severe child abuse left him victim of post traumatic  stress syndrome, similar to war veterans, and organic brain damage.  </P> <P> Harris contends that the new psychological information is the result of new  research on child abuse developed since his sentencing in 1979.  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington gets Dollars 40m for Coburn Optical Pilkington, the glass group, has agreed the sale of Coburn Optical Industries, a US subsidiary which makes spectacle and contact lens processing machinery, and expects to receive the Dollars 40.3m (Pounds 22.9m) cash consideration by its March financial year end. Coburn was put on the market last May when Pilkington hoped to sell it for more than Dollars 50m. It said yesterday that in the current climate the price achieved was not disappointing. It is likely to see a small loss on the sale. The purchaser is a private company controlled by Mr Robert Jepson, a US businessman. The disposal is part of Pilkington's programme of selling non-core activities which has raised about Pounds 200m over the last two years. The money will be used to reduce debt. Pilkington acquired Coburn when buying Visioncare, Revlon's eyecare business, for Pounds 361m in 1987, but it was not considered an essential part of that business. Although Coburn was profitable, Visioncare plunged into losses and its future was uncertain. When Pilkington reported interim figures in December it said that Visioncare had returned to trading profits, and since then has said it would not sell Visioncare.</p>

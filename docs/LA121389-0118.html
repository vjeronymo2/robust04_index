			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG PROFITS IN BRITAIN AFTER WATER UTILITY PRIVATIZATION  </P> <P> Britain's water companies made a big splash on London's stock market Tuesday as  some of the 2.7 million investors who bought stock in 10 companies in England  and Wales reaped instant profits when the shares began trading.  </P> <P> The controversial selloff of the companies was the latest in Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's sweeping privatization program and the third biggest after  British Petroleum and British Gas. Water utilities in Northern Ireland and  Scotland were not included in the offer.  </P> <P> The $8.4-billion (5.25 billion pounds) flotation had 5.7 orders for each share  offered. Delighted government officials hailed the demand for the stocks as a  reaffirmation of popular capitalism.  </P> <P> It was at one time the most unpopular of Thatcher's privatizations because  feelings ran high about putting the water authorities in private hands.  </P> <P> But an attractive offer price, a promise of lucrative dividends and generous  incentives, coupled with easy payment, turned what some analysts had predicted  would be a potential flop into a roaring success.  </P> <P> Northumbrian Water Group was the star performer, surging to $2.72 (1.70  pounds), compared to the $1.60 (1 pound) price at which the government sold  each share.  </P> <P> Other water companies made 64 cents (40 pence) or so on paper for their new  owners, but many investors could not take profits immediately because share  certificates will only be sent out Dec. 20.  </P> <P> Any purchaser of the new shares can trade them before he or she receives the  certificate.  </P></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Japan adopts public works bidding plan The Japanese government yesterday adopted a long-awaited programme to increase the transparency of the country's bidding system for public works projects and improve access to the market for foreign contractors. The move, which is expected to help avert sanctions by the US against Japan for its failure to open its public works market to foreign companies, comes just two days before a US deadline for a decision on whether to impose sanctions against Japan. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, hailed the measure as introducing an 'historic' change in Japan's public sector works. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, called on his fellow ministers to support the implementation of the measures which he said were 'internationally appropriate' and in line with the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Despite official enthusiasm, the plan is widely regarded in Japan as insufficient to change the close relationships between Japanese construction companies and public sector institutions and the collusive and exclusive business practices that characterise the country's construction market. It is unclear whether the programme will be seen as adequate in Washington. A US trade official said yesterday that the plan was being reviewed by an inter-agency committee which will make its views known tomorrow, the sanctions deadline. The plan, to be implemented in April, calls for the adoption of an open and competitive bidding system for public works projects sponsored by the central government and public corporations which are valued at SDR4.5m (special drawing rights) - Pounds 41.53m - and for those sponsored by prefectures and specified cities which are valued at more than SDR15m. For design and consulting services, the area of most interest to foreign firms, the thresholds above which an open bidding system will be the rule are SDR450,000 for central government projects and SDR1.5m for prefectural governments. More transparent guidelines on public tendering are to be drawn up by Japan's Fair Trade Commission and the experience of foreign companies outside Japan will be taken into account in evaluating the eligibility of foreign companies to bid for projects. Under Japan's present system, only companies which have been designated by the projects' sponsors are eligible to bid for a contract. Penalties against unfair practices will also be strengthened in response to criticism that past penalties have been too weak. Japan and the US will continue to assess progress by foreign companies in winning public works contracts. The plan opens a substantial proportion of Japanese public works projects to open bidding. Widespread implementation of the new measures will depend to a large extent on the size of the penalties against illicit practices which will be decided later this year.</p>

India and Uzbekistan today  expressed their resolve to counter religious fundamentalism,  extremism and terrorism and signed six agreements, including one  on comprehensive economic co-operation aimed at strengthening  bilateral relations.    An Indian bank and cultural centre alongwith an Indian Chair  in an educational institution will start functioning in  Uzbekistan shortly, while arrangements were also being made to  telecast Doordarshan programmes in this Central Asian republic.  The agreements signed at the conclusion of the Uzbek President's  visit also covered postal, telegraph and related matters,  telecommunications, setting up an Indo-Uzbek centre for Science  and technology, transport and transit.    Addressing a joint news conference after signing the  agreements, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the  Uzbekistan President, Mr Islam Karimov, said that there was  tremendous scope to increase bilateral trade and participate in  joint ventures to boost economic co-operation between the two  countries. Both the leaders stressed on building sounder  relations and reviving the historical relationship that has  existed between the two countries.    In reply to a question on the Kashmir issue, Mr Karimov said  that his country believed in the principle of non-interference  in the internal affairs of other states and favoured settlement  of problems through negotiations. "We intend to strictly follow  this policy at all international forums," he added.    In his opening statement Mr Rao said that during his talks  with Mr Karimov he had explained India's determination to face  cross-border terrorism so that people in their countries could  live in peace and devote their energies to promoting their well  being.    In reply to a question how Uzbekistan was coping with the  growth of religious fundamentalism, Mr Karimov said the people  and government of his country had been strongly resisting this  threat from Tajikistan. "Had it not been so I would not have  been sitting here today," Mr Karimov remarked.    He invited Indian businessmen to visit his country and set  up  joint ventures. Mr Karimov pointed out that of the 960 joint  ventures currently underway in his country a mere 14 were with  India of which only six were operational. "This is insufficient  for a great country like India," he said while revealing  statistics on Uzbekistan's rich mineral resources including  gold, natural gas and strategic minerals like uranium.    Mr Karimov said that his country attached great importance  to  the experiences of India as a successful secular democracy.  "India has been going along the democratic road for development  while being able to simultaneously preserve its national culture  and historic traditions. We are presently in a transition period  and are in the midst of transforming from a totalitarian state  to a free market economy. Our stress will be on attaining  self-reliance and preservation of our traditions and ethnic  identity. But we hope to learn from the experiences of other  countries who have passed through a similar phase," he pointed  out.</p>

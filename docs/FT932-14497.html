			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Lloyd's urged to delay Names' writs THE Association of Lloyd's Members has urged the insurance market to extend the moratorium on writs against names in the troubled Gooda Walker syndicates. Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the association, made the plea in a letter to Mr Brian Garraway, chairman of Lloyd's of London's regulatory board. The moratorium on all writs seeking to recover funds from Lloyd's Names is due to end on April 30. Members of the four Gooda Walker syndicates are among the worst-hit of the insurance market's Names - the individuals who supply its capital. Their losses amount to more than Pounds 900m, with many individuals facing losses of more than Pounds 1m. Following the release of a 200-page report on the four lossmaking Gooda Walker syndicates which was passed to the Serious Fraud Office last week, Mr Powell argues that the moratorium on writs against the Names should not be lifted. In the light of the report, he says, 'It is clear that Names will have been encouraged to join certain syndicates on the basis of a false prospectus.' The report focuses on the use by the Gooda Walker syndicates of 'time and distance' policies - reinsurance policies that allow Lloyd's syndicates to manage their reserves against long-tail claims, which emerge many years after the inception of policies - more effectively. Such deals allow insurers to 'discount' their reserves against future claims.</p>

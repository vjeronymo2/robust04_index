			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mexican brewer in Dollars 533m share issue Grupo Modelo, Mexico's largest brewing group, and its owners are set to sell 12 per cent of the company's share capital today in a two-tranche initial public offering worth 1.65bn pesos (Dollars 533m), writes Damian Fraser in Mexico. The primary and secondary offers, totalling 24.3m shares, at 68 pesos per share comprise the biggest domestic share issue of a non-financial group in recent Mexican history. They value the whole company at 13.77bn pesos, or 38.5 times earnings and 2.3 times book value. Modelo will become one of Mexico's most valuable companies, in terms of market capitalisation, and its shares will trade at a premium to those of Femsa, its main competitor. Best known for its popular Corona beer, Modelo accounts for more than half of Mexico's domestic beer market and two-thirds of the country's exports. The company will sell 5 per cent of its share capital in the primary offering, and its owners another 7 per cent in the secondary offering. Modelo said it would use part of the proceeds from the primary share offering to build a new brewery in the state of Zacatecas.</p>

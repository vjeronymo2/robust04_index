Having  become the meeting's chairman, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati delivered a speech on the reasons for holding the  meeting and ways in which ECO members can cooperate.    Mr. Velayati said: In order to achieve its aims, ECO needs  to  benefit from the experience and financial and technical  cooperation of specialist and international organizations. In  this connection, it is willing to provide part of the costs of  implementing joint projects. The foreign minister said that  progress will not be possible unless ECO members make serious  and constant efforts. He added: It is vital for the  organization to find new ways to expedite decisionmaking and the  implementation of projects.

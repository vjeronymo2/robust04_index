			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Hopeful signs of a reversal of fortune: Hilmar Kopper's plans to rebuild Deutsche Bank's reputation The old Banco de Madrid signs have been taken down from 300 branches across Spain, and those of Banca d'America e d'Italia are disappearing in Italy. In their place sits the familiar line-and-box symbol of their owner, Deutsche Bank. After a year of travails and controversy in Germany, Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche's chairman, does not disguise his delight that his bank's name retains its prestige elsewhere in Europe. Sitting in his wood-panelled office in Frankfurt, Mr Kopper recounts how the two banks asked to be re-branded. Their customers liked the idea of banking with Deutsche despite finding the name difficult to pronounce. 'Clients seem to like it, and they will practise very hard to be able to tell their relatives what their bank is called,' he says, his shoulders shaking with amusement. Mr Kopper has had few chances to laugh this year. Many Germans enjoyed the sight of their biggest bank being toppled from its pedestal by the Schneider and Metallgesellschaft affairs. This not only revived traditional German antipathy to the Macht der Banken (power of the banks), but raised doubts about Deutsche's reputation for strong management. Its shares slid against the market as it lost its premium rating. On the eve of Deutsche's 125th anniversary next year, he and his fellow managing board members found themselves in the unfamiliar position of struggling to restore the bank's reputation. They have not found it easy. Mr Kopper's remark that the DM50m (Pounds 21m) trade debts left by Mr Jurgen Schneider when his property group collapsed earlier this year with total debts of DM5bn were 'peanuts', reinforced Deutsche's image of arrogance. And the incidents have re-kindled debate over whether banks' equity stakes in large companies - such as Deutsche's 24.4 per cent stake in Daimler-Benz - lead to conflicts of interest. Deutsche was dragged into the Metallgesellschaft affair because it not only lent money to the mining, metals and industrial group, but held a 10.6 per cent stake. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche managing board member, chaired Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board as a result. All this has happened as Deutsche wrestles with restructuring its 1,506-branch domestic bank, trying to devolve more power to local managers (see below). 'It has obviously been a tough year for them,' says Mr John Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, the investment bank, 'They have been in the news more than they would have liked, in circumstances they would not have chosen.' Yet in the last months of the year, Deutsche shows signs not only of regaining stability, but striking back. The bank announced 10 days ago that it will base investment banking operations in London, and integrate more closely with Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank it acquired five years ago. This is a sign of new aggression in the competition for investment banking business with other large European banks. Mr Kopper, who took over as chairman of the managing board five years ago when Alfred Herrhausen was assassinated, accepts that it may never regain all its mystique, but insists that respect remains. 'That has not been shaken at all. There is the same amount of trust, confidence and stability. What has changed is that it has become more popular to talk about banks. There is much less of a taboo,' he says. He dismisses the idea that Metallgesellschaft or Schneider will have a lasting impact, describing the former's losses in futures trading as 'a wonderful story for textbooks of what a management board can do wrong'. The latter, he insists, was a one-off. Yet Mr Kopper admits that Deutsche has been afflicted by the same reputation for being uniquely powerful that it used to enjoy. 'I sometimes wonder why we are looked at that way. We try to explain what we can - and cannot - do,' he says, 'Of course, there is some mystique, which one enjoys as long as it is positive. It is less enjoyable when negative connotations are attached, which seems to be the case now.' Ridicule matters less than the possibility that hostility to banks will encourage legislation forcing them to reduce stakes in companies to 5 or 10 per cent of those companies' equity. Although Deutsche has a policy of reducing stakes - and withdrawing from supervisory boards - forced disposals would cost it dearly in tax as it realised large capital gains from stakes held at the original value. Mr Kopper says that such legislation would be against the German constitution, and would be challenged by Deutsche in court. Further, he insists that banks are good shareholders. 'A bank is a shareholder that reacts in a responsible way in line with the interests of the company it has invested in, not its own,' he says. Deutsche wants to maintain its portfolio because the yield from dividends helps to smooth cyclical earnings from lending and volatile trading income. The latter was more than halved in the first half of this year because of bond market turmoil. Mr Kopper says he wants to reduce volatility in earnings, and also to diversify its sources of income geographically, one of the motives behind the investment banking move. By comparison with most other European banks, Deutsche has expanded boldly in European retail banking, with acquisitions in Italy and Spain, where margins are high. But it has been more cautious than Swiss and US banks in investment banking. It has not expanded fast in equity underwriting and broking, or financial derivatives, both unfamiliar for a bank from a country that lacks sophisticated capital markets. It has also been slower than competitors to absorb London firms, reaching a 40-page agreement with Morgan Grenfell in 1989 that prevented integration. Mr Kopper says its ambitions have now grown. 'This is really the starting point. We are making a major effort in these markets, a very daring move,' he says. He talks of 'a lot of investment from every angle', to expand international investment banking. Yet Deutsche remains cautious in two ways. First, while an investment banking board will now be in charge of both Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche's activities, further integration will occur only 'in the most careful way'. Mr Kopper argues that the bank has already gained from 'bundling the Morgan abilities with the Deutsche abilities' but 'there is even more there than we have been able to realise'. Second, he emphasises that the bank wants to build investment banking organically rather than through acquisition. Although it aims to build equity broking strength in London, he says that 'we are quite able to build this up ourselves from the grassroots to save the time- and money-consuming process of integration'. This also goes for derivatives, a field in which others have expanded by buying Chicago firms. Mr Kopper admits that Deutsche 'may look weak' in terms of the notional value of derivatives it trades compared with US and Swiss banks. However, it believes 'a prudent approach is right' in a field that has been controversial because of losses by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble. This raises the broader question of whether the cautious and consensual approach to management typified by the Deutsche managing board - 12 directors who meet each Tuesday and have collective responsibility - suits the fast-moving world of investment banking. 'You have got 12 bosses, none of whom strikes me as a weak individual, and that means they can be a little slow,' says Mr Leonard. Mr Kopper points out that the managing board approach has been varied by having a single chief executive for investment banking. But he robustly defends the underlying principle. 'This is one of the most successful banks in the world. I always hear that this is not the best structure, and I don't know what is. But experience suggests the Vorstand (managing board) structure is obviously desirable,' he says. It will therefore be a chastened, but unbowed Deutsche that faces next year's anniversary. The bank's confidence last year was such that it commissioned an official history to be published in 1995. It will include chapters on the late 1930s and 1940s when it helped the Nazi government to seize Jewish property and assets. Further disclosures could spoil the celebrations, but Mr Kopper is unabashed. 'Maybe there is something new that we did not know about. I hope so, I hope it will make interesting reading. I say we must be able to face up to whatever it is,' he says. It is an appropriate sentiment for a year in which Germany's most powerful bank has seemed curiously vulnerable. But it may take more than the admiration of Italian and Spanish customers to restore fully Deutsche's old sense of superiority.</p>

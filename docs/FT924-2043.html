			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Little Rock conference sees much talk, fewer policies AS president-elect Bill Clinton convened his two-day 'economic conference' yesterday, it rapidly became clear it was an exercise in communication - live from Little Rock - and not an occasion for policy-making. Above all, it was a chance for Mr Clinton to demonstrate his mastery of detail and his determination to be a president who remains in touch with the people. Continuing the pattern of this year's election campaign, this was achieved by including a nationwide phone-in on the television broadcast. Mr Clinton, vice-president-elect Al Gore and their economic team listened to Main Street America's ideas about the country's economic problems as well as the opinions of leading academics. From the beginning, Mr Clinton seemed in his element, frequently challenging the academic presenters and offering lengthy clarifications for his television audience. When Professor Alan Blinder of Princeton University raised the need for greater investment in education and training, Mr Clinton asked why, when only 15 per cent of employers reported difficulty in finding skilled workers. It was a typical intervention from Mr Clinton, who appeared frustrated at times that many speakers were echoing - or exaggerating - his own arguments rather than offering new ideas. This, of course, was his own mistake in insisting that only Democrats - or people known to sympathise with his views - were invited. With this caveat, participants were diverse, ranging from Ms Kathleen Piper, owner of the Pied Piper Flower Shop in Yankton, South Dakota, to industrialists such as Mr Henry Poling, chairman of Ford Motor Company. Labour unions were also well represented. Hundreds of journalists, representing organisations ranging from the local Arkansas Democrat Gazette to CNN to the Chinese Daily News, milled around Little Rock in search of two scarce commodities: decent hotel rooms and hard news. Many seemed uncertain of the purpose of the conference and bemused by the bureaucracy imposed by the Clinton media people. In his opening remarks, Mr Clinton repeated his view that encouraging signs of economic recovery must not be allowed to divert attention from longer-term structural problems. Calling again for more investment in education, training and infrastructure, he seemed, however, to put greater emphasis than before on reducing the budget deficit. 'We must stop the cycle of borrow-and-spend economics,' he said. 'Our national debt is an economic ball and chain dragging us down, keeping long-term interest rates high in spite of the actions of the Federal Reserve in bringing down short-term rates.' This means 'we're going to have to make some tough decisions and some hard choices'. But judging by yesterday's glorified talking shop, the Little Rock conference seems unlikely to be the place these hard choices will be made.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Observer: Crying wolf Consternation and concern in the department of transport when Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford south, called for a special debate in the Commons on Menwyth hill station. Obsessed as they are with rail privatisation, the civil servants went into overdrive. The minister concerned, Roger Freeman, was asked by officials to clear his diary to ensure that he was free to answer the debate, due to be heard this coming Friday. Whereupon it was discovered that the 'station', near Harrogate, is a security listening post operated by the ministry of defence, in co-operation with American spooks. Freeman has thanked Cryer for providing him with an unscheduled day off.</p>

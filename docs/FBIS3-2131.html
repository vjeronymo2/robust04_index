			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Hong Wen (1738 5113)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The  Sino-British Airport Committee will hold an experts group  meeting tomorrow. Prior to this meeting, Financial Secretary  Macleod announced the financial budget for the new fiscal year.  What is noteworthy is that the budget has verified that the  Hong Kong Government had a surplus of 15 billion [Hong Kong]  dollars last year. In other words, the Hong Kong Government has  accumulated a surplus of more than 130 billion dollars this  year. We believe that this figure is quite useful for airport  experts to discuss capital injections and loans for the new  airport at the upcoming airport experts meeting. Many  personalities pointed out that since the Hong Kong Government  possesses such a huge fund, it absolutely can increase its  capital injection into the airport to reduce debts and enable  China and Britain to reach an early agreement on the new airport  financial arrangements.    Reports say that a new airport financial arrangement plan  recently submitted to the Chinese side by the Hong Kong  Government has suggested increasing the capital injection from  45.3 billion dollars to 60.3 billion dollars, to reduce the loan  from 43 billion dollars to 23 billion dollars. However, the  amount of this debt is still more than four times the  5-billion-dollar limit set by the Memorandum of Understanding on  the new airport.    Ho Ching-on, member of the Airport Advisory Commission, said  that at a time when the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's  constitutional structure have broken down, the Chinese side is  still willing to reopen an experts group meeting; this indicates  that the Chinese side still has sincerity. Therefore the  British side should also show its sincerity and make further  efforts to reduce the construction cost and increase its capital  injection.    Legislative Councilor Chim Pui-chung, who represents people  in financial circles, pointed out that if the British side still  insists saying that the loan for the new airport railway does  not fall into the category of "government debt," it will be  difficult for the Chinese side to accept it. According to his  analysis, on the question of loans--an issue on which China and  Britain differ greatly--there is still room for flexible  accommodation if the provisions of the Memorandum of  Understanding are followed. Namely, if the loan exceeds 5  billion dollars, China and Britain should consult to reach an  agreement for implementation. But the amount of loan should not  be too high and should correspond with the principle of cost  benefit.    But in Mr. Chim's and Mr. Ho's opinion, now is not the time  to thoroughly resolve the above problem, because there are still  great differences between the sides and the British side is  still playing number games, which has caused difficulties to the  talks. Therefore it is still difficult to reach a satisfactory  agreement in the near future.    In addition, Li Weiting, assistant to the director of the  Hong Kong XINHUA Branch, pointed out that the 5-billion-dollar  limit can still be discussed by the experts group and that there  is also room for flexible handling of land approval. But with  the huge surplus, the Hong Kong Government absolutely can inject  more capital and follow the provisions of the Memorandum of  Understanding. He added: The British side has destroyed the  foundation for cooperation on the question of constitutional  structure; regarding other aspects, it depends on future  development. The Chinese side does not wish to see Hong Kong's  economy and people's lives seriously affected, but many matters  cannot be determined by one side only.</p>

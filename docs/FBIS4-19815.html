			<p>BFN     [Text] Chemnitz (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], does not expect the  economic recovery to lead to a reduction of unemployment in  Germany this year. "I would be satisfied if we managed to stop  unemployment this year," Kohl said on Wednesday [20 April] night  at a conference sponsored by FREIE PRESSE in Chemnitz. That was  all one could expect from the current developments.    In his approximately one-hour lecture, Kohl emphasized that  economic recovery in the new laender had started: "Although the  flourishing landscapes will not come within four or five years,  they are on their way," he said.    Kohl said that it was a "very tough experience" to see how  difficult the Germans were finding it to achieve internal unity.  The chancellor said that people in both east and west obviously  became more alienated than had been thought.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FORGERY BILL THAT REAGAN BACKED ADVANCES  </P> <P> The state Senate passed and sent to the Assembly a bill endorsed by former  President Ronald Reagan to make it a crime to use an unauthorized signature in  campaign literature.  </P> <P> The legislation by Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) was prompted by a 1986  mailer authorized by Assemblyman John R. Lewis, a GOP strategist from Orange  County, that contained Reagan's unapproved signature.  </P> <P> Lewis was charged with felony forgery, but an appellate court threw out the  charge on the grounds that the letters did not legally constitute forgery.  Craven subsequently introduced the bill specifically making unauthorized use of  a signature in campaign material punishable by a prison term, a $50,000 fine or  both.  </P></p>

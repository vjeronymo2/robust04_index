			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Womenswear maker seeks protection from creditors LESLIE Fay, the US womenswear manufacturer which has been bedevilled by news of accounting irregularities recently, has filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. Making the filing, Leslie Fay said that disclosure of the irregularities - which had boosted profits by inflating stocks and reducing the cost of goods sold - prompted its banks to 'severely limit the company's working capital facility, in both amount and duration'. As a result, the company would not be able to obtain the necessary 'piece goods' from its suppliers for the autumn season. However, in conjunction with the Chapter 11 filing, Leslie Fay is securing a new Dollars 100m 'debtor-in-possession' loan facility from Citibank. It says it will be able 'to continue the flow of merchandise to its customers without delay or interruption'.</p>

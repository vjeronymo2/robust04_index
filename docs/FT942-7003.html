			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / People: BT rings the changes Tony Booth, 55, is retiring as managing director of BT's special businesses division. The division - which includes BT's highly successful Cellnet cellular mobile joint venture with Securicor - is thought to be a likely target for reorganisation, with its businesses integrated into BT's main service divisions. Rupert Gavin has been appointed director of BT's Information, Communications and Entertainment programme - a key unit for developing the inter-active multimedia services which BT hopes will be money-spinners later this decade. Gavin, 39, has spent 11 years in advertising, and is expected to give a consumer edge to BT's multimedia projects. His predecessor, Paul Reynolds, moves to become general manager of BT's customer service division in Scotland.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Smile please, and just say British cheese - Nicholas Lander introduces two Frenchmen to the joys of Cheddar, Cotherstone and Spenwood CHEFS have two sources of job satisfaction in addition to their pay packet. The first is cooking for a busy restaurant. The second comes from finding the right raw materials to prepare, cook and serve. These two pleasures are mutually supportive: without the raw ingredients you will not attract the discerning customers. Often such pleasures leave time for little else. Marjan Lesnik, executive chef at Claridge's, London, had not been home for three nights last week because the hotel was so busy, but at the weekend he was up early picking wild mushrooms in Epping Forest, hoping that the rain had brought out the chanterelles. Until this year, British chefs had seen much of the best produce whisked from under their noses by wholesalers prepared to pay higher prices for trailerloads of Scottish salmon, langoustines, Cornish seabass and Somerset elvers. These were delivered, via Calais, to top French, Spanish and Italian kitchens. Today, the market is changing as the recession affects demand from the rest of Europe. In Spain restaurants have been cutting prices to stimulate demand. In France, two-star Michelin chef Andre Daguin led a demonstration of more than 300 chefs, dressed in their whites, in an attempt to bring the plight of the French restaurant industry to his Government's attention. The 'franc fort' policy has put off tourists, recession is cutting corporate entertainment and the industry has little tax relief on its major investment, the training of young chefs. (I took the opportunity of writing to the head of the Federation National des Hoteliers et Restaurateurs in Paris suggesting the French equivalent of 'Lunch for a Fiver', the Weekend FT's scheme for eating out cheaply, only to receive a haughty non). The same circumstances now prevail in Italy, according to Priscilla Carluccio who, with her husband Antonio, has just put together an extensive selection of the best Italian ingredients, available from their shop in Neal Street, London (tel: 071-240-1487). This is the first time that small producers of such delicacies as wild chestnut jam, eight-year-old balsamic vinegar or panforte have welcomed orders from the UK. Perhaps this is largely because restaurants in Italy are cutting costs and ordering less expensive produce. Joel Antunes, the talented chef of Les Saveurs, in Curzon Street, Mayfair, London, (tel: 071-491-8919) is one French chef who has been extremely impressed with the quality of British produce since he arrived here two years ago. However, because Les Saveurs is French, no-one had bothered to introduce him to British cheeses. Happily I was able to help bridge that gap. At a test meal organised by the host, everyone was happy with the menu and wines but then came the cheese course. Two mature clarets were being served. Which cheeses, I was asked, would I suggest? 'British,' I replied, only too well aware that the chef, manager and sommelier would never consider such an option. I waxed lyrical about mature Cheddar, Cotherstone, Spenwood and Mendip. I even suggested, a cheese tasting at Neal's Yard Dairy, Covent Garden (071- 379-7646). Within minutes they replied: they would be delighted to taste British cheeses, something they had never done before. We agreed to meet under the awning outside the theatre in Cambridge Circus where Les Miserables is playing. At 4pm, in between the lunch and dinner services, I met Joel Antunes, Emmanuel Manjuzan, the restaurant manager and Yves Saubova, the sommelier. As soon as they walked into Neal's Yard Dairy their jaws dropped. Truckles of mature Cheddar; turrets of farmhouse Lancashire, Cheshire and Colston Bassett Stilton; goats' cheeses in all shapes and sizes; buckets of creme fraiche and large pats of bright, yellow butter. Just to make them feel at home, was a shelf of organic jams and mustards from France. They held out their hands in silence for the cheese tasting, only asking whether the cheeses were 'sheep, cow or goat.' Twenty cheeses later they had made their choice for dinner - Keen's Cheddar, Spenwood (a hard sheeps' milk cheese from Berkshire) and Gubbeen, a soft cows' milk cheese from Cork, in the Irish Republic) although the cheese they bought for themselves was Harbourne Blue, a goat's milk cheese from Devon. As they left, with samples for their staff to taste, I asked if British cheese would soon be on their French-only trolley. Back came a very French reply: 'As soon as we have our first Michelin star', which, if cooking is the criterion, should be early next year.</p>

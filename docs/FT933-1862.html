			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Ashdown setback PARTY leader Mr Paddy Ashdown (above) was flatly rebuffed yesterday in his ambitions to open up government to non-elected experts, Philip Stephens writes. The setback came as his close aides said the party intended to counter the charge that it had become a 'one-man band' by raising the public profile of its parliamentary representatives. Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president; Mr Matthew Taylor, its campaigns co-ordinator, and Mr Menzies Campbell, the defence spokesman, were singled out as the principal beneficiaries of such a move as senior figures acknowledged that most of the party's MPs are unknown outside their constituencies. Amid an undercurrent of concern that some of the party's representatives needed to sharpen their presentation of key policies there were also suggestions that Mr Ashdown may reshuffle the responsibilities of his Westminster team. That put a question mark on Mr Alan Beith's long-term hold on the economics portfolio. Mr Ashdown's hopes of promoting a more pluralistic political establishment by proposing that unelected individuals be allowed access to ministerial office was rejected. He had backed a plan to reserve up to a third of ministerial posts for appointees from outside Westminster. But delegates shared the objection of a number of his colleagues that such a move would undermine accountability. The leader was also accused privately of relying on 'gimmicks' to raise the party's profile.</p>

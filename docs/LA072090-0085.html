			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'MEN DON'T LEAVE' HAS ARRIVED WITH JESSICA  LANGE  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Jessica Lange shines as a mother of two sons who must adjust to a new life  after her husband's death in "Men Don't Leave" (Warner, $89.95, PG-13). The  warm, touching and funny comedy-drama from earlier this year -- writer-director  Paul Brickman's first film since his more acidic "Risky Business" -- also  features Arliss Howard, Chris O'Donnell and another enchanting performance by  Joan Cusack.  </P> <P> Warner Home Video also has two vintage movies for fans of '50s blond sigh-guy  Troy Donahue -- and of pre-R-rated young-folk romance. "A Summer Place" (1959)  finds Troy snuggling up to equally blond Sandra Dee. Most notable for its Max  Steiner-written theme song (a big hit) and its lush color photography (by Harry  Stradling), this young-love-in-New-England drama is soapy but not too dopey.  Except maybe for its length (130 minutes).  </P> <P> Dopier but mildly enjoyable (and a half-hour shorter) is "Palm Springs Weekend"  (1963). Troy's co-star this time (blond again, of course) is the bouncy Connie  Stevens, and they're supposed to be, uh, teen-agers. It's not a great picture  by any means, but still easier to take than the R-rated teen "comedies" of a  later and less innocent time.  </P> <P> The best new oldie, though, is also the best (and first) Lassie film, "Lassie  Come Home" (MGM/UA, $19.98). The 1943 heart-tugger stars the very young  Elizabeth Taylor and Roddy McDowall.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW ARRIVALS: "Homer and Eddie" (HBO, $89.99, R) stars James Belushi and  Whoopi Goldberg is a 1989 drama about an odd couple who journey across the  country together. "Mad About You" (Academy, $89.95, PG) is a sweet if minor  1989 romantic comedy about a young woman (Claudia Christian) and the men in her  life (ranging from a football player to a musician). "Streets" (MGM/UA, $89.98,  R) stars Christina Applegate (TV's "Married . . . With Children") in a rough  1990 story about a teen-age prostitute, a cop and a serial killer. "Primary  Target" (MGM/UA, $89.98, R) is another imitation-"Rambo," jungle-rescue flick  (from 1989) starring John Calvin.  </P> <P> COMING ATTRACTIONS: "Chinese Roulette" (Aug. 16), "Nuns on the Run" (Aug. 23),  "The Handmaid's Tale" (Sept. 5), "House Party" (Sept. 5), "Impulse" (Sept. 12),  "The Hunt for Red October" (Oct. 25), "Martians Go Home" (Sept. 27), "Teenage  Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie" (Oct. 4).  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> For kids, Golden Book Video is releasing two award-winning, 1978 Claymation  versions of the classic tales "Rip Van Winkle" (narrated by Will Geer) and "The  Little Prince" (narrated by Cliff Robertson). Each half-hour tapes costs $9.95.  TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

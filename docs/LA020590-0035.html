			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 250,000 URGE REFORM IN PROTEST AT KREMLIN;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE MOMENTUM FOR CHANGE GROWS ON EVE OF CENTRAL COMMITTEE  MEETING. DEMONSTRATORS DEMAND AN END TO ONE-PARTY RULE.  </P> <P> A quarter of a million people, gathered outside the walls of the Kremlin in  central Moscow, called Sunday for an end to the Soviet Union's system of  one-party rule in one of the biggest political demonstrations since the  Bolshevik Revolution brought the Communists to power more than 70 years ago.  </P> <P> As the momentum for change gathered in advance of the meeting today of the  Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, the protest dramatized the  growing demand for more sweeping reforms in the Soviet Union's political and  economic system and the widespread impatience with their slowness so far.  </P> <P> The crowd waved huge white-red-and-blue flags of pre-revolutionary Russia, an  emblem for what many now regard as far better times, and held placards warning  party officials to "Remember Romania," where a popular uprising overthrew  President Nicolae Ceausescu's regime only six weeks ago.  </P> <P> "Things cannot continue as they are," Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist,  told the vast crowd that had gathered in Manezh Square, across from the  Kremlin. "At this plenum, the party has been given one last chance.  </P> <P> "It is necessary to restructure the Communist Party. There must not be a party  monopoly on political power."  </P> <P> This change would be so fundamental after more than seven decades of one-party  rule by the Communists that virtually no other element of the Soviet political  or economic system could stand without challenge.  </P> <P> But the sentiments at the five-hour rally were such that the country seemed to  be on the very edge of changes not seen since the Bolshevik Revolution.  </P> <P> .j "We need a free society with a free economy . . . a society of truly free  people," Gavriil Popov, a political economist, said, telling the rally that the  party leadership is hindering reforms and calling upon the party to open talks  with the country's emerging "democratic opposition" on the country's future.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, is scheduled to  lay out his ideas for expanding and accelerating perestroika, as his reform  program is known, when he addresses the Central Committee in the Kremlin this  morning.  </P> <P> Speaking with a delegation of coal miners, Gorbachev said in remarks published  today in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda that the party no longer claims a  monopoly on power and is prepared for "a political dialogue with all those who  favor the renewal of a socialist society."  </P> <P> "On a principled level, our point of view is that a multi-party system is not a  panacea," he said, "but the degree of society's democratization is of decisive  importance as is the democratic nature of all its structures."  </P> <P> Gorbachev is expected to propose an end to the party's constitutionally  guaranteed monopoly on political power and the acceptance of a multi-party  system as a further extension of his concept of "power sharing," according to  Radio Moscow's Interfax news service.  </P> <P> Sunday's rally, which began with a march through the center of the Soviet  capital, had much of the atmosphere of the rallies last autumn in  Czechoslovakia and East Germany before their conservative governments fell.  </P> <P> Comparing the moment when the crowd, hundreds abreast, surged into the square  facing the Kremlin, activist Oleg Rumyantsev, an organizer of the new Social  Democratic Assn. here, told Radio Moscow, "The intensity, the emotional  tension, the general joy were about the same" as that moment when the Berlin  Wall was first breached. And his words were repeated and repeated and repeated  on nationwide radio.  </P> <P> Thousands of flags and banners were held aloft in the square -- those of  pre-revolutionary Russia, of the independent Ukraine, of the Baltic republics  of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and of  Islam -- and all were shown in the extraordinary television coverage of the  rally.  </P> <P> The marchers, chanting in unison, denounced the KGB, the Soviet security  police; Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, and the Soviet army for its  intervention last month in Armenia and Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> "Long live the beginning of the peaceful, nonviolent revolution of February,  1990!" Yuri N. Afanasyev, a leading radical, told the cheering crowd as it  assembled at the end of Gorky Street, just 170 feet short of the Kremlin and  Red Square.  </P> <P> Police blocked streets to allow the march, which had the permission of city  authorities, and thousands of police and young soldiers from the internal  security forces linked arms to funnel the demonstrators into the huge square.  </P> <P> The crowd was estimated by police at more than 200,000, by Radio Moscow at  300,000 and by Soviet television as simply "more than anyone has seen in the  streets of Moscow for 70 years."  </P> <P> Reporting extensively on the demonstration, Soviet television said:  "Perestroika is storming through the party. The old guard is suffering blow  after blow."  </P> <P> But the official Soviet news agency Tass, increasingly a vehicle for  conservative views, denounced the rally as "destructive" and an attempt to  exert "pressure and blackmail."  </P> <P> "Among the participants turned up people who take extreme positions," Tass  said, "and in their speeches they, in fact, unmasked themselves as extremists.  </P> <P> "They showed themselves as not concerned at all with the fortunes of  perestroika and renewal but determined to use the platform of the rally to  exert direct pressure on the public and the authorities."  </P> <P> The mounting popular anger with the party was clearly evident, however, as the  crowd cheered the most radical speakers.  </P> <P> "The numbers of those present today is sufficient to storm the Winter Palace  and the Lubyanka," Igor Chubal, a radical Communist, declared, referring to the  Bolsheviks' capture of the Winter Palace in Leningrad in 1917 and to the  headquarters of the KGB at Lubyanka prison in central Moscow.  </P> <P> "If a peaceful resolution fails, we shall have to make a different one. . . .  The Communist Party stands in the way of democratization. Like the Berlin Wall,  it will fall if it remains such a barrier."  </P> <P> The rally brought together supporters of popular fronts in Moscow and other  cities, the Assn. of Moscow Voters, the Memorial, a group dedicated to  remembering the victims of dictator Josef Stalin, and other reformers, and it  marked a major step toward unity of what they call "the democratic opposition."  </P> <P> "We have no more time," Nikolai I. Travkin, a member of the Congress of  People's Deputies, said, calling for unity. "We do not have time for  disagreements among ourselves."  </P> <P> Yeltsin, a former member of the ruling Politburo and still a member of the  Central Committee, told the rally that he would ask to speak at the committee's  closed-door meeting today and would propose repeal of Article 6 of the Soviet  Constitution, which gives the party the "leading role" and, in effect, the  exclusive right to rule.  </P> <P> "There must be no monopoly of power," Yeltsin said to a thunderous roar from  the crowd. "Down with the Communists!"  </P> <P> Nikolai Shishlin, a senior Central Committee official, meanwhile told U.S.  television on Sunday that a multi-party system would emerge soon in the Soviet  Union and alter the composition of the government.  </P> <P> "I think the political process is going in this direction, and I think that we  will have a multi-party system," he said in an interview on ABC's "This Week  with David Brinkley."  </P> <P> The Communist Party has allowed the reform process to slow down, and measures  are needed now to accelerate it again, Shishlin said. "Reforms will start in  the party ranks because the party left behind perestroika, and just now it is  necessary to reconstruct the party," he said.  </P> <P> Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, explained that  Gorbachev believes that the Communist Party cannot claim the leading role in  the country unless it fights for it and wins in free elections.  </P> <P> "My guess is that in this platform, they are going to say that if the party  wants to be the leading party and win the elections it must be energetic enough  to fight opponents and to win in free elections," Gerasimov told CBS's "Face  the Nation."  </P> <P> Talks Broken Off. Armenians accused Azerbijanis and headed home. A10  </P></p>

Telephone conversation between George Peckman, Vice President, Market Surveillance, Amex, and Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, OMS, Division, Commission, on September 16, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the proposal makes clear that the requirements specified in the Rule 980 only apply to expiring equity options listed on the Exchange. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, particularly, Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although all options exchanges currently have a uniform 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) Exercise Cut-Off Time on Expiration Fridays for expiring equity options, the OCC's rules permit the OCC to accept exercise notices for expiring equity options from clearing firms until 12:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) on the expiration date ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Saturday after an Expiration Friday). This additional time within which to receive exercise notices from clearing members was provided to accommodate corrections of mistakes made in good faith, trade reconciliations, and certain exceptional circumstances that affected a customer's ability to inform its brokerage firm or affected a firm's ability to receive final exercise decisions before the Exercise Cut-Off Time. Nevertheless, there have been situations where member organizations have either delayed making exercise decisions until after 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on Expiration Friday in anticipation of the release of material news concerning a particular underlying company, or having made decisions prior to 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.), changed these decisions based upon such material news. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Commission believes that it is consistent with this approval for the Exchange to interpret its rules to deem the submission of a Contrary Exercise Advice on the basis of material information released after the Exercise Cut-Off Time as activity inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> In re Farmers, Group Stock Options Litigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Master File No. 88&hyph;4994 (E.D.Pa 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> notes 11 and 23. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed exercise procedures should enhance the Exchange's ability to surveil for violations of Rule 980 by providing an enhanced audit trail for identifying late exercises. Specifically, every time an exercise decision is made contrary to OCC Rule 805, a Contrary Exercise Advice must be filed with the Exchange, in addition to the current procedure of submitting an exercise instruction to a clearing member as is currently required. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, the proposal requires that documentation must be prepared and submitted to the proper options exchange whenever a late exercise decision is made in reliance on one of the exceptions to Rule 980, with the burden of establishing the existence of the exception on the party submitting the Contrary Exercise Advice. The proposed rule change, therefore, should facilitate the Exchange's ability to monitor and enforce compliance with Rule 980. Accordingly, because the proposed rule change significantly bolsters the Exchange's existing procedures regarding the exercise of expiring equity options and helps to ensure compliance with their rules, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the Amex has represented that it will prepare (in cooperation with the other options exchanges) and distribute a notice to member organizations describing the new procedures set forth above, and notifying member organizations as to when the new procedures will be fully in effect.

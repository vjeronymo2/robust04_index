			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MANAGER SAYS MURPHY DISLIKED BUCHWALD  STORY  </P> <P> Eddie Murphy's manager testified Thursday the comedian never liked a story sold  to Paramount Pictures by humorist Art Buchwald, who is suing the studio for  allegedly stealing his idea to make Murphy's "Coming to America" hit.  </P> <P> Robert Wachs, testifying at the Superior Court trial of Buchwald's $5-million  breach-of-contract lawsuit, also said he shared Murphy's opinion of Buchwald's  story, entitled "King for a Day." Wachs testified: "We never liked it from the  beginning. I told Paramount innumerable times that we didn't like it. It became  a joke."  </P> <P> Buchwald's lawsuit claims "Coming to America" was based on "King for a Day," a  story concept he sold to the studio in 1983. "Coming to America" is about an  African prince who comes to New York to find a bride. Buchwald's concept  focused on a king from an oil-rich African nation who is stranded in Washington  when he is overthrown.  </P></p>

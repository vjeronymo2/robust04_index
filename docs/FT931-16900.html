			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / State blamed for snags in training THE government has given insufficient weight to social and economic needs in some old industrial towns and cities, a report by Salford University Business Services says. The authors say that this has affected funding to Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) - one of which commissioned the report - and made it harder to restructure a local economy and improve training. Tecs deliver government training schemes in England and Wales. Subs, an independent consultancy attached to the university, has produced an indexed league table of quality-of-life indicators allowing Tec funding to be weighted for special difficulties. The work has been done by two economists, Mr Jim Twomey and Professor Neville Topham. They have not been allowed to disclose which Tec commissioned the work, but their indexing system has impressed other Tecs in tough areas which are now seeking similar advice to argue for more public funds. Taking greater account of economic and social deprivation ought to mean more funds for enterprise training and local initiatives in areas with the greatest difficulties. Tecs using the Subs indices will have objective criteria to argue their case. Topping the league table for best quality of life are the Tec areas covering Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Milton Keynes, Surrey and the Thames Valley. The bottom five of 75 in England are City and Inner London North, Merseyside, Birmingham, East Lancashire and Bradford. There is a cluster of blackspots involving seven Tecs in Merseyside, Greater Manchester and Lancashire. Birmingham and Greater Nottingham are also among the most difficult Tec areas, while there is another cluster of four blackspots in Greater London. The Salford analysis of how things are changing presents an even bleaker picture. Quality of life appears to be improving most rapidly in the Tec areas of Milton Keynes, the Thames Valley, Surrey, Hertfordshire and the Heart of England; and falling fastest in City and Inner London North, Tyneside, Wearside, Teesside and Merseyside - all of them with old, inner-urban areas with narrow economic bases and high unemployment. Prof Topham said: 'Future resource allocations should take account of the backdrop against which individual Tecs have to work.' Quality of Life and Tec Areas. Salford University Business Services.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Hospital Responsibility for Emergency Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We received comments from 68 commenters on the anti-dumping provisions as they existed before the passage of OBRA 89. Commenters included hospitals, professional health organizations, State hospital associations and medical societies, State agencies, physicians, attorneys and other individuals. We have taken into account the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 statutory changes when responding to the comments we received, and we are adding the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 requirements to this interim final rule. We are doing this without publishing a second notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining to the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 requirements because we believe the extensive detail of the statute makes many provisions self-executing and because commenters suggested changes similar to many of those embodied in the legislation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Please note that, with respect to the anti-dumping provisions, the statute now uses the term ``individual'' and not ``patient.'' While our response to comments refers to ``individuals,'' we have not made the parallel change when the term ``patient'' appears in a commenter's statement.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters suggested that HCFA require hospitals to post signs in their emergency departments advising patients of the hospital's obligation to provide emergency care. Two other commenters recommended that we require emergency room personnel to give emergency room patients both written and oral notice of the hospital's obligations and the patient's rights under these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of section 1867 of the Act address what is appropriate performance on the part of hospitals in meeting medical needs of individuals who need emergency services. Additionally, as amended by section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, section 1866(a)(1)(N)(iii) of the Act explicitly directs the Secretary to require Medicare participating hospitals to post conspicuously in all emergency departments a sign (in a form specified by the Secretary) specifying rights of individuals under section 1867 of the Act with respect to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions and women in labor. Further, since some hospitals do not have traditional emergency departments, we are amending &sect;489.20 to include a new paragraph (q)(1) to reflect this statutory requirement and to specify other hospital areas in which such signs should be posted. It should be noted that Medicare participating hospitals that do not offer emergency services do not have to comply with this requirement. However, all hospitals do have to comply with the provision of section 1866(a)(1)(N)(iv) of the Act, as also amended by section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, that directs hospitals to post conspicuously (in a form specified by the Secretary) information indicating whether or not the hospital participates in the Medicaid program under a State plan approved under title XIX. (See &sect;489.20(q)(2).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have also published an interim manual instruction (IMI)(IM&hyph;90&hyph;1, June 1990) in HCFA Pub. 10, the Medicare Hospital Manual, listing minimum criteria for the signs and an example of language for this sign that would meet such criteria. We are including the IMI language as shown in the IMI exhibit for informational purposes in Appendix II to this final rule and request comments on the exhibit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the statutory requirement for the posting of signs, which does not also require individual written or oral notice, is adequate for the general purpose of informing patients of their rights to a medical screening and stabilizing treatment under the anti-dumping statute. This is consistent with the overall drafting of section 1867 of the Act, which specifically requires individual notice in other situations such as consent to transfer. Accordingly, when an individual's specific treatment is involved, we agree with the commenters that it is essential for patients to be fully informed about all the critical medical issues with which they are faced. That is why we require a more detailed process for ensuring that hospitals obtain the informed consent of an individual who is faced with the prospect of a transfer. (See &sect;489.24(c).) In such cases, we agree that both oral and written interaction are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters objected to our proposal concerning furnishing emergency services on the grounds that our rule applies to all patients (rather than Medicare patients only). They believe that any problems were of limited scope and noted that implementation of the requirement will establish an adversarial relationship among HCFA, providers, and patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The protections of the statute are expressly extended to all individuals who come to a facility regardless of whether the individual is eligible for benefits under Medicare. The Federal Government has always viewed that a provider's obligation is to all persons, regardless of entitlement. This obligation has been well understood and universally applied to all providers. Congress, in apparent awareness of this universal obligation, has in some instances limited the scope of a provider's obligation. An example of this is discharge planning, as provided under section 1861(ee) of the Act, which limits the scope of this requirement specifically to individuals covered under the Act. Since Congress has not chosen to narrow the scope of section 1867 by limiting it only to persons entitled to benefits under the Act, we are confident that the provisions of section 1867 of the Act extend to all persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

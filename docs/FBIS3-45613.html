			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China and Germany  should set their eyes on the 21st century and handle their  mutual ties with a strategic point of view.    These remarks were made by Qiao Shi, chairman of China's  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, in an  interview with a local correspondent, Babara Scheer, from the  "Deutsche Welle" (the Voice of Germany) here this evening.    He said China and Germany have no fundamental conflict of  interest, but shared many identical or similar views on  international issues.    Their mutually supplementary economies have laid a good  basis  for bilateral cooperation, he said    Over the past few years, Qiao said due to the concerted  efforts, bilateral ties have appeared a good momentum for  development.    Political relations between the two countries have been  growing closer and economic ties and trade progressing, he said.    During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's China visit last  November, he said the two sides signed a series of agreements,  contracts and letters of intent in the fields of politics,  economy, science and technology and culture.    This demonstrates that the Sino-German ties have entered a  new stage of the all-round development.    Qiao said China always places great importance on developing  its ties with Germany and hopes for strengthening such  cooperation in political, economic and other areas.    He said China is also willing to develop its long-term and  stable relations with Germany according to the principles of  seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual  respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,  equality and mutual benefit.    "We hope that Germany will play greater roles in  international affairs with a view to maintaining the world peace  and development.    "To conduct friendly cooperation between a reforming and  opening up China and a unified and peace-loving Germany is not  only in the interests of the two peoples, but also an important  contribution to the world peace and development," he added.    Answering a question on what kind of hope that he will place  on his current visit to Germany, Qiao said "I hope my visit will  help deepen our mutual understanding, expand exchanges and  strengthen cooperation so as to newly promote such ties."    At the correspondent's request, Qiao briefed him on the  latest development of China's culture, economy and politics.    He said China will continue to deepen its reform and open  the  door wider, focusing on its economic construction as its major  task.    Qiao stressed that China's policy of reform and opening up  will remain unchanged because it has won a country-wide support  and the people have got benefits from it.</p>

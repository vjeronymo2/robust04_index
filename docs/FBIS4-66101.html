			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by Riccardo </F> Orizio; place and date not given: "A Referendum in Ulster" --  first four paragraphs are CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] He used to be an invisible man. Like a ghost  without a face and without a voice, who, from one of his 25 safe  houses in Belfast or his bomb-proof office on Falls Road, would  terrorize Britain with the mere mention of his name, which was  synonymous with fear, bombings, and mysteries.    Now Gerry Adams has come out of the shadows. The charismatic  leader of Sinn Fein (the Northern Irish party that is in  practice the political wing of the IRA), the man who has  survived dozens of attacks by Protestant Unionists and the  innumerable diplomatic traps of the oldest conflict in Europe,  has started showing his beard and his open smile around the  world. Like a real statesman.    First America, last week the Basque Country. Yesterday, he  arrived in Italy, where he will visit Venice, then Turin, for  the presentation of his book -- surprisingly, a narrative work.  It is called, "The Road and Other Stories." It is all set in  the poor and desperate streets of West Belfast, the Catholic  ghetto of the Northern Irish capital, where Adams was born and  where the guerrilla warfare is fiercest.    "To describe it as a diplomatic offensive is perhaps going  too far," he said dismissively, persuasive, and polite. "But  when the American Government granted me a visa, I accepted  invitations from organizations and friends. The visit was a  great success for Sinn Fein and for the cause of the Republican  movement. I was invited to visit the Basque Country a year ago,  and at last I accepted. I visited Italy in 1987 and I pledged  to return if ever one of my books were to be translated. Of  course, this has all happened at a rather busy time for the  negotiations on Northern Ireland, but I could not refuse."    [Orizio] On 15 December 1993, there was the historic London  and Dublin agreement on "the Northern Ireland people's right to  self-determination." Sinn Fein asked for clarifications on 20  points. First, London said "no," then it changed its mind.  Yesterday evening you received a partial reply: a "yes" to a  referendum in Ulster. Is this a victory? Does British Prime  Minister John Major accept you as interlocutors now?    [Adams] Yes, of course. But relations between Sinn Fein and  the British Government began in secret three years ago and have  never ceased. If there were not the Maastricht Treaty to  approve in Westminster, and therefore if a John Major with  problems had not needed to keep his Unionist votes safe, he  would have officially recognized us as a partner in the dialogue  much sooner. So yesterday's acknowledgement is nothing new.    [Orizio] But now Major is talking openly about a referendum,  to determine the future of Northern Ireland. This is something  new.    [Adams] Before making an assessment of the substance of the  British document, we will have to analyze its 21 pages  thoroughly. Permit me to say, however, that a 21-page reply to  just one of the points that we raised shows that we were right  to want to look into the matter more thoroughly and that we were  in good faith. Of course, we are clear about how the "right to  self-determination" would express itself, but we believe that  the entire people of Ireland, and not just of Northern Ireland,  are entitled to express themselves. Be that as it may, if this  British reply helps the dialogue to continue, it really is  welcome.    [Orizio] Are Major's domestic political problems influencing  the negotiations?    [Adams] Yes, and in a very negative way. Major's position is  so precarious that the prime minister is effectively being held  hostage by a group of members of parliament of the Tory Right,  who are holding him for ransom precisely over the Northern  Ireland issue. Without this problem, the negotiations would be  much further advanced.    [Orizio] But there is again more shooting going on in Ulster  than before. Why?    [Adams] It is the Protestant terrorists that are responsible  for almost all these bloodthirsty incidents. The other day they  killed two Catholic workers, 10 days ago an old lady who was  watching television. They are trying to frighten people. But  the worst thing is that they shoot with weapons supplied by the  British Government, as we have proved with documentary evidence.  These weapons came via South Africa and were brought in by a  British agent.    [Orizio] The British Government, however, accuses you  Republicans of having taken weapons from Iran, in exchange for  the elimination of political adversaries of the Ayatollah.    [Adams] It also accuses us of managing a drugs racket to  finance the struggle. It is all lies. Ridiculous stories.  Tehran has denied it, the IRA has denied it, and the Dublin  government has denied it. The fact is that it is all British  propaganda. After the support gathered during my visit to  America, London decided to respond by trying to discredit us.  But no one in Belfast believes these things.    [Orizio] Leaving these accusations aside, is there a hope of  peace now?    [Adams] I believe so. People want peace and the  international climate is favorable. Dialogue has resolved two  crises that seemed insoluble -- the Middle East and South  Africa. Now it is up to us. The political process of dialogue  must be started. We republicans believe in it.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Aukett deficit trimmed to Pounds 2.25m Losses at Aukett Associates, the building services and architectural group, were trimmed from Pounds 3.87m to Pounds 2.25m pre-tax for the year to end-September. The directors said the company was now 'on the road to recovery' and pointed out that the deficit took account of a loss in the opening six months of Pounds 2.06m on the disposal of discontinued operations. Continuing activities moved back into the black in the second half and enabled the group to swing from operating losses before non-recurring items of Pounds 680,000 to profits of Pounds 135,000 for the full year. Turnover slipped to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 8.53m) of which Pounds 402,000 (Pounds 1.42m) arose from discontinued operations. Losses per share emerged at 16.82p (20.77p). However, after stripping out exceptional items, headline losses were 1.71p (16.23p).</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Consumers portrayed as conformist IN SPITE of impressions to the contrary, Britain's hippies and punks have moved aside to make way for a nation of conformists who wash their clothes regularly and take pride in keeping their homes spick-and-span. According to a new report from Euromonitor, the market research company: 'The 1970s hippies and 1980s punks have given way to the 1990s conformist, with the mid-1980s spending boom fuelling a youth culture geared towards smart and sophisticated attire and quality clothes.' Partly because of food hygiene scares, consumers have placed an increasing emphasis on cleanliness in the home in recent years and demand for household cleaning products, such as kitchen cleaners, washing powders, and furniture polishes has grown strongly. The overall market for such items grew by 8.7 per cent in 1989 and was estimated to have expanded by a further 7.1 per cent in 1990, showing few signs of abating in spite of recession. Eighty per cent of households in the UK have a washing machine, according to Euromonitor, and the average family washes clothes five times a week. Household Cleaning: UK and European Trends and Forecasts to 1995. Euromonitor, 87-88 Turnmill Street, London. EC1M 5QU. Pounds 650.</p>

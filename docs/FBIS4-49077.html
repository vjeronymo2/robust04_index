			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yang Zhaobo </F> (2799 0340 3134)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president, and Li  Peng, premier of the State Council, met this afternoon with  representatives of the honorable winners of the State Natural  Science Prize, State Invention Prize, State Scientific and  Technological Progress Prize, and State Spark Plan Prize for  1993, at the Great Hall of the People. Jiang Zemin extended  warm congratulations and paid high tributes to prize winners and  to scientists and technicians working in various sectors across  the nation. He urged the broad mass of scientists and  technicians to sow the seeds of scientific progress across the  country and contribute even more to the development of the  economy and to social progress.    Jiang Zemin said Comrade Deng Xiaoping incisively proposed  an  important exposition that "science and technology are the  primary productive forces." His exposition has developed  Marxist theory on science and technology and played a great  promotive role to China's science and technology work and to the  entire economic construction. Those who are involved in science  and technology work must persist in implementing the policy of  "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" as  this policy has correctly solved the relationship between basic,  applied, and development research.    Jiang Zemin pointed out that the great practice for reform  and development requires being armed with correct theory and  rich knowledge. All levels of leading comrades should study  hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and information on a socialist market  economy and on modern science and technology so as to constantly  score new victories for China's socialist construction.    Present at the meeting with the prize-winning  representatives  and attending the prize-award meeting were Wen Jiabao, Lu Jiaxi,  Li Peiyao, Song Jian, Chen Junsheng, Luo Gan, and others.    For those who are involved in science and technology,  receiving a national scientific and technological prize has been  viewed as a top honor. The entire evaluation and screening  process to select the winning projects and winners for the 1993  national scientific and technological prizes has ended.  Following a hectic evaluation and screening process, several  thousand scientists, professors, and experts selected 781  outstanding scientific and technological results and 4,484  winners. A total of 52 scientific and technological results won  State Natural Science Prizes; 441 won State Science and  Technology Progress Prizes; and 113 won State Spark Plan Prizes.  The percentage of prize-winning trade and industry are as  follows: 42.9 percent for industry, transportation; 16.8 percent  for farming and animal husbandry; 6 percent for basic research;  9 percent for culture, education, and public health; 19.6  percent for national defense and public security; and 5.7  percent for other sectors. Incomplete statistics show that the  accumulated economic benefits generated following the  implementation of the prize-winning scientific results, many of  them reaching the world's advanced level, top 21.3 billion yuan.    Zhu Lilan, executive vice minister of the State Science and  Technology Commission, spoke at today's meeting. She said the  party and government adopt the principle of using both spiritual  and material incentives, with the emphasis on spiritual, to  encourage scientific and technological personnel. This system  has produced the desired effect of "not only encouraging an  individual but also a lot of other people and of not only  encouraging a particular project, but also many other projects."  Through encouragement, we provide guidance on the direction of  scientific and technological development to various levels of  scientific and technological units; effectively help promote  conversion of scientific and technological results to  production; bring about close integration between science and  economy; enhance the people's awareness of science and  technology; strengthen the cohesive force among scientific and  technological workers; spread patriotism, collectivism, and the  spirit of work-dedication; and advance the cause of socialist  spiritual civilization.</p>

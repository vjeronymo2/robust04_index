			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramos rejected suggestions that the  Philippines should imitate other Southeast Asian countries in  using authoritarian methods to promote economic growth. Ramos  said that the Philippines' often chaotic democracy should not be  blamed for its failure to match the rapid growth of other  countries in the region. The president said that when the  Philippines was placed under martial law in 1972, economy  suffered badly, resulting in greater misery for ordinary  Filipinos.</p>

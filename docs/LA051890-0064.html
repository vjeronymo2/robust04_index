			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SOUTH TORRANCE'S 1-0 PLAYOFF VICTORY IS FIRST IN 33 YEARS  </P> <P> A strong wind helped cause an error on a routine fly ball, allowing South  Torrance High to score a 1-0 victory over visiting Capistrano Valley on  Thursday in the first round of the Southern Section 3-A Division softball  playoffs.  </P> <P> With South's Angela Bean on second base, shortstop Gillian Boxx hit a lazy fly  ball into right field that looked to be the final out of the sixth inning. But  the ball sailed away from Capistrano Valley's Shelly Smith and popped out of  her glove. Bean scored and Smith was charged with an error.  </P> <P> Throughout the game, a strong breeze blew from the west across South's diamond.  South right fielder Tammy Hertica also made an error on a windblown fly ball,  but the mistake didn't cost the Spartans.  </P> <P> "Right field can be a killer in this ballpark," South Coach Larry Lent said.  "It didn't hurt us any today, but it hurt them, and that was the difference in  the game."  </P> <P> It also gave South its first playoff victory in softball in 33 years. The  Spartans (18-3) tied West Torrance for the Ocean League championship, but went  into the playoffs as the league's No. 2 entry after losing a coin flip with  West.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley, the fourth-place team from the South Coast League, entered  the playoffs as an at-large team and finished 15-11.  </P> <P> For three innings, Capistrano Valley freshman starter Daniela Hugelshofer kept  South off-balance. She allowed only one hit before giving way to senior  Jennifer Smith (10-10), who struck out four in three innings.  </P> <P> Jennifer Smith gave up only one hit, an infield chopper between the pitcher and  first base by Bean in the sixth. Bean advanced to second on Monica Emmrich's  ground out, then Boxx, South's best hitter at .529, hit the fly ball that won  the game.  </P> <P> South senior Julie DeJaifre (6-1) allowed only Hugelshofer's base hit down the  first-base line in the fourth. DeJaifre, who missed six weeks of the season  with a broken bone in her left foot, struck out two.  </P> <P> South will play either Bellflower (22-6) or Covina (14-5) in the second round  Tuesday.  </P></p>

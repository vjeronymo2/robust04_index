			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Aid bank overheads hit Pounds 200m but E Europe waits for loans THE European Bank for Recon-struction and Development has spent more than Pounds 200m since its launch two years ago on fitting out its London offices and meeting overheads, including the use of private jets for its founder and president and a Pounds 52,000 party for its staff last Christmas. The Pounds 200m figure is double the amount it has disbursed in loans and investments to the troubled economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The cost of fitting out its new City of London offices alone is Pounds 55.5m, according to an FT analysis. This includes a Pounds 22m contribution from the UK government. The bank, which was set up in April 1991 to stimulate the private sector in the newly democratised countries of eastern Europe, spent Pounds 18m of UK public funds on its previous offices, which it occupied for just 20 months before moving out last December. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said he would be asking Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor and an EBRD governor, about the use to which UK public money had been put. 'These are serious matters which require answers,' he said. The UK provided the EBRD with a special grant of Pounds 40m as an incentive to locate its headquarters in London. A Treasury official said: 'It is still a very young bank . . . In its early years it would tend to have higher costs and a smaller loan book.' From April 1991 until the end of last year, the EBRD, which holds its second annual meeting in London next week, had disbursed Pounds 101m in loans and investments, compared with Pounds 201.5m spent on furnishing and equipping its offices, paying staff, travel and administrative overheads. Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's founder and president, said all the bank's budgets had been approved by its board of 23 directors, who represent the 53 western and eastern European countries which own the bank. EBRD expenditure includes: Pounds 600,000 last year on hiring private aircraft for Mr Attali, or more than 8 per cent of the bank's total travel budget. Pounds 750,000 on changing the marble in the building's head office. Pounds 52,000 on a staff Christmas party held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, or Pounds 80 for each of the 650 consultants or employees who attended. Mr Attali denied expenditure was excessive. 'I have a duty to provide them (employees) with a good environment,' he said. He conceded that disbursement of loans and investments was slow but said this was a reflection of the bank's caution. He said the EBRD had approved far more loans and investments than it had actually disbursed.

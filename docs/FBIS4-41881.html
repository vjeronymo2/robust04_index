			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Karapetyan and Sergey Prokopenko: "Russian </F> Peacekeeping Soldiers Have Taken Up Positions Between Warring  Sides. Our Special Correspondents Report From the  Abkhazian-Georgian Border"]    [Text] Gali-Sukhumi-Gudauta -- During the afternoon of 24  June two battalions of the 145th Motorized Infantry Division,  having completed their march from Batumi, arrived in the  vicinity of Zugdidi. They therefore came under the command of  the eastern monitoring zone headquarters and took custody of  three checkpoints and 10 monitoring and observation posts.    Restoration work is continuing on the railroad bridge across  the Inguri river. Let us remind readers that similar work has  already been completed on the road bridge. In our view, the  following fact is pretty significant: All the work is being  carried out, let us stress deliberately, by Russian  peacekeepers. It is hard for the authors of this report to  shake off the feeling that the local authorities on both sides  of the Inguri have acted in line with the principle "here come  the Russians; they will do everything themselves." That is in  fact how things have turned out.    In our view, the situation in the western zone is somewhat  more complex. Whereas the Zugdidi area has been practically  cleared of Zviadist detachments, on the other bank bandit  formations and detachments of marauders are running amok and  shipping out booty by the truckload. The bandits have stepped  up their activities because in the next few days the border will  be closed, thus putting a stop to their "business."    Incidentally, a word or two about the border along the  Inguri. Until the mountain passes were opened, it stretched for  82 km. We were informed by Abkhazian Defense Ministry spokesman  Valeriy Gumba that with the opening of the passes its length  increased to 100-110 km. In our view, this point needs to be  noted. First of all, and most important, up to now there has  been no political decision on the border. This gives both sides  a pretext for defining where the border is as the prevailing  situation dictates.    Second, the border as understood in the conventional sense  does not exist. There is no border strip and no barbed wire.  There is the river, and that is the border. In spring, when  the snow started to melt in the mountains, the Inguri changed  its course, and 13 Abkhazian guardsmen found themselves...on the  Georgian side. Their punishment was short and brutal. Russian  peacekeepers should be prepared for the fact that in certain  border sectors, which it would be impossible to control even  with all the available forces (a task which has not actually  been set), there could occasionally be armed clashes. Our two  mobile groups have been deployed on both sides of the Inguri to  deal with this eventuality.    The western monitoring zone headquarters are located in  Gali.  Its "patch" comprises two checkpoints and 17 monitoring and  observation points. Mine clearance in the deployment area in  this region has been completed.    This situation "in the west" is also complicated as a result  of the following factors. Under the agreed plan -- which we  have reported on -- a 12-km security zone completely free of  weapons is to be established on both sides of the Inguri. This  is the first inconsistency. Some time ago the Abkhazian  authorities promulgated an edict allowing people to keep  weapons. As far as we know, this edict has not been repealed  and apparently there are no plans to repeal it. Consequently  the likelihood that the principle "have gun, will shoot" will  operate is fairly high.    We can even predict where this might happen. In the Kodori  canyon, which is not a zone for which the Russian peacekeeping  forces are responsible. Unburdened by the cares of having to  guard the border, the commanders of Abkhazian and Georgian armed  detachments are concentrating their forces in the Kodori canyon.  According to information at our disposal, literally the other  day a big detachment of Svanetians [Georgians] entered the  canyon under the command of Emzari Ketsmariani. It is not hard  to predict the future course of events: If the tempo of the  political settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict does not  match the urgency of the moment, then the currently shaky peace  could be blown to pieces right here in the Kodori canyon, deep  in the rear of the Russian peacekeeping forces.    A decision was made 26 June to carry out a peacekeeping  operation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. We were  informed by Major General Vasiliy Yakushev that he plans to  complete the peacekeeping forces' engagement before 3 July.</p>

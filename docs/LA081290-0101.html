			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'BOARD SHUNS PARENTS ON POWER LINE TESTS'  </P> <P> Regarding the article "Board Shuns Parents on Power Line Tests" (Aug. 1), two  major points were misrepresented.  </P> <P> First, the letter from the school board did not state that no testing would be  done.  </P> <P> It only notified attorney Allen Brandt that the district would not trade  testing for his dropping the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Secondly, I stated to the reporter that another meeting was scheduled between  county health officials and the district to determine what course of action, if  any, should be taken. That meeting is still planned and should have been  reported in the article.  </P> <P> The Fountain Valley School District and its Board of Trustees are concerned  about the potential health hazards and are pursuing the issue with the proper  authorities -- health officials from the state and county.  </P> <P> The school district has a proven record of protecting the health and safety of  its students and staff. We were one of the first districts to remove all  asbestos from our buildings; we adopted the first comprehensive policy in the  county on AIDS, and we have high-quality procedures and supplies in case of  emergencies.  </P> <P> In each of those instances, we carefully assessed the information and proceeded  with intelligence and concern. We will follow the same careful process in  resolving this issue.  </P> <P> RUBEN L. INGRAM  </P> <P> Superintendent  </P> <P> Fountain Valley School District  </P></p>

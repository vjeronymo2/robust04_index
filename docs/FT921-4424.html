			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Weak demand leaves Calderburn down at Pounds 3m CALDERBURN, the office furniture manufacturer formed by the merger in July 1991 of Alan Cooper Holdings and Mayfield, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m for the year to end-December. The result was achieved on turnover of Pounds 28.8m, and compares with a restated profit of Pounds 5.45m from turnover of Pounds 33.6m for the 1990 year. The company blamed the profits downturn on the weak demand for office furniture and seating in the domestic market. The decline was exacerbated by exceptional costs which totalled Pounds 369,000 (Pounds 64,000) and represented the costs of redundancies and merger-related reorganisation. Mr James Blyth Currie, chairman, said the integration work following the merger had gone better than predicted and it was likely that the enhanced profitability resulting from the synergies and cost savings would exceed original expectations. Looking to the current year, he said orders had got off to a good start but that the duration of the recession made it increasingly difficult to predict any recovery. Earnings per share came out at 8.9p (13.9p) and a final dividend of 4.9p is recommended, making a total for the year of 7.7p. The company had cash balances of Pounds 1.4m at the year-end and no borrowings.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Coles Myer pays more on modest earnings rise COLES Myer, Australia's biggest retailer, has declared a scrip issue and higher dividend after a modest rise in earnings and sales in the year to July. The company is making a five-for-four scrip issue and lifting the effective annual scrip-adjusted dividend to 17.33 cents a share from 16.44 cents, after net profits edged ahead to ADollars 370.7m (USDollars 266.6m) from ADollars 368.2m. Sales rose 1.6 per cent to ADollars 15.18bn from ADollars 14.94bn and Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the company's performance in the early weeks of the current year gave cause for optimism. 'In maintaining our profitability this year we were significantly assisted by reduced debt, lower interest rates and excellent cost control at the corporate level,' he said. Mr Bartels said the company had reduced its total debt in the year by 39.5 per cent to ADollars 807.5m in the year from ADollars 1.34bn. With cash proceeds from the sale of New Zealand-based Progressive Enterprises during the year, net debt was reduced by 65 per cent to ADollars 433.4m. Net interest expense was down from ADollars 167.0m to ADollars 88.1m. Among the group's best performers was its core department store division, lifting pre-tax profits to ADollars 163.1m from ADollars 157.8m, but supermarket earnings fell to ADollars 179.0m from ADollars 199.3m. K mart earnings dived to ADollars 94.5m from ADollars 155.7m. The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 200.4m (ADollars 201.1m previously) and depreciation ADollars 277.2m (ADollars 255.8m).</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Revenue ban casts doubt on annuit - Investors face problems One of last year's most innovative annuity products was taken off the market in a hurry this week because of an Inland Revenue ban. 'Managed' or 'flexible' annuities were designed with relatively affluent customers in mind and allowed them to do two things. First, they could exercise considerably more control over the investments on which their pension depended, and on the amount of income they drew each year. Second, if they wanted to buy a conventional annuity, providing a pre-determined annual income, they could do so at a time of their own choosing when they thought they would get favourable terms. The latter point is particularly pertinent. Falling interest rates have meant that many new pensioners taking out a conventional annuity are getting a considerably lower annual income than they would have a couple of years ago. The only company to have launched a managed annuity scheme is Equitable Life. But Provident Life had a similar annuity ready to go and several other life insurance companies planned to join the fray. It is not yet clear if the insurance industry will be able to adjust the scheme in a way that gets Revenue approval. Equitable Life is determined to try. It stopped selling new flexible annuities this week but has written to the hundreds of people who have bought one. In the letter, it says it does not agree with the Revenue and will contest its decision. It will continue to pay out the annuity instalments due for the time being. These customers obviously are going to have a fraught period ahead as they wait to discover if their contracts are valid. Other people with a problem to sort out in a hurry are those due to retire in the very near future and planning to take out a flexible annuity. Everyone with a personal pension, and all members of company pension schemes based on money purchase (rather than final salary), have to use most of the lump sum produced by their pension plan to buy an annuity promptly when they actually retire. So, even if the insurance companies and the Revenue do eventually compromise on a modified version of the flexible annuity scheme, some would-be customers may be unable to wait. So, what are the options for people needing to choose a retirement plan now? Until the fate of managed annuities is resolved, their basic choice lies between a conventional annuity and a phased annuity. The standard conventional annuity involves a once-and-for-all swap of your lump sum for an agreed annual income for the rest of your life. Usually, this is fixed in money terms. Some degree of inflation-proofing might be built in, but only at the cost of a lower income to start with. The level of income is fixed by reference to gilt yields at the time you buy the annuity, your sex, and how long you are likely to live. A variant on this prototype allows you to take on some stock market risk by linking the income to a stock market-based product such as a with-profits or unit-linked fund. But most people are suited better by annuities which provide a guaranteed income. Phased annuities and schemes offering 'staggered vesting' (even more complex and costly) work by dividing your pension fund into several discrete chunks and allowing you to cash these in for an annuity when you choose. This goes a long way towards dealing with the timing problem. But it is a realistic option only for people wealthy enough to be able to afford to wait, or those who can retire gradually from paid employment. Other conditions, such as whether and when you can take part of your pension in a tax-free cash sum, and what the benefits for partners are, also vary considerably. Pension planning is an area where specialist advice is probably essential.

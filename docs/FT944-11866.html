			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Turks turn full force of rage on Kurds: John Barham reports on one of the biggest offensives in 10 years of war against the PKK Turkey's security forces have launched one of their largest offensives yet in the 10-year war against guerrillas of the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK). They aim to crush the insurgency in the heavily Kurdish south-east once and for all by destroying the PKK's stores and supply routes before winter sets in. The month-old campaign is the climax of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's hardline anti-PKK policy. She abandoned former President Turgut Ozal's search for reconciliation on taking office in June 1993, just after guerrillas ended a short-lived ceasefire by massacring 32 unarmed soldiers. But the conflict not only costs lives - 13,000 have died since fighting started in 1984 - it is also warping society, undermining the economy and distancing Turkey from its western allies. The cost of fighting the PKK - estimated at Dollars 3bn-Dollars 7bn a year - is bankrupting the government, which finances its deficits by borrowing and printing money. For a month, helicopters and jets have blasted away at suspected rebel hideouts in the rugged Munzur mountains of Tunceli province. Troops and guerrillas are clashing daily. The government claims the offensive is working. Troops have seized caches of stores and the army says guerrillas are surrendering at a rate of two or three a day. Mr Davud Haner, Tunceli's assistant governor, is confident that 'sooner or later' the PKK will be eliminated. Few western analysts would agree. Previous 'final offensives' have failed. Half Turkey's 500,000-strong army is based in the south-east, but the PKK, probably numbering less than 20,000, battles on. Turkish conscripts are poorly trained, badly motivated and do not know the region. The PKK generally keeps the initiative, raiding villages and military outposts. Large areas of the south-east are no-go areas. Harsh mountain terrain provides well-protected staging areas and cover from air attack. Turkey's enemies, notably Syria, have armed and trained the PKK. Far from winning hearts and minds, crack anti-guerrilla 'special teams' are hated for their brutality. The army's strategy of razing villages to deny them to the PKK further alienates local populations. Mr Musa Tok, a 70-year-old Kurdish peasant who fled his village near Tunceli, said: 'Soldiers gave me 10 days to clear out. What can I do? My father died defending Turkey and now I am being moved off my land.' A US human rights campaigner says that the PKK is probably more brutal than the army. 'But the army has totally over-reacted and driven a basically apathetic people towards the PKK.' Each new PKK outrage increases support for tougher action. In September, guerrillas murdered six teachers for teaching in Turkish rather than Kurdish. Ominously, Mrs Ciller's uncompromising approach is one of her weak coalition government's few popular policies. She is dragging her feet on promises to reform security laws that allow police to detain anyone suspected of the vaguely-defined crimes of 'separatism' or terrorism. By giving the generals responsibility for eliminating the PKK, she has further entrenched their considerable political power. Last month the army prevented Turkish MPs - including the deputy prime minister - from visiting areas of Tunceli where, according to media reports, troops were burning villages. Remarkably, these reports sparked an anguished public debate over army operations in the south-east. Until now, most Turks have viewed the army as guiltless in its fight against the PKK. Yet Amnesty International has often accused the security forces of exacting fearsome reprisals on civilians for guerrilla attacks. It also suspects security forces of torturing and assassinating opposition activists. Human rights violations disturb Turkey's allies. The US has cut aid to Turkey. In October, the European parliament suspended ties with Turkey's parliament in protest at the treason trial of 15 Kurdish MPs. Strasbourg is demanding the right to debate ratification of the customs union with Turkey scheduled for 1996. If it does so, it could well reject the customs union, a cornerstone of Turkish foreign policy. Western governments repeatedly tell Turkish officials that a purely military approach cannot work. They urge the government to isolate the PKK by offering regional autonomy and allowing education and broadcasting in Kurdish. But Mr Ecvet Tezcan, a foreign ministry official, says: 'We are going to fight. There is no other way out. Europe should understand that this is a question of our survival (as a state).' The south-east is Turkey's most backward region, still in the grip of feudal landlords. Although the government spends lavishly on infrastructure in the region, notably the Dollars 10bn GAP hydroelectric project, the expenditure benefits few local people. Mr Mazlum Arslan, Tunceli's moderate mayor, says: 'As well as fighting terrorism, the government must provide jobs, roads, freedom and democracy. We are all totally against terrorism. But if you do not provide this, you (justify) them.'</p>

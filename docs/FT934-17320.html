			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The West rings the changes in eastern Europe: Growing investment to upgrade telecommunications Western Europe has an average of 43 telephone lines per 100 people. In eastern Europe, only the Baltic states and Bulgaria have more than 20, while most of the region has between 10 and 15. Therein lies the opportunity for western telecoms companies. But it also explains their caution about investing, for the region's poor telecommunications are a reflection as much as a cause of its fragile economies. 'Companies don't want to get left out, but are unprepared to take large risks,' says Mr Ross Parsons, east European telecoms analyst with the consultancy CIT Publications. 'However, in eastern Europe significant investments come cheap by western standards.' The contrast is stark. Siemens is estimated to have invested Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) in Hungary. Last month it made its biggest east European investment this year: 80 per cent stakes in two Polish telecoms companies, ZWUT in Warsaw and Elwrow in Wroclaw, for Dollars 38.5m, with a promise to invest Dollars 57m over the next six years. Earlier this year Siemens was rumoured to have offered GEC, the UK supplier, Dollars 1.2bn for 60 per cent of GPT, its telecommunications division. It is the same story with privatisation. Hungary is set to be the first east European country to privatise its main network operator (Matav). Based on its line coverage, one valuation puts a price of Dollars 3.3bn on Matav - of which a third will be offered to a strategic partner later this year. By 1997 Deutsche Telekom will have spent about DM70bn (Pounds 28bn) in eastern Germany. Privatisation is likely to be the most effective way of attracting large-scale foreign investment. It can be done in discrete segments. Last year the Ukrainian government established a consortium of its national operator (with 51 per cent), AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom and the Netherlands PTT (with 49 per cent between them) to install an international gateway in Kiev and construct an inter-regional long distance network. The company, Utel, was originally responsible for a long distance service covering 13 regions; this has since been extended to cover the country's 12 other regions. Utel has an exclusive 15-year licence for international and trunk traffic. In terms of investment, Hungary has taken the lead in telecoms modernisation, and foreign involvement has been commensurately extensive. Since 1989 Matav has installed digital exchanges and in 1990 chose LM Ericsson and Siemens as exclusive suppliers over five years. Equipment orders have not been as closely tied to investment commitments as in Poland, and Ericsson's main local interest remains a 55 per cent stake in a small joint venture with Muszertechnika, a Hungarian private company. The other important arena for western players has been mobile communications. This summer Hungary raised nearly Dollars 100m in concession fees for two new digital networks. One will be built by US West and Matav; the other by a consortium of telecoms companies from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The two groups are expected to invest up to Dollars 200m each in network development over 10 years. Hungary has already attracted about Dollars 5.6bn in foreign investment since 1988. Mr Gyorgy Schamschula, Hungary's telecoms minister, believes the privatisation of Matav offers the chance to attract 'as much foreign capital again as has come to Hungary so far'. Deutsche Telekom has formed a powerful consortium with Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US to bid for Matav. Industry speculation on rival groups centres on France Telecom, US West and NTT. Southwestern Bell and Stet, the Italian state operator, are also thought to have bought information memoranda. By contrast, in Poland ideas for selling a 20 per cent stake in the state operator will probably be shelved by the incoming centre-left government. The state also has strict conditions on foreign investment - for instance, companies are obliged to produce in Poland half of the equipment they install. In Poland, the future belongs to Alcatel, which is installing systems in Krakow and Piotrkow; Siemens, which is installing DM72m worth of local and international switches in Silesia; and AT&amp;T which is building networks in Gdansk, Szczeczin, Wloclawek, Siedlce and Plock and laying 1,500km of fibre optic cable worth Dollars 30m. Funding has come from credits arranged by suppliers, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and most recently the EBRD for the Dollars 150m Gdansk project. Telekomunikacja Polska (TP SA), the state telecoms operator, is highly profitable and plans to cover one-third of investment outlays from its own funds. Although privatisation of TP SA seems to be off the agenda, local networks can be operated by anyone, local or foreign, without restriction. About 50 local operating licences have been issued, though only two local companies have started to install lines. The main problems are lack of finance and obstructions from TP SA, which is jealous of its monopoly. However, one local project - in Pila to install 100,000 lines at a cost of Dollars 80m - appears to be going ahead with backing from the International Finance Corporation. Sprint, the US long-distance operator, will be the managing company. There is also overseas involvement in Poland's cellular sector. Centertel, a network owned by Ameritech, France Telekom and TP SA has invested Dollars 135m and has 10,000 subscribers. The rest of eastern Europe is a similar patchwork of discrete, small-scale operations and joint ventures by western companies. But if the Hungarian privatisation is seen to be a success, the region could move sharply up the telecoms investment league.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                    TELEPHONE LINES IN EASTERN EUROPE  -------------------------------------------------------------------                     No of main    No. of main lines per 100 people                          lines,           1988                1991                     1991 (000s)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Bulgaria               2,250               22                  25 Estonia                  340               19                  21 Hungary                1,100                8                  11 Latvia                   640               22                  24 Lithuania                820               18                  22 Poland                 3,600              7.8                 9.5 Russia                22,000               12                  15 Ukraine                8,000               14                  15  ------------------------------------------------------------------- For comparison:  ------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                    26,000               42                  45  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CIT Research  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Trade and the environment WITH THE environment a high international priority, trade policies can be no more exempt from environmentalist scrutiny than any others. But the dangers of that scrutiny must not be ignored. Well-meaning environmentalists could find themselves in an unholy alliance with hypocritical protectionist lobbies. The outcome would not only be slower growth than is desirable, but postponement of the day when governments forge the needed global consensus on environmental policy. The Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has today published a report on trade and the environment intended to limit the potential damage. Its fear is that environmentalist pressure to bar exports from countries that do not meet what are deemed suitable environmental standards, or to restrain imports that are not made in environmentally suitable ways, would play into the hands of domestic protectionist lobbies. The secretariat argues persuasively that trade weapons - be they tariff walls, trade bans, or countervailing duties - can rarely be more than palliatives for the problems that concern environmentalists. Worse, where such measures are not being exploited by industries anxious to fend off foreign competition, they are being used by rich countries to force weaker ones to mirror their policies. The use of trade sanctions for environmental reasons is bound to alienate developing countries. Furthermore, the imposition of environmental standards can be an unjustifiable intrusion into the right of countries to set their own priorities. Countries are not clones of each other. Their environmental priorities may differ for valid reasons. Multilateral action Where such policies result in degradation of a country's domestic environment, without international or global spillovers, two options remain. One is to leave the country to wallow in its blighted policies, until it discovers the error of its way. The other is to galvanise multilateral action. A parallel would be international agreement to impose sanctions on South Africa. Naturally, such action would have to be exceptional to be acceptable. Where policies have a spillover effect on to nearby countries - like acid rain or river pollution - or, worse still, where they threaten the 'global commons', like the ozone layer or the world's forests, international action becomes necessary. But even then trade sanctions would rarely be the 'first best' strategy. Unilateral 'vigilante' action is likely to be self-defeating. Multilateral agreement would be far better. Vast bulk Above all, the cost of repairing the environment ought to fall on those responsible for the lion's share of the environmental damage, who are also those with the wealth and the technology to deal with it. Industrial countries should remember, as they preach the 'environmentally correct' path to developing countries, that they have no claim to the moral high ground. They, not the poor, are responsible for the vast bulk of the world's pollution, especially for those problems - global warming and damage to the ozone layer - with worldwide effects. Since there is a link between rising incomes per head and enhanced environmental standards, the rich industrial countries should also adopt policies that will accelerate economic growth among developing countries. Claims of European and American companies for compensation for the costs incurred in cleaning up their manufacturing processes, and for protection against Third World manufacturers who gain comparative advantage by maintaining cheaper, but dirtier technologies, must also be rejected. Those differences in preferences are sources of comparative advantage. Compensation is no more appropriate than it would be for different tax rates, salary levels, land costs and so on. The secretariat is convinced that the Gatt is ill-suited to settlement of genuine environmental problems or disputes. Its report, published just four months ahead of the Rio 'Earth Summit', is intended to press the case for a multilateral agreement on environmental policies, instead. The environment is important. But this concern should not be allowed to pollute the course of world trade, so denying those who are poor the opportunity to enjoy what the rich take for granted.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 1992 Preview: Most people are not pleased most of the time - Joe Rogaly explains that the opinion of the British people is not necessarily reflected accurately in the composition of the government The one thing this election will not tell us is which party the majority of the people of the UK want to govern them. Our elections never do. Since 1945 the closest we have come to putting in a truly majority government was in 1955, when Eden romped home with 49.7 per cent of the votes cast. Many other famous victories have fallen far short of that. For example, the three contests won by the Conservatives under the leadership of Mrs Margaret Thatcher did not represent a positive determination by a majority of the people that they welcomed a Tory decade. Mrs Thatcher secured huge majorities in terms of seats in the House of Commons, but during her time the highest share of votes cast for the Conservatives was 43.9 per cent. That was in 1979. In that same year, after all the tribulations of the winter of discontent, the Labour vote actually rose by nearly 100,000 compared with the previous election in October 1974. What made the difference was a reduction of some 2m in the Liberal vote, and an increase of about 3m in the Tory vote. In the two subsequent elections the split between Labour and the Alliance parties widened. The Conservatives sailed home on 42.4 per cent of votes cast in 1983 and 42.3 per cent in 1987. These seemingly substantial minorities melt away when the calculation takes account of the quarter of the electorate that did not turn out. Then it is seen that at no time did the governments of the 1980s rest on the expressed support of more than a third of the people. Even in 1987 only 32 per cent of the registered voters placed a cross before a Conservative candidate. Thus does simple arithmetic make nonsense of the notion that after 1979 there was a sea-change of opinion, or that 'the country' decided at three elections in a row that it wanted a government of the intermittently idiosyncratic right. It was reasonable to reduce the previously penal rates of income tax, privatise what Labour had nationalised, constrain the trade unions and reform the health and education services, but election results do not indicate that there was popular pressure for any of these policies. Such equations work backwards as well as forwards. To demonstrate that Mrs Thatcher's governments represented a minority of the people is not the same as to say that a majority wanted a Labour government. In 1983 the non-Conservative national parties were almost evenly split - 27.6 per cent for Labour, 25.4 per cent for the Social Democratic and Liberal party alliance. There was undeniably ferment on the left, but this does not mean that you could add the two scores, making 53 per cent, and assert that most people wanted a Lib-Lab alliance. Had that been a practical proposition, many votes might have been cast quite differently. Social Democratic party supporters and many Liberals rejected renationalisation, unilateral nuclear disarmament, and withdrawal from Europe - all three of which were principal planks of Labour policy. You may protest that none of this matters so long as the party that gets into government is the one that won the most votes. Even that is not guaranteed. In 1951 Labour won some 225,000 more votes than the Conservatives, but Sir Winston Churchill (then plain Mr) became prime minister. His Conservatives commanded 321 seats to Labour's 295. In February 1974 more people voted for Mr Edward Heath's Conservatives than for Mr Harold Wilson's Labour party, but it was Mr Wilson who returned to Number 10 Downing Street. 'The country' did not turf Mr Heath out. It was the electoral system that achieved that. Sweeping proclamations about what the people now want are a form of shorthand, convenient for idle minds. It is better to be particular. For example, Scotland has a four-party system. Two of the parties - Labour and the Liberal Democrats - propose to establish a devolved assembly for Scotland. The Scottish Nationalists want independence. Only the Conservatives propose to maintain the status quo. Yet the Tories could win the forthcoming election on a minority of United Kingdom votes and override the wish for some form of home rule, as expressed by three-quarters of the Scots. Again, Northern Ireland's politicians live in a world of their own. They are preoccupied with Ulster, not UK-wide concerns. Most Unionist MPs vote with the Conservatives in the Commons. There are two principal reasons why voting behaviour and thus the expression of the 'opinion of the people' have become disaggregated. The first is that the rise of the Liberals and nationalists has eaten away at support for Labour and the Conservatives. Between 1945 and February 1974 the largest share of the vote attracted by the then Liberal party was 11.2 per cent. The average Liberal score over the eight elections between 1945 and 1970 was 7 per cent. In the five elections since February 1974 the average for the centre parties has run at 20 per cent. The Celtic vote, although small in absolute terms, has shown a similar increase. Second, voters have become less attached to parties. Loyalties can no longer be taken for granted. This is true of most democracies in the west. The classic socialist-capitalist divide was dependent to some degree upon the existence of a large blue-collar proletariat. Contemporary class structures are complicated and inherently unstable. Thus it is hardly surprising that the picture of public opinion drawn from the evidence of polling data is blurred. A 1988 survey by Mori indicated that 54 per cent of the British people then held essentially socialist values while 39 per cent adhered to what at the time were called 'Thatcherist' values. As recalled by Mr Bob Worcester of Mori: 'A third of those who said their voting intention . . . was Labour held essentially Thatcherist values and over a quarter (27 per cent) of those whose voting intention was Tory were essentially socialists, whether they knew it or not.' There is another reason for describing the public mood as confused. In his recent book, British Public Opinion, Mr Worcester suggests that three elements influence the behaviour of marginal voters, those important individuals who determine which party wins and by how much. These are: the image of the leader, the party's perceived fitness to govern, and party policies. As to the first, today's Conservatives are far ahead with Mr John Major. The Tories also probably have the edge on fitness to govern, although Labour, with its clean shirts, neat suits and conservative ties, has been catching up fast. Finally, there is a familiar list of policy divides. Labour is preferred on health, education, social security and the like, while the Tories' principal advantages are the economy, defence, law and order. It is the economy that tends to be the deciding factor. Here the regional distribution of seats is instructive. Of about 100 Conservative marginals, 78 are to be found in London and the south-east, the Midlands and the north-west. In most of them, the existing Tory majorities are vulnerable to a strong swing to Labour. It could be that decisions by fewer than 250,000 voters in those constituencies will be decisive. If so, the question on polling day boils down to something far more mundane than 'what is the mood of the country?' It is: 'How badly off do a handful of swing voters in about an eighth of the constituencies feel - and do the Few Who Choose think they would be any better off under Labour?'</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Tory dismay as backbencher calls for cabinet sackings Fresh divisions hit the Conservative party yesterday, just four days before this year's first crucial electoral test, when a senior MP called for nearly a third of the cabinet and the party chairman to be replaced. The extraordinary public outburst by Mr David Evans, a member of the powerful 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, undermined efforts to mount a show of party unity ahead of the local elections. His remarks came after Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, implied that two out of 10 Tory MPs did not fully support Mr John Major and that teams of supporters were already canvassing on behalf of two potential leadership candidates. The local elections this week, followed by the European elections in June, are expected to have a decisive bearing on whether Mr Major remains prime minister. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the Conservatives of never having been as demoralised, disorganised and dispirited as they were today. He called on voters to use the approaching elections to punish the government for recent tax increases. As senior cabinet ministers lined up to mark the 15th anniversary of unbroken Tory rule by attacking Labour, Mr Evans, Conservative MP for Welwyn Hatfield, stole their thunder by calling for six cabinet ministers and Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, to go. He named only three: Mr John Gummer, cabinet minister with responsibility for local government, Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, and Mr John Patten, education secretary. Speaking of 'unease' in the party that Mr Major's closest advisers were 'incompetent', Mr Evans called for a new 'kitchen cabinet' to be installed at Downing St. He admitted there were some 50 Conservative MPs who would not accept the prime minister 'at any price'. Mrs Shephard yesterday tried to play down the significance of her remarks, saying there was 'a tiny handful' of people who were determined to cause problems. In Blackpool, Mr Smith demanded an immediate general election if Mr Major was replaced. Tory fault-lines over Europe were also exposed when Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury - who is widely expected to enter the cabinet in a summer reshuffle - insisted that most Conservative supporters recognised that Britain's economic interests were best served within Europe. His comments came after Mr Michael Portillo, one of his Treasury colleagues, said the imposition of a single European currency would mean giving up the government of the UK.

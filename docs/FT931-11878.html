			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Call to extend Budget timetable PRESSURE IS mounting on the government to reduce loopholes in tax legislation by extending the period for consultation before finance acts are drafted and debated. Tax practitioners want each year's finance bill to be published early in January and not passed until mid summer. They say that has been made possible by the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to move the Budget to December. Their strategy would reduce the need for late-night parliamentary debates to correct anomalies in the finance bill identified at the last minute. It would also reduce errors caused because parliamentary draftsmen failed to capture the intention of ministerial debate in the bills. The finance bill is now published shortly after the Budget in March and given royal assent during the summer. Tax experts argue that this three-month gap should be extended to six months. They also say that draft parts of the finance bill should be circulated after the Budget in December to give them the Christmas period to examine the legislation. The move follows the response to a joint submission last September to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, by a group including the Institute of Taxation. Mr Dorrell said there were no plans to extend the consultation period. The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants has called for changes to the tax structure which would divide taxpayers into business and private-income earners. The institute said that the present structure forced businesses to choose between incorporation or non-incorporation on tax grounds and that ending the distinction would ease the integration of UK businesses into the European regime.</p>

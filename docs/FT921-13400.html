			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / US Supreme Court to review abortion law THE US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to review a highly restrictive Pennsylvania abortion law, paving the way for an inflammatory debate over the constitutionality of abortion during this year's presidential campaign. As the court announced the review, dozens of demonstrators were being arrested for trying to bar pregnant women from entering two Washington abortion clinics. Pro-choice advocates were 'running the blockades' to escort pregnant women into the clinics. Ms Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defence Fund, yesterday said she expected the court to use the Pennsylvania case as a vehicle to reconsider Roe vs Wade, the 1973 decision which legalised abortion in the US. Today is the 19th anniversary of the Roe decision. President George Bush has replaced two liberal judges on the supreme court with two conservatives, and 'the risk is high' that Roe will be overturned, Ms Lichtman said. A Pennsylvania appeals court struck down a provision in the Pennsylvania law which said a wife's spouse must be notified before an abortion can be performed, but it let stand other restrictions, including compulsory a 24-hour waiting period before the abortion. Both the state and women's rights groups then appealed to the Supreme Court. Women's groups are blaming Mr Bush for the threatened loss of abortion rights along with the Senate, which approved his court nominees.</p>

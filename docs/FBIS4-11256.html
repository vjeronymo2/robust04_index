			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo 22 Apr -- The foreign ministers and  delegates of the Rio Group and the EU who met today here believe  the new rules established by the GATT will solve eventual trade  disagreements between their blocs.    Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana today told  journalists  that there are "less trade barriers" following the agreements  reached during the Uruguay Round.    "Just as the political walls have fallen, the economic and  trade walls are now falling," the Spanish foreign minister said  before the opening ceremony of the fourth annual ministerial  meeting of the EU and the Rio Group, the principal Latin  American forum for concerted action.    The meeting, which is taking place at the Latin American  Parliament (Parlatino) headquarters, will end tomorrow with the  signature of a 10-page declaration in which the discussion will  be evaluated and the bases for a future inter-regional relation  will be established.    The Rio Group has expressed concern and rejection over the  possible environmental, social, and political conditioning by  the EU of Latin American exports.    The Europeans and Latin Americans who agree that the  dialogue  between the two should be upgraded have asserted that mechanisms  to solve future trade conflicts may be found in the recent GATT  resolutions.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio has told EFE  that "an alarm must be set off" in face of the possible  establishment of new trade obstacles. She nonetheless admitted  that arbitration and problem-resolving instruments are envisaged  by the GATT.    Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said: "The GATT  rules eliminate these fears since they create a trade order to  counter protectionist practices."    Regarding the attempted inclusion of a "social clause" on  trade flow, Spanish Foreign Minister Solana expressed his wish  that Europeans and Latin Americans reach "a joint position"  within the organization that will soon replace the GATT, that  is, the World Trade Organization.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim opened the meeting  in  Sao Paulo today. He said that despite some disagreements, the  Rio Group is aware of the permanent goodwill of the EU to  intensify the general system of international trade.    The current circumstances, Amorim said, offer new  opportunities to renew relations, adding: "We observe the  temptation to adopt an hegemonic attitude, which is natural  following the disappearance of the bipolarity" that prevailed in  the past.    Theodoros Pangalos, the alternate foreign minister of Greece  and EU acting president, and European Commission Vice President  Manuel Marin then spoke.    Marin said that although Latin America has attained economic  growth, financial balance, and the consolidation of its  democratic institutions "it still has a pending subject: the  accumulated social debt as a consequence of the economic  adjustment processes."    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa defended a greater  access of Latin American exports to the EU market and rejected  any trade conditioning.    He added that the increase of European exports to Latin  America -- which amounted to 23 billion ECU's in 1993 --  contrast with the sharp decline of imports -- 22 billion ECU's  -- when the trade balance was negative by 10 billion ECU's in  1990.    The foreign ministers and delegates who participated in the  first of the two work sessions today agreed on the need for a  "quality improvement step" in the dialogue between Europe and  Latin America.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The coalition parties [the Civic Democratic Party,  the Civic Democratic Alliance, the Christian Democratic  Union--Czechoslovak People's Party, and the Christian Democratic  Party] assess positively the U.S. project Partnership for Peace,  which was approved by the top officials of NATO countries in  Brussels yesterday [10 January].    The Czech Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Social  National Party are also positive about the project. All of the  above consider this project to be, first of all, the first step  to the desirable cooperation of the Czech Republic with NATO.    The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the Left Bloc  disagree with this opinion. They warn against our joining NATO  because they see a possible isolation in relation to the  remaining partners within the Visegrad Four, as well as the  threat of cutting down on our sovereignty.</p>

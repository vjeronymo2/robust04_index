This final rule amends Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 9A04A to include the international space station and all components, parts, accessories, attachments and associated equipment specially designed, modified or configured therefor. The international space station is being built under the supervision of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and NASA's international partners: the space agencies of Japan, Canada and Russia, and the European Space Agency. The Department of State will publish a separate rule that removes the space station from the United States Munitions List (USML). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Jerald Beiter, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;3351.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 16, 1990, President Bush signed Executive Order 12735 on Chemical and Biological Weapons and directed various other export control measures. The measures directed by the President included the removal from the USML (see 22 CFR part 121) of all items contained on the COCOM dual-use list (i.e, the International Industrial List), unless U.S. national security interests would be jeopardized. To implement this part of the directive, the Space Technical Working Group (STWG), was established. The group consists of representatives from the Departments of State, Commerce, and Defense, as well as other U.S. Government agencies. The STWG recommended movement of certain non-military spacecraft, including the international space station, from the USML to the CCL. Further, on March 10, 1994, an interagency Space Station Export Controls Steering Committee recommended several steps in the area of U.S. export controls that are necessary for NASA to advance its international space station program; one of those steps involved the movement of the international space station itself from export control under the USML to control under the CCL, as well as all components, parts, accessories, attachments and associated equipment specially designed, modified or configured for the international space station.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the removal of international space station commodities from the USML, the State Department is removing from the USML certain software and technology related to the international space station, which software and technology are not captured under Category XV(f) of the USML. Such software and technology not captured under Category XV(f) of the USML are currently captured on the CCL at ECCNs 9D96G and 9E96G and will remain under those ECCNs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and determined that, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA, as amended, shall be carried out under Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, so as to continue in full force and effect and amend, as necessary, the export control system heretofore maintained by the Export Administration Regulations issued under the EAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0010, 0694&hyph;0013, and 0694&hyph;0073.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Hillary Hess, Office of Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 9 (TASS) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin signed a decree "on the participation in peacekeeping  operations for maintenance of peace in the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict."    The decree, which came to ITAR-TASS from the presidential  press service, says that this decision was adopted following the  deterioration of the situation in the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and proceeding from the support  given by CIS states to a proposal to carry out a peace-keeping  operation in the zone of the conflict and taking into account  repeated requests made by Georgian and Abkhazian leaders to  deploy peace-keeping forces without delay.    Yeltsin decreed: "To take part in carrying out a  peace-keeping operation by the Commonwealth of Independent  States for the maintenance of peace in Abkhazia." (point 1)    The Russian Government has been instructed to ensure the  formation of the necessary military contingent on the basis of  Russian troops having a status of a peace-keeping force, with  the use of the infrastructure of the Russian Armed Forces  stationed in the Caucasus, with its possible subsequent  reinforcement after the federation council adopts a  corresponding decision.    The decree goes into effect since the moment of signing,  except point 1, which will come into force after the federation  council adopts a decision on the use of the Russian military  contingent as part of the CIS peace-keeping force in Abkhazia.    The decree has been submitted to the federation council for  consideration.</p>

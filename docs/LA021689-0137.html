			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: LOGGING PROGRAM RELIVES THE PAST  </P> <P> Personal computers allow us to perform many tasks that we could not otherwise  do. But there is a certain anxiety attached to all that power. What if we lose  a critical file? It happens.  </P> <P> Sometimes files are lost because the computer was turned off before the data  file was saved and the program that created it was properly closed. At other  times, some combination of keys were pressed that could not be obeyed by the  computer and it locked up, preventing the data from being saved. A user error  or a bug in the program can cause that, too.  </P> <P> Partial data loss may be just as bad, as when a portion of a document or  spreadsheet is inadvertently deleted.  </P> <P> But a new program for IBM and compatible personal computers can, in some  circumstances, help you recover from such disasters. Cocoon, $100, from  Daybreak Technologies, lets your computer keep a log of every keystroke you  make. Then, if the need arises, Cocoon recreates what you lost by using that  log to replay the keystrokes.  </P> <P> The idea behind Cocoon is deceptively simple. Just before you enter the program  you would normally use, you start the log running just by typing the word LOG  in front of the command you use to start the program, as in LOG 123 to start  logging a Lotus 1-2-3 session.  </P> <P> From then until you leave the program, every keystroke you make is instantly  recorded in a special log file on the hard disk. That process continues until  you exit the program for which you started the log. On my PC/AT compatible  computer there was no perceptible slowdown in my regular software while the  keystrokes were being recorded.  </P> <P> You can log keystrokes for any program you have on your hard disk without  interfering with logs of other programs, as long as each program is stored in a  separate directory. Cocoon automatically backs up its own log files.  </P> <P> The Cocoon program is known as memory-resident software because once loaded it  resides in your computer's memory alongside the application program -- word  processor, spreadsheet, database, etc. -- that you choose to run. It is a very  compact program, requiring only 10 kilobytes of memory in the log phase and 20  kilobytes during the recovery phase, so it will run on virtually any IBM or  compatible personal computer with a hard disk. Floppy disk drives are too slow  for Cocoon's log to work.  </P> <P> The only application program use that Cocoon cannot log is that of another  memory-resident program such as Sidekick or Hotline.  </P> <P> The idea of logging keystrokes is simple and it really does work, but there are  some big potential problems that you need to be aware of.  </P> <P> Because all Cocoon does is record keystrokes, it doesn't know anything about  the context in which those keys were hit. It can't read your computer screen  the way you can.  </P> <P> Here's how you can get into big trouble. Say you start Lotus 1-2-3 and then use  a feature of that spreadsheet program that shows you a list of worksheets and  allows you to move the cursor to highlight the one you want to open. Cocoon  will know only how many times you pressed the cursor key, not the name of the  worksheet file that was highlighted.  </P> <P> If you add or delete another worksheet during that session, the order in which  those names appears on your screen will change and if you subsequently use  Cocoon to recover the session, it will open the wrong worksheet. Obviously,  every keystroke it replays thereafter will damage a good worksheet and leave  the one you wanted to repair untouched.  </P> <P> You can protect yourself by making sure that you always type file names when  you are logging a session, instead of pointing with the cursor keys. But that  may mean you have to change the way you are used to working with your favorite  software.  </P> <P> Another problem arises if you work with an existing file during a logged  session, as opposed to creating a new file. Under those circumstances, Cocoon  will not be able to recreate the session accurately unless it can begin with a  version of the existing file that is identical to the one you started working  with.  </P> <P> That means you always should make backup copies of existing files when you  begin a new logged session and then use the backup if you need to recover your  keystrokes. Some programs give you the option of making backups when you open a  file, and some even do it automatically. If your software does neither, you can  use the COPY command of your operating system to make a backup before you start  the session.  </P> <P> When working with backups, remember that they have a different name than your  original file so you'll have to change the name of the backup to that of the  original before you can successfully recover the session.  </P> <P> Another thing to watch out for: Don't make any intermediate saves of the file  you are working on while you are logging keystrokes. If you do and you later  need to recover, the file won't be in the condition it was when you started the  session. Not making intermediate saves will take some getting used to because  it is contrary to every safety instruction you probably have learned. Of  course, you do want to get into the habit of backing up your work either when  you finish working on a file or before you begin working on it the next time.  </P> <P> In fact, as I wrote this column, my word processor automatically saved my text  at intervals. That feature prevented Cocoon from working properly unless I used  it with a backup version of the file.  </P> <P> The authors of Cocoon anticipated these kinds of problems and warn you about  them in the instruction manual. But they also programmed a way to edit the log  file during recovery so that you don't execute unwanted keystrokes and ruin the  very file that you are trying to save.  </P> <P> If you understand the pitfalls and watch out for them, Cocoon works very  nicely. It is fun to watch it automatically recover the keystrokes because it  is like having the computer on autopilot. The file is recreated at a brisk pace  before your eyes. You also can set it for manual recovery in which you have to  press a key (any key on the keyboard) to instruct Cocoon to recover the next  keystroke in the log file. The manual mode is a little safer if you're not sure  if something will go haywire in the recovery process because it can be stopped  at any point.  </P> <P> A very nice feature of Cocoon is that you can tell it to reconstruct your last  session up to, but not including, the last keystroke you had typed. If it was  the last keystroke that ruined things before, you certainly don't want to  repeat it during the recovery phase.  </P> <P> There are some other uses you can make of Cocoon. It can be used by programmers  to debug a program by playing back keystrokes used to operate the program they  are creating and show where they cause problems. The log file also can be used  to create complex files for programs that allow the use of macros. A macro is a  way to cause a single key to send a long series of keystrokes to the program.  </P> <P> Another use is to create program demonstrations that can be replayed for others  to see.  </P> <P> In computing, things are seldom simple. Cocoon is a good example of a program  works very well and performs a critically important task. But it has to be used  with skill and care or you could end up with a worse mess than you started  with.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the author cannot  respond individually to letters.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ugandan troops of the expanded ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West Africa States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], of  the multinational African peacekeeping force in Liberia, are  today being deployed in the southeast of the country. The  Ugandan peacekeepers are travelling by sea to Maryland County,  where they will be received by county officials, chiefs, elders,  and ordinary citizens, as well as UN officials including  Ambassador Trevor Gordon-Somers. The deployment, which has been  described by observers as long overdue, is in compliance with  the Cotonou Peace Agreement, which mandates the disarmament,  encampment, and demobilization of NPFL [National Patriotic Front  of Liberia] soldiers under the auspices of the expanded ECOMOG.    The deployment of the Ugandan contingent in the southeast  follows several hours of talks during discussions between UN  Envoy Trevor Gordon-Somers and former NPRG [National Patriotic  Reconstruction Government] President Charles Gankay Taylor last  evening. The meeting, held at the Executive Mansion in Gbarnga,  is believed to have centered on removing the obstacles in the  way of the peace process.    The slow pace of the deployment, which is a prerequisite for  the disarmament exercise of all fighting groups in the country,  has been the main hurdle in carrying out the military aspects of  the Cotonou Accord. (?Commercial) interests in the factional  fighting within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy  in Liberia] has been dragging the peace process to the brink of  collapse.    Nigerian and Ghanaian [as heard] troops of the old ECOMOG  have been selling arms to the opposing sides within ULIMO.  Intelligence sources in ECOMOG revealed last week that the  Guineans were selling arms to the Mandingo faction of ULIMO,  while the Nigerian contingent is in the business of arms sales  to the Krahn elements of ULIMO. [passage omitted]    News just coming in from Monrovia says the forces loyal to  the leader of the Mandingo faction, Mr. Alhaji Koromah, are  being surrounded in Monrovia by security forces. Some have been  arrested and are presently under detention at various  headquarters in Monrovia, awaiting interrogation by the joint  security. General Koromah [title as heard] is alleged to have  imported mercenaries into the country under the guise of being  businessmen in the city. According to reports from Monrovia,  some of the mercenaries are now selling towels, clothes, [word  indistinct], and other valuable items, while others are directly  [word indistinct] with Mr. Koromah and with Sierra Leonean and  Guinean ECOMOG soldiers.</p>

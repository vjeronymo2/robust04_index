			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VIACOM SUES TIME FOR $2.4 BILLION OVER ITS PAY-TV PRACTICES  </P> <P> Viacom Inc. today charged Time Inc. and its Home Box Office and other cable  television subsidiaries with monopolizing the pay-TV airwaves and filed a  lawsuit seeking as much as $2.4 billion in damages.  </P> <P> The antitrust lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by Viacom  International Inc. and Showtime Networks Inc., two units of the New York-based  entertainment and communications company.  </P> <P> Viacom said in a statement that the suit against Time, one of the world's  largest entertainment and publishing conglomerates, had been more than a year  in preparation.  </P> <P> In the suit, Viacom alleges that Time and its Home Box Office Inc., American  Television and Communications Corp. and Manhattan Cable Television Inc. units  are violating federal antitrust laws.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Predatory . . . Acts'  </P> <P> Viacom charged that Time and its TV holdings are monopolizing, conspiring to  monopolize and attempting to restrain trade, practices prohibited by the  Sherman and Clayton acts.  </P> <P> Time, HBO, ATC and MCTV are breaking the laws by "engaging in an integrated  series of predatory and exclusionary acts and strategies designed to increase  the costs of their rivals, raise barriers to entry and expansion and otherwise  entrench themselves as monopolists by anti-competitive conduct, injuring the  competitive process and, ultimately, consumers," the suit said.  </P> <P> Viacom alleged that Time and its cable subsidiaries have tied up the limited  number of cable outlets available in many markets and also tied up the most  desirable films for pay-television programming services.  </P> <P> Time's American Television &amp; Communications Corp. subsidiary owns or  manages cable systems reaching at least 7.2 million viewers in the United  States. In each of its local markets, including much of Manhattan and such  cities as Memphis and Denver, ATT possesses a nearly 100% market share, the  suit said.  </P> <P> Even in markets where Showtime and The Movie Channel are offered through a  Time-controlled cable system, Viacom alleges that its channels are treated in a  discriminatory manner with regard to channel position and in promotion and  marketing.  </P> <P> The suit contends that the violations entitle Viacom to recover three times the  actual amount of monetary damage done to Viacom, which was placed at no less  than $800 million. After trebling, the amount sought in damages is $2.4  billion.  </P> <P> Viacom also asked the court to permanently bar Time and its pay-TV units from  further anti-competitive behavior.  </P> <P> Time Inc. called Viacom's complaint "totally baseless" and "a rehashing of  issues that have been periodically raised for more than a decade."  </P> <P> "On several occasions, the Justice Department has reviewed many if not all of  these allegations and repeatedly concluded that no action was warranted," it  said.  </P></p>

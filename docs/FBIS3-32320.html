The ambassador was  received by the current president of the Senate, Firmin  Jean-Louis. Edner Jean reports live:    [Jean] The meeting between the two men lasted about an hour.  This meeting allowed Ambassador William Lacy Swing and President  Firmin Jean-Louis to proceed to an assessment of the country's  general situation and to the inventory of the perspectives of a  solution to the crisis. Both parties expressed their common  concern about the degradation of the social, economic, and  political atmosphere as well as their real willingness to  proceed quickly toward the resolution of the crisis. This visit  by the United States ambassador in Port-au-Prince was mainly a  gesture of support for Firmin Jean-Louis who is threatened with  being discharged by some senators of the Alliance for  Parliamentary Cohesion with the firm and determined support of  those elected in the contested 18 January vote. On 2 February  the resolution asking for the discharge of Firmin Jean-Louis  almost made it to a vote. The ambassador insisted at length on  the importance that his government gives to the legislative  agenda within the scope of the Governors Island and New York  accords. Furthermore, he pointed out the key role that the  parliament must play in the search for a solution to the crisis  and in the building of democracy in Haiti. [passage omitted].  The ambassador also answered journalists' questions regarding  the conflict between the United States and France on a total  blockade against Haiti. The ambassador reaffirmed that the  United-States and the three other countries -- the friends of  Haiti -- maintain a common position and demand once more the  return of democracy in Haiti. [passage omitted]. The presence  of Mr. Kosak [not further identified], who has just arrived from  the United States, should be noted. He participated to some  extent in the talks between Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis and American  Ambassador William Lacy Swing. Right now, the ambassador is  talking with the president of the Lower Chamber, Deputy Frantz  Robert Monde.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Fizz goes out of office revels: Christmas parties are too dear for some UK companies Lehman Brothers is trimming back the tinsel this year: it has cancelled the Christmas party for its London staff. The decision has brought some grumbles, and provoked some 'underground' events, but it seems that the US investment bank is not alone in taking a cost-benefit approach to festive fun. Despite the recovery in the UK economy, jollity is a commodity that some companies are finding too expensive. They want to maintain staff morale, and the image projected by a high-profile celebration is important, but many are considering carefully how much pleasure it is worth paying for. A survey of 130 businesses by Reed Personnel Services revealed that 81 per cent of companies were still planning office parties this year, but approximately half said they expected them to be less extravagant than in the boom years. As Mr William Deakin, owner of Juliana's party designers, says: 'Parties in the 1980s were very lavish with unlimited budgets for alcohol and perhaps included cabarets. Now people cut out themes and cabarets, and after a certain point the guests have to pay for their own booze.' In some sectors an extravagant Christmas party continues to be justified as a status symbol and a display of creative skills. Ms Wendy Riches, managing director of advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather, for example, says that recent Christmas parties have involved the staff dressing up as animals to visit the zoo, and gambling fake money in casinos. 'We are a bright, sparky agency so we have to do something bright and sparky,' she explains. But even among advertising and public relations agencies, the emphasis has shifted away from sheer expenditure towards greater innovation. 'How much staff enjoy a party often has nothing to do with how much money is spent,' Ms Riches insists. The desire to stage a shared celebration as a way of engendering corporate spirit is also still strong. Morgan Stanley held a lavish staff party in Chelsea this year, while its bond traders celebrated among waxworks in Madame Tussauds. It also held a client party at the Royal Academy - a venue that costs Pounds 3,500 to hire, before catering costs. Securities house Robert Fleming, which has been increasing its staff recently, held a dinner for more than 1,000 people at the Grosvenor House Hotel - an event which, according to the hotel's official price list, would normally cost about Pounds 33,000. 'Our most valuable asset is our people. We believe that a party like this is valuable because it brings people together - many of our staff are very specialised, and never have a chance to meet each other,' says Robert Fleming. But as City groups have expanded, some have found that engendering corporate togetherness is no longer feasible. Stockbroker Nomura International's guest list, for example, has risen to more than 1,400 in the past couple of years as the company has expanded. It now has difficulty cramming its staff and partners into a venue without dividing them into separate rooms - and thus dividing any corporate spirit. 'We have been thinking about cost cutting,' Nomura explained. The lack of any suitable large venue in London clinched its decision to abandon its main staff party this year, it says. Ford UK, the car manufacturer, has never funded staff Christmas parties, precisely because of the problem of size. The company used to have 50,000 employees, and it was impossible to fund a party for all of them, the management argues - but it would have been divisive if it had funded a party for a few. The fear that a party might generate more ill-will than good appears to have been a motivating factor for other companies. They are worried about appearing profligate. The phenomenon of the extravagant of-fice party is anyway particularly British. 'You don't see drunken crowds wearing black tie on the streets in Paris at Christmas like you often see around the City,' notes a trader with a French bank in London. UK companies are more aware of how their customers might view an expensive party. East Midlands Electricity, which recently announced a special interim dividend worth Pounds 186m, is sticking to its traditional Christmas lunch - courtesy of the company canteen and funded by the staff themselves. 'If you think we are all living lavishly in the privatised sector, that would be wrong,' the company says. Government departments such as the Treasury have long relied on Christmas spirit to overcome their restrained party budgets. The Treasury's public expenditure group, for example, this year had a party featuring karaoke to enliven an otherwise modest affair. For small companies, Christmas parties continue to play a vital role, particularly at a time of weak employee confidence. 'The benefits of a party for staff morale are very great,' says Mr Charles Madden of specialist broking house European American Securities. Last year the company had a Christmas meal in a Chinese restaurant. This year, however, the six employees, plus partners, travelled to Paris to celebrate. 'Paying for a weekend in Paris might sound a bit ritzy, but it's good value if you compare it with the goodwill it creates - particularly when a meal might normally cost Pounds 50 a head anyway.' But as the spending bonanza of the 1980s becomes a distant memory, a more cost-conscious approach seems likely to spread further in the private sector. Corporate Christmas frolics remain entrenched. But crackers, rather than champagne, seem likely to be the hallmark of the British Christmas party this decade.</p>

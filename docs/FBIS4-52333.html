			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT]  sponsored "Research Council for Broadcast Digitization," a  private-sector research council of the Broadcast Administration  Bureau director and chaired by Academic Information Center  Director Hiroshi Inose, which was conducting a study on  next-generation broadcasting systems channeled through  satellites, cable, and land-based stations, issued its final  draft report on 24 April. The main feature of the report covered  provisions for setting standards for various technical features  concerning digital broadcasting by fiscal year 1996, thus  specifying a timetable for the first stage of digitization. The  aim of the timetable is to encourage domestic sources to embark  on research and development at an early stage in view of trends  in overseas areas. The report provides a course for  digitization, while having the potential of rekindling debate on  a modification of plans for analog-based high-vision  broadcasting.    The Research Council for Broadcast Digitization will  complete  its final report by 27 April. Already in the interim report  published in December 1993, the council had recommended the  adaptation of digital technology which has the capability of  transmitting larger volumes of data than past systems, while the  final report is expected to include government implementing  plans aimed at the adaptation of digital broadcasting.    The final report will introduce the fact that the  International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is promoting  establishment of a standard for digital broadcasting with a  target of 1996. The final report will conclude that "There is a  need, domestically, to standardize technical aspects of the  program by 1996," in order to avoid being left behind by the  international community.    Transition to digital broadcasting will require several  stages and standardizing the technology will be the first step.  Broadcasting-related industries fear a drop in sales of current  analog-based products and are reluctant to assume a clear-cut  stand on the intent to convert to digital broadcasting, but the  final report will have the objective of enhancing the desire of  manufacturers of communications equipment and domestic  appliances to develop digital-technology equipment by specifying  a timetable for establishing standards for digitization.</p>

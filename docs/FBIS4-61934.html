			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, Mikhail Moroz] </F>   [Text] Kiev 10 May TASS -- Four candidates for the post of  Ukrainian president have become known here on Tuesday, including  Leonid Kravchuk. The other candidates include socialist leader  Aleksandr Moroz, president of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Businessmen Leonid Kuchma, and Parliament  Speaker Ivan Plush, ITAR-TASS was told by vice-chairman of the  Ukrainian Central Elections Commissions Valentin Kirnenko. He  noted that all the candidates, according to preliminary  information, had collected the 100,000 signatures, required to  be registered as presidential candidate.    According to the same source, two would-be candidates have  asked the central commission to give them more time to collect  the needed signatures, but were refused. According to the  legislation in force, a presidential candidate had to collect  the needed signatures before 6 May. Moreover, he had to collect  100,000 "autographs" in 18 regions and not less than 1,500 in  each of them.    Leader of one of the Ukrainian Rukh organisations Larisa  Skorik voluntarily gave up the race. According to some reports,  she plans to campaign for Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukrainian  president still wants the presidential elections to be put off  to a later date. In addition to a large group of MP's [members  of parliament], his stand is backed by the right-wing centrist  parties and movements. Kravchuk plans to hold a closed meeting  with them today. It is not difficult to guess that they will  work out the tactics and strategy for the session of the new  Ukrainian parliament, which is to open on 11 May.</p>

This, according  to the Tamanrasset governorate department of regulations and  administration, is the final evaluation of the damage assessment  commission.    According to the commission, four sectors were hit  especially  hard: housing, agriculture, water supply, and basic  infrastructures.    Thus, 416 houses in Ideles and 118 in In-Amguel have become  uninhabitable. As a result, governorate officials indicated, the  Tamanrasset governorate initiated an emergency housing  reconstruction program as part of communal development plans  (PCDs) in order to cope with the emergency and provide housing  for the homeless.    As far as agriculture is concerned, 120 hectares under  irrigation were flooded, 70 motor pumps carried along by the  deluge, and 100 range wells damaged. Hundreds of cattle, goats,  and sheep were also lost.    The departments involved prepared an application to the  National Natural Disaster Fund for any assistance and  indemnities that may apply.    In the In-Amguel and Ideles areas, the drinking-water supply  system was reported damaged over 3,000 meters, the discharge  system over 850 meters. At In-Amguel, four drillings are deemed  irreparably lost, and eight valves were carried along by the  water.    The basic infrastructure sector, too, suffered extensive  damage involving in particular 110 km of unpaved road, three  crossings, 65 km of road shoulder, and a long section of Highway  No. 1 between Tit and In-Amguel.    The Tamanrasset governorate declared an emergency concerning  the repair of damaged drinking water lines and unpaved roads,  and decided to launch an emergency housing construction program  making it mandatory, this time, to use local stone as building  material instead of the "toub" that disintegrates every time it  rains.    Note that the president of the Algerian Association for  Maladjusted Children (AAPEI), whom we contacted by telephone,  indicated that the association would start distributing food to  flood victims in the In-Amguel and Ideles areas on Saturday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today's Comment" column by So Naro, secretary </F> general of the Cambodian Journalists Association: "We Do Not  Want To Exchange Hun Sen for Khieu Samphan"]    [Text] The horrifying news carried in the letter from  Samdech Hun Sen to the Cambodian king on 18 June, in which the  former said he wished to resign from his post, has caused great  alarm among the citizens. The Cambodian people would like to  solmenly declare that we do not want to exchange Hun Sen for the  genocidal gang of blood-thirsty butchers under whose reign of  terror many of our grandparents, parents, children, and  grandchildren died most miserably in their prison without walls.    The Cambodian people cherish and are always ready to follow  His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the revered monarch  of the Cambodian motherland. The king, however, is living so  far away from his subjects. Will he be able to prevent the gang  of butchers from murdering his beloved children and  grandchildren again as during those three years eight months and  20 days? Only Prince Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] and Samdech  Hun Sen have all the potential and all the forces at their  disposal to stop the black-shirted murderers from returning to  power. If Samdech Hun Sen, who is a patriot and who once saved  the nation, leaves the Royal Government and is replaced by the  blood-stained bandits, the king's subjects will surely be  miserable and wretched again.    His Majesty the father of the nation is begged not to listen  to the sweet-talking, black-hearted Khmer Rouge who are very  good in their divide-to-rule tactics. If they succeed in  recapturing power, our revered nation, religion, and king will  surely be just history. Seeing this sign of danger, the largest  segment of the Cambodian people earnestly implores His Majesty  the father of the nation to graciously maintain his trust in the  Royal Government born out of the will of the people who are your  loyal subjects.    Your Majesty should not forget the taste of the  3-year-8-month-20-day regime to which you too were subject.  This time, if the Khmer Rouge get the power back, they will not  spare you.    The common people do not forget, but the common people are  afraid Your Majesty might forget. The snare never forgets the  heron; only the heron keeps forgetting there is a snare  somewhere.</p>

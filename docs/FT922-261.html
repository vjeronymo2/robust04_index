			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Thatcher sets stage for bitter confrontations: The former PM's latest European onslaught IF MR JOHN MAJOR had harboured hopes that Mrs Margaret Thatcher's elevation to the House of Lords would signal a period of silence, they were comprehensively shattered by her onslaught yesterday against virtually all things European. The startling passion with which Mrs Thatcher denounced Maastricht - on her entry into the Lords tomorrow she will become Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven  -set the stage for a series of bitter confrontations over the next few months. As worrying for the government was that, as standardbearer of the Tory rebellion over Maastricht, she signalled she felt she would feel free to attack her successor over a broad range of issues. Cabinet ministers were horrified by the content and tone of her remarks. The former prime minister should be reminded, they suggested, that she had campaigned in the general election on a manifesto that hailed Maastricht as a triumph. But after a period of erratic loyalty during the approach to the election, her friends say Mrs Thatcher sees no reason to keep quiet now about issues of 'principle'. Her warning that Britain could not expect economic recovery until it decoupled its borrowing costs from high German rates echoed a series of attacks by rebel Tories on sterling's participation in the exchange rate mechanism. Mrs Thatcher - who was persuaded by Mr Major two months before her resignation to take sterling into the system - was careful not to advocate withdrawal from the ERM. But she backed calls for immediate cuts in interest rates to get the economy moving, if necessary at the expense of devaluing sterling against the D-Mark. A policy of high interest rates that was right for Germany, she said, was causing growing unemployment in Britain. 'You will not get economic recovery in this country while this interest rate stays as high.' There was also a warning shot over public spending, as Mrs Thatcher reminded Mr Major that while she was prime minister the government presided over large surpluses. Her successor had to be 'very careful', as sound finance was the basis for commanding respect abroad. But it was on the future of Europe that Mrs Thatcher was at her most scathing. For her, Maastricht is irredeemable. Even with its opt-outs for Britain on monetary union and the social charter, it would strike at the heart of parliamentary democracy. It would create a European union that had its own citizenship, currency and foreign and defence policies. 'It is the structure of a federal state,' she said. Mrs Thatcher dismissed as 'gobbledegook' the principle of 'subsidiarity' which Mr Major has put at the centre of his approach to European integration. She attacked his decision to back the extension of Mr Jacques Delors' term as European Commission president. She applauded the Danish vote against Maastricht. She argued that it had 'saved parliamentary democracy in this country'. If Mr Major pressed ahead with ratification of the treaties, she warned, she would vote against him. Even if Mr Major's leadership was threatened by such a rebellion, although Mrs Thatcher did not believe there would be such a challenge. She told Tory opponents of Maastricht to 'vote on what you believe'. Mr Major's colleagues believe that in the end such attacks will be counter-productive. The Conservative party in the country had worshipped Mrs Thatcher, but it would not back disloyalty. Though guaranteed publicity this week, her attacks would be a 'devaluing currency'. Ministers also believe that if the legislation to ratify Maastricht is framed as a confidence issue, then only a small hard core of Tory 'irreconcilables' will vote against it. Until then, they acknow-ledge that Mrs Thatcher is likely to provide a focus for a damaging and distracting rebellion.</p>

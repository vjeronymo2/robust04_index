			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Neighbours travel in opposite directions TURKEY's seemingly inexorable rise ran out of steam last month, while its neighbour, Greece, moved in the opposite direction. Data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank, shows that the Turkish equity market fell by 11.6 per cent in dollar terms during July. 'There was no one big item of bad news that pushed the market down,' said Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London. 'But there was a series of uncertainties and the market had little to drive it.' Political uncertainties in the run up to the conferences of the government coalition partners in October and November began to take a toll, as did the departure of Mr Rusdu Saracoglu, the central bank governor. Indeed, the market seemed unmoved even by some very strong half-yearly results, including a 1,636 per cent rise in first half profits from Tofas, the car manufacturer. Greece, conversely, managed a 9.9 per cent rise in dollar terms, in spite of delays in the privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications company. Ms Maryam Mansoury of Lehman Brothers cites falling inflation, lower interest rates and good earnings growth as the spur, together with the stimulus of a seven-year, Dollars 20bn restructuring loan from the EC. She believes that the outcome of a parliamentary vote tomorrow on the OTE sell-off will provide additional momentum, since the outcome will remove a major uncertainty.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC MONTHLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Dollar terms                      No. of         Jul 31      % Change      % Change Market               stocks           1993    over month    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              (11)         607.58          -0.7          +4.8 Brazil                 (44)         187.06          -1.9         +49.6 Chile                  (20)         410.93          -3.6          -1.8 Colombia*               (8)         407.99          +6.1          -4.0 Mexico                 (59)         672.13          +6.0          -0.6 Venezuela**             (8)         564.65          -3.9          +8.7 East Asia South Korea***        (130)          98.29          -4.1          +0.1 Philippines            (11)         163.21          +9.1         +22.2 Taiwan, China****      (76)          82.04          -4.0         +11.2 South Asia India*****             (61)          79.72          +6.9         -14.9 Indonesia******        (31)          79.57          -1.7         +35.6 Malaysia               (61)         213.27          +7.2         +30.4 Pakistan*******         (8)         228.92          +3.6         +14.4 Thailand               (52)         257.42          +6.7         +11.7 Euro/Mid East Greece                 (17)         227.24          +9.9         +16.4 Jordan                  (5)         163.62          +0.7         +39.0 Portugal               (16)          89.26         -0.42         +15.5 Turkey********         (31)         129.53         -11.6         +89.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Local currency terms                      No. of          Jul 31     % Change      % Change Market               stocks           1993    over month    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina              (11)     372,825.66          -0.7          +5.1 Brazil                 (44)  18,136,130.19         +28.4        +769.7 Chile                  (20)         665.49          -0.2          +3.8 Colombia*               (8)         578.38          +7.9          -5.4 Mexico                 (59)         903.93          +6.0          -0.5 Venezuela**             (8)       1,177.59          -2.7         +26.1 East Asia South Korea***        (130)         104.20          -3.4          +2.4 Philippines            (11)         216.04         +11.7         +33.6 Taiwan, China****      (76)          82.14          -2.0         +17.8 South Asia India*****             (61)          88.16          +6.9          -7.7 Indonesia******        (31)          90.32          -1.7         +37.3 Malaysia               (61)         201.88          +7.0         +27.9 Pakistan*******         (8)         308.76         +13.8         +33.2 Thailand               (52)         258.60          +7.0         +10.9 Euro/Mid East Greece                 (17)         365.84         +12.2         +28.5 Jordan                  (5)         232.79          +0.7         +40.4 Portugal               (16)         110.26         +10.2         +41.2 Turkey********         (31)         688.80          -7.0        +150.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at month end.

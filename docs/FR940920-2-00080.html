			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The significance of the proposed activities in relation to the objectives stated in Injury Control in the 1990s: A National Plan for Action. Atlanta: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993 and Healthy People 2000;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. National needs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Overall distribution among:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;the three priority areas of violence-related injury research: youth suicide, firearm injuries, and interpersonal youth violence;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;the major disciplines of violence-related injury prevention: social and behavioral science, biomechanics, and epidemiology;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;populations addressed (e.g., adolescents, racial and ethnic minorities, the elderly, children, urban, rural);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Budgetary considerations (e.g., preference may be given to applicants who submit proposals requesting funding for research projects of one to two year's duration);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Additional consideration may be given to those applicants who provide evidence of an active training program or mentoring program for inexperienced minority injury researchers (``junior investigators'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Continued Funding: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuation awards made after FY 1995, but within the project period, will be made on the basis of the availability of funds and the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The accomplishments reflected in the progress report of the continuation application indicate that the applicant is meeting previously stated objectives or milestones contained in the project's annual workplan and satisfactory progress has been demonstrated through monitoring presentations or work-in-progress workshops;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The objectives for the new budget period are realistic, specific, and measurable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The methods described will clearly lead to achievement of these objectives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The evaluation plan will allow management to monitor whether the methods are effective; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable and consistent with the intended use of grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Supplementary Funding:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Competing Supplemental grant awards  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> may be made when funds are available, to support research work or activities  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not previously approved  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC). Applications should be clearly labelled to denote their status as requesting  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supplemental funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These applications will be reviewed by the IRGRC and the secondary review group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> A TRADITIONAL FRENCH KITCHEN AT MARINA BISTRO  </P> <P> "Let's get the scrambled eggs with caviar," said the tiny cookbook author who  writes the big huge books.  </P> <P> Touche. We were in the patio of the Marina Bistro, a gentle, dainty,  old-fashioned French restaurant -- its symbol is a violet orchid -- and the  tiny cookbook writer was out-ordering me something fierce.  </P> <P> Her "scrambled" eggs, for instance, were technically "blurred" (oeufs  brouilles), stirred continuously to get a fine-grained texture but cooked over  water so they stay creamy instead of drying out. In fact, these could have been  a shade creamier, but they were much better with caviar than the usual chopped  hard-cooked eggs, and a shrewder appetizer idea than anything I'd thought of.  </P> <P> I liked the idea of snails in red wine, but tiny person plumped for a special  of snails in puff pastry. They turned out to be -- of course -- plump snails,  among the tenderest I've ever had, in a simple but impressive sauce of cream  boiled down a little with garlic and sprinkled with chives. Touche again.  </P> <P> My best suggestion was zucchini soup, just because I happened to know the  Marina Bistro makes excellent vegetable soups with no cream, nothing but pureed  vegetable enriched with a bit of butter and a characteristic dose of black  pepper. This is a kitchen that likes its black pepper.  </P> <P> This is also a very traditional kitchen, with a chef who used to work in Paris  at Petrus and the Plaza Athenee. Very few of his dishes couldn't have been  found on any French menu 20 years ago. The only nearly trendy things are 10  years old: funny-colored peppercorns in one dish, raspberry vinegar in one  salad, and a bit of the mania for pureed and/or stuffed vegetables. Little  cylinders of zucchini filled with winter squash puree, for instance.  </P> <P> Other parties were having their own fun in the plants and latticework  environment of the dining patio, laughing and holding hands and that sort of  stuff, but at our table serious food discussion raged. The cookbook writer  surprisingly suggested that somebody have jambonnette de volaille au homard,  which is about the cheapest entree on the menu. This is simply a stuffed boned  chicken drumstick in a sauce of cream and reduced lobster broth, but it was  unusually good, the stuffing a light and refreshing hash of chopped leeks  instead of the usual ground meat.  </P> <P> I had a grilled prime rib, but it was simply bravado on my part to order meat.  Mostly, I know the fish entrees on this menu: say, a grilled tuna steak with  beurre rouge, which is a strong reduction of red wine plus butter and plenty of  black pepper. Fortunately, my prime rib was very good in its strong,  old-fashioned Cabernet sauce.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, when it came to her own order, the tiny cookbook writer picked  the bouillabaisse (available only on Fridays and Saturdays). She had just been  talking about how one of the differences between bouillabaisse and Italian  cioppino is that the former isn't supposed to include shellfish when the  bouillabaisse came, in a showy shell-shaped bowl . . . and it was mostly  shellfish. Furthermore, there was a bitter, iodine taste in the broth, possibly  the fault of some mussels that seemed past their prime.  </P> <P> Her luck was running out. The chocolate souffle -- not my suggestion -- was the  kind we expect in this country, slightly overdone and faintly rubbery so the  waiter can pour chocolate sauce and whipped cream into it, although this is  hard on its souffle quality. The tiny cookbook writer herself got stuck with a  creme brulee (which, as she pointed out, the French consider an English dish)  with a sugar crust that, as she also pointed out, was crystallized but not  quite caramelized.  </P> <P> I had started feeling an ignorant bystander, but I actually got the best of the  desserts: a cylindrical pralin tart with caramel frosting and a hidden charge  of chocolate in the bottom. There is a certain justice in this world; wisdom,  or even better, the appearance of wisdom, comes to anyone who waits long  enough.  </P> <P>  Marina Bistro, 3100 Washington Blvd., Marina del Rey; (213) 822-2020. Open for  dinner Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Parking lot in rear. All major credit  cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $48-$73.  </P> <P> </P></p>

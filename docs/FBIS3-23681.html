			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Payson, under the rubric "Cooperation": </F> "Russian Cosmonaut Aboard the `Shuttle': Sergey Krikalev Becomes  a Full-Fledged Member of the Crew"]    [Text] On Thursday, 3 February, the Russian cosmonaut  Sergey Krikalev is to be sent into space aboard the "space  shuttle" Discovery.    Our cosmonauts have not met with the Americans in orbit  since  the joint flight of Soyuz and Apollo in 1975. Although a joint  Shuttle-Salyut flight was planned after Soyuz-Apollo, the  agreement was cancelled because of a worsening of the political  climate, and the meeting of the cosmonauts and astronauts in  orbit was postponed indefinitely.    After the Soviet-American "handshake in orbit," cosmonauts  from the entire socialist camp went into space aboard the  Soyuzes. The American Shuttle crews included specialists not  only from Western Europe, but also from Mexico and Saudi Arabia.    Sergey Krikalev, however, will not be a "diplomatic  representative" of Russia in the intensely working crew. An  engineer from NPO Energiya, an acrobatic pilot, and an  experienced specialist in EVAs, Krikalev is departing on the  flight as a full-fledged crew member -- a flight program  specialist. The five astronauts and one cosmonaut are to place  into orbit a platform for growing ultrapure semiconductor  crystals and then bring it back aboard Discovery after  completion of the experiments.    Krikalev trained for a little more than a year in the  American Johnson Space Center, working with the Shuttle's remote  manipulator. Now, using the "mechanical arm," he is to get the  saucerlike platform from the cargo bay of the craft and bring it  back later. "It's similar to the manual control of the Soyuz,"  Krikalev said, speaking of the work with the manipulator. "They  say you `fly' the `arm' more than you control it." In the words  of cosmonaut-astronaut Krikalev, you can generally acquire the  skills for working with such manipulators by even, well, playing  computer games -- racing airplanes or a "digger" on the screen.  There it is -- the benefit of the "dandyization" of society!    In addition to the work with the "flying saucers," the crew  will work in the commercial laboratory Spacelab, which is set up  in the cargo bay. Spacelab is a fairly small additional  compartment that roughly doubles the usable space of the Shuttle  cabin. Of course, the weeklong flight with such an "add-on"  can't be compared with ever so longer flights on the orbital  station. So the flight of Krikalev and the flight of his backup,  Vladimir Titov, planned for February 1995 about the Shuttle, are  serving the role of prelude to the first stage of the  Russian-American cooperation in the creation of the joint  orbital station Alpha, as they're calling it for now. And in  1995, an American astronaut will go up to the Mir station for  three months.    Of course, the flight of Sergey Krikalev is no pioneering  achievement. The launch slated for tomorrow will be the 60th  launch of a Shuttle, and Krikalev himself has 464 days aboard  Mir. But the political importance of the work of this kind is  unquestionable. The Russians and the Americans are learning to  work together. The future orbital station couldn't be built  without it.</p>

He was referring to the demands  included in the 18 points submitted by the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP]. He added: "They are imposing things on us; we  accept, for the sake of unity."    This came in an exclusive interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  at  Shaykh al-Ahmar's home in Sanaa in which he said: "Our view is  that everything possible has been done but there should be  agreement on the constitutional amendments." He also said that  the "points are acceptable (in principle), go in stages, and  could be carried out by the government." He added: "Out of our  concern for unity we accept everything they impose, which is a  bitter pill to swallow."    Political sources in Aden have confirmed that Yemeni  Planning  and Development Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani has  resigned in protest against an order issued by Prime Minister  Eng. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas calling for discontinuation of  the Yemeni population and establishments census. Sources close  to al-Iryani said that he considered that decision to favor  partition and division.    Out of his concern for Yemeni unity, Shaykh al-Ahmar is  making efforts as speaker of the House of Representatives which  is the only unity institution still functioning regularly. He  stressed that he is by no means acting as YRG leader. He said:  "Responsibility has made it incumbent upon us to be passive and  not to say what we believe should be said."    In reply to a question about views expressed by political  observers to the effect that the YSP is exerting pressure "for a  stable state system but is working for a continuation of the  state of unrest and anticipation for as long as possible to get  as many concessions as possible," Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar  said: "Why should we preoccupy ourselves with analysis and  speculation? The situation is clear. That is the position of  the (YSP) Political Bureau and Central Committee."    Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar emphasized that the decision about  the state system and whether it should be a parliamentary or  presidential system "should be a part of the constitutional  amendments." He added: "We have our own views regarding the  local councils system which is in harmony with the current  Constitution, and regarding financial and administrative  decentralization."    On the divisive military movements within the state of  unity,  the speaker said: "There have been movements which nobody can  deny such as the transfer of some units from the eastern areas  to Shabwah, but there has been no confirmation of other things  and we hve not heard about them." He reaffirmed the importance  of preserving unity. He said: "Despite everything, we are  prepared to come to some understanding with them (the YSP) for  the sake of unity, which was a precious achievement, dear to us.  We are prepared to offer many times the sacrifices we have  already made for its sake."    Shaykh al-Ahmar denied that the YRG had "any part in causing  the crisis."    He stressed that "there are no differences within the  presidency of the House of Representatives. There can be no  doubt about that. We all work together" because "the House of  Representatives is the only unity body still functioning, albeit  with little output."    He said that "the Socialist deputies attend and we have had  no disagreement with them on any measures, because we have not  reached the point of decision on the measures which should be  taken and to which the House of Representatives is entitled."  He said that "the House of Representatives, like other state  institutions, has been affected by the crisis but we are still  holding together and there has been no dispute within the  House." [passage omitted]    It should be noted that the prime minister and the ministers  of defense, oil, transport, and housing, and the deputy prime  minister for manpower are all in Aden and do not discharge their  ministerial duties or take part in the cabinet meetings in  Sanaa. The cabinet holds regular meetings under the  chairmanship of Dr. Hasan Makki, member of the General Committee  (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress [GPC] and  first deputy prime minister.    In reply to a question about the absence of these ministers  and whether there is justification for withdrawing confidence  from the cabinet and forming a new cabinet, a YSP source said  that the reason they have stayed away from Sanaa was the  discovery of a plan for their assassination. He added that  senior state officials knew that. [passage omitted]</p>

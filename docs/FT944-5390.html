			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Heady brew for Scottish - The Week Ahead MONDAY/WEDNESDAY: Two brewers' results this week will exemplify the industry's trends and investors' intentions. Scottish &amp; Newcastle (Monday) has outperformed Bass (Wednesday) in both beer and stock markets. The main factors behind the rise in S&amp;N's interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 145m (Pounds 109m) are the acquisition of the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain and expansion of its Center Parcs holiday villages. Bass is expected to report a more modest rise in pre-tax profits for the year ended September to about Pounds 540m from Pounds 508m. MONDAY/TUESDAY WEDNESDAY/FRIDAY: The regional electricity companies' interim results season gets into full swing with the City expecting high dividend increases following the 21 per cent rise announced on Thursday by Seeboard. Midlands (Tuesday), Swalec (Wednesday) and Norweb (Friday) are all expected to raise payments to shareholders by at least 15 per cent, and possibly considerably more. Profit growth will also be healthy. Northern Ireland Electricity (Monday) is expected to raise dividends by about 15 per cent, while Scottish Hydro-Electric (Thursday) probably will be less generous, with a rise of 8 to 12 per cent expected. TUESDAY: Siebe, the international controls and engineering group, is expected to report interim profits of about Pounds 117m (Pounds 94.2m) and a dividend roughly 10 per cent ahead to just over 4p. The company's recovery in the US has been a key attraction for investors. TUESDAY: NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group, is expected to announce full-year profits for the year to September of around Pounds 110m before tax and exceptional items, compared with Pounds 95m. Attention will be focused firmly on news of an appointment of a new chief executive following the company's fall-out with Peter Sherlock in August. WEDNESDAY: Pre-tax profits at Carlton Communications, the television and TV services group, are expected to jump from Pounds 126.1m to between Pounds 169m and Pounds 180m for the year to the end of September. It is likely the company will come in at the top end of the range, boosted by the first profits from Central TV. THURSDAY: Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retailing, financial services and property group, is expected to announce an 8 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 213.2m to about Pounds 230m. Attention will again focus on the secretive group's Pounds 1.5bn cash pile, with last month's share buy-back by Boots having rekindled speculation that GUS might make a similar move. FRIDAY: Analysts expect profits at GEC for the half-year to September 30 to rise by Pounds 10m to Pounds 370m with the interim dividend up to 2.95p from 2.81p. The power systems division may have done well but the medical equipment business in the US has been struggling.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The government plans to draw  up a plan to double the real income of the Japanese people by  lowering prices through such means as drastically reviewing  public service charges, government officials said Tuesday [24  May].    The officials said Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told cabinet  ministers after a regular cabinet meeting, "from now on, we want  to make lowering prices an aim. For example, we will cut  (prices) by a certain percent, or something such as that."    "Just like a government project in the past to double the  people's income, this time we want to draw up a plan to double  real income," Hata was quoted as saying.    Cabinet ministers agreed to set up a project team to review  the method of public service rates, the officials said. The  group is expected to propose a plan on how to review the rates,  they said.    The move follows a chorus of calls from the ministers for  efforts to lower public service rates instead of simply freezing  their hikes, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said.    At the day's regular cabinet meeting, Hata spoke of the need  to boost the nation's real income while guiding consumer prices  down, Kumagai said.    Last week, the government announced a freeze until the end  of  the year on planned increases in public service charges,  including domestic telephones charges, public housing rent, taxi  fares and expressway tolls.    It is the first freeze on public charges since 1974, and the  first such sweeping freeze since 1964.</p>

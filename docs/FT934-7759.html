			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA prices moved higher in the afternoon. Cocoa, after only a slightly steadier morning, took off with a vengeance in late trading afternoon, the near March jumping Pounds 13 at one point to Pounds 1,027 a tonne, the highest second position's highest level since July, 1988. Dealers said the market was running into little or no producer selling, which was helping to accentuate the rise. But they thought strong resistance was likely before Pounds 1,050. An absence of producer selling was also cited as a factor in coffee's continued advance, which took the January position to Dollars 1,296 a tonne at the close, up Dollars 40. Base metal prices rallied from earlier lows during late trading at the London Metal Exchange. The three months delivery COPPER price rallied from Dollars 1,630 a tonne on speculative buying and short-covering, touching Dollars 1,640 before closing at Dollars 1,634, down Dollars 7 from Tuesday. The ALUMINIUM market found strong support on dips towards the Dollars 1,050-a-tonne level for three months metal, which bounced to close at Dollars 1,056.50, a tonne up Dollars 6.50 on the day.

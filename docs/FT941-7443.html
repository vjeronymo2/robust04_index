			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei subdued as Kuala Lumpur surges 3.3 per cent Activity remained subdued on the last trading day for February settlements, and share prices edged lower after hovering within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average lost 0.80 at 19,341.83 after a high of 19,466.95 and low of 19,323.93. Small-lot index-linked trading by dealers and institutional investors dominated activity after the yen strengthened to the Y104 level to the dollar, raising uncertainty over the course of the Japanese currency. Traders said fears of arbitrage unwinding also depressed sentiment. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 5.68 up at 1,577.85 and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.24 to 291.83. Volume totalled 270m shares, against 325m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 9.04 at 1,318.53. The yen closed at Y104.65, up Y1.30, as many market participants focused on Saturday's meeting of top finance officials of the group of seven leading industrial nations in Frankfurt. In spite of active selling of the yen by the Bank of Japan, the domestic currency rose on buying by US fund managers and bank dealers. Fanuc, a leading machine tool equipment maker, fell Y200 to Y4,090 following reports that Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, had downgraded its rating on the company, saying that the stock would underperform the Nikkei index. Retailers were firm on buying by individuals hoping for an earnings rebound due to the income tax cut next fiscal year. Mitsukoshi, the department store, jumped Y37 to Y882 and Jusco, the supermarket chain, advanced Y60 to Y2,340. Navix Line, a shipping company, was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y18 to Y363 on buying by overseas investors. Multimedia shares gained ground. Toshiba rose Y12 to Y738 and Fujitsu Y10 to Y1,020. Cable makers were also higher, with Furukawa Electric up Y9 to Y704. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y5,000 at Y939,000, while Victor, the consumer electronics maker, put on Y90 at Y1,130 on hopes of an earnings rise. Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y21 to Y873 on profit-taking by individual investors. Mining stocks had been higher last month on buying by short term traders, in tandem with firmer gold prices. In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 49.24 to 21,437.09 in quiet trading. Roundup Pacific Rim markets put in mostly positive performances. KUALA LUMPUR posted a 3.3 per cent rise on retail and foreign buying which continued to be focused on second line stocks, and particularly rumour-driven issues. The composite index added 36.60 at 1,141.05. Arab-Malaysian Development, rumoured to be a takeover target, forged ahead 18 cents, or 5.4 per cent, to MDollars 3.50 in volume of 32m shares. Mulpha International surged 70 cents, or 11.2 per cent, to MDollars 6.95 on continued talk of a port privatisation deal. SINGAPORE was supported by foreign institutional buying in response to what was viewed as a pro-business national budget released just before the market closed. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 23.55 to 2,423.91. Some institutional buying in properties was noted, with Singapore Land gaining 35 cents at SDollars 7.60. A cut in the commercial property tax rate is expected to boost some property stocks with commercial property exposure. HONG KONG finished well off the day's highs after some profits were taken. The Hang Seng index was finally 89.22 ahead at 10,763.23 after a peak for the session of 10,815. Among blue chips attracting interest after the recent bear run, Henderson Land advanced HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 49.25 and Cheung Kong appreciated 25 cents to HKDollars 45.25. AUSTRALIA climbed on the combination of US interest rate prospects and upcoming options expiry, the All Ordinaries index closing 16.4 up at 2,218.9 in ADollars 510m turnover. Among blue chips, BHP rose 16 cents to ADollars 18.36 and News Corp 6 cents to ADollars 10.22. CRA was 28 cents higher at ADollars 18.20. NEW ZEALAND took its lead from Wall Street's performance and the NZSE 40 Capital index moved ahead 47.60 to 2,265.24. Ceramco weakened 35 cents to NZDollars 6.50 on news that 1994 profits are likely to be less than earlier forecast. TAIWAN reversed early losses to close higher in a rebound from four straight days of falls. Institutional bargain hunting in a wide range of stocks helped the weighted index improve 35.28 to 5,769.19, although turnover remained thin at TDollars 43.14bn, against Tuesday's TDollars 41.53bn. KARACHI gained ground on heavy foreign buying, with energy, chemical and bank issues leading the rally. The KSE 100 index rose 47.53 to 2,455.11, and dealers said that funds were encouraged by a positive government policy on privatisation. BOMBAY fell but sellers withdrew, hoping that they could get improved prices in the two trading days left before Monday's national budget. The BSE index ended 56.11 lower at 4,028.78.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Secrets of marketing success How do small businesses market themselves successfully? Researchers in the north-east of England have been studying local fast-growth businesses to see what makes them different from less successful rivals. A study* of 30 companies - each about 10 years old and employing more than 100 people - revealed the following success factors: Marketing expertise was available from executive board members or non-executives. Marketing was regarded as fundamental to the business's operations. Less successful firms viewed it as 'best left to the marketing people'. Market and customer information was gathered rapidly but selectively, and drawn upon in taking decisions. Less successful firms gathered similar amounts of information but did not make use of it. Top management made itself available to customers. Some gave customers' office, car phone and home numbers. Quality of product or service and customer care were given high priority. British quality assurance standard BS 5750 had become the norm. A willingness to take on their customers' problems as their own. In some cases companies actively sought out problems facing their customers and devised solutions. A strong corporate identity and internal corporate culture. Overalls in the company colours bearing the corporate logo, letterheads and the colour of office furnishings all demonstrated a corporate unity and the 'feel' of success. Close partnership with suppliers and distributors. One company fitted phones in its distributor's lorries to keep customers informed about deliveries and delays. Key management travelled extensively to stay in touch with customers. They concentrated on developing markets and fulfilling market demand before developing new products. *Action Research into Market Development in the Independent Growth Firm.

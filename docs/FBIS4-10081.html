			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Commission on Public Morals was  established at La Moneda Palace today. President Eduardo Frei  decided to set up this commission to combat signs of corruption  in the country.    The issue of honesty in public office has been uppermost in  the head of state's mind since he came to power. The idea of  establishing the National Commission on Public Morals answers  this concern. This commission, which is to be made up of  leading figures from all political sectors, will have a 100-day  deadline for submitting its proposals.    [Begin Frei recording] We establish this national commission  today in order to streamline the legal mechanisms established to  ward off and suppress occurrences such as corruption and  trafficking of influence. The reason that prompted me to  establish this national commission was to underscore that  corruption and its attendant problems are things that concern  the whole country, as the efforts of a particular government are  not enough to prevent and overcome it. All the democratic  forces of our country should be united in this endeavor. Every  upright and efficient government official ought not to be  worried. Our final goal is to turn public service into a  dignified work environment where initiative, the spirit of work,  and the disinterested effort to achieve the common good are  rewarded. We are not seeking to create a paralyzing and  stifling control system. We are interested, rather, in clearly  distinguish illegitimate intentions from mere mistakes. We are  pursuing the betterment of the state so as to be able to give  citizens aboveboard and competent service rather than the  construction of an efficient and bureaucratic state.

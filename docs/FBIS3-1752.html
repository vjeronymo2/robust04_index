Having 1,000 enterprises appraise the work of the government  departments at the provincial level, was organized by the  provincial industrial and economic federation and the provincial  entrepreneurs' association, and was launched according to the  decision of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government. This is a major move adopted by the provincial  party committee and the provincial government to implement the  guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to further promote  transformation of the functions of government departments, to  expedite the implementation of the "enterprise law" and the  "regulation on changing the operational mechanism of state-owned  enterprises," and to help establish the socialist market  economic structure. It is the first time that the province has  launched such a provincewide activity of "appraising higher  levels by lower levels." When viewed in terms of practical  results, this activity is not only completely necessary but also  successful.    Whether our government departments will successfully  transform their functions and style of work depends chiefly on  the opinions of enterprises and the reflections of the  grass-roots levels. "A house may have a leak in its ceiling,  but it is discovered below." The method of organizing  enterprises to appraise the work of government departments  constitutes a direct and effective supervision of government  departments as well as a positive attempt to promote the  transform of the superstructure with the voice from the economic  base. We should successfully summarize the experiences gained  from this activity, carry them forward, and establish systems to  ensure that our government departments will be able to listen  to, in a timely manner, all the opinions of the grass-roots  units and the voice of enterprises and then will, in line with  the demand on government functions under the condition of the  market economy, continuously improve their work and better meet  the requirements of new circumstances and new tasks. Here, I  mainly dwell on three views and opinions:    1. Our government departments at the provincial level have  made progress in implementing the "enterprise law" and the  "regulations," but there are still many problems.    The current appraisal of the work of the provincial-level  government departments by 1,000 enterprises is, in fact, an  inspection over the situation in which the provincial-level  government departments have transformed their functions and work  style. When viewed from the results of the appraisal, what  should be affirmed first is that these departments have scored  great achievements in implementing the "enterprise law" and the  "regulations" and in transforming their functions and style of  work. In order to truly enable enterprises to transform  mechanisms, to enter the market, and to become the mainstay of  the market economy as demanded by the "enterprise law" and the  "regulations," many government departments have positively  assigned to enterprises the affairs that should be managed by  enterprises and have delegated to enterprises the powers that  should be enjoyed by enterprises. For the affairs that should  be managed by the government, but were managed in a poor and  ineffective manner in the past, government departments are now  adopting measures to gradually strengthen management. To  expedite the enterprise reform, and, in particular, to help  invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, some  government departments have voluntarily gone deep into  enterprises to specifically guide and help enterprises deepen  their internal reform, seek projects and funds, and solve  problems. Some departments that were originally engaged in  planned economic work have rapidly transformed themselves into  the departments that provide enterprises with the service of  information, consultation, technology, development, and  marketing, thus creating conditions for enterprises to rapidly  transform mechanisms and dovetail themselves with the market.  All these cases have proven that the overwhelming majority of  our government departments at the provincial level have  conformed to the historical trend of reform and have actively  keep abreast of the demands of the new situation. In the  current appraisal, many enterprises have expressed satisfaction  with and highly appraised the work of such comprehensive  economic departments as the provincial planning commission, the  provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission, and  the provincial economic restructuring commission. This is  really gratifying.    However, the enterprises participating in the current  appraisal activity have also generated much criticism and  complaints, and some problems revealed by them are very serious.  In light of these complaints and problems, what I want to  stress on is why enterprises still have so many complaints and  why so many problems remain with our provincial-level government  departments after the promulgation of the "enterprise law" five  years ago and after the issuance of the "regulations" a year or  so ago. This merits our conscientious research and ponderation.  Of course, it takes time to change government functions, and it  also takes time to tackle various sorts of contradictions and  problems. We do not expect the government to tackle all sorts  of contradictions and problems all at once. The problem at  present, however, is that many problems that could be tackled  completely have not yet been tackled and many affairs that could  be completely handled have not yet been handled. This has  affected the reform and development of enterprises so that  enterprises can not help but complain about the government.  Then, what is the reason for this situation? From an objective  analysis, when delegating decision-making powers to some  enterprises, we need a process of coordination, and such kind of  coordination should be gradually realized through in-depth  reform. From a subjective analysis, there are three reasons:  First, some comrades have failed to conscientiously study  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the decision of establishing a  socialist market economic structure, the "enterprise law," and  the "regulations." Some comrades have lacked an understanding of  new structures and have not been fully prepared ideologically  and professionally to orient the work of government departments  to the new demands of reform. Second, some comrades have failed  to conscientiously implement the idea that "reform is a new  revolution," are still accustomed to the past work style of  "grabbing power and centralizing power" that was available under  the planned economic structure, are still accustomed to  considering enterprises the subsidiary body of government  departments, and are reluctant to give up the powers in their  hands and their vested interests. Third, some government  departments have paid attention to professional work but not to  the ranks of working personnel, and, as a result, the management  is in chaos and many problems have emerged in the ranks of  working personnel. Some working personnel are still riding  roughshod, extorting money from the people, and using their  power to seek personal gain.    Facing these problems, all government departments should pay  high attention to the criticisms and complaints raised in the  current appraisal activity. Although some criticisms and  complaints are not completely correct, generally speaking, they  are objective, fair, and pertinent. Although some problems have  emerged at the grass-roots level, their roots are in the higher  levels. Although local governments should assume some  responsibilities for problems, the provincial responsible  departments also should not shirk their responsibilities onto  others. Therefore, all departments should, without exception,  pay attention to and do research for the complaints raised in  the appraisal and examine and ponder over them one by one. On  no account should they remain indifferent towards these  complaints. Second, we should adopt measures to firmly grasp  rectification and correction. All departments and units should  make clear the situations and the reasons for the related  problems raised in the appraisal. On this basis, we should  formulate feasible measures for solving problems in the right  order of importance and urgency in order to straighten them out  and correct them. As for the problems that are enterprises  complain strongly about,and that should be and can be solved,  responsibilities should be assigned to departments concerned to  solve them as quickly as possible and yield results in the near  future. For the problems that are not raised in the appraisal  but actually exist in practical work, voluntary inspection  should also be conducted to correct them. Third, we should use  rectification and correction to expedite transformation. The  current appraisal activity will greatly promote the  transformation of functions of all government departments. All  departments and units should regard the appraisal as a very good  opportunity to transform their functions, should draw inferences  about other cases from the problems revealed in the appraisal,  should summarize experiences and draw a lesson from these  problems, and should strive to take a big step forward in the  work of transforming functions.    2. The establishment of a socialist market economic  structure urgently requires the transformation of government  functions, and that it should be firmly grasped from beginning  to end.    The "decision on some issues of the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure," adopted by the third  plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, has sketched  the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure.  The five major pillars of this framework--the modern enterprise  system, the nationwide integrated market structure, the perfect  macro-economic control system, the rational individual income  distribution system, and the multi-layered social security  system--are all closely related to the transformation of  government functions. If the government refuses to transform  its functions, a modern enterprise system cannot be established,  a nationwide integrated market structure and a perfect  macro-economic control system cannot be formed, a rational  income distribution system and social security system cannot be  set up in a very good manner, and then we are in no position to  establish the socialist market economic structure. Therefore,  transforming government functions is not only an important  content of the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure but also a supporting reform that must be carried out  to ensure the success in the package reform. All departments of  the government should attach high importance to the  transformation of functions and truly handle this issue well in  carrying out organizational reform.    A major issue of the transformation of government functions  is to make clear what should be managed and what should not be  managed under the new situation of the socialist market economy  and to correctly handle the relationship between the two. The  practice in the past several years proves that if government  departments fail to delegate to enterprises the powers that  originally belong to the government in carrying out the planned  economy and that should be delegated to enterprises now, the  reform cannot be carried on; and if government functions fail to  manage the affairs that they should manage in many fields of the  development of the market economy, a confused situation will  emerge and losses will be incurred. Therefore, our government  departments must make clear what affairs that were managed in  the past should, or should no longer be managed under the new  structure, and provide ways to successfully manage these  affairs. Departments should conduct conscientious investigation  and study as well as discussion and analysis by proceeding from  helping to invigorate enterprises and facilitating the sound and  orderly development of the market economy, and then define the  targets of the transformation of functions, the work  orientation, and the work priorities for respective departments.    This year, the province will carry out organizational reform  step by step and spread the reform of the public service system  in line with the unified arrangements of the central  authorities. This reform will be carried out from higher levels  to lower levels, beginning with the provincial-level  organizations. All administrative organizations at the  provincial level, particularly comprehensive economic  organizations, specialized economic organizations, and the  organizations supervising the enforcement of economic laws,  should make good preparations for successfully fixing the scale,  functions, and staff of their organizations in accordance with  the "decision" adopted by the third plenary session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee and with the demands for carrying out the  organizational reform of administrative organizations and for  implementing the reform of the public service system.    3. We should continue to firmly and thoroughly stop wanton  collections of fees, fines, and apportionments, as the major  content of the anticorruption campaign. When viewed from the  current appraisal, the province as a whole has made progress and  yielded results in stopping the "three wanton collections," but  these results cannot be overestimated. A host of facts show  that the "three wanton collections" still seriously remain in  many places, and they have not only seriously disturbed the  normal operational sequence of enterprises and hampered reform,  opening up, and economic development, but also seriously damaged  the image of the party and the government. Therefore, the  elimination of "three wanton collections" must be conducted  through to the end by regarding it as an important content of  the transformation of government functions and the  anticorruption campaign.    To make the work in this aspect a success, I want to stress  on the following points:    First, all departments directly under the provincial  authorities must assume responsibility for stopping the "three  wanton collections" within their own departments. All  departments should not only manage their professional work but  also manage their ranks of working personnel. And, they should  not only eliminate the "three wanton collections" directly  occurred in their own departments but also eliminate the "three  wanton collections" occurred in other departments and trades in  the province as well as at the grass-roots areas. All  departments should pay attention to education, training,  rectification, and correction to constantly improve the quality  of their ranks of working personnel and enhance their expertise  of enforcing laws and disciplines. From now on, if the masses  at the grass-roots level complain strongly about a department or  a trade for its serious wanton collections, the responsible  government departments of the provincial level will be held  accountable. Second, the inspection of and punishment to the  "three wanton collections" should be strengthened in a sustained  manner. All departments at all levels should inspect and ferret  out the "three wanton collections" in a timely manner. Once a  case is discovered, it should be inspected and dealt with  immediately. Those which should be returned should be returned,  those deserving punishment should be punished, and those  deserving disciplinary actions should be given them. The  serious cases should be laid bare and dealt with publicly. The  responsible persons of enterprises who dare to resist the "three  wanton collections" should be encouraged and supported  continuously. Third, all measures and stipulations aiming at  checking the "three wanton collections" should be assigned to  the grass-roots areas. The fees and apportionments that are  abolished by the provincial-level government departments and the  measures and methods related to this work have already been made  public in newspapers. But, it is only the first step. They  must be made known to all grass-roots areas and to all related  personnel. All departments and units should take advantage of  the opportunity provided by the current appraisal to inspect, in  the near future, whether the "three wanton collections" are  eliminated among grass- roots areas. Once a problem is  discovered, it should be tackled immediately in order to  strictly prevent and correct the cases of "sticking to one's old  way of doing things," "rectifying in the beginning but being  confused at the end," and "remaining confused despite repeated  rectifications." Fourth, we should continue to carry out the  system of "making work procedures and results public so that  they are subject to supervision by the masses." All the  stipulated reasonable fees and fines should be made public and  be subject to supervision by the masses. All departments at all  levels should pay attention to the petitions of the masses that  reflect the "three wanton collections," and conscientiously  examine and deal with them. On the whole, the tasks on  eliminating the "three wanton collections" remain very arduous,  and the endeavor of eliminating the "three wanton collections"  should still be regarded as the emphasis of the anticorruption  campaign this year in order to thoroughly tackle problems  related to wanton collections. All departments at all levels,  particularly law and discipline enforcing departments such as  public security, communications, postal and communications,  power, industrial and commercial, tax, and public health  departments, must strive to make contributions to eliminating  the "three wanton collections" in the province and to optimizing  the economic environment.    The current appraisal of the work of provincial-level  government departments by 1,000 enterprises has been conducted  in a successful way. It has been proven that in the new  historical period and the new situation, such social groups as  the industrial and economic federations and associations of  various trades have much to do and accomplish in conducting  activities around the central task of economic construction.  Such social groups that lie between the government and  enterprises, serve as a new type of bridge to link the  government with enterprises, and thus play the role as the mass  groups of enterprises. Therefore, party committees and  governments at all levels should attach full importance and give  warm support to such newly born groups and pay attention to  studying and exploiting their positive role in expediting reform  and development. Industrial and economic federations and the  associations of various trades should enhance their senses of  historical responsibility and mission, make great efforts to  make innovations and explorations, continue to summarize  experiences, and strive to invigorate the work in all fields.</p>

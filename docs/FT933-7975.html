			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Eni sees improvement after 'difficult year' ENI, the Italian state energy and chemicals company due to be partly privatised, is likely to report a group loss this year after losing L815bn (Dollars 529m) in 1992. However, in a letter accompanying its 1992 accounts, Mr Luigi Meanti, chairman, suggests it may return to the black in 1994, partly because of privatisation receipts. Results for the first quarter suggest 1993 will be 'another difficult year,' according the letter. Margins in the energy business have been eroded by the weak oil price, while chemicals are still overshadowed by the recession. Problems at the EniChem chemicals subsidiary, which lost L1,560bn in 1992, were largely responsible for last year's Eni group losses, which compared with net profits of L1,081bn in 1991. Poor performance in chemicals wiped out earnings at Eni's profitable Agip and Snam oil and gas subsidiaries. Mr Meanti said other parts of Eni's activities were likely to do better this year, with higher earnings in engineering and services and some improvement in the lossmaking metals and mining division. This year's results will also be overshadowed by heavy restructuring costs linked to the group's concentration on its core businesses, and sales of non-strategic operations. The group has already announced a string of asset sales, the biggest of which is the Nuovo Pignone turbines and compressors subsidiary. Other disposals, mainly of relatively small business units, are expected to raise about L2,700bn for EniChem by the end of 1994 and about L1,000bn for the Agip Petrol subsidiary. Eni, which has been severely implicated in Italy's political corruption scandal, is also trying to ascertain the size of kickbacks and other off-balance sheet payments. Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's biggest banks, said Mr Vincenzo Palladino, its deputy chairman, had resigned. Mr Palladino, a prominent Milan lawyer, was arrested last month in connection with allegations of corruption regarding the former Enimont chemicals joint venture between Eni and the private-sector Montedison group.</p>

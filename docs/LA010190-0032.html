			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMENTALIST AFGHAN REBELS REPORTED HANGED  </P> <P> Several fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla leaders were hanged at a public  gathering inside Afghanistan for murdering about 30 moderate moujahedeen rebels  last summer, a spokesman for the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group said Sunday.  </P> <P> Fundamentalist Hizb-i-Islami commander Syed Jamal Agha was hanged along with  several other of the group's commanders in Taloqan on Dec. 23, Jamaat-i-Islami  spokesman Umar Sherdil said, confirming reports published Sunday in local  newspapers.  </P> <P> Sherdil told journalists that Agha and a "few" other Hizb-i-Islami commanders  were publicly hanged in the city's main park in the presence of 43 leading  elders from northern Afghanistan. He said that a large number of people  witnessed the execution.  </P> <P> The executions are the latest in a series of assassinations among moujahedeen  guerrillas and politicians in Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan as  Muslim fundamentalists struggle with moderates for control over the 5 million  Afghan refugees and the rebel movement.  </P> <P> A Jamaat-i-Islami member who claimed to have witnessed the executions said Agha  was questioned in the park and accused by many people present of having killed  their relatives and friends.  </P> <P> The commander reportedly told them that he had killed hundreds of people in the  fighting against Soviet and Soviet-backed Afghanistan government forces and  couldn't identify them.  </P> <P> He was also reported to have confessed his role in the murders of about 30  Jamaat-i-Islami commanders and moujahedeen in an ambush last summer.  </P> <P> Hizb-i-Islami is a hard-line fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla group seeking to  create an Islamic state in Kabul. Jamaat-i-Islami, while also strongly Islamic,  is more moderate.  </P> <P> Hizb-i-Islami has been particularly envious of the charismatic and successful  Jamaat-i-Islami commander, Ahmed Shah Masoud, who was reportedly the target of  the massacre.  </P></p>

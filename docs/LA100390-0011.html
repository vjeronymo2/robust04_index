			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON GERMAN UNIFICATION;  </P> <P> THE LESSONS OF EVIL ARE NOT FORGOTTEN;  </P> <P> CAN GERMANY BE TRUSTED? A GENERATION THAT HAS WITNESSED CATASTROPHIC RESULTS OF  WAR WILL NOT JEOPARDIZE DEMOCRACY.  </P> <P> Today the German Democratic Republic will formally merge into the Federal  Republic of Germany. The population of the Federal Republic will jump from 62  million to 79 million and the territory will grow by more than 44%. Given the  size of this new, united Germany and our terrible history, it is not surprising  that many people have mixed feelings about this reunification. Can the Germans  be trusted not to repeat the past? Is democracy rooted deeply enough to prevent  return to a totalitarian regime? Will the Germans fall back into excessive  nationalism and try to dominate Europe? I don't believe so. The experiences of  my generation of Germans -- those of us born during and immediately following  World War II -- offer reassurance.  </P> <P> My first lesson in the evils of a totalitarian state began early in life. I was  born in Trautenau in the Czechoslovakian Sudetenland on May 7, 1944. On that  day, my father, a member of Hitler's Reichswehr, was steering an army truck a  thousand miles to the east in the Ukraine. Father and son did not see each  other for 12 years; within months of my birth my father was taken prisoner by  the Soviets, sentenced to 25 years in a labor camp and sent to Vorkuta in the  northern Ural Mountains.  </P> <P> As the war ended, my mother, my three sisters and I -- then a year old --  became part of the long westward trek of 12 million German refugees from the  eastern provinces. With only the clothes on our backs, we were sent to  Weissandt in newly created East Germany, a region now infamous for decades of  environmental neglect.  </P> <P> We lived in one room of a farmhouse, refugees in an impoverished land. Walter  Ulbricht's East German government classified prisoners of war held by "our  Soviet friends" as criminals, rendering families such as mine ineligible for  financial support, public housing or access to higher education.  </P> <P> As a result of Konrad Adenauer's efforts, all German prisoners were to be  released from the Soviet Union in late 1955. Leaving my sisters behind in East  Germany, my mother and I hurried to the expected reunion with my father in  Herleshausen, West Germany. We stayed several weeks, watching each transport  arrive and unload. But my father was not among the men released. Six months  later, we learned that those classified as war criminals had been sent to  Bautzen, in East Germany. After another month, in May, 1956, my father finally  joined my mother and me in the West; several months later, the East German  authorities allowed my sisters to join us.  </P> <P> Millions of other German families endured similarly long separations, loss and  grinding poverty after the defeat of Hitler. I do not compare our sufferings  with the millions of victims of the Third Reich. But I know that my generation  of Germans has personal knowledge of the horrible consequences of an aggressive  war and of totalitarian regimes. I want to ensure that my daughter will never  repeat my experiences.  </P> <P> If my childhood education in the evils of aggressive nationalism is not unique,  my career as a political scientist in the field of international relations has  given me an unusual opportunity to observe the political lessons our democratic  government has learned over the past 40 years.  </P> <P> Like my career, my country's fate is also linked to the European Community, an  institution that has proved that excessive nationalism can be held in check by  regional integration and self-restraint. Germany is an integral part of this  community of states; we have not tolerated territorial expansion by force or  coercion. We know that the Wirtschaftswunder was no wonder but hard work in a  democratic environment guaranteed by a strong Western alliance. We remember  well that only six short years passed from Munich in 1938 to a world in  shambles in 1944, when I was born.  </P> <P> Mine is the generation, born in the 1940s and 1950s, that will run a united  Germany well into the next century. Precisely because we have witnessed the  catastrophic results of aggressive war and subsequent authoritarian regimes, we  will not jeopardize the advantages of our democracy.  </P> <P> Our task will not be an easy one; unification will test our new stability in  many ways. Can we develop a society open to immigration? Can we lead the  process of European economic unification without dominating it? Can we shoulder  global security responsibilities without sliding into power politics? Can we do  these things while absorbing 17 million new citizens and a host of new  environmental, social and economic problems?  </P> <P> In the last 40 years. German democracy has survived many tests: the massive  immigration from the East in the late 1940s, rearmament in the 1950s, the  emergency laws in the 1960s, terrorism in the late 1970s, severe economic  recession in the early 1980s. It is now my generation's turn to accept a new  set of challenges. We face them well-schooled in the advantages of democracy.  We embrace them, not as a means of building a more powerful Germany, but as a  way to play a constructive, peaceful role in a new and more dynamic Europe. We  deserve the benefit of the doubt.  </P></p>

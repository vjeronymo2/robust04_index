			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Storehouse There were grounds for mild optimism in Storehouse's annual results. The return to profit was mainly thanks to a second-half bounce in the BhS chain which Mr David Dworkin has done much to improve. Now promoted to chief executive, he should be able to work the same trick at Mothercare, but the benefits will take time to accrue. Habitat, which lost Pounds 9m last year, remains an uglier proposition. Its US operation looks a prime candidate for closure. That could leave the way open for a sale of the remaining French and UK assets to management which would effect an immediate Pounds 10m boost to profits. Whatever happens, the market has been too enthusiastic about the group's shares. After outperforming the sector by nearly 30 per cent this year, they are on the same forward rating as those of Marks and Spencer. Yet Storehouse made a mere Pounds 10m of trading profit on Pounds 1.2bn of turnover; five years ago, profit was Pounds 130m on similar turnover. At present rates of progress, the dividend will be barely covered this year. Storehouse still has much to prove.</p>

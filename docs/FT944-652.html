			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Scalfaro gains support in fight to avoid early polls Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro received an important boost yesterday for his plan to avoid early elections in the wake of the resignation of the Berlusconi government. Support for prolonging the parliament came from Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and head of a large faction within the Northern League, a former coalition partner. His faction had been reluctant to break with the outgoing rightwing coalition headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who wants the president to call early elections. Mr Scalfaro, who can either find a new government or dissolve parliament, made clear that he viewed a snap election as disastrous for Italy. The president believes elections can be held only when electoral laws have been improved and clear guidelines and controls are established for the media, as three commercial television channels are controlled by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest business empire. Mr Berlusconi said 'a very important company of the group' could be sold in coming days. 'Elections are inevitable,' he insisted. Mr Maroni opposed the decision by Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League leader, to bring down the Berlusconi government by putting forward a no-confidence motion. In the past week, he has been co-ordinating some 40 'dissidents' among the movement's 105 deputies. That split within the League appeared to strengthen the hand of Mr Berlusconi and his allies, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, which has insisted there is no alternative to early elections. However, Mr Maroni's position now means that almost 60 per cent of the deputies in parliament oppose early elections. He is also against Mr Berlusconi being allowed to form a second government, and wants him to resolve the conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest. Mr Maroni stated publicly for the first time the motives behind Mr Berlusconi's strategy of early elections: 'He (Berlusconi) wants to capitalise on (public sympathy) immediately because he won't be able to sustain this wave of sympathy for more than two months.' In beginning a series of formal political contacts yesterday, the president started with former presidents Giovanni Leone and Francesco Cossiga. The main discussions will not be until next Wednesday.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant General Dmitriy Kharchenko in the </F> column "On the Eve of the Event": "What to Expect from the  Brussels Meeting"]    [Text] Opening on the 10th of January in Brussels, the  capital of Belgium, is a NATO Council summit of heads of states  and governments of countries that are members of this military  and political organization. It is expected that the focus of  attention will be on two major issues: How to resolve problems  of international peace, and what to do about a request made by a  number of Central and Eastern European states for inclusion into  the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. In essence, the discussions  will boil down to the future of this Alliance in the  contemporary world.    On this eve of the NATO summit meeting, it would be  advantageous to examine the question of the relationship  existing between Russia and NATO. However, before we attempt to  find an answer to this question, it seems to me that certain  remarks are in order.    A truly paradoxical situation has come about. Virtually  everyone in the West is of the opinion that the NATO Alliance  has emerged from the Cold War as the victor. At the same time,  in no time in the past has the Alliance faced problems that are  so pressing and difficult of resolution as it does now. It is  also said that NATO is undergoing its own crisis.    This statement of the bloc's crisis situation is all the  more  surprising, since it came directly on the heels of the explosion  of euphoria which in the West was accompanied by the fall of the  Berlin Wall, self-dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization,  and disintegration of the Soviet Union. Leaders of states and  governments of Alliance countries in a London meeting held in  the summer of 1990 were triumphant in their welcoming the  changes occurring in Europe, even calling them historical. Then  suddenly the crisis. What went wrong?    The fact is that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in  the form which it was at the end of the 1940's, has virtually  ceased to exist. The "threat from the East" has disappeared. So  has the enemy. The point here is that they were essential to the  bloc's organizers not only to set a course of "containment and  repulsion" of communism, but more importantly to consolidate the  leading role played by the USA in the post-war world. Serving as  an instrument of Washington's politics and pulling into this  political channel other Western countries was for many years the  major function of the bloc.    And something else. NATO, after having rid itself of real or  imaginary fears concerning a "massed assault from the East,"  came to face new and this time real dangers. These were the  unstable situation in Russia (let us recall how much someone in  the West suffered over the parliamentary election results in our  country) and in other states which sprang up on the territory of  the former USSR; the possibility of uncontrolled proliferation  of weapons of mass destruction; and, finally, the inter-ethnic  and ethnic conflicts occurring on the periphery of the bloc that  turned into fierce armed conflicts, such as those in Yugoslavia,  Moldova, and the Caucasus. How to react to all these dangers?  What could and should NATO do under these conditions?    The above questions should be answered at the NATO summit.    All of the above bears a direct relationship to Russia. All  the more since this raises full-force the question of expansion  of NATO's limits by virtue of including a number of Eastern  European countries into the organization. One cannot fail to  respect the sovereign right of every state of selecting those  forms and means of insuring the security it deems most suitable.  However, NATO's leading circles are aware of Moscow's negative  attitude toward possible forced expansion of the Alliance. This  could lead to new problems rather than to the resolution of  existing ones. For example, this could disrupt the legally  formalized system existing on our continent, primarily the  Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Instead of  strengthening of trust and stability, this would sow new seeds  of distrust, which undoubtedly would lead to destabilization of  the entire situation.    Expansion of NATO's zone of responsibility would directly  impinge upon the interests of Russia in the geopolitical,  military, and home policy areas. Expansion of the Alliance of  the world's largest military bloc would push out its boundaries,  which would then be located close to the Russian borders. This  would necessitate a fundamental rethinking of all our defensive  concepts, restructuring of the Armed Forces, reviewing of the  operational configuration of the theater of military operations,  developing an additional infrastructure, relocation of large  military contingents, and changing of operational plans and the  nature of combat training.    One can easily imagine that the expansion of NATO's circle  of  members would be perceived by both the leadership and public of  Russia as attempts to set up isolation, creating a "sanitary  cordon" at our western borders. One would not be out of line if  he were to point out that that could lead to xenophobia in our  society and an intensification of the influence of radical-right  nationalistic parties and organizations.    Incidentally, the above opinion is not solely that of  Russians. It is no accident that the influential German  newspaper WELT recently wrote that the driving force behind all  of NATO's attempts to expand eastward is an intent of erecting  another "Iron Curtain" that would constitute a barrier against  an unstable neighbor: Russia.    NATO's leading circles do understand the nuances of this  situation. It appears that the latter are in no hurry to accept  new members, in spite of insistent requests made by Poland,  Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and a  number of other Eastern European countries. As an alternative,  the US President has presented an idea that has come to be known  as the "Partnership for Peace." It seems to me that Russia could  support this idea, to the extent that it incorporates the  security interests of all states without exception. Of course,  this partnership should be based on the drafting of universal  standards of security applicable to the entire North Atlantic  area. A genuine partnership would include priority development  of political dialogue, constant consultations, agreement on  positions, and, in the future, coordinated actions.    Ministers of foreign affairs and defense of NATO countries  in  their sessions held in the beginning of December affirmed their  support of the "Partnership for Peace" plan advanced by  Washington. However, the nature of the plan and the methods of  its implementation are not yet clear. These problems will  obviously be objects of close examination at the forthcoming  session of the NATO Council, and it would be very desirable if  the participants would take into consideration the Russian point  of view relative to the given problem. Of course, the decisions  made in Brussels will be discussed by the Presidents of Russia  and the United States during their meeting to take place in the  next few days.    All of the above does not mean that Russia and NATO are  separated by an unbridgeable gulf. This was evidenced at the  recent meeting of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and NATO  Secretary-General Manfred Woerner. On that occasion, it was  pointed out that an objective evaluation of Russia's role  relative to the assurance of international security and  stability requires that Russia's relationships with the NATO  Alliance be accorded priority, with respect to rate of progress,  scope, and depth, over relations between the latter and  countries of Central and Eastern Europe.    Noteworthy in this regard is that there already exists  compatibility in a number of fundamental views in military and  political concepts held by Russia and NATO member countries.  This is a beneficial result of the de-ideologization of  international relations on the one hand, and a coincidence of  views held by both sides relative to basic problems of security  assurance on the other.    In this regard, both sides accord political methods a  position of priority. The use of military force is looked upon  as an exceptional measure, one permissible only in the interests  of self-defense and in peacekeeping operations. Both the "new  strategic NATO concept" adopted in 1991 and the recently  approved "Basic Military Doctrine Principles of the Russian  Federation" contain extremely important provisions asserting  that neither the North Atlantic Alliance nor Russia will  consider any state or coalition to be an enemy. Both documents  acknowledge that the limitation and reduction of armaments are  in agreement with the national interests of all states and  promote strengthening of general security. It may be said that  this opens up a real possibility of eliminating the remaining  elements of military confrontation in Europe.    And the above kind of elements do still exist. Russia is  carrying out a deep restructuring of her Armed Forces, has  already effected considerable manpower reduction, and intends to  proceed in this direction, while the NATO countries are slow in  abating their military activity. In a recent session of the  bloc's Military Planning Committee, it was pointed out that the  last few years have seen a mere 15&percnt; reduction in manpower  of  member countries, while military expenditures still amount to  3.2&percnt; of the gross national product. And this in the  absence of  a real enemy!    But this raises another question. If Russia considers  expansion of the NATO structure disadvantageous, so to speak,  and if the details of the "Partnership for Peace" are still  unclear, can there be a solution to the existing situation? It  appears that there can be, and, possibly, more than one. For  example, one can point to further improvement in the role and  significant activity of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (NACC). Even now it unites 38 states, being NATO members on the  one hand, and former members of the WPO (Warsaw Pact  Organization), including of course the Russian Federation, on  the other. Russia participates actively in sessions of the NACC  at the level of ministers of foreign affairs, while  representatives of her Ministry of Defense take part in the work  of various commissions, seminars, and courses, within the  framework of this organization.    However, the above framework is still limited. The time has  obviously come to effect a considerable expansion in this area.  There are real possibilities for transforming the NACC into a  collective security organization in Europe. This would be  associated with diminishing the role of the CSCE (Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe), but due to the fact that  the work of the CSCE involves a much smaller number of states  compared with the NACC, it would be easier to arrive at  mutually-acceptable solutions and render the latter more  effective and responsive to pressing tasks and requirements  related to the situation.    One would not be out of line here to point out that the  above  is understood by all NACC members. Issued at a recent meeting of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was a statement  discussing the measures advanced for improving  interrelationships within the framework of this organization.  The latter has identified for itself the task of continuing and  activating consultations related to political problems and  problems associated with security assurance and to the  development of cooperation in the military area. For example,  this served as the purpose for approving a new working plan of  dialogue, partnership, and cooperation for 1994.    Why the selection of organizations such as North Atlantic  Cooperation Council? Why not charge NATO with the function of  assuring regional security? The answer is that the NATO Alliance  was set up as a specific organization of leading Western  countries under definite conditions to accomplish definite  goals. But the conditions have changed radically.    There can be no doubt that any attempts made to transform  NATO will effect virtually no change in its nature. The NATO  Alliance is an organization of the past. Occupying its agenda  should be not its modernization, but instead a move away from  bloc thinking and toward an efficient and effective system of  European and international security. The time has obviously come  to infuse with vitality the fruitful idea of creating a security  system stretching "from Vancouver to Vladivostok," to prepare  and implement the necessary machinery.    The above are the considerations I would like to share on  the  eve of the NATO summit relative to a problem as serious as  relations between Russia and the NATO Alliance.</p>

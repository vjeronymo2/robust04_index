			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Inland Revenue bans annuity plan The Inland Revenue has banned an innovative type of annuity which was designed to helped pensioners cope with the effects of falling interest rates, Gillian O'Connor writes. Sales of 'managed' or 'flexible' annuities by Equitable Life, the life company, have been halted and pensioners who have taken out such annuities may have to make alternative arrangements. The sharp fall in interest rates over the past few years means pensioners taking out a conventional annuity now might receive an income which was between 25 per cent and 30 per cent lower than those who took out their annuities a couple of years ago. Last October Equitable Life introduced a new annuity product which allowed pensioners to choose what level of income they wanted to take out of their pension fund in particular years or to take out a conventional annuity at a time of their own choosing.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: LEMOND WANTS TO JOIN CYCLING TEAM IN U.S.  </P> <P> Tour de France winner Greg LeMond wants to leave the Belgian ADR cycling team  after receiving a "phenomenal" offer from the 7-Eleven team in the United  States, his team director said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jose De Cauwer said LeMond wanted to break his contract -- which does not  expire until the end of next year -- but ADR had yet to decide whether to allow  him to quit.  </P> <P> "If he desperately wants to go, there are two possibilities," De Cauwer said.  "Either we tell him to stay and we start quarreling or we agree to let him go  by mutual agreement."  </P> <P> De Cauwer said that 7-Eleven had made LeMond an unprecedented offer, one ADR  could never match.  </P> <P> "They are ready to pay him a phenomenal sum and they are prepared to go to the  bitter end," De Cauwer said. He would not specify details of the offer.  </P> <P> LeMond and his lawyers have visited Hein Verbruggen, president of the  International Professional Cycling Federation, to discuss ways of terminating  the contract but Verbruggen said it would not be possible, according to De  Cauwer.  </P></p>

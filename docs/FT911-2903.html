			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Treuhand seeks buyer for railway carriage maker THE Deutsche Waggonbau, the world's largest builder of railway carriages, has been placed on the market by the Treuhand, the east German privatisation agency. The Treuhand said yesterday it would be seeking buyers in Europe, the USA, Japan and South Korea, as well as in Germany. The company has been established from the ruins of a giant railway equipment Kombinat but has been given about DM200m (Pounds 66.8m) for new investment in the current year and, according to the Treuhand, could very soon be profitable. It expects sales of about DM2bn this year, a large part from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, talks over a possible lengthening of the one-year ban on sackings in the east German engineering industry ended inconclusively yesterday. IG Metall, the engineering union, is trying to extend the ban, which is due to run out on July 1. Another round of negotiations in the west German metal industry also ended inconclusively, with the union threatening that warning strikes could begin next week. The union is seeking a 10 per cent rise, the employers have offered 4 per cent, and a settlement at about 7 per cent is expected. The German dairy products group Alois Muller said yesterday it was planning to build a plant in Britain. In 1990 the company had a turnover of DM508m but is seeking to expand abroad. It is also building a plant in east Germany.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: OFFENDERS MAY OUTGROW LIFE OF CRIME  </P> <P> The reason there are so few reports about older criminals is that, with age,  most give up the trade. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, one-half  of all people arrested for property crimes such as theft and robbery are 19 or  younger. By contrast, only 19% are 30 or older.  </P> <P> Why is aging -- and the changes that accompany it -- such an effective  deterrent to criminal behavior? Like many non-offenders, aging criminals "begin  to take stock of their lives and their accomplishments," sociologist Neal  Shover writes in "Aging Criminals." He reports on interviews with 50 offenders  who were 40 and older.  </P> <P> In the process, many gradually view their youthful criminal identity as  "stupid," and reshape once-grandiose aspirations into more modest but  attainable goals. They grow more aware of time as a limited resource and,  consequently, are more reluctant to spend it in prison. The development of  satisfying relationships and ties to legitimate employment also encourage a  more conventional life style.  </P> <P> Despite having learned to avoid trouble in prison, "older criminals will say  that the time gets harder to do," says UCLA sociologist Jack Katz, author of  "Seductions of Crime: Moral and Sensual Attractions in Doing Evil." He  attributes this in part to "a loss of fascination in the myths and dramas that  young people act out in crime. . . . In a hedonistic way, the seductions (of  crime) become less attractive."  </P> <P> Noting that many offenders go straight in their 20s or 30s, Katz speculates  that withdrawing from crime is a life-cycle phenomenon akin to outgrowing  adolescence -- for persistent criminals, a prolonged one.  </P> <P> Successful older offenders who have prospered financially from crime are least  likely to give it up, according to Shover. Nevertheless, he writes, many  eventually mend their ways "in large measure because of real or imagined  infirmities of age."  </P> <P> Question: On Christmas Day, my 73-year-old mother called paramedics because my  father was ill. The individual who answered the phone apparently refused to  take the call seriously. Fortunately, my brother dropped by and noticed that my  father's breathing was very shallow.  </P> <P> He called the paramedics and, within one-half hour, my father was in the  emergency room. Why didn't they pay attention to my mother's call?  </P> <P> Answer: Although most paramedics respond to emergencies appropriately, there  have been cases where the paramedic operator failed to "pick up" on the  seriousness of the call.  </P> <P> Emergency operators must make quick decisions with little information. Often  when people call 911, they fail to transmit vital information because they are  so overwhelmed with concern for the victim.  </P> <P> Another possible explanation is that the operator responded to your brother  because it was the second call about the same individual. And though it rings  of ageism and sexism, it may be that your brother's voice commanded more  respect from the operator than your mother's.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Marshall Morgan of UCLA's Emergency Medicine Center, callers  should give as specific information as possible. For example: "My father is  having trouble breathing, has pain in his arm and has a history of heart  problems." A specific description helps the emergency operator make an  immediate decision without needing to ask many questions.  </P> <P> To improve emergency-operator responses, many paramedic programs are developing  guidelines to help determine real emergencies.  </P> <P> Q: I'm a 52-year-old bride-to-be who will be tying the knot the second time  around this spring. Can you advise me on what to wear?  </P> <P> A: Most second-time brides prefer pale colors or off-white. If you are planning  an informal wedding, a knee-length suit or silk dress would be a good choice.  If your wedding is more formal, you may want to wear a romantic dress of lace  or chiffon with a mid-calf or long skirt. One advantage of a suit is that it  can be worn again with a different blouse or buttons.  </P> <P> Shopping options include bridal departments and boutiques, securing the  assistance of a personal shopper or having an item made-to-order. Some  wedding-dress manufacturers have a collection geared for second marriages.  </P> <P> Most bridal experts recommend wearing a hat, bow or flowers, but not a veil.  </P></p>

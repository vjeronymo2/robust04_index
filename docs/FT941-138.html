			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Light touch in battle for brands - A free speech issue, a clever marketing ploy or an unfair promotional device? Diane Summers looks at EU plans to liberalise comparative advertising Two chimps are locked up by scientists: one is given Coca-Cola to drink, while the other gets Pepsi. After six weeks, the Coke chimp can hammer pegs into holes and the scientists note his 'remarkable improvement in motor skills'. The Pepsi chimp, meanwhile, has gone missing and is later discovered driving a Jeep full of young women along the beach into the sunset, to the accompaniment of rock music. This Pepsi television advertisement - one of a series that seeks to differentiate the drink from the brand leader by giving it, in Pepsi's words, a 'hip and irreverent' image - was unveiled to a US audience of 130m viewers during a break in the Super Bowl football championship in January. The advertisement made it clear that Pepsi was being compared to Coke and both drink cans were displayed. But when it came to showing the advertisement around the world, further versions had to be made, referring coyly to Coke as Brand X 'leading cola' or, even more elliptically, as Brand X 'leading soft drink'. Comparative advertising, which makes direct comparisons with a competitor's product, is a common and long-standing practice in the US, but is either restricted or banned in a number of other countries. In Germany, for example, all comparisons are seen as unfair competition  - the slogan 'Avis, we try harder' was not allowed because it was seen as implicating fellow car-rental business Hertz, even though the rival name was not mentioned. Pepsi sees comparative advertising as a free speech issue, as well it might, since it is the number two brand. The convention is that the brand leader never stoops to the tactic. Alan Pottasch, a senior executive in charge of worldwide advertising for Pepsi-Cola International, says: 'As the world moves irrevocably towards free and open markets, we think it's high time that comparative advertising becomes an acceptable way to communicate the concept of choice to consumers everywhere. That's what we believe is at stake here.' Coca-Cola's response - attempting to get the chimps advertisement and other Pepsi comparative commercials taken off the air in some countries  - is, in effect, stoking the 'cola wars'. It has been suggested that the cola conflict appears manufactured and is in the interests of both brands - and that both Coke and Pepsi sales increase when their battle is being publicly fought. Even if it is a marketing ploy, Pepsi is not alone in wanting comparative advertising laws liberalised. In the UK, the government is using a bill on trademarks, currently being considered by parliament, as an opportunity to clear the way for comparative advertising. There is no absolute ban on the practice in the UK and there have been some famous examples, including Qualcast and Flymo lawnmowers, Duracell and Eveready batteries, St Ivel Gold and Flora spreads and, most recently, The Sun and Mirror newspapers. The latter has appeared mainly in the trade press, a sector which has produced some particularly strong comparative copy. But, because of existing trademarks' legislation, an advertiser can run into trouble if a competitor's trademark - and names and packaging often form part of the trademark - appears in a comparative advertisement. The proposed UK trademarks bill clearly specifies that the use of trademarks by others should be allowed 'for the purpose of identifying goods or services'. However, not everyone is happy about such liberalisation. The Confederation of British Industry, the UK employers' organisation and representative of some of the largest brand leaders, opposes the development. The CBI attempted to get the bill amended at an earlier stage of its passage so that trademark owners' permission would have to be granted, or, at the very least, owners would receive a warning that the trademark was to be used in comparative advertising. Emily Marks, a CBI legal adviser, says trademark owners fear that brands in which they have invested could be damaged by competitors 'riding on their backs' to promote their own products. There could also be the danger of selective or subjective comparisons being made and by the time complaints are found to be justified, the damage to a brand would have been done. Most of all, the CBI considers the trademarks bill provision ill-timed - a European Union directive on comparative advertising is in the offing. 'The European directive may overturn anything that's in the trademarks bill, so it'll all have to be gone into again,' says Marks. European Commission plans for a directive have been around, in various forms, since 1978. A detailed set of draft rules, which would have allowed comparative advertisements - provided they were restricted to comparisons of objectively verifiable features of goods or services - was thrown out by member states as being overly-prescriptive. A much simplified version is likely to emerge from the commission this year. At present, eight EU countries allow comparative advertisements, with varying conditions, while four - Belgium, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg - either ban the practice or have restrictions making it virtually impossible. If the EU directive does result in Europe-wide liberalisation, are there any lessons that can be learnt from the US experience, where comparative advertising has been used for the past 20 years? Phil Dusenberry is chief executive in New York of BBDO, the advertising agency which has produced a number of advertisements for Pepsi, including the chimp one. It has also produced comparative campaigns for Visa and American Express, and Pizza Hut against its competitors. Dusenberry says the technique has many advantages but also numerous pitfalls. 'You have assiduously to avoid confusing the consumer. The casual television viewer will sometimes confuse your competitor with your product. That's like throwing money down the drain,' he says. Dusenberry also believes that a light touch works best, particularly when the difference between brands is a matter of taste - as in Pepsi and Coke - rather than a clear-cut product advantage. 'If you come on too heavy-handed, you could look like a bully or a terrier nipping at the heels of the competition in a way that's off-putting and offensive. Usually the best kind of comparative advertising is done with a sense of humour, with a smile, rather than a sledgehammer,' he says. Coca-Cola, meanwhile, fails to see the joke. A statement in response to questions about Pepsi's latest advertising reads: 'The Coca-Cola Company is not opposed to comparative advertising as long as the comparison is objectively chosen material, relevant, and scientifically measurable.' Somehow, one suspects Coca-Cola is unlikely to see the chimps experiment as scientifically valid.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Hester Street (A&amp;E Monday at 1 p.m.): Joan Micklin Silver's charming 1975  film, set in a meticulously re-created 1896 Lower East Side and starring Carol  Kane, who comes from the Old Country only to discover her husband (Steven  Keats) has taken on American ways. (2:00)  </P> <P> Lonely Hearts (TMC Wednesday at 4 p.m.): Paul Cox's 1981 Australian film is a  miracle of loving, bemused observation. Norman Kaye and Wendy Hughes play two  lonely people who have lived their lives for others and who meet through a  dating service. (1:35)  </P> <P> Camille (TNT Friday at 9 a.m.): Arguably, Greta Garbo gave her greatest  performance as Dumas' "lady of the camellias" under George Cukor's flawless,  compassionate direction. (2:15)  </P> <P> Danton (A&amp;E Saturday at 1 a.m.): Ardrzej Wajda's beautifully and richly  detailed 1982 film on the French Revolution is an electrifying depiction of a  society hurtling toward chaos; Gerard Depardieu is the boisterous, earthy  Danton. (3:00)  </P></p>

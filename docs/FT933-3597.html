In case you've forgotten, these were the 54 managers who invested in the station's golden handcuffs scheme ahead of the franchise auction in 1991. Some became paper millionaires last month when their shares became tradeable. Under the scheme's terms, they could not resign and hold on to their share options. But it appears they could still be made redundant; six months ago Alan Woolfson, the visual services controller, became an 'involuntary leaver'. He has retired to enjoy a nest-egg coming to the boil at around Pounds 900,000.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Funding the UN IN THE past western governments had some excuse for thinking of the UN as an expensive talking shop of limited use, which had to be kept on a tight financial rein. But in the last two or three years those very governments, through the Security Council, have loaded the organisation with a succession of exacting tasks, especially in the field of peacekeeping. It was therefore quite a shrewd move on the part of the secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, to encourage the Ford Foundation to set up a high-level independent advisory group on UN financing, co-chaired by Mr Paul Volcker with Mr Shijuro Ogata, the respected former deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank, and including such impeccably orthodox financial luminaries as Raymond Barre, Pehr Gyllenhammar, Karl Otto Pohl and Sir David Scholey. It may not be an original observation, but it is still a remarkable one, that the UN spent less on peacekeeping in 1992 than the cost of one stealth bomber, or of operating the New York City Police Department for one year. Perhaps in itself such frugality is a matter for congratulation, but the effects of parsimony, and more especially of the hand-to-mouth way the money is raised, are increasingly and unpleasantly visible in the time it takes the secretariat to respond when instructed to provide peacekeeping forces, and sometimes in the mishandling of peacekeeping tasks when the forces do arrive. The group rejects the suggestions that the UN be given authority to borrow, but accepts such ideas as charging interest on contributions in arrears and allowing the secretary-general to commit a proportion of the funds for a peacekeeping operation as soon as the Security Council has approved it. It also advocates the creation of a revolving reserve fund for peacekeeping set at Dollars 400m (much larger than the Dollars 50m Mr Boutros Ghali had suggested), recommends a regular appropriation for peacekeeping training, and urges the UN to consider the merits of a unified peacekeeping budget, in place of the separate budgets currently in use for each operation. And it lends its considerable authority to the notion that, since peacekeeping is 'an investment in security', governments should finance it from their national defence budgets. The report should be taken seriously, not least by the two countries which have invested most (politically if not financially) in the UN's new role, and whose leaders are meeting each other for the first time today.</p>

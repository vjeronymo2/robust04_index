			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A quest for new connections - Cable and Wireless's search to find a partner HARDLY A month goes by without a new story or rumour surrounding Cable and Wireless's plans to seek an alliance or partnership with another telecommunications company. First there were talks with American Telephone and Telegraph, the giant US telecommunications group, on a global alliance between the two companies. Earlier this year Cable's share price rose on news of the talks but fell sharply when they failed. Next, reports suggested US West, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' regional companies spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, was in talks about forming a partnership with Mercury Communications, Cable's UK telephone subsidiary. Then rumours suggested the talks were off because of US regulatory problems; earlier this week the talks were confirmed as on again. The market, punch drunk with rumours of telecommunication alliances, no longer knows what to make of it. So what is Cable up to? The group confirms it is seeking a link-up between Mercury and another telecommunications company. One purpose is to increase Cable's profits generated outside Hong Kong. For the year to March HongKong Telecom, in which Cable holds a majority stake of 58.4 per cent, generated 60 per cent of the group's Pounds 644m pre-tax profits. There are two ways for Cable to grow: expanding existing operations and establishing new ones. When it comes to the latter Cable is hopeful of getting licences to operate in parts of eastern Europe, Australia, Sweden, Japan and elsewhere. In the long term it is looking at establishing a network linking the large towns surrounding St Petersburg and Moscow, known as the 'Golden Ring'. These ventures could prove expensive on top of existing capital spending commitments of Pounds 1bn over the next three years. The group, therefore, needs a partner to inject equity. With regard to expanding existing operations Mercury is the obvious candidate. Measured by trading performance it is expanding faster than Cable's other businesses, with revenue growing by 34 per cent in fiscal 1992 compared with HongKong Telecom's 28 per cent growth. Mercury was set up in 1982 to compete with British Telecommunications. It concentrated on the lucrative international market. It has 7 per cent of the domestic market compared with 18 per cent of the international market. It believes the only way of challenging BT's dominance in the UK is by winning over more residential customers by making a significant inroad into the local market. Mercury plans to increase the number of residential customers from 200,000 to 2m by the year 2000. To expand in the local residential market would require a significant amount of investment - which is another reason Cable is looking for a partner. To achieve its twin goal of challenging BT's dominance in the UK and establishing new operations abroad it therefore started talks with US West about selling a stake in Mercury. US West would need US government permission to take a stake in Mercury in order to participate in international services. The Federal Communication Commission, the US regulatory authority, has said waivers to participate in international services had been given to other Baby Bells in the past and would probably be given in the future. Mr James Ross, Cable's chief executive, envisages four elements to an agreement with another telecommunications company. It must be a strategic alliance that would link Mercury's long-distance network with a local network in the UK. This could require a massive investment to take on BT in the UK. Any deal would probably lead to Cable's partner agreeing to underwrite part of that investment. Cable is seeking a stake in the partner's cable television interests, not because it wants to diversify into cable - although it could provide long-term benefits - but so it can reinforce its commitment to build Mercury's residential customer base. For example Cable is negotiating to take a stake in TeleWest, US West's cable television joint venture in the UK. If the talks succeed US West's cable television network would be able to provide a local network to Mercury at no great extra cost to itself. Mercury would provide the long-distance links and probably the exchanges, known as switches. The cable television companies are already installing telephone lines into homes and offices. TeleWest is the largest UK cable operator with 17 franchises serving 2.9m homes. Between 40,000 and 50,000 have signed up for telephones. A partner mould be expected to pay cash for a stake in Mercury to finance its future expansion in the UK. With net debt of Pounds 612m compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 2.9bn for the year to end-March, Cable does not need to reduce borrowings, Mr Ross says. In fact he expects net debt to rise to about Pounds 1bn in the next year. An equity stake in Mercury would be mainly used to finance its expansion instead of reducing borrowings. The sale of a stake in Mercury would put a value on it and thus could lead to a separate listing from Cable. HongKong Telecom already has its own listing on the Hong Kong, New York and Pacific stock exchanges. Mr Tim Hirst, telecommunications analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'The market believes Mercury is worth about Pounds 2bn. So any sale that values it at more than that will have a positive impact on the shares.' The talks with AT&amp;T - about creating a global alliance between the two telecommunications groups - failed because they did not include the four elements outlined by Mr Ross. US West appears to be able to meet all four. By publicly spelling out Cable's terms for doing a deal in the future Mr Ross is trying to tell the market that any talks currently taking place are likely to be more focused.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Party funding probe may force reforms Widening allegations that France's centre-right Republican party has illegally funded itself are prompting calls for a further reform of the country's political finance laws. Mr Philippe Seguin, the national assembly president, has proposed an all-party study into reforming legislation on the funding of political parties, a move which, according to a Louis Harris poll in yesterday's Infomatin newspaper, would have the backing of 90 per cent of French people. Mr Seguin criticised Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, for failing to respond to the allegations surrounding his trade and industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, by instituting a wider reform. The prime minister confined himself to saying that the investigation of Mr Longuet's affairs should pursue its course, but that if by the end of this month this led to the minister being formally charged, he would be asked to resign. A Paris prosecutor has asked the justice ministry to appoint a magistrate to investigate allegations that the Republican party received some FFr28m (Pounds 3.35m) in cash during 1987-91, that it set up an advertising company as a front to cream off commissions from companies, and that it received 'particularly advantageous' financing from property companies to buy its Paris headquarters.</p>

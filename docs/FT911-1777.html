			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Clothes that can sense the mood CLOTHES which can change colour according to your mood is the promise of a liquid crystal display technology developed in Poole, UK, by a division of the German chemicals company Merck, of Darmstadt. The technique uses liquid crystal ink, originally developed for use in equipment such as thermometers, which is sensitive to heat and changes colour as the temperature rises - from black to red, yellow, green, blue and violet. It achieves this because the heat changes the viscosity of the liquid crystal ink, and so the light reflected. The task for Merck, which worked on the technology with Hull University and the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern, has been to develop an ink which can be applied to textiles and survive washing or cleaning. This has been achieved by combining the inks with a type of gelatin. A special screen varnish can also be applied over the top. Merck: Germany: 6151 720; UK, 0202 745520.</p>

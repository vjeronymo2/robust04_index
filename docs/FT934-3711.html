			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Pentagon to plan for new foes The US is to change its military planning, equipment and intelligence to deal with the likelihood that, even after the demise of the Warsaw Pact, its future enemies are likely to possess some form of chemical, biological or nuclear weapon. Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, said new measures were needed because 'a policy of prevention through denial won't be enough to cope with the potential of tomorrow's proliferators'. The military services have been asked to examine their equipment programmes and shift money toward better ways of tracking mobile missile launchers, improving bomb penetration to attack buried weapons sites and developing detectors and suits to guard against chemical or biological attack. Theatre missile defence systems will also be a priority. These new counter-proliferation measures could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and a senior defence official said budget realities meant that money would have to come from other defence programmes. At the same time, US intelligence efforts will be shifted to gather more information that the armed forces might need to help protect themselves against weapons of mass destruction in future regional wars. The number of military personnel in the Central Intelligence Agency's non-proliferation centre will be tripled. While US forces have always been prepared for a Warsaw Pact enemy in Europe who possessed both nuclear and chemical weapons, military planning for smaller regional conflicts has largely ignored such weapons of mass destruction.</p>

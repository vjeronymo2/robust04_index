			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> OLDER PAINTERS EXHIBIT ARTWORKS  </P> <P> A group of Camarillo artists is out to prove that you are never too old to set  up an easel, stretch out a canvas and pick up a paintbrush.  </P> <P> The artists, members of the Leisure Village painters club ranging in age from  70 to 90, are exhibiting their work today and Sunday at the Irene Vasquez Art  Center in Camarillo.  </P> <P> The paintings were done by the club's professional, semi-professional and very  enthusiastic amateurs, said Marian Jayne, president of the club and its  part-time art teacher.  </P> <P> "This is the first time we've exhibited outside Leisure Village. We want to  show what can be done at any age," she said.  </P> <P> Most of the 59 paintings exhibited are done in oil, but there are some acrylics  and watercolors, Jayne said. Subject matter includes landscapes, abstracts,  still lifes and "of course, we always have portraits of the grandchildren or  the cat."  </P> <P> Jayne, a 76-year-old retired professional artist with several works in the  show, said the exhibit also provides the first opportunity for some of her  beginning students to showcase their efforts.  </P> <P> She pointed out two oil paintings of horses done by a man in his late 70s.  </P> <P> "That man had never done any painting, but in his soul is a Paul Gauguin," she  said.  </P> <P> Jayne moved to a landscape done by another student.  </P> <P> "This is an attractive painting. She's proud of it, and it matches her couch."  </P> <P> Painting gives club members the chance to express themselves, Jayne said.  </P> <P> "It involves your pride and ego. Some of my paintings have become my friends.  It's wonderful to be able to paint." KAREN MCKEAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Eastman Kodak Co.: The Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic equipment and  chemicals firm posted second-quarter net income of $60 million, down 85% from  the record $390 million of a year ago, due to restructuring costs. Without  those costs, the firm said earnings would have amounted to $287 million, down  26%. Profit was further depressed by higher costs, including greater interest  expense, and the unfavorable impact of exchange rate changes. Sales totaled  $4.5 billion, up 9%.  </P></p>

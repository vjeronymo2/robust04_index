			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Martini] </F>   [Text] Some blunders like appointing Bacon Duarte Prado as  an adviser or avoiding the implementation of serious measures at  the IPS [Social Security Institute] are factors that reduce the  credibility of the executive branch's political management. If  we add to this Decree No. 2780 on promotions and transfers in  the judicial branch, the lack of enthusiasm with which [Colorado  Party Deputy] Bernardino Cano Redil -- the government's main  intellectual operator -- champions some government positions,  and the Colorado Party's sensible silence last month, we  recognize an increasingly isolated president at Lopez Palace.  Even [Colorado Party Senator] Juan Carlos Galaverna seemed out  of place this week.    It is not possible to ask the government to solve in less  than one year of administration the problems of the oligarchic  agrarian structure bequeathed by numerous decades of wealth  concentration. It is also not possible to ask the government to  work a miraculous economic swap that will allow a large GDP  growth rate. It is not possible to ask the government to affect  the international prices for soybean or cotton, and, with the  assistance of a saint, conclude the military's reform within  eight months. It is not possible to ask the government to  abruptly improve the quality and scope of education. No one is  asking Engineer Wasmosy to perform these miracles.    The problem is that there are not even favorable signs of a  political line allowing us to guess that we have a government  management that seeks to overcome these and other serious social  and economic deficits. The Social Development Council  represents an attempt to find a solution to the growing social  crisis. And, as a general framework, we must mention a policy  of basic agreements sought through discussions among various  parties or directly through agreements on concrete issues. And  the "democratic compromise" is a sign of the latter method.    Bearing in mind the new political arena, involving an  increased balance of forces, a broad conciliatory policy has  been sought. And even though the National Encounter, the  [Colorado Party leader Luis] Argana supporters, and the [Hermes  and Miguel] Saguier supporters uphold a critical stance toward  [opposition leader] Domingo Laino, they are actually  implementing a moderate opposition and have signed the  "democratic compromise." In a nutshell, President Wasmosy has a  potentially favorable arena to achieve a broad spectrum of basic  agreements that might represent a contribution to the  credibility of President Wasmosy's government. Nevertheless, for  reasons that we cannot entirely understand, the president  sometimes seems to be his government's main opponent. The last  measure taken on the judicial issue violates the spirit and  letter of the "democratic compromise." In addition, the  president has not taken drastic measures on the IPS issue or  agrarian problems. It seems to be a government that does not  take any initiatives.  <H5>  Wasmosy's Men </H5>   The selection of his advisers reflects a president's  political bias. It is hard to believe that a figure like Duarte  Prado can contribute anything to the government's democratic  credibility. It is also not possible to trust in Engineer  Wasmosy's effective willingness to advance with all the  democratic segments in the improvement of justice with actions  like those taken this week.    Therefore, the question of who are the men governing with  Wasmosy arises. We assume that they are not the main  shareholders and directors of the companies that allowed him to  accumulate wealth recently. We trust [Army Commander Division]  General [Lino] Oviedo is not one of them. The Colorado Party  leadership does not have a clear position on the social  problems. And since the ANR [National Republican Association --  Colorado Party] already is involved in its primary campaign,  some of its main leaders are reviving their traditional  language, with the exception of Education Minister Nicanor  Duarte Frutos.    The UIP [Paraguayan Industrial Union] is withdrawing its  support. The trade unions are calling a general strike. The  president should -- at least -- attempt to keep fluent  communications with his moderate opposition. And he does not do  it. Therefore, who is or are advising him? What is the  president's political strategy team? It is worrisome. We still  believe that the first civilian president since 1954 must be  successful. And that he is still in time to change the course.</p>

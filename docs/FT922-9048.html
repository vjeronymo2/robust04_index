			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Books: Behind the Shropshire Lad / A look at the life and work of A. E. Housman HOUSMAN'S POEMS by John Bayley Oxford Pounds 25, 202 pages A E HOUSMAN by Keith Jebb Seren Books (Bridgend, Mid-Glamo gan) Pounds 11.95 THE TIDE of taste ran strongly in Housman's favour during his lifetime - copies of A Shropshire Lad were in great demand during the First World War - and then it turned against him when he died in 1936. Cyril Connolly, writing then in the New Statesman and Nation, declared: 'The truth is that many of Housman's poems are of a triteness of technique equalled only by the banality of thought; others are slovenly, and a quantity are derivative - not from the classics, but from Heine, or from popular trends - imperialism, place-nostalgia, games, beer - common to the poetry of his time. A Shropshire Lad includes with some poems that are unworthy of Kipling others that are unworthy of Belloc, without the excuse of over-production through economic necessity which those writers might have urged.' Further stick came from within Housman's own citadel of Cambridge, where attacks on him were launched in Scrutiny. FR Leavis and IA Richards were enraged by Housman's Leslie Stephen Lecture The Name and Nature of Poetry, delivered in 1933, with its denigration of the Metaphysicals and most of the English 18th century poets; and in which Housman propounded his famous razor test for poetry: 'Poetry indeed seems to me more physical than intellectual . . . Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to keep watch over my thoughts because, if a line of poetry strays into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act. This particular symptom is accompanied by a shiver down the spine . . .' TS Eliot had, however, some good words to say for the lecture, and the new young 1930s 'Macspaunday' poets (Roy Campbell's useful abbreviation), especially Stephen Spender, did admire Housman; or seemed to until Auden put the boot into Housman in his cruel sonnet about him. 'Deliberately he chose the dry-as-dust,/ Kept tears like dirty postcards in a drawer . . .' But since the Second World War the tide has turned once more and, as these two books under review testify, Housman is riding high again. His work has been kept alive by new and ever more complete editions - a quantity of his poetry remained unpublished at his death - and by biographical revelations. As is now well-known, Housman was homosexual but powerless to do much about it. The great love of his life was a fellow undergraduate Moses Jackson, who appears to have been completely indifferent to him sexually and who got married sometime after Oxford without telling Housman. His career was spent largely in India so that Housman rarely saw him, making memories of him all the more powerful. As a Cambridge Professor of Latin and a Fellow of Trinity, Housman (after ten years as a dogsbody in the Patent Office) was by then largely restricted for his social life to the donnish world of High Table; in term time at any rate. As an enthusiastic pioneer air passenger Housman did fly off in the vacations to places like Paris and Venice, where he seems to have enjoyed a special relationship with his gondolier. Some cryptic notes in his hand on a piece of card that has survived suggest he may have gone in for rented male companions in the French capital. All this stands today as the sub-text to the poems about red-coats, bugles, reveille, athletes, lost love, lads, lasses, and public hangings, those poignant lyric poems full of memorable lines like 'An air that kills . . .', highly individual versions of English pastoral. Christopher Ricks did a useful job a few years ago editing the poems. His Penguin, AE Housman Collected Poems and Selected Prose (1988) gives to the ordinary reader all he needs of Housman's work in one convenient inexpensive volume. A complete edition, based on fresh scrutiny of the heavily corrected manuscripts by Archie Burnett, seems to be on the way. Both Bayley and Jebb compare Housman to Larkin. There are striking similarities between the two bachelor poets, most obviously in their insistence on several degrees of separation between the private secret self manifest in the poetry, and the public existence and activity of the professional man: the professor of Latin literature and textual scholar in the one instance; the university librarian in the other. Both happened when they were young men to be students at the same Oxford college, St John's, and both as old men left their unpublished papers in a mess for their executors to tidy up. Bayley claims that there is an even greater kinship between them than merely one of external stance and of shared attitudes (pessimism about sexual happiness, acute consciousness of deprivation, religious scepticism); he argues that there is a kinship in the way their poetry works in the mind of the reader. 'Meeting Housman or Larkin in their poems (he writes) can be like experiencing a change of consciousness. Poetry like theirs gives us an abrupt feeling of what it is like to be someone else, putting us in touch with them more immediately, and as vividly, as might in other circumstances be the case with a novelist and his characters'. The comparison with Larkin is but one of many with the work of other poets made by Bayley in his attempt to define Housman's deceptively simple directness: Emily Dickinson, George Darley, Sturge Moore, John Davidson, Walter de la Mare, Warren de Tabley, Paul Celan (the modern German poet of the Holocaust, author of Death Fugue) are some of the surprising names he throws into the ring alongside the expected ones, Shakespeare, Daniel, Collins, Browning, Yeats. The book, though short, is taxing and illuminating; it may be read not merely as a reappraisal of Housman but as a meditation on the nature of poetry by a leading member of the Oxford English school. In seeing Housman in such a wide, international perspective Bayley tends to neglect his local habitations and his homosexual nature, no doubt believing these have been gone into more than enough already. He does not, for instance, comment on the one poem Housman wrote about Oscar Wilde (without actually naming him): 'Oh who is that young sinner with handcuffs on his wrists?' By contrast Keith Jebb, whose first book this is, closely examines this poem and the possible impact on Housman of the Wilde trials - they came on at around the same time A Shropshire Lad appeared. Jebb, who is perceptive about Housman the man as well as the poet, was born in Shropshire. His short book, which starts splendidly and then seems slightly to run out of steam, is part of a series, Border Lines, dealing with writers and artists whose work and lives stem from the Border country between England and Wales. Housman was not a Salopian born and bred. He grew up in neighbouring Worcestershire in a large family headed by a weak father but managed by a caring mother whom he loved dearly, and, after her death, equally well by a friendly step-mother. Ludlow and Shropshire at the period of the Boer War were for him legendary inspirational romantic regions, not areas he knew at all well at first hand. Nonetheless, like Shakespeare and Venice, he brings them to life with a sense of plausibly realised actuality. The relevance of his poetry, several wars and holocausts later, is something made abundantly clear by both these books. Connolly's final twist of the knife was his remark that Housman 'will live as long as the BBC'; but it begins to look as if Housman will be the more enduring of the two.</p>

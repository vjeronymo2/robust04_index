			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Legislators yesterday gave the go-ahead for a  funding request of $715 million to finance the installation of  the airport railway immersed tube and related projects amid  signs of optimism for a Sino-British agreement. The approved  funding was $102 million less than the original request tabled  in the Legislative Council last month due to lower tender prices  submitted to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). It  represents about three percent of an equity injection of $23.7  billion for the airport railway contained in the fourth  financing package given to the Chinese side in February.    The Financial Secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, also confirmed  a  report that the latest proposal on equity injection to the  Provisional Airport Authority stood at $36.6 billion. The two  amounted to a total equity injection of $60.3 billion by the  Government -- $40 billion more than that in the first proposal.  Sir Hamish said he did not think the revelation of the figures  would affect the Sino-British talks. "I think they will  understand that just to review the equity is reasonable," he  said.    Sir Hamish said there was a need to reassure legislators on  whether the funding request tabled to them would be in line with  the amount of equity. He refused to say whether the revelation  meant that the gap between the two governments had become  narrower. "At different stages in the talks, as work  progresses, then we have to gradually reveal more in order to  give members enough of the picture for them to feel that they  can make a reasonable judgment and approve the funds," he said.    Last week, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, Lu Ping, said he expected an agreement on the airport in  about two months.    The money, granted as advanced funding, will become part of  the equity injection to the MTRC [Mass Transit Railway  Corporation]. The MTRC confirmed that British firm Tarmac  International and Japan's Kumagai Gumi had jointly been awarded  the project.    Due to earlier delays, it was estimated that the airport  railway section linking Central to Kowloon would be completed  only in April 1998.    According to the latest submission, the estimated cost of  the  airport railway immersed tube and related works has dropped from  $726 million to $630 million. The construction supervision and  resident site staff allowance also dropped by $7 million to $51  million. The reduction in the prices listed has resulted in a  lower project contingency level at $34 million.    Meanwhile, Sir Hamish's confirmation of the equity amount  also sparked criticisms that the Government was "governing  through the media." Three leading parties the United Democrats,  the Liberal Party, and Meeting Point -- also questioned the  Government for rejecting their request for details of the fourth  financing proposal, information of which has been leaked to the  press. The Liberal Party's Steven Poon Kwok-lim said: "As  legislators, we are not happy with it. Are you governing  through the media?"    Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang dismissed the  suggestion. "We do not feed information to the press. We do not  have complete control on what the press may or may not say," she  said.</p>

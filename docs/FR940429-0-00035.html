If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet program requirements at any point after grant start-up, or at any time during the term of the grant (i.e., if matching funds from sources other than program participant fees drop below 50 percent of total supportive services cost), the Secretary concerned may decrease the federal grant share of supportive services funds accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

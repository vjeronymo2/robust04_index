			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Jobs: Working in a worrying wonderland - Readers' explanations of practical skills range from life after death to pulses in the brainbox Curiouser and curiouser,' cried Alice in wonderland. More curious still is that the Jobs column seems to have joined her without doing anything unusual such as following rabbits down holes or drinking strange potions (other than those prescribed for the Beijing flu). All I did was ask you readers a practical question about the most everyday of topics: to wit, how do you do your work? That was 10 weeks ago, and 128 of you have kindly replied from 14 countries, citing experience in a great variety of jobs. The snag is that the answers often just deepen the mystery my question was meant to clear up. Indeed, some of your explanations of how skilled work is done are literally out of this world. An example is the reply from Switzerland saying: 'The key to this phenomenon is reincarnation.' The question certainly seemed down-to-earth on the day it was asked, even though the work you readers do is of a complex mental kind. Ironically, I was expecting most of you to confirm that the way you actually use your mental skills is less complicated than we are led to suppose by a notion evidently underpinning the bulk of conventional education. And while the fact that you've largely done the opposite may serve me right for being presumptuous, I do wish you hadn't. In that case, what follows would have been plain sailing - just a summary of your practical explanations, contrasting them with the said educational notion. But now you have brought reincarnation and the like into the act, some philosophy is unavoidable. So let's start with the proposition that there are different kinds of knowledge, of which two in particular form the main focus of academic curricula. One kind is factual: knowing that something is so. The other is the explanatory sort: knowing why something is so. For ease of reference, both the know-that kind and the know-why sort can be lumped together as know-about - which brings us back to the educational notion. It is that operations requiring mental ability consist of two separate stages. First, we think out what to do, using know-about to form an intellectual plan of the actions that need to be taken. Second, having drawn up the plan in our heads, we carry it out in practice. Now that is clearly far from always the case. For example, we all know that it is possible to ride a bicycle, so being more clued-up than Dr Johnson who apparently refused to believe it. Moreover those of us who also know why it is possible would be better equipped than his contemporaries to persuade him he was wrong to see it as the equivalent of lifting oneself up in a bucket. But possession of both the know-that and the know-why would not be enough to enable someone to ride a bicycle. That requires know-how, which is different. It strikes me that what applies to bike-riding applies to most kinds of skilled work. And the same view happens to be shared by about 70 per cent of you who replied. The trouble is that you differ radically in your beliefs about know-how's nature, being split into three main camps. One is the pure intuitionists for whom know-how ranges from indefinably intricate to plumb mysterious. While few go as far as the Swiss reincarnationist, a good many come close, especially in their account of creative skill. To them, its essential source is not in any individual head or body, but in a universal, supra-human, invisible intelligence. In support, one camp member has sent proofs from a book to be published next year by Blackwell, which cites a study of the use of intuition by 1,312 managers in nine different countries. At the other pole are the grey materialists, who see know-how as rooted in the pulses of the flesh, particularly the bit in the brainbox. Although less expansive than the intuitionists' accounts, their views are more testable. What's more, they have the broad backing of an authority in the field, neuropsychologist Tim Shallice of London University. He says the latest scanning techniques have already traced the networks of brain cells responsible for numerous 'sub-components' of mental action, such as ability to recall short lists of words. Some of the processes, however, are intelligent without being conscious. An example is 'blindsight', by which certain people partly blinded by illness can not only detect but precisely locate a purely visual stimulus they cannot physically see. Professor Shallice expects that in 20 years or so we will have a brain map of all the main mental functions. But even if we do, it won't solve the ultimate question of why they operate intelligently. Hence there would seem to be still room for incorporeal if not unearthly influences of the sort favoured by pure intuitionists. To which my response, as perhaps befits a scared sexagenarian, is agnostic. After all, though such postulations seem improbable, there is no conclusive evidence to hand that disproves them. The only one of the camps I feel able to refute is the smallest: 37 readers who think know-how essentially the same as the know-about taught in schools. The sole reason why our practical skill often seems intuitive, they say, is that we have so deeply absorbed the know-thats and know-whys which compose it as to have forgotten we ever learned them. My disagreement is on two grounds: real-life experience and an observation made a century ago by the American pragmatist philosopher William James. It is that a distinction between two kinds of knowledge is recognised by several languages other than English. One sort is intellectual know-about - wissen in German, for instance. The other is kennen: direct knowledge as exemplified in knowing another person. The related experience came in August when with Pam, my wife, and our 34-year-old son Jon, I was sailing our Holman sloop Malaguana from Dartmouth to the Exe. The wind was moderate but tricky and the tide unfavourable, if anything worsening with time. I've done a fair deal of sailing, and helmed for the first hour. At the end we'd gone 3 1/2 miles, but 20 degrees off the ideal course. The second hour was steered by Jon, who has thousands of sea miles behind him, hundreds of them in Malaguana. He too firmly grasped the stout wooden tiller, though with a lighter hand than mine, and managed 4 miles no more than 10 degrees off line. He then persuaded Pam to take over, which she resisted because she has done hardly any helming except on a previous sail alone with Jon. Nor has she any time for, let alone knowledge of, the theory of sailing. Instead of grasping the tiller, she just rested one finger on it . . . and achieved 4 1/2 miles dead on course. 'Isn't it sickening?' Jon said. 'She out-sailed me last time too.' Asked how she did it, she said: 'I can feel with my finger when the boat's going at her best. So if she falls off, I just nudge her gently about till she's happy again.' That is plainly a case of James's direct knowing. What's more, on reflection, I find the same provides a more fitting explanation than know-about of my way of writing. The salient difference is that, whereas Pam 'feels' the boat, I 'hear' the English language. So it may be that the main root of know-how is unusually sharpened senses. True, there is not much hard evidence to support my theory either. But at least it's simpler than reincarnation.</p>

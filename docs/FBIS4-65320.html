			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The recently concluded congress of the  Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and other party  developments were the subject of commentary in the Greek press.  <H5>  Tsokhatzopoulos Loses Vote </H5>   Writing in the 19 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, Stavros  Liyeros discussed one of the main arguments that arose during  the congress: the refusal of congress participants to approve  the double role of Akis Tsokhatzopoulos as both party secretary  general and minister of interior. Liyeros recalled the 1990  congress, at which PASOK leader Andreas Papandreou threatened to  dissolve the party if Tsokhatzopoulos were not appointed  secretary general. While party regulations forbid the secretary  to occupy a ministerial post, Papandreou nevertheless appointed  Tsokhatzopoulos as minister of interior last October, remanding  a solution of the dilemma to the 1994 congress. As the date of  the congress approached, Liyeros continued, Tsokhatzopoulos  attempted to reinforce his position in the party as Papandreou's  "natural heir." To avoid a conflict the position of minister of  state was offered Tsokhatzopoulos, who rejected it "out of  hand." Tsokhatzopoulos believed the majority of congress  participants would approve his dual position, since they had  been elected "under his banner." Events proved him wrong, with  two out of three participants voting against approval. Liyeros  cited a PASOK official as saying that "we all wanted to send a  message that we will not accept a second hegemony, especially a  misprint of Andreas'." The party, Liyeros observed, has entered  a "slippery course," because the "Tsokhatzopoulos group," which  had extended its power in the central committee and the party  apparatus, suffered a political defeat despite Papandreou's  advice to his minister of interior to show "flexibility."  Liyeros quoted a Papandreou aide as saying that "the prime  minister had no reason to jeopardize his relations with PASOK  and lose his role as almighty referee just to get  Tsokhatzopoulos out of trouble."  <H5>  Other Congress Developments </H5>   Beyond the Tsokhatzopoulos issue, Nikos Kiaos took a  critical  look at other congress developments in the 21 April Athens daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA.    -- Papandreou was only present for an hour, the time it took  him to open the proceedings, close them, and cast his ballot.  He was crowned party leader once again by means of general  applause and slogans which "covered up" the strong objections  and criticism of the leadership a number of participants  launched.    -- While the congress rejected open membership in party  organizations, it approved without discussion the list of  candidates for the central committee "imposed" by Papandreou and  the party's executive bureau.    -- The congress boasted about "party unity," but all its  members were engaged in conflicts related to the list of  candidates for the central committee.    -- Papandreou repeatedly emphasized the "rebirth" of PASOK  without specifying the means to achieve it. Such a "rebirth"  was contradicted by the proceedings.    -- While all the members of the executive bureau disagreed  with Tsokhatzopoulos' dual position, supporters of officials  such as Kostas Laliotis and Yerasimos Arsenis voted for it.    -- Despite the fact that party groups and apparatuses were  denounced, the central committee is dominated by the  Tsokhatzopoulos, Simitis, and Arsenis groups.    -- Although a congress is expected to generate discussion of  "hot problems," foreign and domestic policy issues were barely  mentioned and only self-satisfaction was expressed.    -- Finally, no discussion of the past 2O years or criticism  of erroneous policies occurred, Kiaos observed.</p>

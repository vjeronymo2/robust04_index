			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (34): How the review operates Software at Work is concerned with the experiences of users and how they use software to benefit their businesses. If you are a user with a tale to tell in any of the three topic areas (bespoke systems and consultancy, training), we would be delighted to hear from you directly. User-contacts are a pre-requisite for software suppliers wishing to contribute information, and both user-information must be submitted in a particular format. To comply, suppliers should contact the FT Surveys Department in writing only, saying which topic is of interest, and they will be sent the relevant questionnaire. User-contacts and information are needed by the day before the Easter break: Thursday April 16, 1992, at the latest. Information should be addressed to: Software At Work, Surveys Dept. Secretary, Financial Times, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL.</p>

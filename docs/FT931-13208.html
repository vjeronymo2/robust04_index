			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / German pay talks break off amid warnings on inflation TALKS between the German government and the oTV public sector trade union broke down at the weekend amid warnings that the inflation rate would continue to climb, delaying a cut in interest rates, unless wage rises were kept to just 2.25 per cent. Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister and the government's chief negotiator in the pay talks, said inflation could rise above 4 per cent unless wage rises were controlled. The union has insisted on a 5 per cent increase, as well as a shorter working week 'of about 35 hours'. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, head of the oTV, said the government's unwillingness to compromise, coupled with the unveiling last week of a draft solidarity pact between the states, central government and unions, which aims to slash public spending to finance the cost of German unification, could lead to 'conflict'. Inflation in Germany stands at about 3.8 per cent but had been forecast to stay at or below 4 per cent this year. In a letter to Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union parliamentary group, Ms Wulf-Mathies said the solidarity pact was 'unfair and unbalanced'. Mr Seiters said each percentage point wage increase would cost the taxpayer DM4bn (Pounds 1.64bn). Economists also believe the oTV wage demand could delay moves by the Bundesbank to lower interest rates, which German industry and the economic institutes are demanding. The outcome of the pay negotiations, which resume on February 3, will be watched closely by the unions in the five states of east Germany. Although the west German unions are committed to wage parity with their eastern German counterparts by 1994, the consensus among economic institutes is that individual enterprises will opt for jobs, and not income. For example, Opel, the car manufacturer, which is building a new plant at Eisenach in east Germany, has not joined the federal employees' association. This means it can negotiate separate wage contracts. 'With labour costs 80 per cent higher in east Germany than west Germany, when productivity and wage levels are taken into account, enterprises will want to try and attract both foreign and west German investment through lower wages,' said one economist.</p>

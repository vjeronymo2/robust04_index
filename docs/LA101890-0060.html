			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPENDED NAVAJO LEADER, SON CONVICTED IN CORRUPTION CASE  </P> <P> Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald was convicted Wednesday on 41 counts  of bribery and other crimes for taking money and favors from people doing  business on the reservation.  </P> <P> The same six-member tribal District Court jury convicted Peter (Rocky)  MacDonald Jr., MacDonald's son and co-defendant, on 23 similar counts.  </P> <P> The elder MacDonald could be sent to prison for as long as 21 1/2 years and be  fined up to $21,500. The conviction bars him from holding tribal office for  four years. His name is on the Nov. 6 ballot for tribe president, a post that  replaced the office of chairman.  </P> <P> The prosecution contended that MacDonald illegally asked for and accepted cash  payments, loans, airplane rides and the use of an automobile from businessmen  seeking to curry favor. The defense claimed in closing arguments that he  received the gifts through friendship and that he neither threatened the  business people nor promised them anything in return.  </P> <P> This was the first of three trials that the suspended chairman faces in tribal  court. MacDonald's and his son's second trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday.  They face conspiracy charges related to the tribe's purchase of a ranch for  $33.4 million from a company that had paid $26.2 million for the property five  minutes earlier.  </P> <P> The third trial, in which MacDonald faces 93 fraud counts related to the  tribe's 1986 primary and general elections, is scheduled to begin Dec. 4.  Suspended Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is a co-defendant.  </P></p>

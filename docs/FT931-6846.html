			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / US wins Nato support for Bosnia aid plan THE US yesterday won its Nato allies' political support for its decision to parachute humanitarian supplies to besieged Moslem enclaves in Bosnia, but failed to get any offers of concrete aid for the operation, expected to start this weekend, except from Turkey. Making his first appearance at a Nato ministerial meeting since his appointment as US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher said he was nevertheless 'gratified and encouraged' by the support he had received from his fellow ministers. 'I didn't come here for the purpose of asking for their aid and I was not at all disappointed by the response I received,' he maintained. Both Mr Christopher and a number of allied foreign ministers, including Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, went out of their way to stress that the US and European humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia should be seen as 'supplementary' and not rival policies. But this did not prevent a certain amount of mutual irritation from creeping into their assessments of the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Christopher clearly continues to feel that the European nations are not pulling their weight in the search for a Bosnian peace settlement. The recent decision by the US to participate in the peace negotiations in New York, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, 'comes with the expectation that Europe, which is most directly affected, will play a leading role and redouble its concerted efforts,' he told his fellow ministers. 'The addition of the US should certainly not occasion any relaxation by others.' Official and media criticism of European policy in Bosnia goaded Mr Hurd into once again underlining the extent of the British and French humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia. British troops had escorted 279 convoys carrying 20,000 tonnes of supplies to distressed areas of Bosnia, he said. Mr Christopher also called on the alliance to make preparations 'now' on measures to enforce a peace settlement once it is reached, pointing out that the Vance-Owen plan did not provide for the means required to ensure its implementation. 'We must be ready to act effectively if and when a viable agreement is accepted by all the warring sides.' He reiterated his promise that the US was ready to join with the United Nations, the European Community, Nato and 'others' in implementing a peace agreement, including 'possible US military participation'. Nato's special capabilities and command structure could play a key role in such a joint operation, together with contributions from non-allies, Mr Christopher said. Russia said earlier this week that it was ready to co-operate with Nato in a force to implement a peace agreement, which experts estimate will require at least 60,000 peace-keeping troops. Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said France would propose the nomination of a special UN co-ordinator for the aid and military operation to implement a peace agreement. Though Yugoslavia took up much of the ministers' time, Mr Christopher also made a ringing declaration on the new US administration's fidelity to the Nato alliance and its support for 'a strong and integrated Europe'. President Clinton intended to pursue a policy of 'total diplomacy', which viewed domestic and foreign issues as inseparable, he said. 'We recognise that only an America that is strong at home can act as an effective partner abroad.' The three pillars on which America's 'total diplomacy' would rest were: elevating the US's economic security to a primary foreign policy goal, updating US forces and security arrangements to meet new threats and organising US foreign policy to help promote the spread of democracy and free markets abroad.</p>

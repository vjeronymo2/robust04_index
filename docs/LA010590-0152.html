			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR A CATCHY NAME, CONSULT THE PUN &amp; BRADSTREET OF CUTE  </P> <P> Let's Pet is an invitation to . . . buy an animal, A Flush Beats A Full House  does plumbing and Honest Engines repairs motors.  </P> <P> Punmanship is giving American entrepreneurship a new name, says a University of  Illinois author whose new book lists dozens of businesses nationwide that have  been bitten by the pun bug.  </P> <P> Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics at the Urbana campus, said  Tuesday that what he calls "cutespeak" is a growing trend aimed at capturing  customers' attention as well as their pocketbooks.  </P> <P> "People are going to be attracted to a place with an outrageous name," he said  in a telephone interview. "One of the ploys of advertising is to have something  that sticks in the consumer's mind."  </P> <P> That ploy seems to work for one of Baron's favorite businesses, The Brick Shirt  House in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.  </P> <P> "Originally it was named because it moved into a red brick building and we sold  T-shirts," said owner Henry Haase. "Everybody laughs when they hear it and they  say, 'You know what it almost sounds like."'  </P> <P> "It was something we figured people definitely would remember," Haase said.  </P> <P> They did. The business quickly caught on and since opening about eight years  ago has expanded and moved to larger quarters. But the store has kept the same  logo -- a little outhouse with a T-shirt for a window.  </P> <P> Dyna Sewer, a Chicago plumbing outfit that calls itself "the rooter giant,"  also says the punny name has helped business.  </P> <P> "You know it does help business because it does attract peoples' attention,"  said dispatcher Dennis Weisenritter Jr.  </P> <P> The company is an example of punmanship expanding into previously uncharted  territory, because cutesy names used to be reserved mostly for restaurants and  bars, Baron said.  </P> <P> "You don't think of plumbers with a trendy name," he said, but there's the San  Francisco-area plumber A Flush Beats A Full House. There's also a mechanic in  the Southwest called Honest Engines and a gynecologist's office in the Chicago  area called Ladies First.  </P> <P> These are among the 100-plus businesses listed in a chapter of Baron's new  book, "Declining Grammar," which examines various aspects of language. The book  was published in Urbana by the National Council of Teachers of English.  </P> <P> Even Baron thinks puns can go too far.  </P> <P> "A good witticism is enjoyable the first time around, and sometimes the second  or third time around," he writes. "But frequent repetition sours even the best  of jokes, and . . . the staying power of funny names is seriously limited."  </P> <P> Some names can even be embarrassing, Baron says. Take the Chicago pet store  called "Let's Pet."  </P> <P> "What's it like to work in a place like that?" Baron asked. "Do you answer the  phone and say, 'Hello, Let's Pet?' Or maybe just have the dogs breathing  heavily?"  </P> <P> An employee who answered the phone saying, "Let's Pet" and identified himself  only as "Bill" said he didn't know how the store got its name, and referred all  questions to the owner, who was not in.  </P> <P> Cutespeak can also be too cute.  </P> <P> That was a worry of Belinda Norris and Barbara Bird when they opened their  Boston caterer, Currier &amp; Chives.  </P> <P> In creating the business 6 1/2 years ago, "We wanted it to be memorable more  than anything else," Norris said. "I think the only objection on Barbara's part  was that (the name) might be too cute."  </P> <P> So far, no one's complained.  </P> <P> "It's been an incredible name for us," she said. "People have really responded  to our name. The phone calls are usually, 'I love your name.' "  </P></p>

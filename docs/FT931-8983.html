			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Business sentiment darkens in EC BUSINESS confidence across the European Community dropped last year to its lowest level since the deep recession of the early 1980s, a European Commission survey published yesterday shows. A picture of continuing economic gloom emerged from capitals across Europe at the same time as the Commission survey revealed scant prospects for early recovery. The Commission's leading economic indicator, which combines calculations for output and confidence, dropped from 96.3 in November to 96.1 in December, equal to its previous low in October 1982. In Paris, a Bank of France survey showed output falling and stocks rising in most sectors last month and depressed demand throughout the business sector. Cars and consumer goods were the worst affected sectors. French exports also slowed and orders were down, reflecting economic instability in Germany and increased competition from other European countries because of the comparative strength of the franc. Some companies put off investment programmes and although employment was stable in trade and services, it fell in construction and manufacturing. Official figures released in Rome yesterday showed a further decline in industrial output, hitting Italy's industrial heartland worst. Output declined 0.6 per cent last year although the full extent of the decline was masked by three extra working days last year compared with 1991. The drop in production began to accelerate after last summer and in December was 2 per cent down against the same period the previous year, according to figures released yesterday by Istat, the national statistics institute. The worst affected sectors were the automotive industry and engineering, down 11.1 per cent and 7.9 per cent. Unions said 145,000 jobs were at risk in the northern industrial region. The Commission survey suggested industrial investment was likely to remain weak throughout this year after failing to achieve downgraded estimates last year. The sentiment indicator would have fallen even further in December, the survey showed, had it not been for the glimmer of recovery in Britain. But latest UK official figures yesterday showed manufacturing output fell in each of the final two quarters of last year. Britain was the only one of the 12 Community members to show an improvement in sentiment last year in the Commission survey. In France and Germany the indicator fell to 97.4 and 95.5, respectively, from November's 97.9 and 96.0. France's indicator is well below October 1982's 98.5. Consumer expectations, both for their own countries and for the economy as a whole, were particularly low in Germany, France, Italy and Portugal.</p>

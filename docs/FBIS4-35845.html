			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Umer Farooq] </F>   [Text] Islamabad -- In a letter addressed to Prime Minister  [PM] Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition Nawaz Sharif has  expressed his inability to meet her on June 5.    The prime minister had invited the leader of the opposition  to tea to discuss the current economic situation in the country.  It was proposed by the PM that the government would take the  opposition into confidence regarding the steps to be taken in  the forthcoming budget.    Nawaz Sharif turning down Bhutto's offer has proposed to  send  two of his colleagues instead to attend the pre-budget briefing.    The leader of the opposition in his letter has also proposed  to discuss vital issues of national importance like Kashmir,  nuclear programme and price hike on the floor of the House.    Following is the text of Nawaz Sharifs letter:    "Dear Prime Minister, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your  letter of May 29, 1994, inviting me for tea on June 5 for a  discussion on the current economic situation.    While thanking you for your invitation, I will be unable to  attend personally, but will be happy to send one or two of my  colleagues to attend the proposed pre-budget briefing.    In the context of your invitation to the leader of the  opposition for a discussion on economic issues. I do wish to  express some views on the relations between the government and  the opposition.    First, I find a wide gap, which is sadly increasing between  your pronouncements and your practices. For instance, I am  being invited for tea at a time where your government's  vilification and victimisation of the opposition has reached new  heights. Our government in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province]  was destabilised through illegal means in a bid to capture total  power in the country. The leaders and workers of PML [Pakistan  Muslim League] and its allied parties are being victimised and  subjected to the worst form of vilification at the hands of the  PPP [Pakistan People's Party]-controlled official and electronic  media.    Second, as I stated in your presence in my speech of the  National Assembly on October 19, 1993, my role and that of my  party remains one of an issue-oriented opposition engaged in  constructive criticism of official policies in the larger  national interest.    I hope you would agree with me that the current security and  economic situation in the country is too grave to leave much  room for scoring political points which seems to be your  government's primary endeavour vis-a-vis the opposition. I am  ready to discuss issues of vital national interest like Kashmir,  the nuclear question and the price hike in the National  Assembly, since, it is most suitable and representative forum  for such discussions".    Sincerely,    (Signed) Mohammad Nawaz Sharif.</p>

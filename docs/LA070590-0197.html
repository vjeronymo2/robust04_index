			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SINATRA: A JOLLY 4TH IN LONDON  </P> <P> Frank Sinatra celebrated American Independence Day by performing in the country  that still sometimes thinks of the United States as "the colonies."  </P> <P> "I asked my agent if it was smart to book an act in London on July 4," the  74-year-old Sinatra said during his show Wednesday night at London Arena.  </P> <P> The audience laughed and applauded warmly as Sinatra broke into the opening  bars of "Strangers in the Night."  </P> <P> For more than an hour, Sinatra sang his favorite tunes, including "My Way,"  "New York, New York" and "A Foggy Day in London Town." He sipped a glass of  bourbon between songs, stopping at one point to toast the bandleader -- his  son, Frank Sinatra Jr.  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Taking care of trouble at t'mill  -A traditional craftsman who rose above the recession AT THE beginning of 1991, David Nicholls' order book was so thin that after 21 years as a millwright he wondered if it was worth carrying on. Local authority cuts, a general lack of cash around and - in common with many other hands-on small businessmen - failing to go out and market his company meant that, for Nicholls, the recession started early. However, even if he had not won an important restoration contract for the Warwick Castle watermill, he still would have been able to keep his team together. Nicholls is at a loss to explain why 1991 - a year most small businesses prefer to forget - turned out to be a year of upturn for him: one of the handful of experienced, full-time professional millwrights in the UK, with profitable work in half-a-dozen counties and an expected turnover of 220,000 (in a business of which he is the sole employee.) Wind, water and to a certain extent gas all play their part in his varied workload. Nicholls, a specialist in historic buildings, was called in to assess Warwick Castle watermill, on the site of a medieval mill, rebuilt as a flour mill in the 18th century. It was adapted in the last century, becoming a comprehensive generating station supplying the castle with electric power generated from water and town gas. Nicholls has worked on 26 windmills and 17 watermills, besides survey work and feasibility studies on another 35 mills. His job at Warwick Castle was to restore and recommission the waterwheel and its supporting mechanism; restore the control mechanisms, the transmission gear, the sluicegate and the massive trash screens; remove the debris that accumulates in the millrace, and be responsible for constructing a huge wrought-iron eel-catching framework which, he believes, will be the only one of its type in the UK This meant liaising with experts: architects, gas and electrical engineers and steel fabricators, as well as elusive wrought- and cast-iron suppliers. He also had to supervise his own team of 14, whose talents include precision engineering as well as traditional millwrighting skills such as joinery, carpentry, timber engineering; blacksmithing, forging and leather work. Such a complex task underlines a modern problem faced by the 'traditional' millwright: how to keep together a large team of experts whose skills - individually vital  - almost certainly will not be needed all the time. One answer is to undertake a diversity of tasks simultaneously - much as a builder does with his workforce. Another is - again like the builder - to employ most workers as sub-contractors and remain able to guarantee sufficient work to ensure that you can call on their skills when needed. Nicholls says: 'In millwrighting, some of those skills are so esoteric that you come under pressure to provide employment for most of the year.' This was the problem when his order book took a dip in 1990. There were jobs that would have provided an existence, but insufficient to provide the Pounds 25,000 a year that Nicholls aims to be able to pay himself, plus a reasonable return for his team. 'The other key to in this business is to know what is going on in the market place. There are so few full-time professional millwrights that this is not a difficult task.' He is trying to hedge against the future, accepting a partnership with a friend and business associate, Alan Smith of Impel Engineering, a four-man precision engineering company based at Woodcote. He also plans to develop the team's conservation work on historic buildings. 'Looking to the future in traditional millwrighting, I don't believe there are any wind- or water-powered flour mills left that one could renovate and turn into economic businesses," Nicholls says. 'But I think there is a future for water mills if they are used for other functions - for example, as small individual paper mills or power sources using renewable energy for other applications, preferably with visitor interest. 'There are any number of conservation bodies and enthusiastic individuals who may require millwrighting work. But so often I get a call from someone who then realises that the job would be hopelessly expensive. I have to explain that in order to retain my team I have to run the operation as a business. Too many millwrighting enterprises fail because they have been run by devotees who have put their enthusiasms before business acumen. 'Sadly, this means that there are still many worthy old buildings that are going to fall down. But there are many amateur groups who successfully restore mills and other historic buildings over many years in their own time, using people like myself to provide professional expertise or components.'

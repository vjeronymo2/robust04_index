			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> EASTON: CHARM TO SPARE, INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH LUNGS  </P> <P> Sporting the body that's no doubt inspired its share of health club  enrollments, Sheena Easton played the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday with an  hour-plus, high-energy workout of every song she's ever recorded. Or maybe it  just seemed that way. Easton, of the tautly muscled torso and  industrial-strength lungs, is an attractively gifted singer with charm to  spare. But her act still contained a lot of bloat.  </P> <P> While Easton (who also plays the Pacific Amphitheatre on Saturday) can outclass  many other pop vocalists on emotive, lung-bursting ballads like "I Wouldn't Beg  for Water" and "For Your Eyes Only," she wasted a lot of time on lightweight  sweat-inducers like "No Deposit, No Return." Easton sounded best when she stuck  to fresher fare, such as "Sugar Walls," a song that earned her Tipper Gore's  brand as a corrupter of youth. "Hey, Dan Quayle's more dangerous to this  country than I am," Easton chortled Friday. And he probably doesn't look nearly  as cute in exercise gear.  </P> <P> Opening act Atlantic Starr's set was marred by new member Portia Martin. Her  over-reaching efforts made you long for the more subtle demeanor of Barbara  Weathers, the singer she recently replaced in the group. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

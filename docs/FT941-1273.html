			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Loral heads Dollars 1.8bn satellite consortium Loral, the US defence electronics and aerospace group, said yesterday it had assembled a group of 'strategic partners' and secondary investors who would provide initial financing for its Dollars 1.8bn satellite communications system known as Globalstar. The group, which includes leading US and European telecommunications operators and manufacturers, is to invest Dollars 275m to begin the construction and launch of 48 satellites providing voice and data communications services to at least 33 countries. The announcement comes at a time of heightened activity by high-technology companies seeking to secure their positions in the market for wireless communications. Earlier this week McCaw, the US cellular operator bought last year by AT&amp;T, and Microsoft, the California-based software concern, disclosed plans to set up a Dollars 9bn system of 840 communications satellites. Globalstar is expected to begin full operations in 1999. Initially the partners would provide services in 33 countries. Later, local telecom providers are to be granted licences to extend Globalstar's reach to other regions. Loral, which will design and build the satellites and control centre, projected a customer base of 2.7m and revenues of Dollars 1.6bn within three years of the system's launch. By the year 2012, subscribers were expected to total 16m. Globalstar would offer 'substantially' lower rates than other satellite-based systems, according to the lead contractor, and its cost to customers would be only a little higher than that offered by cellular providers. The European investors in Globalstar are Alcatel, the French communications systems supplier, and Vodafone, the UK's largest cellular operator. Alcatel, a leading supplier to the international mobile communications market, is responsible for design and delivery of payload modules to be mounted on the satellites. Vodafone, which is investing Dollars 37.5m, will use the system to offer subscribers using special handsets a global roaming capacity and a service in remote regions of countries - such as Australia and South Africa - in which it is building terrestrial networks. Loral said the key to Globalstar's cost competitiveness was its use of an advanced digital transmission technology, developed by Qualcomm, a California high-technology supplier. The system is compatible with existing wireless communications systems.</p>

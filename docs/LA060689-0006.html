			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo County Supervisor Dave Blakely sold cocaine to friends between  1983 and 1985, but no charges will be filed because the three-year statute of  limitations has run out, the San Luis Obispo County district attorney's office  said. Senior district attorney's investigator William Hanley said informants  indicated that Blakely, then a teacher, sold cocaine about 30 times. Blakely,  who has publicly admitted using cocaine, marijuana and other drugs before 1985,  called Hanley's report "character assassination" and denied selling drugs.  </P></p>

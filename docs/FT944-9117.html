			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / EU jobs agency launched The European Commission is today launching a European Union-wide computerised employment agency, designed to assist companies and workers in the creation of an integrated labour market. Known as Eures, the programme will give job seekers specific vacancy details from each member state backed up by information on living and working conditions and problems such as accommodation, contract law and different levels of taxation and social security. The programme, which workers can use in 1995 to search for jobs, has an annual Ecu7.5m (Pounds 5.9m) budget. It is starting modestly with a data bank of around 600 job vacancies from employers seeking recruits beyond their national borders but the organisers hope a growing number of companies will use Eures in their cross-border recruitment plans.</p>

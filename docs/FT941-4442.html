			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Lautro fines life insurer record Pounds 225,000 A record Pounds 225,000 fine has been imposed by Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry, on Aegon life assurance for serious structural failures in its compliance procedures. The penalty is the first to be levied as a result of the second round of routine inspection visits carried out by the regulator. It reflects Lautro's statement last week that there could be 'little excuse' for companies which still had seriously inadequate compliance procedures in spite of the extensive amounts of regulatory guidance that had been issued. The regulatory offences, admitted by Aegon, occurred between May 1990 and March 1993 and related to weaknesses in the internal control systems. As a result of the rule breaches, Aegon has had to review 2,000 files using standards set by an independent firm of accountants and pay some Pounds 10,000 compensation to 65 investors. The payments relate to complaints against the company which it had already admitted but where Lautro believed it had undercompensated customers. Five specific shortcomings listed by Lautro included failures in vetting procedures for appointing some company representatives and 'tied' agents, in checking selling practices, in properly investigating the high levels of policies sold by some sales agents being surrendered early, and in dealing with complaints promptly and properly. Lautro also said that the compliance department had inadequate resources. Mr Peter Baines, Aegon chief executive, said that since the second inspection visit the company had increased its compliance department from six to 11 staff and had appointed a new head of compliance. He said that during 1991 and 1992 the company had expanded rapidly, and admitted that he and colleagues had failed to keep up with the changes in regulatory standards that Lautro was introducing. Although the fine is a new record - about Pounds 45,000 higher than that recently imposed on Legal &amp; General for widespread and systemic weaknesses in compliance - it is likely to be superseded shortly as other cases from the second round of inspection visits are determined. Mr Baines estimated that beyond the fine itself the disciplinary action had cost Aegon almost Pounds 500,000, taking account of its payment of Lautro's costs of Pounds 20,000 as well as the cost of engaging outside advisers and making systems changes. He expressed confidence that all the necessary compensation payments had been made.</p>

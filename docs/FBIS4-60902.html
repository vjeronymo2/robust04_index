			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sazhin report: "It Is Not Subsidies But a Law </F> That Is Needed. `Emergency Meeting' in Russian Federation Press  Committee"]    [Text] Moscow -- Yesterday the Russian Federation Press  Committee held an `emergency meeting' of central and regional  newspaper journalists. Committee Chairman B. Mironov told those  attending about the results of the work of the two-day central  and regional newspaper editors' conference. There was also a  kind of committee report on the work it has done in the last  four months.    As is known, at the end of December and beginning of January  the mass media was in a crisis situation -- typographic service  prices sharply increased because of an revaluation of  polygraphic capacities. This could have led to the closure of  many publications. A solution was nevertheless found.    "We proposed two options for solving the problem," Mironov  said. "The first is to continue subsidizing the press in 1994.  This is not a promising route because not everyone can be given  help. Over 1 trillion rubles would be needed to do this.  Naturally the government does not have that kind of money at the  moment. The second is to draft a law on state protectionism for  the press. This means preferential taxes, rent, and customs  duties. A draft of such a law has been prepared. At a meeting  between mass media leaders and V. Chernomyrdin it was decided to  consider it at a Government Presidium session and then send it  to the State Duma. But for the time being the premier confined  himself to a subsidy of R110.4 billion.    The committee leadership is concerned by the fact that  because of the high cost of polygraphic services many  publications are having to be printed abroad, where prices are  somewhat lower. We are being enticed by the cheese in the  mousetrap. New jobs are being created abroad for Russian money,  while our print shops are closing down and high-caliber  specialists are leaving. In a year or two foreigners will  increase their prices. Russian fugitives will be forced to  return home and will be no better off than before, because by  that time print shops will have become completely run down.</p>

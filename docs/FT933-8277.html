			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Crown Agents to be privatised THE CROWN AGENTS, the government-controlled procurement, technical and financial services agency, is to be privatised as an independent foundation. The move is intended to free the organisation to pursue a wider range of business, operating as a private-sector entity while maintaining the reputation for impartiality and integrity that has made its services attractive to leading aid agencies such as the World Bank, and to national aid programmes such as those of Japan or the European Community. Privatisation of the Crown Agents, which employs 650 people from a headquarters in south London, has been under discussion since December. The organisation, which yesterday welcomed the change, had feared that full-scale privatisation would undermine its credibility as an 'honest broker' in the supply of procurement and financial services. At the same time it will no longer be bound by government policy to act as an agent only for other public-sector entities. It will be able to offer its services to private-sector corporations and be able to tap the financial markets for funds if it wants to expand. The Crown Agents has operated at no cost to the exchequer for several years, with three-quarters of its business financed from sources other than the UK aid programme. Over the 10 years to 1991 it brought procurement orders worth about Pounds 2bn to almost 8,000 UK companies. It manages the equivalent of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) on behalf of 300 governments or public bodies. In the past year it has been active in the reconstruction of eastern and central Europe. In February this year it was appointed by Japan's foreign ministry to procure food for distribution in Russia as part of Japan's first emergency humanitarian aid package to former Soviet republics totalling Dollars 100m.</p>

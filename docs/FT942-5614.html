			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ANS launches Pounds 10m rights Associated Nursing Services, the USM-traded nursing home operator, is asking shareholders for some Pounds 10m to fund the development of more homes. The 1-for-3 rights issue at 255p was accompanied by estimated pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m for the year to March 31. This is about Pounds 500,000 less than expected due to ANS's introduction of the FRS 5 standard on off-balance sheet financing. The company, which changed its accounting policies in 1992 following a judgment by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, has decided to bring the assets and liabilities relating to two homes developed with BES money on to its balance sheet. The Pounds 2.4m development profit will now be reflected in the balance sheet as revaluation reserves. Mr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, said that because the company had a commitment to buy the homes after five years the transaction would be treated as a financing arrangement under FRS 5. The change has the effect of increasing gearing from 84 per cent to 92 per cent at the end of March and reducing pre-tax profits for the year from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.3m. The previous year's profit has been restated from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 1.58m. The change also reduces the effective tax rate so estimated earnings fall by only 2p to 17.4p against a restated 14.3p. It plans to pay a final dividend of 1.5p for a 2p total. Mr Dhandsa said the rights issue, which will cut gearing to about 20 per cent, would enable the company to fund the opening of 700 beds in 1995-96 and 750 beds the year after. Its programme to add another 600 beds in the current year is already fully funded. Most of the new homes will be developed by joint ventures. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Henry Ansbacher. The shares fell 9p to 275p yesterday. ANS also said Mr Robert Upsdell was stepping down as non-executive chairman at the end of October.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Plastic card fraud total tops Pounds 165m CRIMINALS spent Pounds 165m last year through the fraudulent use of plastic cards - the equivalent of a Pounds 5 loss every second. Banks and building societies pick up most of the bill, with a card-holder's liability restricted to Pounds 50 maximum, unless the bank or society can prove that the owner was responsible for the loss. Announcing the figure this week, Richard Allen, chief executive of the Association of Payment Clearing Services, said the loss was 'totally unacceptable'. However, for the first time, the rise in plastic card fraud has at least been contained. Losses were Pounds 60m in 1989, Pounds 122m the following year and Pounds 165.6m in 1991. The fraudulent use of credit and cheque guarantee cards has been taking place against a background of rapid growth in plastic card transactions. There were 400m of these in 1985 and this is forecast to rise to 4bn a year by 2000. There are 80m plastic cards in circulation in the UK. Apacs, which oversees money transmission in the UK, attributes the containment of fraud losses to the launch of its Card Watch campaign last year. This included making the delivery of cards more secure. Apacs estimates that one quarter of fraud losses in 1991 were because of the diversion or interception of the card with the consequent fraud losses peaking at Pounds 3m a month in the spring of 1991. The introduction of registered post, courier services and delivery through branch networks has brought this figure down to an average of Pounds 2m a month lost through non-receipt of cards. Nearly 40 per cent of cards are now delivered through means other than the post. This year the Card Watch campaign is targeting a number of groups to try and raise awareness of plastic card crime. Women are thought to be particularly vulnerable because they keep cards in handbags which can be snatched by criminals or are left hanging temptingly on the back of a seat. Motorists are another target. Apacs estimates that 18 per cent of fraudulently used cards are taken from cars. Many plastic cards also go missing from offices. People can be lured into a false sense of security in the office and tend to leave possessions unguarded. Finally, young people are being targeted so that they 'understand the concept of plastic, its value, its use and the implications of its misuse,' according to Apacs. Card issuers are also spending Pounds 500m as part of a three year anti-fraud investment in new technology to fight crime. This includes testing cardholder identification techniques such as photographs, finger-scanning and digitised signatures.</p>

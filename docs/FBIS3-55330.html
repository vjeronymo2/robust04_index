If U.S. companies see no advantages, they will  not go to Russia," said Anatoliy Porokhovskiy, deputy head of  the Institute of the U.S. and Canada Studies of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, in an interview with ITAR-TASS timed to  coincide with the issue of the "diplomatic courier" bulletin  devoted to the forthcoming visit of the U.S. President Bill  Clinton to Russia.    Porokhovskiy said that "cherishing hopes that the U.S. will  spend money only because Russia needs help is pointless. One  must take into account that whenever the U.S. allocates funds to  support this or that country, primarily, it will give support to  their own companies which will provide this aid, i.e. up to 80  per cent of funds will be realised trough American private  business and only 20 per cent of the allocated amount will  directly reach facilities on the territory of our country."    "What we can hope for is the acceleration of processes which  already began and the creation of a favourable atmosphere for  the American business in Russia. As for the main task, we have  to resolve it by ourselves. In this country, pinning hopes on  the American capital to take us out of the situation in which we  found ourselves will be another illusion, to put it mildly,"  Porokhovskiy said.    "It is necessary to precisely forecast what will be  advantageous to our country and not to confine ourselves to only  one variant in the search for the best option. Apart from  America, there are Europe, Japan and other countries. We should  take a flexible and active economic position which would clearly  show that we come out for the development of relations with all  countries, but on a mutually advantageous basis, which is  accepted in business circles of any country," Porokhovskiy said.</p>

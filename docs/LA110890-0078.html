			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE OFFSPRING FOLLOW LEAD OF POLITICAL PARENTS  </P> <P> It was like father, like son, for a Udall, a Taft and a Mondale. But a Chafee,  a Chiles and a Mosbacher found that a famous last name is no guarantee of  election.  </P> <P> A bumper crop of political offspring ran Tuesday. In Minnesota. Ted Mondale,  son of Walter F. Mondale, ousted Republican state Sen. Phyllis McQuaid in his  first bid for office. Hubert H. Humphrey III won a third term as that state's  attorney general.  </P> <P> Here are other younger-generation winners and losers:  </P> <P>  -- Republican Robert Taft II was elected secretary of state in Ohio, ousting  Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown. He is the great-grandson of President  William Howard Taft and the son and grandson of U.S. senators.  </P> <P>  -- Democrat Tom Udall won a race for attorney general in New Mexico. His  father is former Arizona Rep. and Interior Secretary Stewart Udall.  </P> <P>  -- While his father, Lawton Chiles, was winning the Florida governorship, Ed  Chiles lost his race for a Florida Senate seat to Republican John McKay.  </P> <P>  -- Lincoln D. Chafee, son of Republican Sen. John H. Chafee, was defeated by  Democrat Charles Donovan in his bid for mayor of Warwick, R.I.  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A life of highs and lows - Mike Evans records Welsh choirs. Clive Fewins visits Evans in his idyllic base Deer roaming in the parkland surrounding his office in a Welsh mansion make a curious contrast with the sight of his Pounds 200,000 mobile recording studio parked nearby as Mike Evans ponders on three of the most turbulent years in the 15 year history of his Welsh-based recording business. For the past 10 he has specialised in recording Welsh choirs and issued several hundred releases. In 1989 he spent Pounds 100,000 upgrading his mobile studio to cater for the increasing amount of subcontracted sound recording work he was doing for television companies. At the same time he moved the two-man company from Swansea to its present home: the National Trust-owned 17th century Dinefwr House, set in 450 acres presided over by a medieval ruined castle, perched on the edge of the Towy valley above the town of Llandeilo in west Wales. The move coincided with a downturn in the subcontract work. 'With recession-led cutbacks location productions were the first to be hit. No sooner had my expansion plans begun to bear fruit when the subcontract work came to a juddering halt,' said Evans, the sole director of Black Mountain Records. Fortunately Evans had a good track record. With the aid of some first-rate freelance technical staff he had recorded Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Dennis O'Neill and the now 'retired' boy soprano Aled Jones, at locations as diverse as the Royal Albert Hall, Glyndebourne and opera houses in Italy. He also had a steady turnover and a Pounds 200,000 overdraft facility. What could have been a very shaky period turned out to be no more than a blip. But when he diversified again, in late 1992, with a tie-up with the world's largest mobile facility company - Fleetwood Mobiles - the arrangement came to nothing when Fleetwood went into voluntary liquidation. Evans ended up with the Fleetwood name, a mobile studio, complete with Pounds 60,000 advanced mixing desk, sports the Fleetwood livery. 'Perhaps the main lesson I learnt is that you should take great care before expanding in too many other directions when you have a good core business,' said Evans, 43. 'It really is a case of the old adage: 80 per cent of your business will come from 20 per cent of your customers.' In the case of the choirs this certainly proved true. 'With the recession and most choirs representing a cross-section of their communities one might have expected them to be among the first organisations to be affected by the adverse conditions, especially in former pit villages,' Evans said. 'However the opposite has been the case and we have just enjoyed our busiest year yet, with a turnover of Pounds 200,000.' He attributes this to good groundwork in the early years, plus the skill of former BBC enginer Geoff Atkins, a freelance available whenever Black Mountain needs him for an important recording. 'From the outset I knew that gaining a reputation with the 500 or so choirs in Wales would take a long time,' He said. 'Recording used to be regarded with very mixed feelings by choirs, mainly through bad experiences and advice. I like to think Black Mountain has pioneered a fresh approach to the art of choral recording that has won us many converts over the years. 'Initially I had to offer every possible incentive to gain clients - even to offering six months settlement terms on unsold stock, which used to give my bank manager palpitations. On average, the return in those early days was only about 5 per cent after tax. Nowadays I expect a typical deal to involve about 1,000 cassettes or CDs, with the choir agreeing to sell a minimum of 500. The standard price is Pounds 5.99. I look for a return of around 20 per cent after tax. We are expecting to turn over Pounds 250,000 this year. 'The choral world in Wales is like one big club,' Evans said. 'Choirs are probably the last bastions of community spirit in most areas. People sing for enjoyment and their camaraderie is overwhelming. Black Mountain Records is an extension of that tradition, and great fun to run. 'Although there is some concern over the future of the choral tradition in Wales, as long as the communities are there I believe the choirs are an integral part of them and will stand the test of time.' Evans is steering the Black Mountain road train towards England. 'I have taken the truck to Scandinavia and Italy, so why not England - or for that matter, the rest of the UK?' he said. 'There are more than 2,700 choirs in mainland Britain so we only at present service 20 per cent of the market.' Last month Evans completed repayments of a Pounds 40,000, 8 per cent loan from the Welsh Development Agency. He took the loan in 1989 for vehicle refurbishment. The balance of Pounds 60,000 was met by his bankers, Lloyds, and has already been repaid. By late May he should be the owner of a company worth around Pounds 500,000 with no debts and only one full-time employee - assistant Lee Lewis. 'It will be a nice position to be in after working in a financial straitjacket for the past three years,' Evans said. 'With an increasing number of bookings in England and the TV work starting to gain momentum again things are looking good.' Evans and his landlords, The National Trust in Wales, plan to turn Dinefwr park into a centre for music, staging a variety of summer open air musical events. 'Wales is the land of song, yet the range of music offered to summer tourists has been very limited. We intend to do somethig to try to overcome this,' he said. 'Llandeilo is an ideal location for this. It is close to the M4 and on the A40 - the main artery for tourists from the Midlands to Pembrokeshire. I am not only looking forward to recording more choirs, but also towards helping promote the Welsh musical tradition to visitors.'

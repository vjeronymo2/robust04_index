			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MSC: "Test for Hereditary Cholesterol </F> Defect"]    [Text] The TNO [Netherlands Organization for Applied  Natural Science Research] has developed a test to determine  whether a high cholesterol level is caused by a genetic defect.  The defect in question is located in the gene close to the  receptor responsible for cholesterol elimination [ldl-receptor]  and causes an hereditary form of hypercholesteremia. The test  is a combination of pcr [polymerase chain reaction] and  gelelectrophoresis. Dr. Paola Lombardi from the TNO Institute  for Studies on Aging and Vascular Diseases, who obtained her  Ph.D. with this research, claims the test is nearly flawless.  According to her, the test is not yet being used, but will be  introduced in hospitals in the long term. The patients' veins  have been constricting since birth, hence the importance of  knowing whether hypercholesteremia is hereditary.</p>

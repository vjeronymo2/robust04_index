Exclusivo Program listeners, we have made direct  contact with Angola. To be more specific, we have made direct  contact with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina who is at  the Presidente Meridian Hotel in Angola. Robaina arrived in  Angola yesterday as guest of the Angolan Foreign Ministry.    Comrade foreign minister, what are you and your delegation  doing on this visit to five African countries. We know that you  started your tour in Ghana on 11 January, that you are in  Angola, and that you will be visiting other African countries.  This is a live interview on Radio Rebelde's Exclusivo Program  in Havana.    [Robaina] This visit to Angola is part of a tour that began  in Ghana. Our visit to Angola ends tonight; as a matter of fact  the visit to Angola will end in a few hours with a news  conference we will hold at the airport prior to departure. We  are leaving in the morning for Zimbabwe. From there we will go  to Zambia and then Namibia. After Namibia we will be headed  back to Cuba. We are all anxious to be back home.    This tour, as we have said, is also an offensive we have  launched. We have come here to explain our situation. We have  come here to explain the problems our people are confronting and  how we are solving them. We carried out a similar task in Latin  America and in the United States as well.[as heard] We are here  at the invitation of several African foreign ministries.    [Mejia] I see.    [Robaina] On an African tour we could not overlook a visit  to Angola. Angola is very important for Cuba. Strong ties and  historic ties link us to Angola.    We have fulfilled a broad program. Our greatest success,  what I consider to be the most important, is that the  governments, the press, and the solidarity associations have  given us the necessary space to talk about what we are doing in  Cuba and what motivates us to resist and to seek solutions to  the problems we confront. Above all, this visit has allowed us  to learn first hand of what is going on in our Africa. I am not  saying my Africa because it is our Africa as a result of the  ties that join us. It has been hard work. However, the work our  people are doing back home is even harder than the work we are  doing. No number of meetings, interviews, can compare to the  work our people are doing at home.    [Mejia] Foreign Minister Robaina, you are back in Angola. In  1989 you were in Lubango and (?Kahama). Does this visit mean  something special for you?    [Robaina] Yes. This visit is special for Cuba, the Foreign  Ministry, and for me in particular. I cannot forget that the  most important part of what I have learned in life was learned  in this country. I am speaking of my military life. The  experiences I shared in Angola with Cuban and Angolan youths  have a very special meaning for me. I have seen many of the  people I met during those difficult and complex times. This is  something that one does not forget that easily, and something  that I do not plan to forget. Quite the contrary.    [Mejia] Comrade foreign minister, I know there is a six-  hour time difference between Havana and Angola. At this very  moment it is 0124 in Angola. Please tell us how the Angolan  press has covered your visit to Angola.    [Robaina] The press is a faithful reflection of our visit. I  have found much understanding and respect. Many people are  interested in learning what is happening in Cuba. I think that  it is important that our people know that we have many friends  here. The situation the Angolans are confronting domestically is  very difficult, and they admit it. However, they trust that  they can overcome these problems. The Angolan people, leaders,  and the president himself have wished the best for the people of  Cuba. I am leaving Angola much more convinced that our  commitment is not only with the 10 million inhabitants of our  island; our commitment is also with many honest men and women of  this world -- honest men and women on this continent and in  this country. They respect us. They agree that Cuba, despite  the difficult times it is experiencing, should be allowed to  speak and be heard.    [Mejia] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Robaina.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In compliance with the GATT agreement, Thailand will  not promulgate new laws or regulations to discriminate against  foreign nationals in the service industry. Minister of Finance  Tharin Nimmanhemin said that it is a basic commitment among  member countries signing the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade. Minister Tharin said that liberalization of service  industry is different from other businesses. He said it  involves licenses issued for businesses. He said the Thai  Government plans to allow aliens to enjoy the same rights as  Thai nationals in doing business in Thailand. He said the  Finance Ministry will allow over five licensees of the Bangkok  International Bank Facilities, or BIBF, to transform into  commercial banks by 1997.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, June 23 (TASS) -- Russia is responsible for  the CIS countries' development. For a long time Russia was a  force that united the former republics of the USSR, and it has  no moral right to disregard their problems now.    This was the leitmotiff of the hearings on international  cooperation in support of peace in conflict zones on CIS  territory organized by a number of State Duma committees,  including on CIS affairs, on relations with compatriots abroad,  on defence and international affairs.    Representatives of CIS member-countries and Western  diplomats  in Moscow showed keen interest in the conference because of the  urgency of its themes.    Russian scientists, historians and diplomats who took part  in  the hearings noted that Russia was the only force capable of  resolving armed conflicts in CIS countries. They said  international organisations, such as the United Nations and the  Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, were not very  helpful. Therefore Russia has to move quickly and resolutely to  put an end to armed conflicts and arrange for peaceful  negotiations between the warring parties.</p>

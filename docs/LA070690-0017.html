			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> STONE-AGE COMEDY IN 'JETSONS'  </P> <P> Like the two-headed flatworms perverse biology students raise in high school  labs, the animated "Jetsons: The Movie" (citywide) tries to go in two  directions at once and goes nowhere instead.  </P> <P> Writer Dennis Marks and producer/directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera  can't seem to decide whether they're making a with-it musical for teen-agers or  re-creating the ingenuous humor of a '60s TV show, and don't do either very  well.  </P> <P> "The Jetsons" is an odd vehicle for a feature: The original show flopped in  prime time in 1962, although it proved popular on Saturday morning. The theme  song is a camp favorite and the name of the Jetsons' dog (Astro), is a trivia  game stickler. But the antics of George, Jane, Judy and Elroy owed too much to  sitcoms like "The Donna Reed Show" and "Hazel" to be particularly memorable.  Their Futurelux world dominated by an omnipresent, benevolent technology seems  hopelessly dated in 1990 -- as does a family where Dad goes to work and the  women go shopping.  </P> <P> When Mr. Spacely moves George to his troubled satellite factory, Judy is  heartbroken at leaving her boyfriend, but perks up as soon as she learns the  new space community includes a mall. The minimal plot thickens when the Jetsons  learn the factory is destroying the homes of the Grungies, a nauseatingly cute  tribe of furry little critters who look like a cross between George Lucas'  Ewoks and Gizmo in "Gremlins." (They also look suspiciously like something  designed for a merchandising tie-in and/or spinoff TV show.) The film ends with  a pat resolution and some leaden platitudes about ecology.  </P> <P> Most of the original vocal cast has been reunited, including Penny Singleton  (Jane), George O'Hanlon (George), Jean Vanderpyl (Rosie the Robot) and Don  Messick (Astro). Mel Blanc recorded Mr. Spacely's lines shortly before his  death, and Patric Zimmerman fills in as Elroy for the late Daws Butler.  </P> <P> In an appeal to the potentially lucrative youth audience, Janet Waldo has been  replaced by pop star Tiffany as the voice of Judy. A two-minute fantasy set to  her song "You and Me," obviously designed for MTV, features some striking  animation from the Kurtz and Friends studio. Its bold colors, fluid motions and  kicky graphics make the limited animation in the rest of the G-rated film seem  as exciting as a flat Perrier.  </P> <P> Realistic, three-dimensional computer-generated images of the space city and  asteroid factory make the flat, drawn characters look as though they stumbled  in from another film. Their prominent shadows give them an odd, plastic  texture, but don't help them fit into the computerized world.  </P> <P> For all their efforts to appear hip (the characters constantly give each other  high fives), the film makers remain mired in a kidvid mentality. An  anthropomorphized dog growling "I love you, George" might have seemed funny in  1962, but it isn't going to panic kids who watch "The Simpsons" and "Beverly  Hills Cop."  </P></p>

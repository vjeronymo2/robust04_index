This proposal would require inspections to detect discrepancies of certain main landing gear (MLG) retract actuator bracket retaining bolts; replacement of discrepant parts; installation of washers, if necessary; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. This proposal is prompted by reports of extension and retraction problems on the MLG, due to loose retract actuator brackets on the MLG shock struts. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a loose retract actuator bracket from interfering with the MLG shock strut trunnion support, which could result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;234&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The Luftfartsverket advises that several operators have reported extension and retraction problems on the main landing gear (MLG) due to loose retract actuator brackets on the MLG shock struts. These difficulties were caused by the shearing at the head of one of the two bracket retaining bolts. Laboratory investigations have revealed that the fracture of the retaining bolt has been attributed to fatigue or hydrogen embrittlement (corrosion). There have also been some cases where the retaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bolt for the bonding strap had not been installed with a proper amount of washers. This can reduce pre-tension of the bolt and allow the bracket to move and apply excessive load on the retaining bolts, and can lead to fatigue fracture of the retract actuator bracket retaining bolt. A loose retract actuator bracket, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could interfere with the MLG shock strut trunnion support, and subsequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in the inability of the MLG to extend or retract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Saab has issued Service Bulletin 340&hyph;32&hyph;094, dated October 29, 1993, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion, cracking, or damage of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and to determine if the nut is bottoming the threads of certain other bolts; replacement of any corroded, cracked, or damaged bolt; and the installation of washers, if any nut is found bottoming the threads. The service bulletin also describes procedures for a one-time visual and magnaflux inspection during MLG overhaul to detect any scored, cracked, or out-of-tolerance condition of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retainer bolts; replacement of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrepant bolt; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain nose landing gear (NLG) trunnion pin cross bolts. The Luftfartsverket classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Swedish Airworthiness Directive (SAD) No. 1&hyph;061, dated November 15, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Sweden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Luftfartsverket has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the Luftfartsverket, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to detect corrosion, cracking, or damage of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and to determine if the nut is bottoming the threads of certain other bolts; replacement of any discrepant bolt; and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of washers, if any nut is found bottoming the threads. The proposed AD would also require a one-time visual and magnaflux inspection during MLG overhaul to detect any scored, cracked, or out-of-tolerance condition of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retainer bolts; replacement of any discrepant bolt; and eventual replacement of certain MLG retract actuator bracket retaining bolts and certain NLG trunnion pin cross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bolts. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DUKAKIS' BOMB TALK WAS NO JOKE  </P> <P> Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' joke about a bomb on a USAir plane and a White House  aide could have landed the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate in trouble  with airport security.  </P> <P> Dukakis was boarding a USAir flight from Logan International Airport to  Washington on Sunday evening when he spotted White House aide and political foe  Ron Kaufman.  </P> <P> According to WBZ-TV in Boston, Dukakis reportedly joked about checking Kaufman  and his baggage for a bomb.  </P> <P> Such remarks about airline safety, even in jest, are prohibited by federal law  and should be reported to authorities, a Federal Aviation Administration  spokesman said.  </P> <P> "He apparently made some comment that caused the USAir agent to check with his  supervisor to see if security should be notified," said USAir spokesman Dave  Shipley.  </P> <P> Shipley said the supervisor recognized the governor and let him go.  </P> <P> "That was an error in judgment," Shipley said. "He should have been detained  and questioned if in fact he made some remark" about carrying a bomb.  </P></p>

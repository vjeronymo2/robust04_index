			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO CURTAIL IN-FLIGHT NEWSCASTS DEFENDED  </P> <P> Re Howard Rosenberg's Dec. 18 column, "CNN, American Airlines: All the News  That Fits," in which he criticized a proposed agreement that major air  disasters not be reported during in-flight newscasts purchased from Cable News  Network:  </P> <P> Rosenberg, along with almost every other journalist in America, is paranoid  about censorship. If American Airlines does not want to buy a product, it does  not have to. If I choose to not attend a showing of "Batman" I don't have to.  Neither is censorship.  </P> <P> Censorship is when the police power of the state is used to keep its citizens  from hearing or reading certain things judged by the authorities to not be in  the authorities' best interest.  </P> <P> Censorship is when American Airlines stops Rosenberg from getting published,  not when American Airlines picks and chooses what products to buy.  </P> <P> FRANK AYLESWORTH  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

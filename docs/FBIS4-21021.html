			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: "Narcotics Gangster Sentenced Under </F> False Name"]    [Text] Cocaine Gang: The man who was pointed  out as a gang leader was arrested in Vridlose and jailed  yesterday. He would not talk to the police. The chief of  narcotics thinks he can be held for abuse.    A Colombian drug gangster was able to be sentenced in  Denmark  under a false name. Yesterday, as the fingered leader of a  recently detected cocaine gang, he was again brought before  Copenhagen's magistrate court.    Gustavo Hernando Barrero Rubiano is what he called himself  when he was arrested in February 1992 in a hotel room where a  pistol with live ammunition was hidden together with a stash of  cocaine. This name also stands on his magistrate court sentence  of three years in prison from 2 September 1992. Yesterday, when  he came before the judge and was jailed for being behind the  smuggling and the attempted smuggling of at least 45 kilos of  cocaine, he was called Guillermo Rojas Ferro. He directed the  operation from the prison in Vridslose, where he also hired a  few of his couriers.    BERLINGSKE TIDENDE learned that he consistently called  himself "Gustavo," and both his fellow prisoners and the members  of the gang know him as "Gestapo." He refuses to talk to the  police about the charges in what is up to now Denmark's largest  cocaine case involving smuggling into the country in bowling  balls, computer monitors, and hollowed-out books and ropes. A  34-year-old Chilean-born woman was also arrested yesterday,  charged with having brought messages to and from the prison  while a 27-year-old man was being released. Twelve persons have  now been arrested in the case, which would hardly have gotten  this far if Ferro had not been able to communicate so freely in  a Danish prison.    Narcotics Chief Erik Bjorn has no patent solution for the  problem. But about the struggle against narcotics he says: "It  is time for a debate on the failed narcotics policy. We work to  catch as many drug dealers and smugglers as possible. The  country must make a collective preventative effort, among other  things, by working in schools and clubs to prevent young people  from becoming drug addicts. And then the treatment system must  take over the present addicts. They must be transferred so that  they will immediately get effective treatment. If this happens,  then I think that with everyone's help we can stop the abuse and  the extensive resulting crime."</p>

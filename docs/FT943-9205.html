			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Shell optimistic despite 7% fall: Recovering demand and higher oil prices relieve disappointing figures Royal Dutch/Shell yesterday sought to offset news of a sharper than expected decline in second quarter profits with encouraging comments on the outlook for oil prices this year. Demand was increasing more rapidly than expected and prices could remain above second quarter levels for the rest of the year, the group said. The statement contrasted with Shell's warning in February that it expected oil prices to remain depressed. Although crude prices were on average 12 per cent lower during the second quarter at about Dollars 16.05 a barrel, by the end of the period they had recovered to levels similar to those achieved in the same period of 1993. Disrupted production in Nigeria had helped prices improve further since June. 'The signs are more optimistic,' the company said. Shell announced a 7 per cent drop in profits on a replacement cost basis - which excludes the effects of inventory changes - to Pounds 574m for the second quarter. Interim profits were 4 per cent lower at Pounds 1.52bn. The second quarter decline was due to lower oil prices and a sharp drop in refining margins, as well as charges and currency losses totalling a net Pounds 211m. This included a Pounds 322m gain on a property sale in Hong Kong. Stripping out the Pounds 133m net exceptional charges and Pounds 78m in currency losses, underlying profits fell by 12 per cent to Pounds 785m. This was some Pounds 100m less than had been expected, and Shell's shares in London were marked down by 12p to 718p. Analysts said they were disappointed at the performance of the exploration and production business, which saw profits fall by 43 per cent to Pounds 233m in the quarter. 'BP and Chevron managed to offset oil price weakness with cost reduction,' said Mr Fergus McLeod of brokers NatWest Securities. 'That does not seem to be coming through at Shell.' Shell began to cut costs later than its rivals, but is acknowledged to be an efficient company with less fat to cut. The upstream business was hit by a higher tax rate as well as the low oil price and exceptional items. This offset the benefits of higher volumes in both oil and gas. Shell increased its net crude production and natural gas sales outside the US by 8 per cent. Downstream activities such as refining and marketing were also affected, returning profits 10 per cent lower at Pounds 455m. Refining margins were particularly weak in the Far East - in Singapore they fell almost 40 per cent. The chemicals business returned to the black with profits of Pounds 92m before exceptional charges of Pounds 162m. After the charges - mainly related to a fire in a US petrochemicals plant, property losses and asset sales - losses were more than halved at Pounds 70m. Shell said the division was showing encouraging growth, with volumes 11 per cent ahead in the quarter. Metals incurred a Pounds 108m loss, reflecting costs related to the Pounds 1.14bn sale of Billiton to Gencor. Shell is planning to float its Australian mining assets and sell its Chilean copper mine this year. These disposals are expected to more than offset the metals loss. Interim dividends for Royal Dutch and Shell Transport, which account for 60 and 40 per cent of the group's profit respectively, will be announced on September 15. Lex, Page 14</p>

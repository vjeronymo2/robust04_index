			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Wellcome leads lobby over pay A GROUP of large British companies led by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical company, is to lobby urgently for changes in legislation on profit-related pay after a sudden reversal of Inland Revenue practice last month. In an unexpected statement in July, the Revenue issued a statement of practice that disqualified from tax relief profit-related pay schemes using certain formulae that it had previously allowed. Mr Neville Machin, Wellcome's group employee relations manager, expressed frustration that the Revenue's plans will bar its scheme, which it has drawn up after several years' negotiations with the Revenue. Wellcome had used a formula to calculate its scheme, which was geared to rewarding improved rather than static performance. Although tax relief for the current year is not affected, the scheme will in future be disqualified. Employees in approved schemes can receive the lower of Pounds 4,000 or 20 per cent of their salary tax-free. The number of approved schemes more than doubled from 1,277 to 2,597 in the year to March 1992.</p>

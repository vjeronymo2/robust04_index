			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Treatt shows 13% advance to Pounds 571,000 Pre-tax profits of Treatt, the USM-quoted supplier, blender and distiller of essential oils and aromatic chemicals, advanced by 13 per cent, from Pounds 506,000 to Pounds 571,000, in the six months to March 31. The result was struck on turnover up by Pounds 2.18m to Pounds 7.41m. Earnings per share improved to 3.94p (3.49p) and the interim dividend is again 1p. Mr Norman Talbot, finance director, said RC Treatt, the principal operating subsidiary, performed satisfactorily, with sales volumes up by 40 per cent and net profits improving by 13 per cent. However, about a third of the increase in turnover was of an exceptional nature and unlikely to be repeated, he added, while the improvement in last year's second half at the Florida Treatt operation had not been sustained in the current year.</p>

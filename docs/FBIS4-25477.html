			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, June 9 (CNS) -- In improving its economy,  Fujian, a resources-hungry province in south China, places its  hopes on coastal cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou and  Zhangzhou as well as inland towns of Nanping and Sanming where  new hi-tech industries are fast developing.    --The province last year saw an output value of RMB  [renminbi] 5.3 billion earned from such an industry by  enterprises across the province including those in its  state-level new hi-tech industrial development zones. This  industry has now become a new driving force for the economic  development of the province.    --Some 49 new hi-tech enterprises operating in the province  have developed a batch of new products covering electronic  information, biological engineering,  optical-machinery-electrical industry and new materials,  achieving sound economic results.    --The new hi-tech industrial development zones in Fuzhou and  Xiamen have been included in the 52-strong list of state-level  zones of this kind across the country. The Cangshan Scientific  and Technological Garden in Fuzhou has seen ten factory  buildings under construction, and eight enterprises engaging in  new hi-tech industry have been set up there with annual output  value expected to be RMB 130 million, the annual output value of  the Hongshan Scientific and Technological Garden now is put at  over RMB 300 million while in the Mawei Scientific and  Technological Garden, a batch of construction items including  the second-phase construction project for the New World Computer  Company have been completed.    --The Torch Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone in Xiamen  has  become a keen site for foreign investment with 31 foreign-funded  enterprises being approved in the zone. Their total investment  has reached RMB 260 million and their output value last year was  RMB 500 million. With the support of the State Science and  Technology Commission, the China Institute of Science and  Technology and a shopping mall selling scientific and  technological products have been established in Xiamen City.    --The Quanzhou Hi-Tech Corridor has also seen its business  developing very fast. The Shishi Hi-Tech Photo Equipment  Research Institute has developed stereoscopic colour enlargers  whose quality ranks first in the country. In addition,  preparations for the construction of the China (Shishi) Garments  Hi-Tech Development Centre and three province-level hi-tech  industrial development zones in Zhangzhou, Nanping and Sanming  are now under way.    --The province has planned to cultivate 100 new hi-tech  enterprises and develop 80 new hi-tech products this year.</p>

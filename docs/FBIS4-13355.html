			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 18 Apr (INA)--Ahmad Yahya al-'Imad, member  of the Standing Committee of the General People's Congress and  adviser to the Presidential Council in Yemen, has stressed that  President Saddam Husayn is one of the Arab nation's immortal  symbols and embodies the Arab nation's hopes and aspirations for  a bright future.    In a statement to INA, al-'Imad said that he conveyed a  written message from Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to  his brother President Saddam Husayn on the close bilateral  relations, the developments of the Yemeni crisis, and the  efforts being exerted to overcome it.    He added that President Saddam Husayn had a distinguished  role in the realization of the the Yemeni unity, and that his  excellency is still extremely interested in safeguarding this  Yemeni Arab achievement. This, he said, is because the failure  of this unity is a failure for the Arab nation's hopes to  achieve Arab unity.    Ahmad Yahya al-'Imad denounced the continued unjust blockade  imposed on the children, women, and elderly of Iraq. He pointed  out that the imposition of this blockade is considered a serious  violation of the human rights about which U.S. imperialism and  its allies brag.</p>

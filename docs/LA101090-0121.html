			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> RAMS UNLIKELY TO OBTAIN ALLEN  </P> <P> Despite another round of weekend rumors, there appears to be little chance  running back Marcus Allen will become a Ram before next Tuesday's trading  deadline.  </P> <P> The Rams are ranked first in the NFL on offense, last on defense.  </P> <P> They already have three former No. 1 draft choices in the backfield --  Cleveland Gary, Curt Warner and Gaston Green. Gary gained 92 yards in 20  carries as the starting tailback against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday.  </P> <P> The most recent rumor concerning Allen and the Rams was reported by NBC  correspondent and Boston Globe reporter Will McDonough, a long-time confidant  of Raider owner Al Davis.  </P> <P> The Raiders had reportedly offered Allen to the Rams last summer for linebacker  Kevin Greene, then a holdout. The latest report has the Raiders reducing the  offer to a first-round draft choice.  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers might also be interested in trading for Allen, with  running back Roger Craig's status uncertain.  </P> <P> Raider Coach Art Shell said he is not sure how long the team will be without  linebacker Ron Burton, who suffered a knee injury on the opening kickoff of the  38-24 loss to the Bills in Buffalo Sunday night.

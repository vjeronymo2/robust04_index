			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Afsane Bassir Pour: "France Has Altered Its UN </F> Draft Resolution To Take Account of Russian and American  Objections"]    [Text] New York (United Nations) -- A resolution on Bosnia  is due to be put to the vote in the UN Security Council in the  next few days at France's initiative. However, it differs  considerably from the initial French plan.    France would have liked the United Nations to appoint a  veritable "administrator" for the city of Sarajevo. This idea  was curbed from the start by the Americans who regarded it as an  attack on the Bosnian Government's sovereignty. The modified  plan now proposes the appointment of a "high-level civilian  official" who, in "close cooperation" with the Bosnian  Government, would have the mission of restoring essential public  services in the Sarajevo area.    Russia's objections to the French plan were clearly more  extensive. With regard to Sarajevo, Moscow opposed the UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force] taking control of certain road systems and  intersections, because, they said, their soldiers could thus be  in a situation of confrontation with the Serbian militias.    Russia also opposed the resolution referring to Chapter 7 of  the UN Charter (which makes provision for the use of force) and  reaffirming the NATO ultimatum. Finally, it refused to allow  the use of force to be mentioned with regard to remedying the  situation in three other Bosnian cities which France proposed  turning into new "security areas." On Monday [28 February],  Moscow informed the French delegation that such a plan would  meet with a Russian veto.    However, following Franco-Russian contacts, the deadlock was  broken on Tuesday and Moscow no longer intends to oppose Paris'  efforts. According to Russian diplomats to the United Nations,  Moscow's initial "reservations" were "bureaucratic and not  political."    A compromise document was due to circulate among the other  members of the Council on Thursday. It calls on all sides to  "achieve with UN assistance" the full freedom of movement for  the civilian population of Sarajevo and on the secretary general  to appoint a civilian official "immediately and for an interim  period."    Taking account of the U.S.-British initiative announced on  Tuesday by Bill Clinton and John Major, the French resolution  calls on Mr. Butrus-Ghali to create a fund of voluntary  contributions for Sarajevo "with a view to promoting a return to  normal life." Finally, the French plan asks the secretary  general to draw up a report within 10 days on the "feasibility  and means of extending" the protection provided for the  "security areas" to Maglaj, Mostar, and Vitez.    Before the vote, Washington could still ask for amendments  to  curb the authority of the civilian official who will be  appointed for Sarajevo, making him "a simple coordinator, or  even a chief engineer" whereas Paris wants him to have "real  powers." According to General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR  commander in chief in Bosnia, the extension of the security  areas to three other cities requires the deployment of 2,000 to  3,000 additional soldiers. It seems possible to solve this  problem because, according to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, Malaysia,  Bangladesh, and Pakistan have agreed to send "several hundred"  soldiers to Bosnia.</p>

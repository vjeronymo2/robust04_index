			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Zaire suspends bank chief Zaire's new government, alarmed by the collapse of the national currency, ordered the immediate suspension of the central bank governor and an audit of the Bank of Zaire. The decision to suspend governor Mr Ndiang Kaboul, an appointee of President Mobutu Sese Seko who had held the post since February, was announced on national television by Mr Masegabio Nzanzu, information minister, at the end of a six-hour cabinet meeting. He cited what he described as serious failings and Mr Ndiang's violation of government instructions over the running of the bank. In the past couple of weeks billions of newly-minted Zaire notes have flooded on to the black market, sending the zaire into a steep slide against foreign currencies and forcing steep rises in the price of consumer goods. Launched last October at the rate of three to the dollar, the zaire has fallen to 1,300.</p>

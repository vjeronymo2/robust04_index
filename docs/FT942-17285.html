			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / ITN signs video news release deal Independent Television News has signed an exclusive deal with Medialink, the world's largest supplier of video news releases, the television equivalent of press releases which are distributed around the world by satellite. Medialink will use the camera crews and technical facilities of ITN. The agreement is with News Services, the facilities arm of ITN, and ITN journalists will not be involved. Video news releases for television stations go out virtually daily. Reuters Television, part of the international news and information group, has operated such a service for a number of years. Medialink, which will continue to produce the videos filmed by ITN crews, has a regular agreement with the Department of Transport to produce video releases. Material from the video release of a recent transport safety campaign was used on the BBC Six O'Clock News and regional ITV stations, thereby reaching an audience estimated at more than 41m. Services range from a simple video release through electronic press kits to 'satellite media tours' - interviews with television stations all over the world - and video conferences. To produce a video news release and distribute it all over Europe and the US could cost around Pounds 15,000.</p>

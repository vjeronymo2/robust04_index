			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rosyth's 'despairing cry' ruffles MoD - The last-minute Trident refit bid THE IMPACT of Rosyth Royal Dockyard's last-minute bid to halve the investment cost for refitting Trident submarines - and thus to stop the business going to Devonport - came as much from its timing as from the radical nature of the proposal. Rosyth proposed in effect to carry out different parts of each refit in different docks. By doing that, it offered for Pounds 60m a facility for which the government was once ready to pay Pounds 450m. That was the cost of the giant covered dock complex originally due to be built for the submarines at Rosyth. Defence officials grumbled that it was 'totally unreasonable' for such a plan to be submitted out of the blue after months of discussion. Rosyth said it started submitting details of the new plan drawn up by its project team last week, and argued that it met all the requirements. Captain Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships and a former nuclear submarine commander, said: 'In theory it is feasible. In practical terms it would certainly create huge organisational difficulties. It sounds like the despairing cry of a lost cause.' The Pounds 60m investment proposed by Rosyth would go on installations and support for removing and replacing the nuclear fuel from submarines' reactors at its existing emergency docking facility. This facility is in effect a large lock, mostly left empty but sometimes used for tests and other purposes. It was recently upgraded at a cost of Pounds 20m for Trident vessels. These are much bigger than their Polaris predecessors. Most of the work would be done at other docks. But, as there would be no nuclear fuel on board, nothing would need to be spent to bring them up to modern nuclear safety standards - a large part of the cost in other proposals for using existing docks, put forward by both Rosyth and Devonport. The process would also allow greater use of nuclear refuelling facilities, which are used for only a short part of the two years taken to refit a nuclear submarine. Rosyth said the plan capitalised on investment already made. 'We have had an emergency dock for 25 years for Polaris, and it has never been used,' it said. Devonport has no equivalent, but one is included in its bid for Trident work and it said it could produce a 'copycat' proposal if required. Devonport said a fresh round of bidding based on these new premises could delay a decision for several more months, jeopardising the target date for refitting HMS Vanguard, the first of the submarines carrying Trident missiles. The date is confidential, but Rosyth has said publicly its proposal would enable the first Vanguard to start refitting in September 1999. One question is the potential risk in exploiting the emergency dock. Taking fuel out requires cutting into the pressurised hull to get at the reactor. It also requires erecting special structures in and around the submarine to handle the used fuel, the most dangerous part of the process. Experts raised doubts whether Rosyth could guarantee being able to make the dock ready to handle an emergency in the required time - believed to be about two weeks - especially if problems arose in fuel-handling.</p>

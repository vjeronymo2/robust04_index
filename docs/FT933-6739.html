			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Esso Singapore to upgrade refining - Italian company wins contract ESSO SINGAPORE, part of Exxon Corporation, has announced that it will invest SDollars 380m (Pounds 157m) to upgrade its oil refining operations in Singapore. Foster Wheeler Italiana, based in Milan, has been awarded the contract to build a 15,000 barrel per day hydroprocessing unit at Esso's 230,000 bpd Pulau Ayer Chawan refinery. The new unit will upgrade lower value, high sulphur vacuum gas oil to produce low sulphur diesel oil, naphtha and low sulphur vacuum gas oil. Esso said that demand in the Asia Pacific region for high grade products was outstripping supply. 'Strong economic growth in the Asia-Pacific has boosted demand for higher grade, cleaner refined products,' said Esso. Singapore, with a refining capacity of slightly over 1m b/d, is now the world's third biggest refining centre, after Rotterdam and Houston. Singapore's refineries supply about 40 per cent of Asia's imports of refined products. Several companies have recently announced multi-million dollar projects to upgrade existing refineries or build new petrochemcial plants in Singapore. In February, British Petroleum, Caltex and the local Singapore Petroleum company announced a Dollars 850m (Pounds 570.4m) refinery project in Singapore.</p>

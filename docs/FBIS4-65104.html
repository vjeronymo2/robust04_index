			<p>BFN     [Text] I have just learned that the 11 French people from  the aid organization Premiere Urgence who are being detained in  Bosnia could be released soon. This was said this morning by  Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. According to the  Bosnian Serb agency SRNA [Serbian News Agency], the release  could take place as soon as a legal formula has been found.  [passage omitted]</p>

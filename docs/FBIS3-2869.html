			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng  expressed satisfaction that deputies to the National People's  Congress (NPC) are coming to a consensus on the necessity to  correctly handle relations between reform, development and  stability.    "This is very important for fulfilling the tasks of this NPC  session," he said at a group discussion on his government work  report by Beijing deputies.    When deputy Huang Da, president of Chinese People's  University, expressed his view that Chinese realities require a  correct handling of reform, development and stability, Li Peng  said, "local governments should have the national interests in  mind, and the mass media should guide public opinion correctly,  providing complete and accurate information about central  authorities' policies to avoid misunderstandings by the people."    For the nation, he said, 1994 is a year of heavy reform  tasks  and economic development. The introduction of many reform  programs represents an important step toward the establishment  of a socialist market economy.    He called for carrying out the reform programs firmly,  adopting prudent attitudes and solving questions timely to  ensure a smooth progression of reform and open policy  implementation.    Li noted prices are an important factor for social  stability.  Experience has shown that it is correct to reform the country's  price system step by step.    "The government has lifted price control over 90 percent of  goods," he said. "But lifting price control doesn't mean  forgoing macro-controls."    He expressed the hope that local governments would make  efforts to keep price index at a tolerable level.    While conceding that a shifting of labor is inevitable now  that there is a growing labor market in China, the premier  called for strengthened management of the army of migrating  laborers seeking jobs. "The government should provide guidance  over the flowing labor force," he said.    He asked local governments to pay attention to improving  urban housing and accelerating the renewal of old residential  quarters.    He also urged Beijing to set an example in ideological and  cultural progress, better management of the social order and  create a good work and living environment for citizens in the  capital.    A deputy from the suburbs urged the government to stabilize  its rural policies and provide protective prices for farm  products.    Another deputy, Doctor Hu Yamei, urged the government to  crack down on feasting at public expense, cheating by sham  doctors and superstitious activities.    Premier Li Peng listened attentively to the views and took  notes.</p>

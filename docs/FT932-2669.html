			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls below 20,000 on political anxiety GROWING anxiety over the country's electoral reform proposals weighed heavily on activity, and the Nikkei index fell below the 20,000 level for the first time since April 26, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 143.46 at 19,902.42 on small-lot profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling. Public funds, which were noted placing buying orders around the 19,500 mark, failed to support sentiment. The index rose to a day's high of 20,103.00 in the morning session and fell to a low of 19,820.90 in the afternoon. Volume remained almost flat at 370m shares. Declines outnumbered advances by 909 to 154, with 96 issues remaining unchanged. The broader Topix index of all first section stocks weakened 19.74 to 1,600.14. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.01 up at 1,209.03. Confusion over the political situation grew as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, was poised to give up political reform, an issue on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's agenda since 1988. Foreigners were net sellers, while domestic institutions remained on the sidelines. A rally by the dollar against the yen eased some selling pressure. The dollar rose Y1.32 to close at Y106.35. Overseas institutions were seen selling bank shares: Industrial Bank of Japan dipped Y10 to Y2,930 and Mitsubishi Bank Y80 to Y2,670. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y27,000 to Y919,000 on profit-taking, while electric utilities, which have been recently popular as beneficiaries of a higher yen, lost ground. Tokyo Electric Power retreated Y60 to Y3,730. The lower yen, however, encouraged some high-technology exporters. Toshiba gained Y3 at Y693 and Fujitsu firmed Y4 to Y761. A 5.3 per cent year-on-year rise in semiconductor exporters supported Oki Electric, up Y17 at Y491, and Kyocera, the semiconductor ceramic package maker, which added Y40 at Y5,450. Mitsukoshi, the department store which accounts for more than 90 per cent of Tiffany's sales in Japan, put on Y4 at Y8,231. Reports that Tiffany would take over its own importing and distribution operations in Japan from Mitsukoshi encouraged customers. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 336.22 to 22,040.24 in volume of 18m shares. Roundup THERE were mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG was slightly higher as rumours of a breakthrough in Sino-British talks triggered moderate demand, reversing early losses. The Hang Seng index finished 21.37 ahead at 7,304.83, after losing 53 points in early trading. Turnover was strong at HKDollars 5.2bn. Index futures leapt earlier on talk of progress in Sino-British talks in Beijing on Hong Kong's political future and of an imminent agreement on the deadlocked issue of financing Hong Kong's new airport. The talks in Beijing ended with no outward signs of progress. Among the most active stocks, HSBC appreciated 50 cents to HKDollars 74, Hutchison Whampoa gained 10 cents at HKDollars 22 and Jardine Matheson shed 50 cents to HKDollars 60.50. TAIWAN saw profit-taking in the last hour erode earlier gains. The weighted index, which had risen more than 40 points at one stage, finished 9.40 down on balance at 4,188.90. Turnover remained thin, at TDollars 16.9bn. Strength in the Big Three banks led the market up at the opening, while speculative activity focused on stocks going ex-rights: Kuei Hung and Taiwan Sakura ended the day's limit up at TDollars 81 and TDollars 45.40 respectively. KUALA LUMPUR weakened as profit-taking continued to dominate the market. The composite index finished 2.91 lower at 736.51. Among speculative stocks, Union Paper, which had been rumoured as a takeover target for co-operative Koperasi Usaha Bersatu, fell MDollars 4.05 to MDollars 7.95 on reports that the latter had called off talks. Shares in Union Paper had risen some 400 per cent in the past two weeks, reaching a high of MDollars 23 on Monday. SINGAPORE also eased further as investors took profits, the Straits Times Industrial index relinquishing 7.97 to 1,811.66. Among losers were banks and shipyards as volume slipped to 215.7m shares from Tuesday's 227.9m. SEOUL managed to reverse five consecutive days of losses with a 1.42-point gain to 759.26 in turnover of Won570.3bn. AUSTRALIA was marginally higher, helped by strength in gold shares. The All Ordinaries index closed 0.7 up at 1,724.7 in turnover of ADollars 277.0m, while the golds sector index moved forward 50.2 to 1,717.1. Among gold issues, Plutonic was up 31 cents at ADollars 5.01 after losing 42 cents on Tuesday. BANGKOK saw high demand for major property groups pull the index up in afternoon trading. The SET index added 2.22 at 873.39 in turnover of Bt5.54bn. The property sector index moved ahead 2.67 per cent, with Bangkok Land climbing Bt3.50 to Bt86. KARACHI rose sharply on overseas buying, and the KSE index closed above the 1,200 level for the first time in four months, 13.15 higher at 1,200.93. The market's rise has been prompted by Monday's budget that extended exemptions on capital gains tax.</p>

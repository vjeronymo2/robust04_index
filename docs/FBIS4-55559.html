			<p>BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic at Zagreb  airport this afternoon. President Izetbegovic is on a stopover  in Zagreb on his way to Saudi Arabia where he will be taking  part in the pilgrimage to Mecca with 400 other Muslims from  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. We discussed the implementation  of the Vienna agreement, President Tudjman's visit to Sarajevo  -- which is expected to take place very soon -- as well as  various forms of cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia, such as transport, trade and the power industry,  President Izetbegovic said after the talks.    Minister Granic said that there were no longer any obstacles  in the way of President Tudjman's visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.  He added that the exact date of the visit would be determined  in a couple of days. Minister Granic said that the talks also  centered on cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia  in the area of trade, as well as a joint approach to European  integration, the system of security and succession. As far as  the Washington and Vienna agreements are concerned, both sides  have agreed that their implementation should be ensured as soon  as possible, Minister Granic said.</p>

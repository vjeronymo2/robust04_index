			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Ukraine voters belie forecasts of poll apathy More than 60 per cent of Ukraine's electorate had voted four hours before the polls closed yesterday, surpassing the required 50 per cent threshold in the nation's first post-Soviet parliamentary elections. Voter turnout became a key issue in the campaign, after presidential aides predicted that apathy would make it impossible to elect a workable legislature, enabling President Leonid Kravchuk to introduce direct presidential rule and cancel June presidential elections. Most of the nation's 450 parliamentary districts are expected to go to a second round on April 10 because an outright majority is needed to win a seat. Voters in the restive eastern regions came out in large numbers, although it was not clear if they would vote for parliamentary candidates or only cast their ballots in local 'opinion polls' calling for closer links with Russia. The most potentially incendiary of these local referendums was held in the Russian-dominated Crimean peninsula, which went ahead with a poll on independence, despite warnings from Kiev that the Ukrainian government considered the referendum illegal. A strong vote for independence in Crimea, which many Russians consider to be a natural part of their state, could further complicate already tense relations between Ukraine and Russia. An official in Simferopol, the Crimean capital, was confident that the 50 per cent threshold had been exceeded in the local referendum. Meanwhile, in Kiev, the elections could play a key role in determining the outcome of a mounting power struggle between the president and parliament. Over the weekend Mr Kravchuk, speaking on national television, said that if the parliament was 'not full-blooded' - less than a full 450-seat house - he would ask the legislature 'to give the president new legislative powers' and cancel presidential elections 'so as not to create a vacuum of power'. But, as he cast his ballot yesterday morning, Mr Ivan Pliushch, parliament's chairman, struck back. He rejected postponement of the presidential ballot and said he was confident the parliamentary elections would produce a working legislature. Most voters seemed oblivious to battles between their leaders and used simpler criteria when choosing whom to support. 'I guess I'll vote for the youngest,' said Mr Andrii Voronko, a 29-year-old electrical engineer, who confessed that he was confused by his ballot paper full of unfamiliar names and birth dates. 'They (the younger politicians) have the energy and aren't screwed up by the old mentality.' For a retired publisher, local politics took precedence over national debates. He decided to vote for an former Soviet bureaucrat who had helped him to get a flat years ago.</p>

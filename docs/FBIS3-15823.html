Filatov told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday [9 March] that  indeed he met Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's  representatives during his latest visit to the North Caucasus.  At that meeting Filatov expressed Russia's viewpoint on the  necessity to sign with Chechnya a powers-sharing treaty as it  had been done with Russia's another ethnic Republic of  Tatarstan. But no response from Dudayev has followed as yet,  Filatov said.</p>

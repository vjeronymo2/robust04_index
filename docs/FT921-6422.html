			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Ryan shares dip on profits fall SHARES OF Dublin-based Ryan Hotels yesterday fell 7 1/2 p to 24 1/2 p on news of a sharp fall in profits for the year to end-October. The fall, from IPounds 2.82m to IPounds 975,085 (Pounds 902,000) pre-tax, was blamed on the recession, the Gulf war and sharply higher interest charges.

Turnover declined from IPounds 20.1m to IPounds 19.4m and profits at the trading level emerged at IPounds 2.77m (IPounds 3.31m). Interest charges accounted for IPounds 1.72m (IPounds 863,813) and exceptional provisions for IPounds 82,000 (credits IPounds 370,000). Costs associated with the sale of three hotels were taken as a IPounds 990,075 extraordinary item.</p>

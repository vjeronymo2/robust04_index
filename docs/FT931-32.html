			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (15): Locked into the UK - The recession has helped concentrate minds on the importance of tourism / Tourist industry The number of visitors to Guernsey has sunk to an all-time low, with a 20 per cent drop over the past two years. 'The biggest problem we face,' says Mr Michael Walden, director of tourism, 'is that we are heavily locked into the UK market, with 82 per cent of our business coming from there and when that sinks, as it has done with the recession, we suffer.' However, the recession, had done much to concentrate the minds of Guernsey politicians on the importance of tourism. 'Until recently, it had existed - made a contribution - but it was rather left to look after itself. I think the government will play a more important role in terms of resources and improving the product, says Mr Walden. Tourism is Guernsey's second-largest industry - sandwiched between finance and horticulture - producing Pounds 110m a year; 18 per cent of the gross national product. The Tourist Board is aiming for an annual 5 per cent increase over the next five years to find 100,000 more visitors by 1996, and bring the number back to the 460,000 who visited in 1989. The board also plans to increase the number of beds available from 9,600 to 12,000. More than 1,000 were lost when the owners of guest houses and self-catering establishments, depressed in the past few years with the downturn in the tourist market, sold their premises. This year, 70 per cent of Guernsey's hotels have reduced their rates, held them at the 1992 level, or made only a cost-of-living increase. With a budget of Pounds 2.3m - a 3 per cent increase this year - Mr Walden plans to get closer to the consumer with road shows and promotions in Britain. He hopes to engage people to represent Guernsey on the ground in mainland Europe and do more to encourage conference visitors and small hotels to upgrade their facilities. 'One of our problems,' he says 'has been that until 1990 the tourist industry here thought that the UK would supply all its needs. It didn't want to pay commission on European sales, so looked to UK visitors who booked direct. This meant that continental (European) tour operators couldn't obtain the allocation of rooms they needed to put their brochures together. 'I think local industry must now come to terms with the fact that the continental visitor may be more important in terms of length of stay and spending power. We have so much potential but we still look north because it's been traditional, it's English speaking and easier to operate.' Who goes to Guernsey for a holiday? According to Mr Evan Ozanne, marketing director: 'Mainly those in the 45 to 55-plus age range who come to enjoy our way of life, the peace and quiet, bird watching, fishing, walking, flowers on the cliffs, trips to other islands, super food and a society that welcomes them. We're not creating anything for tourists - we call them visitors - just making available what is here.' He feels there should certainly be more French connections. 'It seems remarkable we are not attracting more people from just across the water. This year we're spending Pounds 50,000 on advertising there and attending exhibitions for the first time.' Research has shown that many who visit Guernsey from mainland Europe prefer to stay in small hotels providing good en suite facilities, good food and personal service. The eight-bedroom Midhurst House Hotel in St Peter Port has been run for 14 years by Brian and Jan Goodenough and this year they, too, looked to Europe for visitors. But they found that all the cheaper flights in July and August, at Pounds 272 from Dusseldorf for example, had been taken by tour operators, leaving only Pounds 400 seats available for independent travellers. The Goodenoughs, who lost a booking because of this, feel there is little point advertising in Germany if guests cannot get to them. Mr Walden sympathised. 'We want to encourage more Midhursts,' he said, 'and I think we should, perhaps, intervene with the airlines on something like this.' Visitors' biggest concerns, according to harbour and airport surveys, are cars, lack of parking facilities and signposts. 'There's been no effort to restrict car numbers,' Mr Walden admitted. 'No MOT, no VAT and petrol and hire car prices are the lowest in Europe. We have the strange situation that although people want to bring their cars, they complain there are too many when they come.' A Guernsey man who is also concerned about the lack of parking as well as the state of St Peter Port's unique attraction, the Victorian market building, is Mr Gerry Cobb. Frustrated with the finance industry, he now has a fish stand in the market. But shoppers are unable to park nearby, he says, and therefore they are drawn to an out-of-town supermarket. This fact, together with a lack of spending on the market building itself, makes him fearful for its future. 'If it's not properly maintained, we'll be in grave danger of the town losing its soul and its heart as well,' he said. There is certainly no lack of commitment in Guernsey's conference and incentive fields, although Mr Tim Orton, conference manager, says the past few years have been very tough with the number of conference delegates falling from 10,000 in the 1980s to 4,100 in 1992. Together with island-based agencies, Mr Orton is now going out to persuade companies that Guernsey - 'abroad but not foreign' - with departures from 21 UK airports, is a perfect business environment. At least 15 hotels provide conference facilities for up to 200 delegates. Mr Tom Castledine, managing director of the five-crown St Pierre Park, feels there is room for cautious optimism. 'Companies are booking very late, sometimes only a month in advance,' he said. 'But the first six months of this year will certainly be better than last.'</p>

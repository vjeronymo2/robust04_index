			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / IMF urges reductions in interest rates across EC: World economic outlook INTEREST rates must be eased across Europe to halt recession and ensure recovery during 1994, the International Monetary Fund says. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that Europe needs a 'mutually reinforcing process of economic recovery in which the restoration of confidence and rebound of activity in each country supports similar gains in the others.' The best way forward, the IMF argues, is through lowering interest rates. A progressive easing of monetary conditions in those countries which are members of the European exchange rate mechanism would have positive effects on business and consumer confidence. In its report, the International Monetary Fund does not conceal its disapproval of the way in which continental European countries have maintained what it sees as over-restrictive monetary policies during the past year because of their adherence to the European Monetary System . Although couched in diplomatic language, the Outlook underlines the IMF's dislike of over-cautious interest rate reductions on the continent since the decision early in August to increase the fluctuation margins in the ERM to 15 per cent either side of central rates. In a thinly-disguised attack on the policies of Germany's trading partners, the IMF warns that 'to maintain excessively high real interest rates to avert some exchange rate depreciation in the short run would further delay recovery, increase the risk of additional fiscal policy slippages, fuel protectionist pressures and might even trigger larger speculative attacks that could lead to larger exchange rate adjustments.' The report said that financial markets had already produced 'important evidence' that moderate but significant reductions in short-term European interest rates relative to those in Germany would cause only limited currency depreciations against the D-Mark. Lower interest rates in the ERM countries would also benefit other continental European countries as well as the newly emerging market economies of eastern and central Europe and those African countries which have close trading ties with Europe, the IMF said.</p>

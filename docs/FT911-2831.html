			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Savings rates are cut SAVERS HAVE started to feel the impact of the last two base rate cuts, with interest rates falling by around 1 per cent across a range of products. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has cut the rate on its London Share Account by 0.95 per cent to 12.75 per cent gross (the minimum deposit is Pounds 2,500). Rates on the Gold Account have fallen by 1 per cent and range from 11.10 per cent to 5.5 per cent gross. The rate on the Flexi-Tessa has also been cut by 1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, although the rate on the Maxi-Tessa is unchanged. Nationwide Anglia has cut its rates by an average 1.15 per cent gross. Rates on the various accounts now vary as follows: FlexAccount (3.3 to 11 per cent); Cashbuilder (9.8 to 12 per cent); Capitalbuilder (11.2 to 12.8 per cent); Monthly Income (10.8 to 12.5 per cent); and the Prestige Bond (11.9 to 13.3 per cent. Those wanting to guarantee their income, in the face of falling rates, may be attracted by the Fixed Interest Deposit Account offered by AIB Bank. This pays 10.75 per cent gross for five years and the minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. Further mortgage rate cuts were also announced this week, with the going rate settling between 12.75 and 12.95 per cent. However, some borrowers will have to wait until June 1 to see the benefit of lower rates. Derbyshire Building Society is cutting its rate for existing borrowers to 12.85 per cent as from June 1. The Mortgage Corporation has reduced the variable rate for new borrowers on its Purchase Plan mortgage to 12.49 per cent, from 13.75 per cent. There is a fixed rate option of 11.99 per cent for between one and five years. National Westminster Bank is reducing its rate by 0.8 per cent to 12.95 per cent. The rate will apply to new borrowers from May 1 and to existing borrowers from June 1. Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society has cut its rate for existing borrowers to 12.95 per cent, as from May 20. The cut will also apply to borrowers on the annual review system. Royal Bank of Scotland has cut its rate to 12.85 per cent, not 12.95 per cent as we reported last week. United Bank of Kuwait has reduced its rate for existing borrowers by 1 percentage point to 12.75 per cent.</p>

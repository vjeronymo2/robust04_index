			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / MPs are told to save Cox apples The crisp, sweet and quintessentially English Cox apple is an endangered species, say apple growers who went to the Commons yesterday demanding action to save it. About 200 growers lobbied MPs and placed a symbolic 'lost orchard' in Abingdon Gardens, the area of lawn opposite the Commons. They say the Cox is being threatened by an influx of foreign apples from low-cost producers such as Chile and South Africa. This is being compounded by a surplus of about 1m tonnes of apples in the European Union. As a result, retail prices are at the same level in real terms as 10 years ago, and UK growers last year covered only half their cost of production. 'The growers aren't getting enough money from their apples to replant their orchards,' said a spokeswoman. 'Unless they invest in new trees, they're going to end up with nothing left at all.' The English Cox Apple Growers, grouping 780 producers, want Britain to ensure fair trade is enforced through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and that UK producers are given the same financial support as continental producers. They are also calling for itemised till receipts in supermarkets. This would highlight British produce to encourage consumers to buy Cox.</p>

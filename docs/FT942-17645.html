			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Rush to beat VAT on fuel nets Pounds 230m for British Gas More than 1m householders met the deadline for making advance payments to avoid value added tax on domestic fuel, which was imposed at a rate of 8 per cent from yesterday, rising to 17.5 per cent in April next year. British Gas said it received advance payments totalling Pounds 230m by noon on Thursday from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of its 18m domestic customers. Full returns from its national network of gas showrooms will not be available until next week, however. There have been suggestions that the electricity companies would receive advance payments of as much as Pounds 1bn. This will not be known until next week because of the holiday weekend. The companies reported the collection of more than Pounds 663m from householders. This figure does not take into account the final rush as Thursday's deadline approached. Banks and building societies that have the regional electricity companies and British Gas as customers will be among the main beneficiaries from the rush to meet the March 31 VAT deadline. Most of the companies have decided to deposit the advance payments with banks and buildings societies, although they also mentioned money market funds as possible destinations. Manweb and Northern Electric were the only regional electricity companies to say they were still considering what to do with the extra cash. If the intentions to favour banks and building societies materialise, it will mean that much of the money will be 'recycled'. Most consumers withdrew funds from banks or building societies to make the advance payments, which they hope will give them an effective yield greater than the relatively low rates on offer for savings. Most electricity companies say the extra interest earned will be used to cover the administrative and data processing expenses associated with the imposition of VAT. Seeboard said its decision to deposit in building societies the Pounds 64m it received from 115,000 customers by Wednesday night meant it was 'effectively returning' the capital. Scottish Power will donate the extra interest it receives to groups 'who have been disadvantaged by the introduction of VAT on fuel'. Midlands Electricity is to donate Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy Action to fund energy-efficiency projects for low-income households. Sports clubs' rebate, Page 9</p>

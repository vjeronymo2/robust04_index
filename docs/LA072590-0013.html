			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FESTIVAL NEWS  </P> <P> Mural Won't Make Festival: The restoration of David Alfaro Siqueiros' "Tropical  America" mural in Olvera Street -- which is being billed as "an image for the  entire Los Angeles Festival" -- will not take place until long after the  September arts festival, according to the Friends of Mexico, which is actually  undertaking the project with the J. Paul Getty Museum. Spokeswoman Miriam  Bertram said that the city's uncertainty surrounding future plans for Olvera  Street has delayed work on the mural which was commissioned in 1932, but  covered with a coat of white paint two years later because it was seen by many  as Communist propaganda. Bertram said that "end painting" on the mural -- which  depicted a crucified Mexican with a huge eagle perched above him on the cross  -- is now scheduled for January, 1991. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

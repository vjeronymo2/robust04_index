			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> KOVIC: BRING U.S. TROOPS HOME  </P> <P> Ron Kovic, the disabled Vietnam veteran played by Tom Cruise in the movie "Born  on the Fourth of July" appealed for President Bush to bring troops home from  the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Speaking on television from his beach city home, Kovic on Tuesday said he would  send his opinions to Bush in a letter.  </P> <P> "I implore the President to begin withdrawing the troops," the former Marine  said during a newscast.  </P> <P> Kovic, 43, whose autobiography served as the source for "Fourth of July" said  he represented millions of people uneasy about an American military operation  in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "This is a growing movement," he said, saying that an opinion shift would occur  as soon as American troops suffer casualties.  </P> <P> "Millions of us want peace," he said. "We've had enough of wars. We've had  enough of our sons coming home in body bags and wheelchairs. We've had enough  of delayed stress syndrome."  </P> <P> Kovic served with the Marines in Vietnam and lost the use of his legs from a  combat wound. He returned to America and eventually became an anti-war  activist.  </P></p>

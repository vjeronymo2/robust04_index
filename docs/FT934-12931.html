			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Miscast down the Mississippi - Karen Fricker reviews Hal Prince's new production of 'Show Boat' IT IS well into the second act of Hal Prince's lavish new production of Hammerstein and Kern's Show Boat, which opened at the North York Performing Arts Centre in Toronto last Sunday, before the musical lives up to its potential. A montage conveys, in the span of a few minutes, the passage of this century's first 20 years. Headline placards slapped one on top of the other on a news stand wall telegraph the passage of years and events: 'Harding Elected,' 'War Declared,' 'Armistice'. The fashion silhouettes change before our eyes as chorine after chorine, decked in Florence Klotz' sumptuous, meticulously observed costumes, burst forth from a revolving door on Eugene Lee's glorious set. Downstage, a riotous scene unfolds, as chorus members shimmy their way through changing dance styles in Susan Stroman's joyful choreography and from this point on it is smooth sailing for Show Boat. But however rewarding these last 20 minutes, it takes a slow two hours to get there. Behind this production of Show Boat lie hopes, of course, of a Broadway transfer. It is not ready for that move yet, but Kiss of the Spider Woman proved that Prince can turn a show around after a rough out-of-town start, and producer Garth Drabinsky appears prepared to support him in the process. Show Boat is considered the granddaddy of the contemporary musical for its revolutionary integration of music and comedy with a serious and historically significant story: the tale, spanning 40 years, of a steamer that trolls down the Mississippi with a variety show on board. Prince and his creative team constructed this Show Boat from the musical's several previous stage and film versions, adding several formerly omitted songs and excluding or changing material that is offensive to contemporary sensibilities (the production has been the focus of protests in Toronto by groups who call the musical racist). Though primarily the story of the love between Magnolia Hawks, the innocent daughter of the captain of the Cotton Blossom, and the raffish gambler Gaylord Ravenal, Show Boat also tells several other stories, including that of Magnolia's parents, Cap'n Andy and his shrewish wife Parthy; and of Julie, the Cotton Blossom's star attraction, whose fate turns tragic when she's revealed to be of mixed race. So many relationships being played out on stage requires that the director seize every opportunity to convey information about the characters, but Prince's hand barely seems present in the first act. Characters drift on, seemingly without motivation, play out a scene or sing a song, and drift off. The score, Hammerstein and Kern's best, sounds gorgeous as played by Jeffrey Huard's orchestra. Rebecca Luker, with a bell-clear soprano, is perfectly cast as Magnolia, and Mark Jacoby's dashing Ravenal is also in good voice. Lonette McKee's Julie is an earthy star turn, and her rendition of 'Bill' sparks the first real magic of the second act. But there is little chemistry between Julie and her husband and acting partner Steve (Doug La Breque), nor does there seem much warmth between Julie and Magnolia, and this is a major oversight - it is their bond that results in some of the most significant plot developments. We know that we are in good hands for 'Ol' Man River' as soon as Joe (Michel Bell) speaks his first words; his rumbling bass almost shakes the stage. Although the huge cast - 71 performers - seems at times unnecessary, all is forgiven when the company lends its full voice to the splendid 'Misery's Comin' Roun' or one of the many 'Ol' Man River' reprises. But what are Robert Morse and Elaine Stritch doing in this production as Cap'n Andy and Parthy? Morse looks to be playing a mixture of Jack Benny, Mickey Rooney, and his own signature solo turn as Truman Capote: floppy hands, floppy hair, camp demeanour, and bizarrely elongated diction. Stritch, of course, plays Stritch, which is fabulous in Sondheim's Follies or Company but wholly out of place here: her undisguiseably contemporary physical presence, gravely voice, and wisecracking delivery seem from a different planet than the material.</p>

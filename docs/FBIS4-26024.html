			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Night News" program] </F>   [Text] The State Environmental Protection Bureau and the  General Administration of Customs recently commended 12 Jiangsu  units for returning 1,288 tonnes of hazardous chemical wastes to  overseas consignees. This serious incident of illegal import of  hazardous wastes, which occurred half a year ago, has been  initially settled.    This serious incident occurred on 25 September last year.  Without receiving prior approval from environmental protection  departments, Beijing's (Zhongmaofa) Company and Nanjing's  (Huagu) Company imported 1,288 tonnes of so-called fuel oil from  South Korea to Nanjing Port's (Shanyuan) Wharf. After a sample  check by Jiangsu Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau  personnel, they found that the shipment was not fuel oil, but  hazardous chemical wastes. The Nanjing New District Customs  immediately blocked the release of the problematic shipment.  Due to the cooperation among relevant state and Jiangsu  departments, the illegally imported wastes had all been safely  returned to the consignee on 5 March this year. A check shows  that during the five-month stay of these hazardous wastes in  Nanjing Port, no incident of pollution was reported, thanks to  the joint supervision of the Jiangsu and Nanjing Environmental  Protection Bureaus. Although these hazardous wastes had been  returned to the consignee, there is no knowing what kind of  punishment will be meted to those who were responsible for  importing these wastes in the first place.</p>

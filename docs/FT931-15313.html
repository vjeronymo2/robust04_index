			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Expert scoffs at US fears of long-term decline FEARS THAT the US is in long-term economic decline relative to other nations are totally unfounded, according to Mr Michael Boskin, outgoing chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 'Declinists' have got their facts wrong, Mr Boskin asserts in his annual Economic Report of the President, released today. Far from deindustrialising, the US has been gaining ground on other leading economies. The report says the US share of the total industrial output of the 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states is higher today than in 1970. US exports have risen from 8 to 11 per cent of gross domestic product in the past five years, confirming that the US is 'internationally more competitive' than it has been for decades. The US still has the highest standard of living, as measured by per capita GDP, and the highest level of industrial productivity, the report says. Looking forward, Mr Boskin projects a substantial improvement in US productivity growth. Output per hour in non-farm businesses will grow at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent between 1990 and 1998, compared with 0.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent registered in the 1970 and 1980 business cycles, although slower than in the immediate post-war dec-ades. The likely increase in productivity growth will reflect a more experienced labour force as the 'baby boom' generation matures and higher levels of investment brought about primarily by lower interest rates and inflation. Mr Boskin concedes, however, that serious problems remain, including the 'deplorable' quality of secondary education, an excessively costly health care system that fails to insure many Americans, and continuing high levels of poverty.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- According to the defense expert of the Free  Democratic Party [FDP], Juergen Koppelin, the Bundeswehr White  Paper, which was officially presented to the public today, is  "poetry rather than a clear description of the future course of  the German Armed Forces." The future development of the  Bundeswehr remains "vague or has been described with concepts  containing old thinking," Koppelin stressed. The Federal  Association of German Industry [BDI], however, welcomed the  statements on the preservation of defense technology. The  cabinet adopted the "White Paper 1994" on 15 March. Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) then  announced that the Bundeswehr plans to establish forces for  crisis operations within the framework of the United Nations.    The White Paper presents the concept of the Federal  Government's security and defense policy. It is the first such  document in the united Germany. The previous White Paper was  published in 1985. Koppelin pointed out that adhering to a  Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 is hardly suitable for an  unbiased discussion of the future of the Bundeswehr. These  figures are "wishful thinking and do not correspond to reality."  As early as by the end of this year, the Bundeswehr will be  reduced to 345,000 soldiers as a result of austerity measures,  he stressed. The Armed Forces are in an alarming situation.  The motivation, the training, and the equipment of the soldiers  must be assessed very critically. "The White Paper presented by  Ruehe could hardly have been more contradictory."    The BDI stressed that the White Paper makes clear the  significance of a modern efficient and competitive national  defense industry as an essential element of Germany's  reliability as an alliance partner. On the basis of the  prospects for the equipment of the Bundeswehr mentioned in the  White Paper, industry must receive reliable planning data, and  sufficient funds for investments must be made available. There  must be an end to the drastic reductions in the defense budget  and the lack of funds.    During the presentation of the White Paper on 15 March,  Ruehe  explained the poor financial situation of the Bundeswehr and  announced a further reduction of the army. He did not mention  figures. The minister wants to present his ideas at the end of  April on the occasion of the presentation of the "conceptional  guidelines" for the Bundeswehr which are to initiate a reform of  the armed forces. Newspapers reported about "model  calculations," speaking of a peacetime strength of the  Bundeswehr of "between 300,000 and 360,000 men." The White  Paper points out that important projects must be given up  because of the poor financial situation. Ruehe stressed  explicitly that compulsory military service will not be  abandoned.</p>

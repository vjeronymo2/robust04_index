			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 9 Apr (XINHUA) -- A responsible person of  the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office today issued a  statement concerning the fire on a pleasure-boat in Qiandao Hu,  Zhejiang. He said both sides of the strait did not want to see  the unfortunate accident happen, which killed 32 compatriots  from the two sides. He urged the Taiwan side to view the  accident objectively and calmly.    On 31 March, a fire broke out on a pleasure boat in  Zhejiang's Qiandao Hu, which, to our great sorrow, killed 24  Taiwan compatriots who had come to the mainland for sightseeing  as well as eight mainland compatriots. The State Council's  Taiwan Affairs Office grieves over the deaths, and expresses  profound sympathy and solicitude for the families of the Taiwan  and mainland compatriots who died in the accident.    The State Council leaders have attached great importance to  problems arising from the fire, and have urged the Zhejiang  Provincial People's Government to earnestly deal with the  aftermath of the accident and to expedite investigations of the  cause of the accident. The Ministry of Public Security, the  National Tourism Administration, and Zhejiang Province  immediately took measures to conduct on-the-site rescue,  inspection, and search for victims' bodies. Acting on a  briefing by Zhejiang's departments concerned, the Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait promptly took the  initiative to inform Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation about  the relevant circumstances. Currently the departments concerned  are continuing to exert efforts to further deal with the  aftermath, and to investigate the accident's cause, striving to  release it as soon as it is verified.    The responsible person said: Both sides of the strait did  not want to see this unfortunate accident happen. We trust that  Taiwan compatriots at large will show understanding for the  measures taken and the efforts made by the mainland departments  concerned to deal with the accident. We are willing to listen  to positive suggestions and opinions from various parties,  including Taiwan compatriots. It is our hope that Taiwan's  relevant departments will view the accident in an objective and  calm manner to prevent some people from exploiting this accident  to create public opinion and trouble unfavorable to the  development of cross-strait relations.</p>

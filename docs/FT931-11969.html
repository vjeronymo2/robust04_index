			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Coleridge to step up role at Sturge MR DAVID COLERIDGE, the former chairman of Lloyd's of London, is set to play a more active role at Sturge Holdings, the Lloyd's agency which he chairs, following yesterday's surprise resignation of Mr Peter Davis, the group's deputy chairman and finance director. It had been expected that Mr Coleridge, who is 60, would have only a part-time involvement at Sturge, following an arduous two year stint at Lloyd's. Instead, he is expected to be much more involved as Sturge prepares to confront a severe skrinkage in its business. Full details will emerge at the group's annual meeting next Thursday but it is expected that capacity of the 22 syndicates under management will fall from its Pounds 1.05bn in 1992 by at least 20 per cent in 1993. Mr Davis joined Sturge in 1988 to help guide the group's expansion outside Lloyd's. However, in the wake of the market's recent trading problems Sturge has suffered a contraction in its business and has reduced the size of its management team accordingly. Resignations of other senior figures are expected this year, as well as further redundancies among the group's 1,300 staff. Since October 1991 175 staff have left. The decline of two 'flagship' syndicates - 206 and 210 - is a particular concern. During Sturge's rapid expansion in the mid-1980s each syndicate - which underwrites a broad spread of insurance business - increased its capacity to over Pounds 200m. More recently both have suffered sharp falls. Syndicate 206 may be left with less than Pounds 50m capacity in 1993, while syndicate 210's capacity could also decline by 50 per cent. Mr Johnston Brown, group company secretary, said that many Names - individual traders whose capital supports Lloyd's - had been hard hit by recent losses and were being forced to reduce the amount of insurance traded on their behalf. Sturge could leave the most recent years of account of syndicates 206 and 210 open, because of the sharp contraction in the syndicates' size.</p>

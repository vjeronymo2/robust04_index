The vehicle, a Ford 350 with license plates 036-GAL, was  traveling down Maracay-El Limon Avenue when it was intercepted  in front of the veterinary school in Cana de Azucar neighborhood  by a group of hooded individuals, who also robbed the driver.    In addition, a demonstration was held between 0800 and 1200  on 20 January in Cana de Azucar neighborhood in front of the  governor's office to protest the high cost of living, the  increase in power rates, the excessive increase of bus fares,  and the value-added tax (VAT).    Uneventful protests were also staged in Villa de Cura and La  Victoria, while professors from high schools in Cagua, Villa de  Cura, and Turmero demanded payment of their salaries.    In Valencia, groups of students and hooded individuals on 20  January hijacked 30 buses on various urban routes as well as  routes outside this capital. The vehicles were taken to the  parking lot at the University of Carabobo's school of education,  where they remained until that evening.    According to several students at the scene, the bus seizures  were prompted by an inconsiderate increase in bus fares. The  students added that they would not cease their activities until  their demands were heard.    Edgar Barbera, representative of the Valencia Collective  Transportation Union, said the union will not allow any  collective transportation to circulate in the city until the  buses are returned.    At approximately 1700, the end of the workday, on 20  January,  Valencia bus stops and streets were crowded with people who were  forced to walk home.    In Maturin and Caripito, students held violent  demonstrations  on 21 January to protest increased bus fares and the collection  of half fares in the midst of demonstrations that affected local  businesses and required the intervention of police riot brigades.    High school students hijacked several microbuses and parked  them near the state government building, which was occupied by  the police on the morning of 20 January.    In Caripito, hotheaded students from the Technological  Institute staged their second consecutive day of violent  demonstrations, causing considerable damage to city hall and the  Socialist League building.</p>

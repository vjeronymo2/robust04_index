He was received at Rinas airport by Albanian  Foreign Minister Serreqi.    The chief of Belgian diplomacy told the reporters that the  aim of his visit is the establishment of a continuous political  dialogue for the interests of both countries. As topics in the  Albanian-Belgian talks he considered bilateral cooperation as  well as the situation in our region.    After arriving at the Foreign Ministry, the two delegations  led by Serreqi and Claes started talks. Regarding bilateral  cooperation, the talks focused on the possibilities of  institutionalizing the consultations between the two respective  Foreign Ministries. Regarding economics, the Albanian side paid  attention to starting cooperation in the mining, energy,  tourism, agriculture, and textile industries. Minister Serreqi  presented the desire that Belgian investors be present in  Albania, assuring the necessary judicial cadre. They also  expressed opinions on cooperation in the fields of defense and  public order.    Another topic in the talks between the Belgian and Albanian  delegations was the situation in the region. The main  protagonists at the meeting supported the U.S. initiative to  create a Croat-Bosnian federation and Claes stressed the need to  find proper ways to do so. For this, he continued, it is  necessary for the Serbian side to contribute as well.    The Belgian foreign minister considered the problem of  Kosova  as part of the general Yugoslav crisis and tied the abolishment  of sanctions to the solution of all aspects of the crisis,  including Kosova.    Our foreign minister was of the opinion that Kosova should  not be treated as a part of Serbia.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Lobbyists force change: Gummer bows to pressures over powers of Environment Agency Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday bowed to intense pressure from environmental groups and made changes to the legislation setting up the Environment Agency that will control pollution in England and Wales. He also announced the appointment of Lord de Ramsey, a farmer and businessman, as chairman of the advisory body preparing the way for the new agency. Lord de Ramsey is expected to become the agency's Pounds 50,000 a year, part-time chairman. Environmental groups were universal in their condemnation of the terms of the bill when they were announced in Wednesday's Queen's Speech. They said it substantially weakened existing powers by giving the agency 'aims' rather than 'duties'. Mr Gummer said there had been no intention to weaken the legislation and he would amend the wording 'so as to provide a clear duty not simply to consider conservation issues in relation to all the agency's functions but to further conservation as appropriate'. He refused, however, to budge on another matter of great concern to environmentalists - a clause insisting that environmental regulation 'must take proper account of costs and benefits'. Nevertheless, Mr Gummer said he would ensure that this clause was not used by organisations to win more time before having to comply with regulations. Friends of the Earth said last night that it seemed as if Mr Gummer was 'giving back only half of what we had before' in pollution control powers. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said: 'We will be reassured when the actual wording of the bill is published. The new agency and its counterpart in Scotland must have a clear duty to further nature conservation.' The new agency will combine the operations of the National Rivers Authority (NRA) with the Inspectorate of Pollution and various local authority waste regulators. Mr Gummer said the enabling bill would contain measures relating to contaminated land and pollution from abandoned mines. An enabling power for the preservation of hedgerows of particular value would be in the bill but would not form part of the new agency's role, he said. Mr Gummer welcomed the decision of Lord Crickhowell to remain chairman of the NRA until the vesting of the new agency in April 1996. He suggested this should reduce the 'problems of disruption' that might arise by the merger.</p>

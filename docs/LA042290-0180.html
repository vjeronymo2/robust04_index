			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT PLAN MAY AID SOCIAL SERVICES;  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD: THE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR SETTING ASIDE 10% OF THE $900 MILLION  GENERATED IN REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  </P> <P> A plan to earmark for social service programs 10% of the $900 million that is  to be spent on the massive Hollywood redevelopment project is likely to be  approved by the city Community Redevelopment Agency and signed into law,  redevelopment officials say.  </P> <P> The officials said the plan is the first of its kind in Los Angeles, and  perhaps the nation, in which social reform programs are directly linked to a  redevelopment effort.  </P> <P> According to the plan, as much as $90 million would be spent over the next 30  years on day-care facilities, medical services, shelter programs for the  homeless and runaways, educational and job training facilities and counseling  programs.  </P> <P> The plan was approved April 6 by the Hollywood Community Advisory Council, and  is now before the CRA board of directors, which is overseeing the effort to  revitalize a 1.7-acre swath of central Hollywood.  </P> <P> "It is a good principle and is consistent with what the agency is doing now,"  said Carlyle Hall, one of seven CRA board directors and chairman of the CRA  board's housing and social needs committee. "I think the 10% should be a floor,  and not a ceiling, for spending on social needs."  </P> <P> Other CRA officials and members of the community advisory group also hailed the  plan and predicted that it would be approved. Hall said the CRA board would  start reviewing the proposal within several weeks.  </P> <P> "I think it is very likely (the board) will adopt it," said Lester Burg,  assistant project manager of the CRA's Hollywood Redevelopment Project. And  project manager Cooke Sunoo said that although the project has been tied up in  court, the agency has budgeted $350,000 for social-needs programs for the  fiscal year that starts July 1.  </P> <P> The Hollywood project, like most redevelopment efforts, is expected to be  self-financing in the long run. Initial phases of the project are built with  funds borrowed against future tax revenue. If successful, the initial phase of  redevelopment then generates enough additional property tax revenue to pay for  the rest of the project.  </P> <P> Under state law, 20% of the added tax revenue generated by redevelopment  projects must be set aside to create affordable housing. The new plan goes  further, setting aside an additional 10% for other social needs -- a first for  the CRA, Sunoo said.  </P> <P> The community advisory council, which sought input from CRA staff members  before approving the plan, determined most of its priorities from a study of  social needs in Hollywood that was conducted by an outside consulting firm.  </P> <P> HCAC Chairwoman Torie Osborn said she expects little opposition from the CRA  board. She noted that the initial idea for setting aside the 10% came from City  Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the area. That idea was incorporated  into the redevelopment document approved by the City Council in May, 1986.  </P> <P> "There is nothing like this plan, to my knowledge, anywhere else in the  country," Osborn said. "It is a visionary document."  </P> <P> What is at stake, and now subject to approval, is exactly how the money will be  spent.  </P> <P> The plan does not allocate fixed percentages of funds for specific purposes.  Instead, it is flexible by design. The plan is for the CRA to work closely with  the citizen's advisory council and private groups in determining how the money  will be spent, Osborn said.  </P> <P> Some residents have criticized the plan as being unrealistic. Among the critics  are some members of an elected advisory group that Woo replaced last year as  the official advisory panel to the CRA in favor of the Hollywood Community  Advisory Council.  </P> <P> At issue, opponents said, is the wording of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan,  which says the agency "shall expend or cause to be expended an amount equal to  10% of the tax increment available to the agency . . . to address the social  needs of the community."  </P> <P> "Where is the 10% guaranteed?" asked community activist Norton Halper. "Not  only is it not in the plan, it does not exist."  </P> <P> Halper said he favors spending on social needs, but he warned that the CRA is  "deceiving the community and the social needs groups that think they are going  to get a lot of money to put forth their programs, when the money will not be  there."  </P> <P> "It's a deceptive hoax," said Halper. He said as much as 70% of the $1 billion  ultimately projected for redevelopment would be used to finance the debts the  CRA will incur by borrowing money up front for projects.  </P> <P> Halper is a member of the Project Area Committee, the group that was replaced  by the HCAC. Though stripped of its official status, the committee still meets  once a month.  </P> <P> Woo said the social programs will not have to wait for the redevelopment  project to get under way before the money starts flowing. The initial  borrowing, he said, will pay not just for construction, but for some of the  social programs too.  </P> <P> "Otherwise, it may be many years before these needs are served," Woo said. "We  have got to start generating some money now."  </P> <P> Lynn Davis, chairwoman of the HCAC's Housing and Social Needs Committee,  acknowledged that such debts would be incurred. "But I don't think they would  be significant enough to dilute the purpose" of the plan to help the community,  she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOLLWAYS DIRECTOR GETS RAISE DESPITE EARLIER OPPOSITION  </P> <P> Orange County tollway officials voted unanimously Thursday to give the head of  the Transportation Corridor Agencies an 11.8% pay raise, despite opposition a  day earlier from Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley.  </P> <P> The same officials also voted -- despite objections -- to repay the county  about $1.1 million for planning work done by the county in preparation for  tollway construction. The work took place before the special tollway agencies  were created.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis, among others, objected that  there are no files documenting any agreement to repay the county, and that  Thursday's decision was based on staff assurances that there had been an "oral  understanding" reached with the county more than 4 years ago.  </P> <P> The vote on Executive Director John Meyer's salary increase of $10,000 took  place after members of the agencies' two boards of directors held a closed  personnel session. During the session, several members contended that no formal  performance evaluation procedure had been developed yet for giving Meyer  feedback about his performance, according to members who attended the meeting  in Santa Ana. For that reason, they argued, the issue should be narrowly  focused on whether the $10,000 raise -- from $85,000 to $95,000 -- was a  well-deserved cost-of-living adjustment, members said.  </P> <P> Meyer received his last raise 2 years ago.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Riley and some other supervisors had said they would oppose  Meyer's salary increase at Thursday's board meeting, citing delays in  processing environmental, design and cost-estimating work, and unresolved  questions about some expenses.  </P> <P> But Thursday's discussion behind closed doors never reached the point where  specific gripes were aired, board members said. And Riley and other critics of  Meyer joined with the majority in approving the raise when the regular meeting  resumed.  </P> <P> Riley did not comment during the vote, but Mission Viejo Councilman Curtis  cited Meyer's heavy workload, staffing shortages and the uniqueness of the  effort to build tollways in California as an explanation for some of the  difficulties Meyer has faced.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Riley said simply that he was convinced that the raise was  not going to be a merit award. "I don't talk about what is said in executive  sessions," Riley said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Same Staff, 2 Boards  </P> <P> The Transportation Corridor Agencies are building three tollways in eastern and  southern Orange County that are scheduled to open in the early to middle 1990s.  The agencies share the same staff and office but have two governing boards: One  oversees the Foothill and Eastern tollways; the other directs the San Joaquin  Hills tollway project.  </P> <P> During Thursday's meeting, Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who serves on the boards  of both the San Joaquin Hills and Foothill/Eastern Corridor boards, said he was  concerned that tollway construction costs have escalated to between $2 billion  and $3 billion from the $1 billion projected several years ago.  </P> <P> "I think we received low-ball projections early on to bring as many people as  possible into this thing," Agran said after Thursday's meeting. "It's  imperative that the agency and the staff own up to the fact that we're now in  the $2-billion to $3-billion range."  </P> <P> Escalating costs could have serious implications for the financial feasibility  of the tollways, because 48.5% of the construction costs are supposed to come  from developer fees. But it is not clear whether those fees can be increased at  a later date. The remaining share of the construction cost is expected to be  covered by the sale of bonds, which would be repaid with toll revenue as well  as state and federal funds.  </P> <P> The fee issue is being reviewed, and revised cost estimates for the three  tollways are scheduled to be delivered to board members within 30 days,  according to tollway officials.  </P> <P> An independent financial review of the agency also is under way.  </P> <P> In order to speed construction of the Foothill Corridor, board members voted  Thursday to contract with James McConnell, the county's lobbyist in Washington,  to try to win Federal Highway Administration permission to build a segment  through Rancho Mission Viejo with partial environmental documentation rather  than the complete environmental impact statement for the full length of the  tollway.  </P></p>

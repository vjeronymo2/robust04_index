			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Unions condemn MPs' pay increase UNION LEADERS yesterday criticised MPs for awarding themselves a pay rise of nearly 5.4 per cent over the next two years while public-sector workers were being told to accept lower settlements. In the early hours of yesterday morning MPs voted by 268 votes to 42, a majority of 226, to award themselves a 2.7 per cent rise from January and 2.68 per cent the year after. Ministers argued that the award would be the first pay rise since January 1992, and would bring MPs' salaries in line with inflation. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the public-sector union Unison, Britain's biggest union, said it was 'grossly hypocritical' for MPs to give themselves a rise nearly twice as high as the 1.5 per cent limit for public-sector workers this year. The TGWU general union said: 'MPs have voted themselves a higher wage rise than they are imposing on 1m local government manual workers.' Among the 56 Labour MPs who voted for the rise were Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, and Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary. In the Commons debate, Mrs Beckett argued that MPs had to live in London and run secretarial and research staff on comparatively small salaries. The 16 Labour MPs voting against the rise included Mr Frank Field, MP for Birkenhead, who proposed a pay freeze, and Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover. On the Tory benches 10 MPs defied the recommendation of the government and voted against the pay rise. The vote cost Mr Michael Bates, Tory MP for Langbaurgh, his job as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister. The pay award was described as 'a free vote' outside the party whip. But as a parliamentary private secretary, Mr Bates was considered part of the 'payroll vote', and was obliged to support the government. Mr Bates was reported to be so outraged at the increase that he was planning to turn down the cash. Under the proposals, the salary of an ordinary MP would rise to Pounds 31,687 next year and to Pounds 32,538 in 1995. Those receiving a non-parliamentary salary, for example those concerned with legal work, would receive Pounds 23,854 next year and Pounds 24,495 in 1995. It is proposed that, from 1996, increases in MPs' pay will be linked annually to a range of civil service bands - which should end the traditional furore over MPs' salaries.</p>

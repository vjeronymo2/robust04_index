			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> WHERE REALITY OUTPACED FICTION: A NOVEL ON THE STEINBERG CASE  </P> <P> Waverly Place by Susan Brownmiller (Grove Press: $18.95, 304 pages)  </P> <P> First out of the gate in an inevitable commercial sweepstakes, Susan  Brownmiller's version of the Steinberg case is presented as fiction, though  recapitulation might be a more precise description of her method. Beginning to  write on the day the Steinberg child died from head injuries inflicted by the  man who had so casually "adopted" her, Brownmiller says, "I wanted the freedom  to invent dialogue, motivations, events and characters based on my own  understanding of battery and abuse."  </P> <P> Drawing heavily upon the lore collected for her impassioned study of rape,  "Against Our Will," Brownmiller struggles to make this case fit a precast mold  too narrow for the appalling facts. Instead of expanding our perception of the  tragedy, "Waverly Place" inadvertently shrinks it.  </P> <P> Even before the actual trial, the New York press coverage was exhaustive,  providing Brownmiller with a daily supply of lurid revelations corroborating,  rivaling and often exceeding anything she could imagine; turning the project  into a contest in which fantasy is continually overmatched by reality. Finding  setting, characters and plot on her doorstep, Brownmiller seems to have taken  them in with only the most cursory effort to turn the raw elements into  fiction. Her central characters remain pallid stand-ins for Joel Steinberg and  Hedda Nussbaum, while the "invented" friends and relatives are hastily  recruited from a pool of urban stereotypes. Since virtually every incident is  preempted by the actual scenario, the 'invention' is limited to singularly flat  dialogue and a disappointingly superficial exploration of motive.  </P> <P> On home ground when she's describing the mental and physical degeneration of a  vulnerable woman victimized by a vicious man, Brownmiller is less assured when  she attempts to portray the complex pathology of extreme drug dependence.  Ultimately, the sordid, numbed world in which Nussbaum and Steinberg lived  eludes writer and reader. Moderately effective as an account of psychosexual  dependence, "Waverly Place" falters when it ventures beyond the confines of the  apartment into the obscure recesses of an addict's mind.  </P> <P> Brownmiller's version of Hedda is a pathetically ordinary young woman named  Judith Winograd; a Brooklyn College graduate who dreams of becoming a novelist.  In 1970, when she's picked up at a Greenwich Village street fair by a  smooth-talking hustler named Barry Kantor, she's 28 years old, stuck in a  poorly paid job, living alone in a gloomy studio; spending a June morning  fingering the curios at a sidewalk stall and hoping her desperation doesn't  show. "Brooklyn gypsy with a ton of hair spray, perky. A type he liked." By  afternoon she's in Barry's apartment, blissfully stoned; thrilled at having  been picked out of the crowd by this hip, swaggering lawyer who rolled a joint  as if he'd just stepped off the set of "Easy Rider."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Early Romance  </P> <P> At first, he takes her hiking at Bear Mountain and skiing in Vermont,  introduces her to the Kama Sutra, and she thinks she's the luckiest girl who  ever crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan. Within a few months, Judith is  living in Barry's brownstone apartment, blindly catering to his outrageous  whims, alienated from family and friends; the world well lost for love.  </P> <P> Struggling to learn survival tactics, she tries to avoid doing anything that  might send Barry into one of his frequent rages, blaming herself whenever she's  brutalized. Always a dissembler, she becomes an expert liar, explaining away  the bruises and black eyes as accidents, keeping her distance from the  busybodies at her office. Their halfhearted advances rebuffed, her colleagues  leave her alone, telling themselves that her private life is none of their  business as long as the work gets done.  </P> <P> Barry makes sure there's always a supply of Valium, pot, cocaine and finally  heroin to take the edge off the anguish. The drugs erode Judith's fragile will  and vestigial self-respect, effectively dulling the emotional and physical  pain. Her captor couldn't have found a more malleable subject.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Baby Broker  </P> <P> By 1981, when they acquire the first of the two children, Judith is entirely  his creature, a zombie programmed to follow his orders unquestioningly. Barry  Kantor's law practice has never been more than a matter of defending drug  dealers and users, many of whom paid him with stock in trade. What cash there  was came from a lucrative sideline as a baby broker. Driven by greed, he tries  to extort more money from clients by actually auctioning a child to the highest  bidder, and when both sets of prospective parents back off, he brings the baby  home to Judith.  </P> <P> For a few years, the role of adoring father amuses him; then it abruptly palls.  From this point on, Brownmiller seems content to record the nightmare  essentially as documented by the media; reducing the convoluted social issues  to an anomalous form that seems a novel in name only.  </P></p>

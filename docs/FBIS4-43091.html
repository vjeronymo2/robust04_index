			<p>BFN     [Text] On the last day of the preelection period, Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou appeared optimistic that a solution  will be found to the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] before the autumn.    The prime minister told [television station] Antenna "I know  that elections will be held there (Skopje) sometime this fall,  but, I believe there is a possibility of closing the issue  before the fall. Allow me to keep to myself the reasons for  this belief." Papandreou appeared to be attributing particular  significance to the upcoming meeting between Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias and international mediator Cyrus Vance in New  York.    The prime minister also appeared optimistic about the  development of our country's relations with Albania and Turkey.  He said that yesterday Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi  asked to meet Papoulias, adding: "There is a possibility--not a  certainty, just possibility--that the climate will change." He  made it clear that the meeting will be held only when we are  "satisfied that the rights of the Greek minority are being  respected."    Papandreou described the meeting between the Greek and  Turkish foreign ministers in Istanbul as positive because, as he  said, Papoulias "was given the impression that the artificially  shrill tone of the tension may begin be abating." He stressed  that Greece wants good relations with Turkey, which "has  significant domestic difficulties and wants to divert its people  somewhere else." He added that this is why Turkey recently  resorted to creating artificial tension in our bilateral  relations.    Referring to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  suggestion that Greece disarm its planes when they fly over the  Aegean, Papandreou noted that Greece is responsible for the  Athens FIR [Flight Information Region], which is being violated  by Turkish airplanes. He said: "If we were entering Turkey's  airspace with aircraft that were equipped for maneuvers or  anything else, then Turkey would be justified in speaking about  a violation of its own airspace." He stressed that the problem  is due to Turkish violations of Greek airspace.    The prime minister showed that he does not believe that the  United States has a single policy toward Greece, and made a  clear distinction between U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Christopher.    Papandreou reiterated that the government reshuffle will not  be extensive, and he congratulated Justice Minister Yeoryios  Kouvelakis, Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos, and  Konstandinos Laliotis, the Environment, Town Planning, and  Public Works minister, for the work they have done, making it  clear that they will not be replaced. He avoided commenting on  ministers' disputes or statements.    He said he does not believe in a collective PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] leadership after him, adding:  "I believe a pyramid is unavoidable." He reiterated that the  next PASOK prime minister will be elected by the party's  congress and that he will take a position himself. He  criticized New Democracy [ND] Chairman Miltiadhis Evert because  "he supported the drachma with words but actually undermined it  by saying that the state would not have enough to pay pensions."  He recalled that ND helped Sali Berisha become Albania's  president.  <H5>  With Vance </H5>   The talks between Greece and Skopje, which will be held at  foreign ministerial level with Vance's help, may not begin  before 16 June. According to relevant statements by the UN  spokesman, there may be a short delay in the talks; Vance  recently said the talks would resume "around 13 June."    Last week, U.S. envoy Matthew Nimetz visited Athens and  Skopje, essentially preparing the climate for the New York talks.</p>

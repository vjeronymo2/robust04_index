			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CALIFORNIA CUISINE'S COOKING COMBINES CREATIVE,  CONTEMPORARY  </P> <P> One rarely hears California cuisine discussed these days, even though the style  thrives under the nurturing care of some of the state's better chefs.  </P> <P> The term may have died at the hands of chain-feedery executives and their  public relations minions, who bullied it savagely. (One publicity release  mailed by a leading San Diego firm touted a client's menu of "California  cuisine dishes like prime rib and New York sirloin"). Thus, the term was  frequently invoked to describe the suburban can-of-soup school of cooking,  which jumbles ill-matched ingredients at will while praying for the best.  </P> <P> One also rarely hears mention of the Hillcrest restaurant named California  Cuisine, even though it continues to turn out thoughtful, imaginative,  contemporary-style fare for what seems a fairly steady clientele. The  intelligence behind the cooking reveals itself when one glances down the list  of menu entries, which features dishes that sometimes sound fantastic but never  implausible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Menu Printed Daily  </P> <P> Chef Chris Walsh prints the menu daily, and it recently commenced with chilled  watermelon and lime soup and concluded with steamed halibut with tropical fruit  and mint vinaigrette. These two dishes made intriguing brackets to a list that  also mentioned such teasers as a shrimp tamale sauced with margarita beurre  blanc (a creamy butter sauce flavored with lime and tequila) and charbroiled  duck, glazed with dark rum and garnished with papaya.  </P> <P> Each of these dishes was undoubtedly novel, but none seemed like the modern  equivalent of a drugstore lunch-counter special. Real knowledge of technique is  required by anyone who hopes to puzzle together unlikely combinations of  ingredients into workable dishes, and such knowledge seems in generous supply  here.  </P> <P> Just as some dishes are overlaid with tone upon tone, the dining room's soft  gray color scheme is highlighted with pastel abstract paintings and extravagant  protea blossoms in table-top vases. The service proceeds smoothly, and it  should be mentioned -- only because so few San Diego restaurants trouble  themselves with this important detail -- that hot preparations arrive on hot  plates.  </P> <P> A recent menu offered so many wildly creative appetizers that the temptation  arose to order several and call them dinner. A cream soup elaborated from  smoked onions and sun-dried tomatoes sounded promising and proved the smash hit  of the evening. Chocolate in color, it approached the taste buds gradually and  tasted smoky only after the first several sips -- a really remarkable soup, it  was velvety, sweet, deep-toned and rich, and offered more than might reasonably  have been expected of its two main ingredients.  </P> <P> Another starter was a fine example of how California and contemporary cuisine  updates and transforms traditional dishes. The menu described the finished  product as a "crayfish chili relleno with black bean sauce and cilantro creme  fraiche." It was an altogether elegant and novel presentation of a time-honored  Mexican specialty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subtle Bean Sauce  </P> <P> Because crayfish tails are now fashionable, it seemed natural enough for them  to be included along with the traditional cheese in the filling. The pepper  itself was battered and fried in the normal method, but, instead of the typical  red sauce and (sometimes) sour cream garnish, the kitchen used the subtle black  bean sauce as a reminder of the beans often used in Mexican cooking. The  cilantro-flavored creme fraiche (a thick, cultured cream) stood in nicely for  the sour cream.  </P> <P> The menu devotes a good bit of space to elaborate salads (none of which were  sampled, although the "Thai mosaic" with grilled scallops sounded like it had  great potential) and to pastas, which, like so many restaurants now, California  Cuisine treats as only incidentally Italian. The "California carbonara" proved  one of the least interesting of the kitchen's offerings. Traditionally, this  dish calls for spaghetti or fettuccine to be tossed with crisp bacon, beaten  eggs and Parmesan cheese. California cuisine changed the formula only slightly  by slipping in a bit of white sauce and some sauteed mushrooms. Other, perhaps  better, choices were fettuccine with chicken, asparagus and cashews in brown  butter, and linguine with shrimp, shiitake mushrooms and roasted garlic butter.  </P> <P> This sense of exploration continues under the entree list, which offers such  things as chicken breast dressed with a spicy walnut, sesame and tomato butter;  veal chop with gingered brandy and chestnut cream, and lamb loin in a highly  seasoned, Chinese-style plum sauce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Real Star of Show  </P> <P> The real star of the show here, however, was an outrageously beautiful grilled  filet of Norwegian salmon, cooked somewhat on the rare side and lightly charred  so that the moist flesh took on an intense flavor. The fish rested in a puddle  of banana-ginger chutney, a smooth, exotic sauce that offered pleasingly  complementary sweet and sharp accents.  </P> <P> A dish of pork medallions, garnished with plump figs and doused with a mild  Zinfandel sauce, showed how ingredients sometimes work together to make a dish  special. A bite of pork taken with the sauce alone actually was rather bland,  but with a bit of fig added to the mix the sauce seemed intense and the meat  much more savory.  </P> <P> When the waiter recited the list of desserts, replete with the usual chocolate  and fruit fantasies, he also mentioned something that sounded so modest that it  seemed out of place at California Cuisine. That fact alone meant there must be  something interesting about the lime/poppy-seed cake in pear sauce. A rather  dry yet tender cake, it took flavors somewhat foreign to American  dessert-making and used them quite cleverly. The flavors were, in fact, muted  but companionable, the pear sauce adding the necessary note of sweetness and  the poppy seeds an elegant and very old-fashioned presence.  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA CUISINE  </P> <P> 1027 University Ave.  </P> <P> 543-0790  </P> <P> Dinner served Tuesday through Sunday; closed Monday.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $35 to $75.  </P></p>

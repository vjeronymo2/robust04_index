			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Clarke warns of too much green concern Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor of the exchequer, warned yesterday that concern about the environment and social issues could be exploited as a cloak for restricting trade. Speaking to the policy-making interim committee of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Clarke said that the new World Trade Organisation, which has been set up after the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, would need to confront the dangers of protectionism. In particular, the programme of work of the World Trade Organisation's trade and environment committee would have to be 'rigorously defined and scrupulously followed,' Mr Clarke said. 'It would be all too easy, for example, for protectionist trading practices to establish themselves under the cloak of legitimate environmental concerns,' he added. Furthering national interests by banning imports of goods which had been produced by processes deemed to be environmentally harmful was 'no better than covert protectionism,' the chancellor said. Mr Clarke also called on countries to resist pressure to use the WTO to enforce minimum labour standards in member states. The chancellor argued that differences in labour costs and practices were an integral part of a country's competitive advantage - or lack of it. 'Forcing developing countries to adopt higher standards, in the name of fairness, will not make them richer. It will deny them the ability and the right to develop, making them poorer still,' Mr Clarke said.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Vietnam debts financed Japan and France will each pay Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.7m) towards settling Vietnam's Dollars 140m arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sources close to negotiations on the deal said yesterday in Hanoi, Reuter reports from Hanoi. At least five other countries - Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany and Sweden - are expected to supply the remaining Dollars 40m, the sources said. Paying off the arrears will enable Vietnam - in line for up to Dollars 1bn in new multilateral funding to improve its infrastructure - to seek fresh IMF loans in return for agreement on a structural adjustment programme. The seven countries and possibly others are due to attend a Vietnam support group conference in Paris in mid-September to sort out the repayments, expected to be made through a banking consortium led by the Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur.</p>

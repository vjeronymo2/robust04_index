			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A SIGNAL FOR SHAMIR'  </P> <P> Yasser Arafat's "recognition of Israel" can be compared with a fairy tale.  </P> <P> We constantly read in the media (editorial) that Israel "occupies" the  territories of the West Bank and Gaza.  </P> <P> When will the media, including The Times, and our State Department cease  referring to the West Bank and Gaza as "occupied territories"?  </P> <P> Isn't it clear that for some 22 years Israel has been administering territories  which it won decisively in self-defense under pressure from surrounding  belligerent Arab countries?  </P> <P> The reality is that Israel must work out a system of rapprochement with Arab  residents within the borders finalized at the conclusion of the 1967 Six Day  War.  </P> <P> Nobody, especially those of us not living within the borders of such a tiny  country as Israel, could possibly experience the pressure of life and the  feeling of insecurity as the Israelis do under the constant threat of  annihilation by its Arab neighbors.  </P> <P> Poppycock to the suggestion of "land for peace." Peace as a promise from any  Arab government is only a fantasy as perceived by those who want to believe in  unrealities. Arab leaders are as stable and expendable as yesterday's bread.  </P> <P> As long as Israel remains strong the wolves will stay away from her door, and  U.S. interests and influence will be protected by its staunchest and only  friend in the Middle East, Israel.  </P> <P> DAVID BECK  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

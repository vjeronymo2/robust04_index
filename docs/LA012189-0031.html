			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLINS' ANTICS ARE NOT WHAT SURFING IS ABOUT  </P> <P> I have been surfing longer than Richie Collins has been alive, and I can  positively state that he is not what surfing is all about. In fact, he and  hordes of other immature, self-centered high school dropouts are what make it  almost impossible to enjoy a morning session in the L.A.-Orange County area  anymore.  </P> <P> And Richie: Please keep you and your "souped-up truck" out of Baja; there's  nothing worse than another "ugly American" screaming wildly through the  serenity of a Mexican morning.  </P> <P> Grow up . . . You can still be a great surfer without being a jerk.  </P> <P> DAVE HOLMES  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

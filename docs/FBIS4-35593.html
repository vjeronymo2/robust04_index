			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second and final part of "exclusive" interview with Shaykh </F> Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, chairman of the Higher Islamic  Shiite Council, in Lebanon by unidentified ETTELA'AT  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [ETTELA'AT] How do you view Iran's role in  political, economic, and security developments in the Middle  East?    [Shams-al-Din] The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the  greater governments of the region and is capable of becoming  even greater, in view of its population and geographical base.  There is no doubt that a political role is of foremost  importance.    We are confronting problems that we should be prepared to  understand so that the region may not experience negative  developments. We are aware that the region has entered a phase  that is being characterized by peace operations in the Middle  East and in the world. As I have said frequently, most of the  Arab systems have not entered this phase willingly.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has not entered this phase and  has declared its dissatisfaction with what has occurred  ideologically and politically in the wake of the peace  operations. Even though the Zionist entity is a regional  phenomenon, it is an unlawful one.    If circumstances were to move toward what is known as peace  talks, the region would be engulfed in conflicting political  ideologies. One of these believes in compromise and abiding by  the results of these talks and the other rejects compromise and  its results; the last one is mostly prevalent in the Arab world.  This is because the Islamic movements in the Arab world and in  part of the non-Arab world contribute to this view and prefer  this stance.    The current phase that is taking shape is placing heavy  responsibility on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Arab  systems. We believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran is  necessary for the Arab world and vice versa. Therefore, a  proper policy should be formulated for an appropriate approach  by the Islamic Republic of Iran toward the realities present in  the Arab systems. The latter should also have a more suitable  attitude toward the stance chosen by the Islamic Republic of  Iran--which should not be construed as inevitable--regarding the  developments in the Middle East.    The stance adopted by Iran is its own choice and is not an  unavoidable necessity as Iran can adapt to events. However,  Iran has adopted the harder approach. At this stage, all of us  should move toward coexistence to attain mutual understanding.  If we were able to do so, it would be a major achievement.    The Iranian stance should be coordinated with Arab needs and  vice versa so that it can assume a more suitable form. Without  this equilibrium, an erratic and inappropriate trend will be  generated on which the Zionists and the West will capitalize.  They will be able to exploit the Arabs even more and will  acquire more power to strengthen the embargo against the Islamic  Republic of Iran. [passage omitted].    I should emphasize that if God grants us success so that we  are able to achieve conformity between the stances of the Arabs  and the Islamic Republic of Iran, it will give Iran ample  opportunity to share in the security of the region and to  safeguard its own security. This will also enable it to  minimize the siege that the West is seeking to impose on it.    However, if this reciprocal understanding is not achieved, I  cannot express what ill-omened consequences it will have on the  security of the Islamic Republic of Iran and on some Arab  governments. We can also view the economic impact within this  perspective. If the policies of the two sides are harmonized  and yield results, the neighboring and non-neighboring countries  will provide a suitable market for Iran and the Iranian market  will probably be beneficial for them. This will generate  reciprocal economic growth for Iran and the Arab governments.  On this basis, we tell the Arabs that economic cooperation with  Iran can be one of the most important instruments of resistance  in the face of Zionist collusion.    Iran is capable of preventing the imminent compromise from  happening, as was the case at the time of the Islamic Revolution  when Iran created an equilibrium in the region. We are hoping  for the glad tidings resulting from the closeness between the  Islamic Republic of Iran and some of the Arab governments, such  as the monarchies of Morocco and Jordan as well as the Kuwaiti  Government.    We are optimistic that this scope will expand and that all  the Arab countries will join this trend without exception; we  have made efforts toward this end in the past. Regardless of  who initiates this trend, it is hoped that both sides will adopt  a positive approach toward it. I do not see any other means of  promoting mutual relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran  and the Arab world.    [ETTELA'AT] In view of the political, economic, and security  developments in the Middle East, what difficulties do you  foresee for Islamism and what avenues do you perceive for its  future growth?    [Shams-al-Din] The most important issue for the Arab and  non-  Arab Muslims, after that of the Zionist regime, is the Islamic  movement. This movement is a manifestation of the spirit of the  ummah, which is a source of strength and power and exists among  all Islamic nations. Iran is an exception among the Islamic  movements as it was victorious, and today it is formulating its  own policies. I can openly assert that whatever goes on outside  Iran has a spiritual link to Iran. [passage omitted]    At its outset, the Islamist movement in Algeria mobilized  all  its resources in the elections, which was a mistake. It would  have been better if it had not projected itself as the foremost  force in Algeria, and as we mentioned to some of its prominent  figures, it should have appeared on the scene gradually so that  the Algerian system would not have risen in confrontation.    On the other hand, society was not ready to accept what the  Islamist movement represented, as such a plan needs time in a  society such as that of Algeria. It was not the kind of society  in which the Islamic experiment could be implemented immediately.    It is necessary to ponder two topics: One is that only non-  Islamic governments are against the Islamic movement. In fact,  some of the nations who are not totally ready for this plan are  on our side. Our nations are Muslim, and even though the  experiment of a Western-style government has proved unsuccessful  for them, this does not mean that they are ready to accept the  Islamic experiment in view of their current obligations.    The other point is that the Islamic movement, with the  exception of Iran, incorporates a political plan and needs the  guarantee of a political democracy. It is possible that this  could be in the form of a real council and not a pyramid-type  structure.    After the Persian Gulf war, we proposed that an open, frank,  and realistic debate on the negative effects of the  organizational structure and existing trends in the strategy of  the Islamic movements be conducted. This is because the Persian  Gulf crisis underlined the deep problems that exist in the  larger Islamic movement groups. We perceived that most of these  problems resulted from the actions of Saddam Husayn, who had  projected himself as an imam Khomeyni to the world. He tried to  adopt the imam Khomeyni way of speaking and an approach used by  Gamal 'Abd-al-Nasir.    There were many who were deceived by Saddam's slogans, and  this caused a disruption in the relations between governments  and nations with the Islamic movements. [passage omitted]    [ETTELA'AT] What is your appraisal of the present and future  situation in Lebanon in the economic, political, and cultural  areas?    [Shams-al-Din] At present all of us are waiting to see how  events shape up. Some describe this period as a formative one  or one of peace resulting from certain developments that are in  the throes of materializing in the Middle East. In this  environment, Lebanon is an area that is bound to be affected by  regional developments, depending on the extent of its  involvement in these events. In light of the nature of its  domestic system, it is endowed with more brilliant and numerous  factors for recovery than other Arab countries. Lebanon does  not require internal economic changes, as it was the founder of  a free economy in the region and has enjoyed greater democracy  than other Arab countries.    Another factor that ensures Lebanon's future is the variety  provided by the presence of Christian and Muslim elements in its  society. These are factors that lend it a distinctiveness  compared to other Arab societies. If a plan to set up a system  in the Middle East region or a proposal for a regional accord  fails, Lebanon has resources to detach itself from this climate  or to minimize the negative effects. I believe that, despite  the presence of a state of political flux and a political crisis  situation, Lebanon has put the dangerous stage behind it.    The conditions are not as bright as the Lebanese Government  projects, but the current situation will not continue and the  economic conditions will improve. I would not describe it as  brilliant but I believe that in the next year we will witness  better conditions in the Lebanese economy. [passage omitted]</p>

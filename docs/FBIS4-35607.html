			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 May (MENA)-- OAU Secretary General Dr.  Salim Ahmed Salim arrived in Cairo this evening. In an arrival  statement, Salim said that he will meet with President Husni  Mubarak to discuss a number of important issues and the  preparations for the 31st African summit conference, which will  be held in Tunis next month. He indicated that he will also meet  with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa.    Salim expressed concern at the failure to find peaceful  solutions to problems facing the African continent. He  explained that the situation in Rwanda is keeps getting more  serious. He expressed the view that the United Nations must be  urged to try to stop the fighting and discuss the possibility of  a peaceful settlement in coordination with the OAU and the  African states, which in turn are making efforts in this respect.    Regarding the developments in Yemen, Salim said that the  situation there has become extremely complicated. A solution  must be reached quickly to end the conflict and maintain unity.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour calls for end to BT curb LABOUR yesterday called for an end to the ban on British Telecommunications providing entertainment services in return for its agreement to reduce 'drastically' the number of people without a phone, Andrew Adonis writes. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the 10-year ban - imposed by the government two years ago to encourage cable TV companies to build local phone and cable TV networks - was 'grossly unfair'. He said: 'Its only benefit is to BT's international rivals. North American telecoms companies have major stakes in 93 per cent of cable TV operators. 'It is a disincentive to BT to invest in the UK, forcing it to spend its money abroad,' he added, pointing to BT's recent Dollars 4.3bn investment in MCI, the second-largest US operator. BT welcomed Labour's support for an end to the entertainment ban, which it claims is anti-competitive and a hindrance to its capacity to finance an advanced fibre-optic network within local exchanges, but it refused to concede the need for further reductions in connection charges to increase lines.</p>

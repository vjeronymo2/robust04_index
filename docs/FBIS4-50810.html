			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wei Jingsheng (7614 0079 3932) dated 30 November </F> 1993: "China and the World" -- originally published in OU CHOU  JIH PAO; first three paragraphs are editor's note]    [Text] It was rumored that Wei Jingsheng, who was detained  by the mainland authorities on 1 April this year, would be  prosecuted and tried once again. Although Beijing has denied  the rumor, Wei Jingsheng's fate in the days to come worries the  outside world to a certain extent.    At the beginning of this year, a female French Sinologist, a  friend of Wei Jingsheng, brought the two articles which Wei  Jingsheng wrote at the end of last year to France. At that  time, Wei told her that he hoped to see the two articles  published in Europe. Being devoted to the trust conferred on  her, his friend wrote and published articles in CROISSANCE and  LIBERATION, introducing the contents of the two articles. The  Chinese versions of the two articles were handed to OU CHOU JIH  PAO [EUROPE DAILY], a subsidiary of LIEN HO PAO, for exclusive  publication. This newspaper reprints them today. Wei Jingsheng  entitled his articles "China and the World" and "How to Invest  in China." Today we reprint the article: "China and the World."    In his article "China and the World," Wei Jingsheng appealed  to European and American countries to support the democracy  movement and the reform process in mainland China for the sake  of long-term interest. He maintained that the issue of the fate  and future of the Chinese people is a major issue which has a  bearing on the future of mankind and it is much more important  than selling a nuclear power station.    It is common knowledge that China is equal to one-fourth of  mankind. It is the only great classic civilization that has  lasted up to this day, and so far is the largest country that  has been under one-party rule by the Communist Party.  Nevertheless, what kind of country is China, in reality? What  kind of people are the Chinese? What kind of relationship do  they share with the other parts of the world? These are things  on which no one is very clear. This being the case, it is both a  logical and extremely dangerous state of affairs that importance  has not yet been attached to China's affairs and to its  influence on the future world.  <H5>  China Does Not Necessarily Lack Any Tradition of Legality </H5>   China has age-old cultural traditions that differ from  European culture. China's culture is unique, and has been very  successful over the past 5,000 years. Apparently, it will  retain the majority of its fine substance in the years to come,  and on that basis, a new cultural system will be formed. Some  Chinese and Europeans maintain that, like many other backward or  weak nations, China can accept European culture totally and  uncritically, and can develop its modern civilization with  European culture as the mainstay. This is obviously wrong. The  reason this is wrong is not that China is incompatible with  modern European civilization. Quite the contrary, the Chinese  were the fastest in accepting the European culture among all  nations besides the Europeans; they were even faster than some  European nations.    More often than not, Westerners who know the Chinese are  amazed at the speed and the degree of understanding with which  the Chinese (not referring exclusively to the Chinese of today)  accept Western cultures, as well as science and technology. The  fact that Western science and technology -- and cultures, in  particular, those forerunners of democratic and liberal ideas --  and Chinese traditional culture have close links shows that  Chinese and Western civilizations are not incompatible.  Otherwise, we would be unable to explain why Copernicus,  Leibniz, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and others were very  familiar with, and even had the greatest esteem for Chinese  culture. Although Europe's modern democratic legal system  differs in essence from China's classic autocratic legal system,  Montesquieu charted the blueprint for Europe's modern legal  system by using China's classic forms of legal system as direct  reference. Therefore, the allegation by the Communists, and of  the royalists of the older generation before them, that the  Chinese lack a tradition of legality is sheer nonsense.  <H5>  The CPC Does Not Tolerate the Existence of a Normal Legal </H5> System    In fact, when it comes to some of the basic ideas of the  modern legal system, such as "Everyone being equal before the  law," the Europeans were not the first to discover them;  instead, they were translated directly by the forerunners of  democracy -- including Montesquieu -- from China's legal system  culture. The principle that "if a prince violates the law, he  will be punished just like ordinary people" has existed in  Chinese legal clauses for at least 2,000 years. Although these  modern principles and ideas of legality were not accurately  guaranteed in the classical autocratic legal system, and were  violated frequently by members of the ruling groups, which had  unrestricted supreme power in their hands, they really served as  the basis on which honest law-enforcement personnel protected  the people's rights and interests, thus playing a genuine role  -- to a certain extent -- in protecting human rights and in  maintaining social fairness and stability. The forerunners of  democracy and the legal system in Europe have raised the status  and role of these ideas and principles greatly, and have  developed a completely new democratic legal system, thus  enabling these basic ideas and principles to play a greater role  in protecting human rights and maintaining stability. Thus, the  argument asserting that the Chinese -- who were the earliest to  put forward these ideas and principles and who had been familiar  with them for more than 2,000 years -- were not suited to the  ideas and principles of legality which obviously were favorable  to them can be nothing but sheer nonsense. I can hardly find  any other more accurate adjectives.    This kind of lawless situation exists in China, but it is  not a continuity of Chinese tradition. It was borrowed by the  Chinese communists from the non-legal tradition in ancient  European culture. They integrated this kind of feudal and  antilegal "communism" with "small-peasant liberalism," which was  a branch of the traditional Chinese culture, to form the  "Chinese-style Maoist" legal ideology. They used this ideology  to mobilize the peasants to overthrow the legal system that had  lasted for more than 2,000 years in China, and they built a  contemporary lawless despotic regime characterized by  small-peasant opportunism. This despotic regime, therefore, is  unable to tolerate the existence of a normal legal system, no  matter in terms of ideological principle or in terms of  practice. So 40 years after the nation's founding, a  preliminary legal system still is nowhere to be found, so  naturally the country cannot be ruled by law. It resembles a  robot, and you treat its head when its head aches, treat its  foot when its foot hurts. There is always a specific therapy  for every illness, but there is no fixed, predictable, and  systematic prescription for every illness. Therefore, politics  in China can only maintain this kind of chaotic situation, which  is highly fortuitous, unpredictable, and adjusted by a small  handful of persons using expedient measures. This style of  maintenance is the most difficult one, as well as an operational  style that places the harshest demands on leaders. Or it may be  regarded as a style for which it is almost impossible to find a  suitable operator to ensure its good operation, so I say that  the CPC regime is a power structure that harbors great factors  for turmoil.  <H5>  Internal Power Struggle Most Likely Cause for Turmoil </H5>   Turmoil can erupt in many areas and in different ways. The  greatest possibility is that it will erupt from the power  struggle within the CPC. Reason number one: Although peasant  and worker riots are the easiest way for it to erupt, owing to  the overwhelming difference between their own ability and the  might of the modern machine of suppression, riots can be only  the catalyst for intensifying social conflict and cannot be the  main way to overthrow the government. Reason number two: The  road through which an opposition party promotes progressive  changes or so-called peaceful evolution to democratic system has  been completely blocked by those in power. With the silent  consent of governments in the West, the CPC gradually has  tightened its control over the mass media, to the extent that  new thoughts and ideas cannot spread. So the possibility that  exploration into new thoughts and ideas may lead to social  consensus diminishes, whereas the CPC does not have new thoughts  and ideas that can win a general consensus in society. What it  has is only the evil method of eliminating its opponents in a  brutal and unreasonable way. Thus, Chinese society will maintain  a blind, confused, chaotic, and antigovernment mentality for a  long period of time. This is how things are at the moment.  Aside from the fact that the CPC fails to offer any presentable  and convincing theory, even if it could, it would find no major  opponent. The CPC solves one problem only to find another  cropping up. Apart from normal modern democratic thought, there  are numerous strange thoughts and theories confronting the CPC's  lack-of-thinking theory in the struggle to win hearts and minds,  and almost all of them are very successful. To conclude, the  most likely cause for great turmoil in China in the future is  the struggle for power and interests within the CPC.  <H5>  China's Influence Greater Than Is Estimated by Historians </H5>   Over the past four decades, owing to the self-imposed  closure  by the CPC and the blockade by the international community,  China was comparatively isolated from the world, so for many  people, China has nothing much to do with the world. Many  people even think that China's situation does not have anything  to do with their countries and their interests; so why bother  whether the Chinese people live or die? Although this kind of  thinking is not quite in line with the humanitarianism and  humanism declared by the Europeans, it is indeed a principle  followed by many European politicians, and it also influences  the attitude of a majority of Europeans. In fact, these  politicians who believe in pragmatism have covered up many facts  that already have happened and will soon happen beside you.    Since the middle of 19th century, when China and Europe  began  frequent trade interactions, every major incident that happened  in China has had something to do with the West, and has become  an important topic in the governments and parliaments in the  Western countries. By the time of World War II, China already  had become one of the major and indispensable members of the  Western allies, and the important role it played in winning the  antifascist war can be matched only by the two great countries:  The United States and the Soviet Union. The trends of this  century have indicated that the closer China's relationship with  the rest of the world becomes, the more evident is its  importance as the largest part of mankind. The importance of  this nation, which Napoleon called a sleeping lion, is in direct  proportion to the degree of its consciousness. After World War  II, the situation was even more shocking. The establishment of  the Maoist regime changed the political pattern of the whole  world, and almost every foreign and domestic condition and  policy in the Western countries was affected by this incident.  The theory of violent revolution exported by Mao Zedong also  became the main ideology in the world during the 1960's and  1970's, and its influence spread to every corner of the world  and has not yet disappeared even to this day. What is more  important is that the Democracy Wall movement and the continuous  development of the pro- democracy movement in China, have become  the starting point for the tides of democracy in "socialist  countries," and its important role in human history cannot  possibly be adequately evaluated by contemporary historians or  anybody else. The importance of such a country should be beyond  dispute, and any change it goes through -- for better or for  worse -- will have a decisive impact on the future development  of mankind which will be hard to evaluate.    If some  politicians have to satisfy the need of some businessmen, so  they tell you that "it is unimportant," would you not feel that  this is an extremely irresponsible deception? I think, if I  were a French or American politician who had a responsible  attitude toward his country and people, I would sacrifice some  commercial sponsorships or even votes, in order to fully support  China's democracy movement and reform process because whether  China has a strong noncommunist democracy movement is a crucial  and decisive factor determining whether China can embark on the  road of cooperation between the government and the people in  peacefully reforming the social system. Whether China follows  the road of peaceful democratic reform or waits for a war among  the warlords is no longer a matter that concerns the fate and  future of the Chinese people alone; it also has a bearing on the  immediate interests of the French and American peoples. I think  that this is more important than whether or not they can sell  one more nuclear power plant because the interests of the French  and American peoples do not terminate when tenures expire. An  old saying in China goes: One who has no long-term  considerations has imminent worries. A person who looks down on  long-term interests often will be plagued by present  difficulties that he cannot overcome.  <H5>  The West Should Help Promoting Democracy Movement </H5>   I want to take this opportunity to tell everyone that my  friendship with the Europeans begins with two Frenchmen. It is  precisely from them that I have discovered that the Chinese and  Europeans can understand and help each other easily. I hope  this kind of friendship and understanding can break through the  blockade by the CPC and reach out to all Europeans and Chinese.  This way, our world certainly would be a better one!

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / China's leaders struggle to keep rampant inflation under control China faces a formidable task bringing inflation down to manageable levels this year and has no chance of achieving its revised target of 13 per cent for the year, according to western economists in Beijing. Economists are forecasting retail price rises of 19-20 per cent for the year, and urban cost of living increases of 22-24 per cent, compared with a national retail price index rise of 13 per cent in 1993 and cost of living rise of 19.8 per cent in the major cities. China's leaders announced last week that fighting inflation would be the government's main priority for the rest of the year. They also foreshadowed a slowing of economic reforms such as attempts to rationalise state-owned enterprises, many of which are virtually bankrupt. Premier Li Peng, in his work report in March to the National People's Congress, the Chinese parliament, set 9 per cent as a target for retail price rises this year, but that figure has since been revised to 13 per cent. The government also has little chance of keeping to its economic growth target of 9 per cent for the year. Economists expect real GDP growth to average 11.5 per cent this year. Fears of social unrest fuelled by rising prices and lay-offs from state factories prompted a high-level review of economic strategy. Thousands of workers have either lost their jobs or are living on subsistence wages following the imposition of a credit squeeze last year. Chinese leaders have been walking a tightrope in their efforts to maintain high rates of economic growth to absorb the unemployed, while at the same time seeking to keep inflation in check by restraining growth in money supply and tightening credit. Resurgent inflation in June and July pushed the leadership into more decisive measures, including a freeze on price increases on services such as transport and electricity for the rest of the year. Local leaderships were put on notice that they would be held responsible for discouraging price rises. 'The ability of local governments to control the retail price index and consumer price index will be used to assess their achievements and will be made public every month,' said a circular by the State Council, the cabinet, published by People's Daily, the communist party newspaper. According to a survey of price movements this year conducted by a western embassy in Beijing, the monthly inflation rate in June and July picked up to more than 3 per cent compared with a slowing in the rate of increase in previous months to 1 per cent. In July, the national retail price index was 21.4 per cent higher than a year earlier, while the urban cost of living was 24 per cent higher. Annualised retail prices in the first seven months of this year rose by 20 per cent. In major cities the rate of inflation exceeded 25 per cent. Western economists attributed the reversal of inflation trends in June and July to an easing of credit in the second quarter in response to a clamour for assistance from failing state enterprises. Credit and deposit balances of the banks increased in May-June and the money supply expanded. At the end of June the amount of money in circulation was 19 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. Capital spending leapt in July. It was 73 per cent higher than in the same month last year, and surged by 29 percentage points over June. A binge in investment in fixed assets last year was one of the main cause of inflationary pressure that built up through 1993. Economists doubt that price constraints will be effective over the longer term. Food price subsidies are regarded as 'short-term palliatives' and ones that will bring their own problems as they will add to the budget deficit. Falling producer prices - prices of steel and other raw materials were down sharply this year - suggest there may be an easing of cost pressures in the latter part of this year. However, promised wage rises in the second half of the year will counteract this trend. Pressures on food prices - the food price index rose by 31.9 in the 12 months to July - are likely to continue. Severe flooding in China's southern provinces and drought in the north have resulted in major crop losses. Possible further increases this year in grain prices to improve returns to a restless peasantry would jeopardise anti-inflation measures. The government raised the price of grain by more than 50 per cent to consumers this year, and this was a major cause of the jump in the food price index. China's leaders face a testing six months. There are no easy choices as they seek to balance a commitment to reform with a perceived political need to check inflation. Western officials have no doubt that if measures announced this week to restrain price increases fail, the authorities will resort to more draconian measures such as a return to rigid price controls on staple commodities.</p>

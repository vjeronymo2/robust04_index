We asked him on this occasion, shortly  before Prime Minister Peter Boross's official visit to Paris, to  assess our relations with France.    [Martin] How do relations with France fit into the system of  Hungarian foreign politics?    [Martonyi] We continue to see French relations as a cardinal  element of Hungary's foreign relations. I could also phrase it  this way: Paris has two dimensions from Budapest's point of  view, one is bilateral relations, and the other is that France  is one of the determining factors in our Europe policy.    As for bilateral relations, it has been said many times  that,  throughout history, Hungarian-French relations have never been  as good as now. And these relations are constantly improving.  Consulting with the general secretary of the Foreign Ministry a  few days ago, we established that our views are identical on  most issues, although some differences of approach exist on  certain issues.    Therefore, in my view, we cannot do much more in the area of  bilateral relations, except encouraging more capital investment  by French investors, and we try to improve domestic conditions  for this. We continue to try to strengthen the French presence  in Hungary from the economic, financial, trade, cultural,  political, and psychological points of view equally. I believe  that there is also much improvement in the public view in our  societies: The French image in Hungary has never been as good  as now, and I trust that Hungary's image is also good in France,  apart from some minor disturbing factors. However, the latter  apply to all Central Eastern Europe, not specifically to  Hungary. [passage omitted]    [Martin] For many decades, Hungary was not France's chosen  state in Central Eastern Europe. Bucharest was France's number  one partner. Can you see any change in this area?    [Martonyi] In my view, Hungarian-French relations have gone  through a qualitative improvement in the past three to four  years. We have never made it our goal to improve these relations  to the detriment of other countries. To the contrary, in our  view, French politics that are much more balanced than in the  past can contribute with increasing efficiency in resolving our  problems. We saw this in the Balladur plan from the first  moment, this is why we still support this proposal. In other  words, we do not want to improve our relations with France by  worsening relations with others, and I do not even wish to  evaluate the way Paris assesses the current situation in Romania  and the most recent change of government in Bucharest. Our  interest is that views on Central Europe generally improve.  [passage omitted]    [Martin] From the implementation of the Balladur plan,  Hungarian diplomacy expects the improvement of the life of  national minorities living in the neighboring countries.  However, it seems that a number of Western European countries  and institutions would prefer to step back in granting national  minority rights. Is there a danger that a document will again  be prepared that is not adhered to?    [Martonyi] Risks do exist, but we can exclude the  possibility of the situation becoming worse after an initiative  like this. We have to seize all opportunities, in the Council  of Europe and in other places. We trust that, even if slowly  and with difficulties, progress can be made: This is Hungarian  diplomacy's basic strategic goal. We need to be very  industrious. As regards the final outcome of the European Union  plan that is launched from the French prime minister's proposal,  I might be more optimistic than the average European. In my  view, this is a correct idea that wants to make up for a  deficiency and it can take us closer to the solution. Naturally,  if the necessary willingness to cooperate is completely missing  from the participants, there is a risk that we will not be able  to make any progress. However, this cannot mean that we will  not try. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] To develop partnership on a new basis -- this is how  Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has described  the aim of his working meeting with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, which is to be held in Vladivostok today.    Before leaving Moscow the Russian foreign minister stressed  there could be no question of partnership between senior and  junior; partners must move toward the same goals. There cannot  be more freedom for one to the detriment of the other. In any  case, it must be a bilateral approach, Kozyrev noted.    He rejected suppositions that relations have begun to cool  between the United States and Russia. There can be differences  of interests within the partnership sphere, the minister noted.</p>

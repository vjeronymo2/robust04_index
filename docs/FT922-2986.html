			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Arts: Down to earth - Radio ON WEDNESDAY, the first Ecology Debate on Radio 3 was presented by Fred Pearce, of the New Scientist. It covered, broadly, the business of the Earth Summit at Rio, although not from a wholly green angle, nor with immediate relevance to the proceedings. Professor Jim Lovelock reassured us that the planet was robust enough to meet its challenges; where once was the ichthyosaurus, now there was the dolphin. 'Forecasts of doom are always wrong,' Julian Simon said; industrialisation gave the wealth that provided the clean environment. Humanity's lot had always improved, with a longer life expectancy and a constant supply of required materials. Only Richard Sandbrook contrasted western social considerations with the rising poverty of backward peoples. Nicholas Hildyard maintained that humans were part of the environment. There could be social conditions of mutual benefit - in his example, elephant 'poaching' should be authorised to provide ivory profits for the people. A second ecological debate comes next week, but it is to deal mostly with familiar matters, and there was a feature last week on over-population. Topically, Radio 4 repeated, as its Monday afternoon play, Bruce Stewart's The Culper Tapes. This supposes a belief that the world is coming to an end, but on religious, not scientific, grounds. The prophet Elijah is about to return and, on Mount Carmel, Christians, Jews and Moslems are in conference. Felix Culper, covering this for the Third Programme, has recorded a mysterious voice, then been sacked - and taken his tapes with him. Clare (Imogen Stubbs), a new features producer, is determined to get them back and visits every potential contact, including Culper on a terminal deathbed. It all works out a bit like science-fiction, and is full of incident. Shaun MacLaughlan directed. Monday evening gave something more serious, Who Killed Palomino Molero? by Mario Vargas Llosa. 'Holy Mother]' it begins, 'My God]' - and then you hear the insects buzzing round the disgustingly murdered body of Palomino. The script is so full of such detail, sexual and physical, that many a director might have cut, but Ned Chaillet gives us the works. The scene is Peru in 1964 under a military dictatorship. Palomino was a romantic young deserter from the air force; who killed him is not the only problem, for the air force colonel and his flashy daughter are killed before the tale is done. Events are seen from the standpoint of two policemen, Lieutenant Silva (Charles Simpson) and Sergeant Libuna (Ray Fearon), who have no authority over the military. Besides all the sex relations, there is talk of the Big Fish of the contrabandistas, but the splendidly complex plot never marks the killers. Finally, the policemen are transferred discreetly to some distant region. This was outstanding radio. The arts strategy debate was concluded on Wednesday with a panel including Sir Richard Luce, who proposed the scheme when he was arts minister, and Anthony Everitt, secretary-general of the Arts Council. 'Key priorities' was the catchword, the foremost of them, naturally, costing. Of the great 170-page document itself, Tony Banks, MP, argued that it dismissed the social role of the arts too lightly; Luce that it said too little about administration. But it will all come up again in September when it will be the business of David Mellor, the new minister; and the debaters all had confidence in him.</p>

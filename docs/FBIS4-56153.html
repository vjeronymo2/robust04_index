			<p>BFN     [Text] Prishtina, May 24 (ATA) -- In an interview with  Behlul Jashari, ATA correspondent, on May 23, the rector of the  Prishtina University, Prof. Dr. Ejup Statovci, said that the  closing of the University of Prishtina by the Serbian  authorities aims at preventing studies in the Albanian language.  To this end, Serbian authorities have occupied the university  premises through force, by not allowing over 900 teachers and  over 20 thousand Albanian students to attend studies there.    According to Mr. Statovci, Albanian teachers and students  have not interrupted teaching. The classes are being held, for  the third consecutive year, in private homes in very difficult  conditions. Almost the whole Prishtina is turned into a  university. Despite the conditions, work goes on for the  modernization of the teaching process. A law has also been  prepared for the university based on the experience of the  universities of Western countries.    Mr. Statovci said that they have good relations with the  universities in Albania, particularly with the Tirana  University, which has given them a great assistance. According  to Mr. Statovci, these relations are not developing as they  should for objective reasons, one of which is the impossible  free movement of the people.</p>

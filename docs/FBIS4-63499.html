			<p>BFN     [Text] First Deputy Ukrainian Interior Minister Valentin  Nedrigailo called allegations of an impending armed  confrontation in Simferopol as a stupid statement. He told  INTERFAX-Ukraine on Sunday [22 May] evening that people were  walking across the city and nothing was happening. "This is a  state of illness" when one imagines intervention and troops in  the streets, he remarked.    Nedrigailo pointed out that there had been complete mutual  understanding and confidence between the Ukrainian and the  Crimean interior ministries. He added that the Ukrainian  National Guard units were carrying out their law enforcement  duties together with Crimean police officers.    Commenting on the information concerning Ukrainian armored  vehicles in Simferopol, Nedrigailo said their arrival in  Simferopol had been made known long ago. First Deputy Crimean  Parliament Chairman Viktor Mezhak and a group of Crimean  parliamentarians had been present when the armored vehicles  arrived on Saturday.    Nedrigailo announced that about twenty armored vehicles had  come. Non-official sources said that there had been about 29  armored vehicles arriving in Simferopol.    It is just normal equipment of the National Guards with  armored carriers, Nedrigailo emphasized.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Customer service pitched just right - Eating Out One of the reasons why I decided not to go into the wine and restaurant trade, after doing much of the early training, was a reaction to keeping up the pretence that the customer is always right. The customer is quite often wrong, as you will know if you have been a wine waiter and seen perfectly decent wine turned back in order to show off, or had coffee rejected because it is not decaffeinated, then returned to be congratulated for the speed of the switch while bringing exactly the same coffee back. There are two answers. One is to avoid restaurants whenever possible, except on holiday. The other is never complain: if something is wrong, say nothing, but don't go back. Above all, beware of familiarity. If the waiters start fawning to you, it is time to move on. For the mark of a really good restaurant is that you can drop in anonymously, even though it might be wise to book. Chez Gerard in London's Chancery Lane is a test case. It is one of the few decent places conveniently situated between the City and Westminster and takes in the lawyers on its doorstep. It has a reputation for being slightly aloof; several women have told me that it does not take kindly to female bookings. On the other hand, it has some of the best frites in London. Last Thursday - the day after the night of the London rain - was a testing time. Wet umbrellas and all, the place was packed even by the standards of Chez Gerard. The initial service was understandably slower than usual. Courteous French efficiency, however, soon resumed. Fizzy water was quickly and quietly exchanged for still. We learned in passing from a waiter - and without interruption to the service - that the only place in London to go for Belgian frites (which are the best of the lot) is a restaurant in Chalk Farm. The first courses - pate and cold duck - were excellent, and decently small. Yet not everything was perfect. My colleague ordered steak tartare. This really is a test case for a restaurant, but if the restaurant puts it on, it must expect to be tested. When it arrived, it looked a bit large to me, but my colleague demurred and gamely set about it. She did not get through to the end but, having the right instincts, would not have dreamed of complaining. She said merely to me - and even then only when asked - that it was 'a bit chewy'. A senior waiter noticed. He came to see if anything was wrong. The word 'chewy' was whispered. The waiter took away the steak tartare, returned to say that he had had it examined in the kitchen, found that it was not up the restaurant's best standards, and apologised. My colleague was offered another course or a deduction from the bill. All that was done with the minimum of fuss and without sycophancy. We concluded that on a difficult day Chez Gerard had passed all the tests without even knowing it was being tested. As London restaurants go, it is not particularly expensive. You can eat well with wine for two for just under Pounds 50, and if you take the fixed price menu the cost is lower still. Chez Gerard, 119 Chancery Lane, London WC2.

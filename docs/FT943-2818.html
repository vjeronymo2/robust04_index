			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Poles clash over price of success: A look at the wrangling over rising money supply Poland's steep growth curve coupled with inflows of foreign capital has the country's economic managers straining to catch their breath and has led the government and the NBP, the central bank, into an unprecedented public clash over how best to deal with the resulting increases in the money supply. The row comes in the wake of government suggestions that the bank should be given an advisory council nominated by politicians. The bank's redoubtable chairman, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, fears that this will lead to a curtailing of the NBP's independence. The government would also like to see the bank's supervisory functions hived off into a separate independent body. Matters came to a head earlier this week when the NBP, concerned about the growth in reserves, slowed the rate at which the zloty is devalued each month to keep exports competitive from 1.6 to 1.5 per cent. The move angered Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and finance minister, as the bank failed to make the 1 per cent cut in its 33 per cent refinancing rate the government wants to see to lower the cost of servicing the public debt. The protagonists later publicly traded arguments in parliament, with the government charging that the bank had exceeded its prerogatives when it took the devaluation decision without getting treasury agreement. Ms Gromkiewicz Waltz replied that inflationary pressures meant action had to be taken quickly and interest rate cuts would have to wait. President Lech Walesa, who nominated Ms Gromkiewicz Waltz to the Central Bank, has also weighed in. 'I'm not an economic expert but I think it is Ms Gromkiewicz Waltz who is in the right,' he said. The statement adds a political dimension. The present government, elected last year, is a coalition of the former communist SLD and the PSL Farmers Party, once allied to the communists. The president, who shares a Solidarity background with Ms Gromkiewicz Waltz, faces an election next autumn. 'I hope that we are dealing with nothing other than a dispute about economics,' said Mr Kolodko in parliament on Thursday, hinting that opposition to interest rate cuts could be aimed at slowing growth. Indeed the coalition desperately needs growth to continue keeping the budget deficit within the tight parameters pledged to the IMF in return for a Dollars 800m (Pounds 511m) standby accord. Equally important for the coalition is the need to bolster its support ahead of the presidential election. Happily for the moment the economy is set to grow by 4.5 per cent this year, with industrial output up by 12.8 per cent in the first eight months. Also monetary flows and indicators are all on target, which shows that both the treasury and the NBP are within IMF guidelines. However, foreign reserves have grown faster than expected to around Dollars 11bn because of receipts from cross-border trade and growing foreign trade. Exports in the first half of the year are up by 15 per cent to Dollars 7.7bn, with imports in the same period actually falling by 1.4 per cent to Dollars 9.5bn compared to the same period last year. This performance owes much to the recovery in neighbouring Germany - which accounts for a third of Polish sales abroad - and to east Germans shopping in Poland. The reserves have also been boosted by traders and tourists from the former Soviet Union buying consumer goods to sell at a profit at home. It is the swelling reserves and mounting corporate bank balances from growing sales and productivity gains that are causing the NBP concern and have provoked the stalemate on interest rates. Western bankers, who have just signed an accord cutting Poland's Dollars 14bn commercial debt by almost half, remain sanguine. Ironically as the country struggles with the effect of growing capital inflows, the deal which reduces Poland's overall indebtedness to Dollars 38bn should lead to foreign investment worth an additional Dollars 1bn a year.</p>

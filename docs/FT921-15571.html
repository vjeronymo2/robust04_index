			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Pressure for changes to accountancy institute CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS are pressing their main professional body to change fundamentally the way it operates by dividing in two. A group of members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is calling for a separate body to represent members' interests, alongside the institute's role of upholding professional standards. A paper has been circulated to district societies and members of the institute's council, its ruling body. It argues that the institute cannot fulfil both functions and calls on it to establish a new organisation with salaried directors to offer commercial services such as indemnity insurance, and to lobby on behalf of the profession. The council's annual conference begins today. The charter of the institute, the paper says, restricts its activities to advancing the profession rather than the interests of its members. These do not coincide and raise questions of a conflict of interest. Mr John Butcher, a sole practitioner and a supporter of the campaign for change, said: 'There is growing concern that the institute has difficulty in fulfilling both roles. The question is whether there can be reform without generating bad feeling. But we are not prepared to be ignored.' A more detailed paper on the subject will be submitted to the council by the start of next month. If there was no sign of change by April, Mr Butcher said there might be a move to 'make our views known at a special meeting'. He said the ideas covered a 'broad cross-section of the profession, including people in positions of influence'. The move comes after more than a year of discussions over the future of the institute since some of its regulatory functions were transferred to the independent Accounting Standards Board.</p>

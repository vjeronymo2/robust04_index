			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Struggling Group Lotus finds Italian saviour THE TAKEOVER of Group Lotus by Bugatti brings together two of the most famous motor racing names of the pre-war and post-war eras. Ettore Bugatti, the Italian creator of some of the world's most beautiful classic cars, died in 1947, and his car factory in France had already ceased production by the early 1950s in the aftermath of the war. In the UK Colin Chapman, the Group Lotus founder and one of the most creative and successful designers of racing cars, started his business in the early 1950s. His company has had a chequered history and never achieved a financial strength to match its success on the grand prix racing circuits. Group Lotus struggled to survive both before and after Chapman's death in 1982. It has proved to be none too secure in the hands of General Motors since 1986, and last year recorded a a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m on a turnover of Pounds 60.98m. General Motors was forced to put in Pounds 18m to repair the battered Lotus balance sheet in 1991, and the reverses convinced the giant carmaker that it had neither the desire nor the management resources to cope with such a small and specialised business. Group Lotus losses have grown from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 4.4m in 1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990, Pounds 14.7m in 1991 and the record Pounds 36.6m last year. However, in the past 12 months General Motors has been restructuring the business to ready it for disposal. Following the demise of the Elan sports car, Group Lotus has limited production to just one model, the Esprit luxury sports car, of which it is planning to build 350 this year. The workforce has been cut from 1,717 in 1990 to about 700 - a total of 500 in engineering and 200 in car production. Now the latest saviour has come from Italy in the shape of entrepreneur and life-time Bugatti lover Mr Romano Artioli, who holds an 18 per cent stake in Bugatti Automobili. He has recreated the Bugatti marque - supported by unnamed financial backers in the European automotive components industry - both as a maker of exotic and expensive cars and as a designer label for exotic and expensive fashion items, from sunglasses to table-ware. The first car of the new Bugatti company, created in 1987, was the EB110 supercar unveiled early last year with a mid-mounted 550 bhp V12 engine, carbon-fibre chassis and four-wheel drive. Production began in December and 47 have been delivered to date. Bugatti Automobili is based at Campogalliano near Modena, not far from the homes of Ferrari and Lamborghini. Mr Artioli was at one time a Ferrari dealer and is now the Suzuki distributor in Italy, but Bugatti has been his passion for 40 years. His campaign to revive the marque began in 1987 when he negotiated with the French government for the rights to the Bugatti name and badge. Ettore Bugatti was born in Italy, but the cars that made him famous were produced in Molsheim in the Alsace region of France. After his death the factory was taken over by Hispano-Suiza which eventually became part of Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group. The Bugatti holding company is registered in Luxembourg and its shareholders remain anonymous. Some big corporations have co-operated in developing the EB110, however, including Aerospatiale, which produces the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis.</p>

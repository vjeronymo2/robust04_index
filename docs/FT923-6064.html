			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Panic promises salvation for a pariah state SERBS are looking to the London conference with despair and anger, fearing the international community will punish them for fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Following the United Nations decision in May to impose sanctions on Serbia for backing Serb fighters in the newly independent Bosnia, the Serbs are citizens of a pariah state. But from their point of view they are victims of an international conspiracy. Their ire is fuelled by the media, which are tightly controlled by President Slobodan Milosevic. Belgrade television blames the war in Bosnia on 'Moslem fundamentalists' and 'Croat fascists', while Serbs are portrayed as innocent defenders of their homes. Attitudes are coloured by the second world war, when hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies were killed by Ustashe, or pro-Nazi Croats. The people of Serbia cannot accept today that Bosnian Serbs can be the aggressors. The war in Bosnia, which has claimed at least 10,000 lives, is depicted not as a land grab but as a battle for survival of the Serbian nation. Serbian television does not show reports about hundreds of thousands of Slavic Moslems being driven from their homes. Some people admit 'excesses' by Serb forces. But they qualify this with protests that Croats are equally culpable in the carve-up of Bosnia, yet remain unpunished by the international community. Inside Serbia few people hold out much hope of a change for the better. There are no signs that the opposition parties - disorganised and no match for the propaganda machine of the ruling Socialists - can mount a united challenge to Mr Milosevic. However, Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the internationally unrecognised Yugoslavia, rivals the president in popularity. He appears to many Serbs to be a breath of fresh air, offering to rescue the republic from collapse. His sense of humour and willingness to speak out contrast with the authoritarian and arrogant manner of Mr Milosevic. Sanctions, which include an oil embargo, are biting and Mr Panic is offering a way out. He has denounced 'ethnic cleansing' and promised to halt its spread inside Serbia. He also appears intent on doing a deal with Serbia's ethnic minorities, who make up a third of the 9.8m population. Capitalising on his popularity, he has arrested or sacked some obvious violators of minority rights in Serbia; yesterday he removed Mr Mihaly Kertes, a deputy interior minister, for his failure to support the government's programme 'of opposition to ethnic cleansing'. However, he faces resistance from warlords and ultranationalists. Perhaps his trickiest task in ending Serbia's isolation will be to convince his people that the UN peacekeeping zones covering Serbian enclaves in Croatia are part of Croatia and do not belong to Serbia.</p>

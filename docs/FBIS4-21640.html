			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 4--India's missile programme crossed  yet another milestone with the successful flight test on  Thursday of the long-range surface-to-air missile, Akash. The  missile, which has an ability to strike at a 25 km range can  also engage several targets simultaneously. An indigenously  produced radar (a phased array radar) on the weapon can track  several targets together.    The Akash test follows successful flight manoeuvres carried  out late last month of the anti-tank missile, Nag. In the wake  of the induction of Prithvi surface-to-surface missile (range of  150 to 250 km) and the likelihood of a third test of the Agni  IRBM, these successes bring India closer to acquiring its own  arsenal of sophisticated missiles.    The development of the Akash is expected to give India an  edge especially over Pakistan, which is not in the race for a  weapon in this category.    Significantly, Thursday's test validated the ramjet  propulsion technology, thus making India the third country which  has achieved this capability. The ramjet principle utilises  atmospheric air to obtain enormous energy from a low volume and  weight. Consequently, this makes the missile lighter and extends  the range.</p>

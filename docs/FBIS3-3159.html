One American manufacturer said  he was not sure if his joint venture would survive the switch to  a value-added tax. He believed the transition phase might cause  a working capital crisis that could lead the parent company to  decide the cash demands of the China subsidiary were too great.    Under the old system, imported capital goods and raw  materials attracted a five per cent tax. This has risen to 17  per cent under the VAT regime, which was introduced on January  1. In theory, companies are able to reclaim the tax after the  raw materials have been turned into goods and sold effectively  passing on the tax to the consumer. However, there are still  grey areas concerning the tax refund, according to KPMG Peat  Marwick tax manager Ayesha MacPherson. "The Government was very  quick to pass and implement the law but very slow to clear up  areas like how to claim a rebate," she said. As a result,  companies are left in a position where it is impossible to make  accurate cash-flow projections because there is no way of  knowing when the rebate will be paid. "The mainland authorities  have said that a refund will be made, but they have not given  any details," Ms MacPherson said.    Another grey area is how the transition from the old tax  system to the new is handled. Ms MacPherson said there was  confusion for companies which had paid tax on their raw  materials under the old system but would sell the finished goods  under the new tax regime. Price Waterhouse senior tax manager  Peter Kung said: "Potentially VAT is recoverable, but to some  foreign businesses just starting in China, the effects can be  quite serious. "They will need a few months to set up and start  production, so it may take several months before they can  recover the tax."</p>

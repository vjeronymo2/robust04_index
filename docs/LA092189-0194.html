			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRUCK PLUNGES INTO CREEK BED, TRAPS DRIVER  </P> <P> Mounting a 90-minute rescue effort that enlisted everything from massive tow  trucks to an airborne surgeon, county firefighters Wednesday pried a man from  the tangled wreckage of a flatbed truck after it plunged down a steep canyon  road into a 15-foot-deep creek bed near Cook's Corner north of Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The truck driver, Eustaquio Chavez Gonzalez, 39, of Whittier, was in serious  condition with multiple fractures and internal injuries at Mission Hospital  Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> When firefighters arrived, the three-axle truck, which was loaded with scrap  lumber, was wedged nose-first into the eastern embankment of Alisos Creek.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tow Trucks Called In  </P> <P> After unsuccessfully trying to free Gonzalez with a hydraulic prying device and  other equipment, rescue crews were forced to call in a pair of heavy-duty tow  trucks to pull the flatbed away from the creek bank so they could reach the  severely injured driver in its mangled cab.  </P> <P> As the rescue effort stretched into its second hour, authorities took the  unusual step of ferrying in a trauma surgeon by helicopter in case Gonzalez  required more intensive medical attention than that normally provided by  paramedics.  </P> <P> "It was one of the more complicated extractions I've been to in 10 or 12  years," said Battalion Chief Bill Dean of the Orange County Fire Department.  "It really required a maximum effort by all involved to get that man out of  that truck."  </P> <P> The episode unfolded about 9:30 a.m. when Gonzalez headed down Ridgeline Road  with a load of scrap lumber from a nearby construction site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faulty Brakes Believed Cause  </P> <P> As he steered down the steep route, the truck's brakes apparently failed,  according to Officer Ken Daily, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. The  flatbed careened through a red light at El Toro Road, nearly smashing into a  car, then plowed through a pair of telephone boxes, knocking out service for  several hours to more than 100 nearby homes.  </P> <P> It finally flew into the creek bed and rammed the opposite embankment, burying  the blunt nose of the vehicle and pinning Gonzalez inside, authorities said.  </P> <P> After county firefighters were unable to free the trapped truck driver with  hand-held extraction equipment, officials called in the county Fire  Department's heavy rescue vehicle, a jumbo-size tow truck outfitted with a  variety of winches and other equipment.  </P> <P> Later, another vehicle, this one owned by a truck-towing firm in Santa Ana,  lumbered to the scene to help pull the flatbed far enough up the creek bank  that rescuers could reach Gonzalez, authorities said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, paramedics were watching the minutes tick away as Gonzalez  remained trapped in the truck. Dean said medical personnel were particularly  concerned when the time-consuming rescue operation passed the so-called "golden  hour," the pivotal first 60 minutes after an accident when odds are best that a  life can be saved by trauma surgeons.  </P> <P> A Lifeflight helicopter was already on the scene, but when paramedics grew  worried that Gonzalez was losing too much blood, the chopper was dispatched to  Mission Hospital to get additional help.  </P> <P> It returned carrying whole blood and Dr. Ralph Maeda, a surgeon at the  hospital's trauma department. Dean said Maeda was flown in "just in case" more  intensive medical efforts were needed.  </P> <P> "Blood is not normally carried or administered by paramedics," Dean explained.  "We were concerned that if we couldn't get him out quickly, we'd have to do  something above and beyond the normal paramedic procedures."  </P> <P> When the tow trucks pulled the flatbed away from the embankment, firefighters  forced open the door on the driver's side and plucked Gonzalez from the  wreckage. He was then flown to Mission Hospital with Maeda and paramedics  providing care along the way.  </P> <P> "He hung in there," Dean said of Gonzalez. "He was a trouper."  </P> <P> Dean credited "a real team effort" among paramedics, firefighters, the  Lifeflight helicopter crew and medical personal at Mission Hospital for saving  the life of Gonzalez.  </P> <P> "Our guys really worked hard, the Lifeflight team worked hard and the base  hospital gave some really good instructions," Dean said. "It was just a real  good cooperative effort. Everything fell into place."  </P></p>

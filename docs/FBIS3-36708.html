Unfortunately, Ukraine belongs to those states  where the Constitution is ignored by many political parties and  authorities. The guarantor of the Constitution -- the president  of Ukraine -- while following the course of this process,  constantly resorts to self-vindicating statements.    The election of the president of the Crimean autonomous  region was a blatant violation of Ukrainian laws, including the  Constitution. The elections were held in an atmosphere of acute  Ukrainophobia and had an obvious backing from the "ruble zone"  patrons. By that time, the Ukrainian state leadership had  traditionally occupied a temporizing and so-called balanced  position.    These circumstances and the economic situation in the state  have brought the leader of the Crimean Republican Movement  [RDK], Meshkov, and the political bloc "Rossiya" [Russia] to  executive power. The Russian Federation has acquired yet  another lever for putting pressure upon Ukraine. This concerns,  in particular, the Black Sea Fleet and the deployment of the  Russian Armed Forces on the territory of the Ukrainian state.  The Russian mass media, first and foremost "Ostankino"  television and the VESTI news agency, stated, one after the  other, that the Crimea is adopting a new political course.    The RDK leader received almost half the votes of the adult  population. Therefore, the results of the voting have shown  that the Crimean population has really taken a new course  oriented toward Russia, the economic transformations promised by  it, and the financial injections.    That is why the results of the Crimean presidential  elections  must also become a basis for a fundamental revision of Ukraine's  economic policy. The success achieved by the separatist Meshkov  is also a consequence of the absence in Ukraine of a clear  information policy aimed at strengthening statehood.    Even before the second round of the elections, Meshkov  announced that, on 27 March, he would hold a referendum on  independence. We believe that the policy of temporizing has  turned out to be the worst for Ukraine. The events of recent  months have shown that Ukraine's state leadership has no proper  influence upon the regions. How can the executive represented by  the RDK be loyal to Kiev, if one of its proclaimed tasks is the  achievement of the peninsula's full independence...?    [Signed] The Press Service of the Congress of National  Democratic Forces    [Dated] Kiev, 31 January 1994</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At 1215 [local time] this afternoon the amir of  Kuwait received Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, Yemeni minister of  oil and mineral resources and envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice  chairman of Yemen's Presidential Council. The envoy briefed the  amir on the critical situation in Yemen and the sad developments  and painful events there.    The amir expressed Kuwait's deep sorrow for the bloodshed,  the killing, and the waste of resources in Yemen. The amir  clearly stated Kuwait's continuing stance of rejecting any use  of force in settling conflicts. He said that national duty  required an immediate cease-fire and the start of negotiations  to discuss in a true spirit of brotherhood all differences in  order to spare the Yemeni people from the tragedies of fighting  and bloodshed.    The amir of Kuwait stressed that dialogue is the way to  understanding and reconciliation and that Kuwait, which strongly  believes in principles of brotherhood and spares no efforts to  spread these principles, categorically rejects the use of force  to solve conflicts. The amir expressed the wish that the  officials in Yemen would take seriously the genuine calls for an  immediate halt to the fighting and for an agreement to end the  differences peacefully.

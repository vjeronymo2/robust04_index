			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swedish opposition to Volvo-Renault merger mounts Opposition mounted in Sweden yesterday to Volvo's planned merger of its vehicle manufacturing with Renault of France in spite of a detailed defence of its plans published by the company. For the first time, united trade union support for the deal cracked as 900 civil engineers within Volvo called for the merger to be postponed until Renault is privatised and a committee representing more than 5,000 white collar workers decided to use their small shareholding to vote against the accord at the November 9 extraordinary general meeting on the issue. At the same time, two influential newspapers voiced their opposition. Mr Mats Svegfors, editor of Svenska Dagbladet, the respected conservative daily, wrote that if necessary the government should step in to prevent Volvo, the country's leading manufacturing group, falling under French control. Dagens Industri, Sweden's financial daily, said the merger should be delayed until 1996, after Renault had been freed from state control. Volvo said momentum was building up against the merger, but said it was not clear Volvo shareholders shared this view. The company circulated a 66-page document to shareholders saying the merger was a 'logical and necessary extension' of a three-year old alliance between Volvo and Renault. It said Volvo's 35 per cent share in the merged company would be 'an important cornerstone' in a radically restructured Volvo which would broaden its interests to include a 100 per cent share in the cash-rich Branded Consumer Products, part of Procordia, a food and pharmaceutical group jointly controlled by Volvo and the Swedish state. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman, insisted Volvo would retain a large influence in the merged Renault-Volvo company in spite of the 65 per cent weighting in favour of French interests. He said Mr Lennart Jeansson, head of Volvo cars, and Mr Karl-Erling Trogen, head of Volvo Heavy Trucks, would respectively become chief financial officer and head of trucks and buses in Renault-Volvo on a five-man management board headed by Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive. Mr Gyllenhammar said Renault was making the biggest foreign investment in Sweden, and was hardly likely to damage this by running down Volvo's Swedish base. In a typically stirring evocation, he said Volvo would be contributing to the process of building Europe. 'We have to realise that such work requires both giving and taking,' he said. Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders association, which has led opposition to the merger, dismissed the Volvo leaflet, saying it gave no clearer picture of the valuation of Volvo's assets in the merger. It repeated its view that Volvo had no guarantees that Renault would be privatised. 'There is no certainty that there will be any privatisation before the next (French) election,' said Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, head of Aktiespararna. Analysts in Stockholm said that Volvo had not laid to rest the main concerns over the merger. But they continued to doubted whether the large institutional shareholders, who will decide the issue at the EGM, would see any viable alternative.</p>

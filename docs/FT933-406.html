			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Observer: Morse code Eagle-eyed strollers in the scholars' garden of St John's College, Cambridge, who spot the new sundial with its Latin inscription coelum indico benignum (I indicate a clear sky) might wish to know its provenance. It seems that former Lloyds Bank chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers until earlier this summer, had volunteered a suitable bon mot for the locally designed chronometer dedicated by the institute to St John's where it has three times held its international banking summer schools. The famously cerebrally unchallenged Morse, who took a first in classics, is of course an Oxford man.</p>

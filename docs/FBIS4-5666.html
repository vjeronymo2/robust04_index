			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The business community  welcomed Wednesday [13 April] a virtual end to political  confusion that followed the abrupt resignation announcement of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata has emerged as the likeliest  choice to succeed Hosokawa as head of the governing coalition,  political sources said.    Business leaders hope a new administration led by Hata will  normalize stalled Diet proceedings, paving the way for early  passage of the fiscal 1994 budget and favorably affecting the  domestic economy.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren), expressed hope that the new  government will continue to pursue a policy of political and  economic reform.    Officials of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives  (Keizai Doyukai) said the new government will never be allowed  to abandon the reform policy in light of domestic and  international situations.    Some business executives, however, said the political  situation remains shaky as a new round of political  reorganizations seems to be inevitable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), finally reached a  compromise on political reform bills at a meeting tonight, after  desperate efforts to end a week-long impasse.    The new accord will see members of the House of  Representatives elected through a combination of 300 single-seat  constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats to be  distributed in 11 electoral blocs across the country.    The new formula will replace the existing multi-seat  constituencies.    On the question of political donations, the compromise  agreement will allow individual politicians to designate one  organization to collect funds from corporations.    The compromise came after a joint committee of both houses  of  the Diet (parliament) had failed to settle the past week's  differences between the ruling coalition and opposition parties.    In a last-minute bid to avoid a political crisis, Takako  Doi,  speaker of the lower house, invited Hosokawa and Kono to hold a  meeting and after two hours they reached a basic accord.    It is likely that the compromise plan may be tabled to the  Diet for a vote tomorrow, the last day for the current  parliamentary session.    In the original proposals, the coalition advocated 274  single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional  representation, while the LDP wanted 300 single-seat  constituencies and 200 seats allotted by proportional  representation.    The ruling parties, meanwhile, were in favor of a ban on  political donations but the LDP called for limited fund-raising  for individual politicians.</p>

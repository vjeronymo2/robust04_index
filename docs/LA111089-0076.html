			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Philip Morris to Sell Rothmans Stake: Philip Morris Cos. agreed to sell its 29%  stake in Rothmans International Ltd. for $860 million, creating a huge profit  for the U.S. tobacco giant and ending speculation that it might take over the  British tobacco firm. The stake will be sold to Swiss-based Compagnie  Financiere Richemont AG, which through its Rothmans Tobacco Holdings unit has  offered to buy all of the shares of Rothmans International. Philip Morris said  it expected to earn more than $450 million before taxes from the deal when it  is completed. It paid $350 million for the stake in 1981.  </P></p>

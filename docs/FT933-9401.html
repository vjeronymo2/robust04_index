			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Foreigners' fears drive Argentina's modernisation ARGENTINA is attempting to improve the poor reputation of its capital markets in an attempt to accelerate the inflow of much-needed foreign capital. Some foreign investors complain bitterly about being 'cheated' by brokers and companies. They claim company accounts are misleading and profits concealed for the benefit of majority shareholders. But Argentina has scrapped exchange controls, deregulated markets, and offered privatisations and private bond issues. It is trying to impose modern trading and disclosure standards, following the leads of Chile and Mexico, Latin America's free-market trail-blazers. In April, the Comision Nacional de Valores (CNV), the securities watchdog, sent a bill to Congress that legally defines for the first time offences such as market manipulation or insider trading. The bill proposes heavy fines - a minimum of Dollars 5m for market manipulation, for instance (the current maximum fine is a mere Dollars 7,919). However, the bill is making little progress, largely due to the quiet opposition of the financial industry. Meanwhile, the CNV is doing what it can by using its administrative powers. Mr Martin Redrado, the commission's president, has initiated 86 investigations, stopped three public offerings, temporarily suspended 12 brokers and issued 66 warnings to companies. The CNV now requires bond issuers to be checked by independent credit-rating agencies. There are now seven such agencies in operation, usually in alliance with respected overseas names like the UK's IBCA. The agencies seem to have overcome some foreign bankers' misgivings about their independence and ability. Only two borrowers - Dutch-owned Banco Holandes Unido and Banco Rio, Argentina's biggest private bank - have received triple-A ratings. Most others range between double-A and triple-B. However, Mr Christopher Ecclestone, a Buenos Aires-based analyst, says that ratings for some companies are still far too generous. Mr Redrado has also publicly rebuked companies which publish inadequate accounts. However, the CNV is split between trying to be referee and cheerleader at the same time. The commission took a leading role in last year's Dollars 1.2bn flotation of Telecom Argentina, a privatised telephone company, which soon lost 30 per cent of its value. The Telecom flop helped precipitate last June's market collapse and cast a shadow over both the market and the CNV. The CNV is understaffed and underfunded and - in spite of one investigation into a suspected case of market manipulation - has not uncovered any evidence of large-scale cheating. Even when it has caught relatively minor offenders, it has been unable to apply more than symbolic punishment. However, the bigger, tougher and better-financed DGI tax department is making an important contribution to transparency in its war against tax evasion. It has put businessmen behind bars, closed companies and imposed hefty fines. This has encouraged companies to declare more of their income to the tax collector, and thus to small shareholders, too. The drift to screen-based trading makes it easier to detect immediately suspicious price movements. Soon, all but a few highly liquid shares which can continue to be traded on the Buenos Aires stock exchange floor will have to be traded electronically. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to modernisation is the resistance of the market itself. Insider trading is common because few brokers consider it immoral, let alone an offence. But the greatest force for change is coming from overseas. Cash-hungry Argentine companies are approaching international markets in increasing numbers, and are having to conform with stricter disclosure and accounting norms.</p>

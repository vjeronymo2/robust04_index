			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> 13 U.S. WARSHIPS HEAD FOR MIDEAST; MISSION CLASSIFIED  </P> <P> The Pentagon said today that 13 U.S. warships with 2,000 assault Marines and  amphibious landing gear are headed for the Mediterranean on routine deployment,  but officials refused to rule out any American attack against an alleged  chemical weapons plant in Libya.  </P> <P> "I am not going to speculate in that area (a possible attack) at all," Defense  Department spokesman Dan Howard told reporters in response to questions.  </P> <P> "Everything you're talking about falls into the general area of classified  information and I cannot discuss it."  </P> <P> Last week, President Reagan revealed that the United States had discussed with  NATO allies possible military action against a chemical plant in Libya that  Washington believes is intended to produce deadly chemical weapons.  </P> <P> The Theodore Roosevelt, the newest U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, left  Norfolk, Va., Friday for the Mediterranean, where the John F. Kennedy carrier  battle group already is on duty, a Navy spokesman said.  </P> <P> Because of Reagan's comments, the Roosevelt's movement took on added  significance and raised speculation that its departure might be linked to  Libya. But a Navy statement insisted the departure of the Roosevelt was "a  routine deployment" planned "many, many months ago."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peace Groups Protest  </P> <P> However, in Rome, peace groups, left-wing political parties and Vatican radio  protested the Navy deployment. The Italian Assn. for Peace called on the  Italian Parliament to declare the nation's ports and naval bases "unavailable  to U.S. Navy ships and military aircraft and in any case to ban their entry  into Italian territorial waters and airspace."  </P> <P> Vatican radio said news of the deployment "has created alarm about the  possibility of new tension between the United States and Libya."  </P> <P> The Roosevelt's 12-ship battle group includes two cruisers, six destroyers, a  frigate and three auxiliary ships. In addition, the group is accompanied by  five amphibious landing ships of the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group.  </P> <P> Navy Cmdr. Steve Burnett said about 2,000 of the 4,100 Marines aboard the five  vessels are assault troops.  </P> <P> An almost identical force of Marines and amphibious landing vehicles, also part  of the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group, is accompanying the Kennedy battle  group -- meaning a total of 4,000 assault Marines will be in the area with the  arrival of the Roosevelt.  </P> <P> The Navy said the Roosevelt will take about a week to reach the Mediterranean,  where there are already 23 U.S. warships, and Howard said, "It is not unusual  for us to have an overlap (of carriers) in the Mediterranean."  </P> <P> However, Howard refused to rule out whether the ship movements would be  affected by the Libyan situation and he said he did not know how long the two  carriers would remain in the Mediterranean together.  </P> <P> Howard referred questions about the alleged Libyan chemical plant to the State  Department, declining to say whether military photographs of the plant had  proven the facility was built solely for chemical weapons production.  </P></p>

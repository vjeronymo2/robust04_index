			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (11): Projects grow in size - Foreign investment / US companies are increasing their involvement Foreign investors continued to pour funds into China in 1994 with actual utilised investment in the first nine months rising to USDollars 22.72bn, up 49 per cent on the corresponding period last year. But numbers of new foreign invested projects and the volume of contracted investment declined after the frenzied activity of 1993 in which pledged funds exceeded those for the previous 14 full years. Numbers of new projects were down by 46 per cent to the end of September compared with last year, and pledged investment dropped by about 32 per cent to Dollars 57bn. This inevitable slowdown also corresponded with attempts by the authorities to calm an overheating economy. But the figures, nonetheless, are impressive. From 1979 - the year that China opened its doors to foreign investors - to the end of September more than 210,000 foreign-funded ventures were approved with pledged investment of Dollars 275bn. Actual investment had reached Dollars 85.1bn Ministry of foreign trade officials predict that utilised investment this year will top Dollars 30bn compared with Dollars 26bn last year. This will represent about half of all foreign direct investment to developing countries worldwide, an indication of the strength of China's continuing appeal to international investors. But the figure could easily be much larger. Delays in resolving internal arguments over the appropriate returns for investors in infrastructure projects, especially power plants, is holding up at least half a dozen power projects worth several billions of dollars in foreign investment. According to electricity ministry officials, China will need to spend at least Dollars 67bn on new power plants by the end of the century to lift its generating capacity from the present 183,000 Mw to a targetted 300,000 Mw. About one quarter of these funds would come from foreign investors. The telecommunications industry is another that is set to increase sharply its investment in China. The announcement last month that Hong Kong Telecom would invest Dollars 260m in a fibre optic link from Hong Kong to Beijing and a mobile telephone network in the Chinese capital is one of many instances of planned telecommunications sector investment. Motorola, AT&amp;T, Ericsson, Northern Telecom, Alcatel, Siemens and NEC all have ambitious investment plans. Motorola, for example, will have invested Dollars 300m by the end of this year in factories producing cellular phones, paging systems and semi-conductors. AT&amp;T, after a slow start, plans Dollars 150m in investment in the next two years in nine joint ventures manufacturing such items as optical fibre cable, switching gear and transmission equipment. Consumer products companies are also in the vanguard of foreign investors. Unilever, Procter and Gamble, General Electric and Electrolux have all recently announced ambitious plans to target the household products and appliance markets. The petrochemicals and agri-chemicals sector is another that is poised to increase significantly its stake in China. Among large foreign institutions either involved in ventures on the ground or in negotiations are Aramco, the Saudi Arabian state oil company, Shell, ICI, BP, Zeneca and Du Pont. Automotive companies have also stepped up their efforts to secure a foothold. Car giants, including Toyota, Ford and General Motors, are jostling for a share of what promises to become - by early next century - the world's biggest new market for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. But for many foreign investors, large and small, involvement in China has been a frustrating and, in many cases, expensive business. According to a recent government survey, between one-third and one-half of foreign-funded enterprises are loss-making in what is, by any standards, an extremely difficult commercial environment. A western embassy in Beijing in a report warns potential investors to beware of what it describes as 'China factors' before committing themselves. These include the parlous state of much of the country's infrastructure; difficulties of arranging distribution and supply due to a crumbling transport system; lack of convertibility of the yuan; bureaucratic strictures that complicate personnel management; opaque rules and regulations; and an unreliable legal system whose dispute-settling mechanisms are loaded heavily against the foreign party. But for all these problems it seems there will be no stopping, for the time being, the 'stampeding herd.' High profile missions such as the one in August led by Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, in which some Dollars 6bn in contracts and letters of intent were initialled, tends to feed what is known as 'China fever' among investors who perhaps lose sight of the difficulties in their desire to become engaged. Growing American business involvement on the ground in China is one of the striking features of the past year or so, and this in turn is being reflected in the investment figures with a distinct trend towards larger-scale projects. In the first eight month, the average investment in a single project was Dollars 1.7m compared with Dollars 1.3m in the same period last year. These figures also reflect the fact that whereas Hong Kong and Taiwanese companies, many of which are involved in small-scale processing activities such as textiles, dominated the field initially, it is now the multinationals who are moving into China in a big way. Japanese companies, which were initially wary, are part of this trend, along with the South Koreans. Among other factors responsible for the drop this year in numbers of ventures and new pledged investment was the introduction of a new tax regime on January 1. This imposed a capital gains tax on property transactions, thus dampening real estate speculation. The new measures also ended the practice of foreign funded ventures being allowed to import cars duty-free. The latter 'privilege' had been widely abused with Chinese entrepeneurs establishing companies using relatives or friends abroad as 'frontmen' to enable them to import luxury cars, free of customs duty. The establishment of thousands of such bogus enterprises had vastly inflated numbers of so-called 'foreign- funded' joint ventures. Apart from a trend towards larger projects, foreign investment also became more widely distributed with inland provinces showing a bigger percentage jump (from a low base) in new investment than coastal regions. According to a study by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), provinces like Guizhou, Hubei and Gansu doubled numbers of overseas-funded enterprises in the past year or so; although there remains a vast development gulf between the coast and the hinterland. After China's 15-year open door experiment what emerges from the latest figures is the significant impact foreign-funded ventures are having on the nation's trade. In the first six months of this year imports and exports of these ventures were up by 45 per cent over the same period last year to Dollars 35.78bn or 36.7 per cent of total trade. Exports reached Dollars 13.47bn, an increase of 44.5 per cent over last year compared with a rise of about 30 per cent in the national export figure. This will be a pleasing result for the authorities who look to foreign investment to boost exports.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Direct overseas investment in China  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The top ten investors: 1979-1993     Country                Number of      Pledged                             projects    investment,                                        US Dollars bn  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers switch A pre-results recommendation sent insurer Legal &amp; General higher yesterday at the expense of Prudential. Securities house UBS repeated its recommendation to switch out of the Pru, which publishes interim figures tomorrow, and into L&amp;G, which announces its profits next Thursday. UBS is cautious on the life sector after the recent announcement by the Office of Fair Trading on disclosure of commissions. However, it feels that L&amp;G offers the best value and forecasts interim profits of Pounds 78m, against Pounds 74m last time. It predicts profits of Pounds 250m for Prudential against Pounds 249m previously. L&amp;G gained 8 at 476p while Prudential put on a penny at 337p.</p>

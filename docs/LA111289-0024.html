			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN "AUTOMATIC," WARNER BROS. ****  </P> <P> The brothers Reid have made an art form of abrasiveness: a first album that  dragged you through thickets of distortion to reach the sweetness at the  center. Concerts marked by indifferent delivery and unpredictable (usually  short) duration. Mumbling interviews. There's something refreshingly real about  these surly, semi-articulate Scots and their pursuit of an eccentric ideal of  pop perfection.  </P> <P> They might have hit it with their third album. The Jesus and Mary Chain still  works the same few rock archetypes -- blues, Velvet Underground two-chord rise  and fall, Stooges grunge riffs, Ramones bubble-gum punk -- and this time, the  Reids really make it sing and surge and soar.  </P> <P> "Automatic's" power is its faith in simplicity and its inspiration is in the  way it sabotages the structures it celebrates. William Reid approaches the  guitar as a flamethrower, and by the end of the album he's trashed the terrain  in just about every track, like the climactic shoot-out in an over-the-top  apocalyptic battle movie.  </P> <P> Jim Reid's vocals remain detached, in these Phil Spector fever dreams of  fumbling, glancing encounters. Though unease and madness emerge from the  cryptic lyrics as the main motifs, the album refuses to wallow in Angst. The  purity of the monolithic sound, the vocals' hypnotic pull, the pulverizing  power, the uplifting tunes all see to that.  </P> <P> The J&amp;MC ranges from pretty folk-pop ("Halfway to Crazy") to a clattering  exercise in edginess ("Take It"), but it's the lean rockers like "Head On" that  really carry the show. Jim sings:  </P> <P>  And there's something going on inside  </P> <P>  Makes you want to feel makes you want to try  </P> <P>  Makes you want to blow the stars from the sky ...  </P> <P>  And the music makes you believe you could.

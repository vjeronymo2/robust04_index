			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Hanson in Dollars 3.2bn deal for Quantum Chemical HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday launched an agreed Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.13bn) bid for Quantum Chemical Corporation of the US. The price includes Dollars 720m for Quantum's share capital plus the assumption of Quantum's Dollars 2.5bn of debt. Quantum, formed in 1987 from National Distillers &amp; Chemical after it sold its wine and liquor business, and refinanced with heavy borrowings in 1988, is the leading US manufacturer of polyethylene, a plastic used in packaging, and products such as toys and automotive components. It is the second largest retail supplier of propane gas. The bid marks Hanson's return to the acquisition trail after its failed Pounds 780m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK food company, launched in October. Hanson was beaten when rival UK conglomerate Tomkins topped its offer. It also follows Hanson's purchase of a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries in 1991 which, despite fierce speculation, never led to a bid. The Quantum bid illustrates the changing style of Hanson's acquisitions. Lord Hanson, chairman, said: 'Hanson's objective for the 1990s is to build up its major businesses, while being prepared to make major acquisitions when the opportunity presents itself. Quantum fits this perfectly.' Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, said he expected the acquisition would make 'a positive contribution to Hanson earnings in 1993-94'. Quantum's profits have slumped in recent years as overcapacity has hit polyethylene prices. Lord Hanson said the deal had been struck 'near the bottom of this industry's cycle'. Mr David Clarke, chief executive officer of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's US arm, said a small increase in prices would have a large impact on profits. In 1988, the peak of the last cycle, Quantum's operating income was Dollars 759.8m, but in 1992 this fell to Dollars 61.4m. Quantum has also been burdened with heavy debt. Interest charges have pushed it into losses in 1991 and 1992 and it has a balance sheet deficit of Dollars 471.1m. Hanson is offering 1.176 of its American Depository Receipts, which each represent five ordinary shares, for each Quantum share. That values the target's equity at Dollars 20 a share or at Dollars 720m in all. The share offer would add 4 per cent to Hanson's share capital. Quantum is paying interest rates of more than 10 per cent on its debt while Hanson pays about 5 per cent on its US borrowings. Hanson also plans to continue cost cutting programmes. It hopes to complete the deal by September 30, its financial year end. The company's shares responded with a 4p rise to a London close of 226 1/2 p. Quantum's shares closed in New York up Dollars 6 1/2 at Dollars 19. Observer Page 23 Lex Page 24 Analysis Page 25 ICI seeks restructure of polyurethane industry Page 26 London stocks Page 48</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1253 GMT on 7 </F> March transmits a report on Pu Jie's cremation in Beijing  together with a service message canceling the following item and  asking that it be replaced with the next item]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (XINHUA) -- The remains of Aisin  Giorro Pu Jie, member of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress [NPC], vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities  Committee, and a special member of the Cultural and Historical  Data Research Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], were cremated in Beijing today.    Aisin Giorro Pu Jie died of illness in Beijing on 28  February, aged 87.    Born in Beijing on 16 April 1907, Pu Jie, of the Man  [Manchu]  nationality, was a younger brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, the  last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. When he was young he studied  at Prince Chun's residence in Beijing and served as a study mate  of Pu Yi. After 1929, Pu Jie was sent to study at Gakushuin  University in Tokyo and at the Japanese Military Academy. After  returning to northeast China in 1935, he served as a military  officer with the puppet state of Manchukuo, which was supported  by the Japanese Army. In 1937, he married Hiro Saga, the  daughter of the Japanese Marquis Saneto Saga. After the  Japanese Army surrendered in 1945, he and Pu Yi were captured by  the Soviet Red Army. In August 1950, they were handed over to  the Chinese Government to be locked up for reform. In November  1960, they were pardoned and freed. After his release, the  party and the government showed great concern for and took very  good care of Mr. Pu Jie. When Premier Zhou Enlai cordially met  with Pu Yi and with Pu Jie and his family members in 30 January  1961, he encouraged them to study and to work hard to make  contributions to the country. Because of the concern shown by  Premier Zhou Enlai, Pu Jie's wife Hiro Saga and a daughter who  had been separated from Pu Jie for many years returned from  Japan in June of that year to live with him. Starting in May  1962, Mr. Pu Jie served as a special member of the CPPCC  Cultural and Historical Data Research Committee and as a member  of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC Committee. After 1978, he was  elected a deputy to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's;  a member of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC Standing  Committees; and a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities  Committee. The fact that Mr. Pu Jie transformed himself from a  brother of a feudal emperor into a citizen of New China and then  advanced to become a member of the highest legislative organ of  the people's political power demonstrates the CPC's great vision  and brilliant policy regarding the transformation of society and  classes, and this also demonstrates Mr. Pu Jie's high quality of  seeking truth and a bright future.    Mr. Pu Jie supported the CPC and cherished the socialist  motherland. This sentiment was embodied in his accounts of  himself and the poems that he wrote over the years. He once  wrote in a poem that "Under a sea of Red flags today, one can  see the total difference between the new and old land." He once  sincerely said that "in the evening of my life, I will try my  best to make use of every available minute." As vice chairman  of the NPC Nationalities Committee, he conscientiously carried  out his duties as a people's deputy by showing concern for  development and progress in minority nationality areas.  Ignoring his feeble condition caused by his old age, he went  deep into minority nationality areas to carry out investigations  and studies. He offered many valuable suggestions for improving  nationality work and worked very hard to safeguard the  unification of the motherland and to strengthen unity among  nationalities. Being enthusiastic about public welfare work, he  vigorously supported welfare and cultural institutions. In  April 1990, he was lauded by all sectors of society when he  donated his life savings to the 11th Asian Games Organizing  Committee.    For many years Mr. Pu Jie dedicated himself to promoting  peace and friendship between China and Japan. He had broad ties  with the Japanese royal house and with people of all circles  both inside and outside the government. He visited Japan  several times. He did a great deal of work to promote  Sino-Japanese friendship by according a warm reception to  visiting Japanese friends from various circles and by briefing  them on the great achievements that China has made in reform,  opening up to the outside world, and the modernization drive.  When his majesty Emperor Akihito was enthroned, Pu Jie made a  special trip to Japan to extend his regards to the emperor  during which the Japanese Government and public thought highly  of him. For many years, when he cordially received visiting  Japanese friends from various circles, he told them of his wish  that China and Japan would maintain friendly relations for one  generation after another. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary  doctor of law degree by Japan's Ritsumeikan University.    Mr. Pu Jie was a capable poet and calligrapher because he  studied calligraphy and poetry when he was young. He was a  well-known calligrapher at home and abroad. He summed up his  calligraphic experience this way: "When you copy a model of  calligraphy, it is necessary to use the strength of the wrist.  If your mind is made up and your concentration is strong, you  will turn out graceful and charming calligraphy." Because his  life experience was unique, the poems and prose that he wrote  about any event came naturally and were sincere in their feeling  and artistic in their conception. He authored the "Selected  Poems of Pu Jie."</p>

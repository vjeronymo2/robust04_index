			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Palestinian unity must be Arafat's next goal MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has won his prize of recognition by Israel. But his historic diplomatic victory has riven the PLO fold, and many in the movement believe the deal with Israel could still backfire if its cost proves to be Palestinian national unity. Mr Arafat's acceptance of a limited Palestinian autonomy, beginning in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, along with Israeli conditions for mutual recognition, has cost him the support of some of his closest comrades and fuelled unprecedented dissent within the organisation. Mr Arafat is convinced he has seized an historic opportunity he could not afford to miss. He has also evidently decided to abandon efforts to retain a Palestinian consensus which, in the view of some of his aides, had previously paralysed the organisation. He thus appears unperturbed by the slender majority by which the PLO executive committee approved agreement with Israel late this week. Eight out of 18 voted for the deal, four voted against, four more had already resigned or boycotted the meeting, one could not attend and one abstained. Opposition to the concessions made by Mr Arafat to win recognition was predictably immediate and outraged from the traditional 'rejectionist' Palestinian groups, which oppose in principle the talks with Israel. Mr Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, called yesterday his 'blackest day', and warned that 'Arafat and his group will be punished by the Palestinian people.' Fatah Uprising, a radical splinter group, declared it would 'shed the blood of the treacherous Arafat.' More significantly, Palestinian opposition over the past week has not been confined to traditional rejectionist groups. Many voicing concern include supporters of the peace process - including Mr Mahmoud Darwish, the prominent Palestinian poet, Mr Shafiq Al Hout, PLO representative in Lebanon, both of whom have resigned from the organisation in protest, and Mr Abdullah Hourani, an independent PLO committee member. Yesterday, Mr Farouk Kaddoumi, PLO foreign minister, and number two in Mr Arafat's own mainstream Fatah movement, bitterly rejected the agreements, arguing that the leadership had no right to give up the Palestinian people's rights. The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the main opposition groups within the organisation, have already joined Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, and are leading seven smaller groups in a campaign against Mr Arafat's strategy. Although the opposition lacks coherence and a unified platform, it could still threaten Mr Arafat's undertaking, in the name of the PLO, to cease violence against Israel and discipline PLO members who violate this agreement. The DFLP and PFLP are now considering withdrawing from the organisation, and joining Hamas, which has never been part of the PLO. But Mr Arafat's failure to consult his colleagues is not the only cause of mounting dissent. In the view of his critics, he has made dear concessions in return for an Israeli recognition of the PLO which falls short of recognising the organisation as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and their national rights. Israel has already claimed that the PLO to which they have accorded recognition is different from that which they had for decades opposed as a mortal ememy. The converse effect on many Palestinians is to give rise to fears that by accepting the Israeli conditions, the PLO has in fact become stripped of its historic identity as the embodiment of Palestinian nationalism. After gaining long-awaited and crucial recognition from Israel, Mr Arafat now faces a struggle to prove that the PLO remains true to the Palestinians' national rights and aspirations.</p>

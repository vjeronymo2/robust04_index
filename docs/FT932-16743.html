			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Gardening: Steamy times in a Berkshire jungle - Robin Lane Fox pulls off the M4 to visit a tropical rain forest and its talented creator WET MIST fell in clouds behind us; simulated thunder rumbled in the distance; there was an echo of chattering monkeys and I stood on the edge of Britain's newest rain forest, just north of Newbury, Berkshire, off the M4. From Wednesday, Wyld Court rain forest will be open to the public: a year and a half's work, a considerable fortune and the imaginative backing of a Gold Medal grower of tropical plants make it an experiment which deserves to succeed. It is bold, lavish and a brainchild: it has something for everyone, even if piranha fish give you the creeps. Wyld Court stands in the village of Hampstead Norreys on the former site of a famous nursery for orchids. Its tropical transformation dates back to a meeting at Chelsea Flower Show. Since 1985, Barrie Findon has been delighting the Chelsea public with displays of tropical planting, kept healthy in a far-from-tropical Main Tent. Two years ago, an appreciative visitor introduced himself: Keith Bromley, very much the senior citizen, whose business ventures had left him with funds to invest in a tropical dream. The Bromley plan was to build a rain forest under glass, put Barrie in charge, and move in his famous exotics, collected over the past 30 years and increased by contacts in the tropical world. In your late 40s, you do not refuse a dream offer. Barrie is now in charge, with his wife Janet, whom he described inadvertently as his top propagator. A Dutch system of computers sprays the glass houses with clouds of fine mist; Barrie has to water all his plants personally and although he has recorded noises from a natural forest, he would secretly like to add a visual flash of lightning to the sound of thunder whenever it comes round on tape. Wyld Court's aim is to show, preserve and, if necessary, export the flora of threatened rain forests back to their countries of origin. Many people have these dreams, but those which prosper are the shared dream of a team. The plan reminds me of another exotic foundation, Eric Young's trust for orchids in Jersey: there, the scheme worked so well because it brought together a backer and an expert cultivator, each of whom needed the other. I sense that the same is about to happen at Wyld Court. Give it a few months to settle and then visit it this summer when the huge leaves are open on the Victoria water lily, the children need amusing and the giant white Arauana fish by the entrance has grown another two feet. In nature, it likes to win the high jump: already its practice has broken two panes of glass in its tank, perhaps because it is being kept up by its millionaire's diet of chicken breast and smoked bacon. Personally, I find tropical plants sinister and rather too large for life. At Wyld Court, the Brazilian passion flower has already grown hugely in less than a year: its flowers are bigger and brighter than any of those which we grow on south walls in gardens. Old gardening friends such as the Clerodendorn turn up with names like splendens and make mine look very pinched. Rare Daphniphyllums appear with elegant green stripes to their white colouring, house plants grow to inflated sizes, suggesting that they would take over the drawing room if mist dripped from the ceiling. Shortly after my visit, Barrie was booked to receive the reptiles: first, the jungle snakes, and then, on Monday, the rest of the Press. Where does it all leave you and me? We will be better informed, no doubt, about that endless worry, the vanishing rain forest. Whenever one of its old trees is felled and turned into a cocktail cabinet, tens of thousands of other living creatures lose a home. Among them are medicinal plants and hundreds of lovely orchids. Barrie is a great orchid-grower and, at Wyld Court, he has a golden yellow Catleya which I have never seen before, while vanderas from Brazil grow on mist and water only without any need for soil. Beside them, wild orchids dangle from the dry skull of an antelope. Barrie and his team intend to sell orchids and exotics to visitors along with what rainforesters call 'dry goods'. The provenance of his collection makes the nursery an important stop for indoor shoppers, travelling down the M4. There is also scope for transplanting Barrie himself. Past clients, he tells me, have turned conservatories into rain forests for their own amusement. After long, sweaty years on the Pacific Rim, old dealers retire to the south coast of England and pine for a hint of the tropics on their bleak, verandahs. For about Pounds 6,000, Barrie can set them up: he has a client near Portsmouth who has programmed the mist in his conservatory to coincide with the evening gin and tonic at 6 pm. The wicker chair might be extra, but the price includes a full tropical planting, computer controls and setting by a proven expert, leaving you with Barrie's knowledge, even in his absence. Somerset Maugham would have loved it: if you are missing Malaysia, Wyld Court could convert the conservatory and even, I dare say, find a few piranhas to remind you of your time in the markets.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / South African Elections April 26-28: Mandela rules out election postponement Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, yesterday ruled out any postponement of South Africa's forthcoming all-race elections, despite a report from the country's Independent Electoral Commission saying it would be impossible to hold elections in violent Natal province. 'Let me tell you there will be no postponement of elections  ..either in the province of Natal or in any of the provinces,' Mr Mandela told a youth conference in Durban. 'We will not postpone our freedom ..We will not postpone our plans to build a better life for all South Africans.' Some 700 additional troops were last night on their way to bolster the 2,000 soldiers already enforcing the state of emergency in Natal, where over 100 people have died in six days. A government spokesman said last night the Natal crisis required a political solution, which will be the focus of tomorrow's peace summit between Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk, Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, who are to meet at an undisclosed venue. The ANC hopes at that meeting to assuage the fears of the Zulu King about the future of his monarchy by promising to protect his salary and status under a new constitution. ANC officials believe they can offer the king a deal which will persuade him to break with his ally, Chief Buthelezi, and accept the constitution, seriously undermining Inkatha's election boycott.</p>

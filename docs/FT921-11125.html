			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Iraqi ships find Italian home THE Italian navy has bought four frigates originally ordered by Iraq, partly closing the book on one of the most accident-prone deals in the history of Italian defence contracting. The four Lupo (wolf) class frigates were part of a L3,600bn (Pounds 1.7bn) contract for 12 naval vessels won in 1981 by two Italian defence consortia, headed by Fincantieri, the state ship-building group and Oto-Melara, the state guided weapons company. But only four vessels, worth L300bn, have been handed over to Iraq. Of these a supply ship and a floating dry dock are blocked in the Egyptian port of Alexandria and two Assad class corvettes are still at the Italian naval base of La Spezia, where the other warships are also docked. The deal fell foul of both the western arms embargo resulting from the Iran-Iraq war and the allied embargo on Iraq following President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the cost of maintaining the four frigates and six corvettes has been running at L550m a day, over L400m of which has been financial charges. The first of the frigates was completed in 1985 and the full order with sophisticated missile armaments was ready by 1987; the completion of the corvette order was spread between 1986 and 1988. Although Iraq sent crew for training on two corvettes as early as 1986, the first opportunity to take delivery came after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Iraq made payments of L1,800bn in the hope of unblocking the entire contract. The frigates were 'freed' for delivery in 1989 and eventually the two least bellicose vessels were released; but just when it seemed the Italian government would waive its objections to the retention of the offensive vessels, Mr Saddam invaded Kuwait. The inability to obtain full payment and the high cost of maintenance has weighed heavily on every big defence contractor in Italy, all of which were either directly or indirectly involved in the deal. The Italian navy was pressed to buy up as much of the order as possible, but was reported to be reluctant because of lack of funds and because the vessels had been designed to Iraqi navy and Gulf water specifications. However, with the Andreotti government in its final days, the defence lobby was able to exercise sufficient influence for funds to be made available to the Defence Ministry through 1994 to purchase four frigates. The remaining eight vessels under Italian control or blocked in Alexandria have been put out to international tender.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> R-Rated Films Banned in Class? In what is believed to be the first such case in  California, Martinez Superior Court Judge Richard Patsey will consider whether  R-rated films can be banned from high school classrooms. The case involves a  1988 suit by the San Ramon Valley Education Assn. that challenged its school  board's policy, which keeps films ranging from "Das Boot" and "One Flew Over  the Cuckoo's Nest" to "The Breakfast Club" from being shown to students. The  case was originally scheduled to be taken up today but was postponed until  April 16. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

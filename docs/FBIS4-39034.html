			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Igor Porshnev, </F> Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others; quotation marks as received]    [Text] Moscow hopes that in Istanbul next Friday NATO  foreign ministers will give their reply to Russia's proposals  concerning the practical implementation of the Partnership For  Peace program. Interfax learned this today from Yuriy Ushakov,  the director of the European Cooperation Department of Russia's  Foreign Ministry.    The North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation will hold its  routine session on the level of foreign ministers in Istanbul  next Friday and Saturday. The session will be attended by the  head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev. On Thursday the  foreign ministers of NATO countries will have a conference there.    As Ushakov said, "Russia stands for strengthening the  Council  and for gradually transforming it into an independent agency for  multilateral politico-military consultations connected with the  CSCE."    According to him, at the session of the Council the foreign  ministers will adopt a joint statement reflecting their attitude  to the pressing issues of European and world politics.    In Istanbul we'll underscore our willingness to promptly  begin to work out the possible agreement between Russia and NATO  on the basis of suggestions [as received] Russia's Defence  Minister, Pavel Grachev, outlined in Brussels on May 25,"  Ushakov said.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Programmed for the Microsoft challenge - Novell's expansion has pitted it directly against the market leader The balance of power in the computer software industry has shifted unexpectedly towards the state of Utah, home of Novell, the leading supplier of software for personal computer networks. Novell announced late on Monday that it planned to acquire WordPerfect, a Utah neighbour, for Dollars 1.4bn in stock. At the same time, Novell has purchased the rights to a popular spreadsheet program called Quattro Pro from Borland International for Dollars 145m in cash. Novell shares closed down in heavy trading yesterday, at Dollars 20 from Dollars 23 3/4 on Monday. The moves give Novell an instant stake in the market for application programs, with WordPerfect's word processors and Borland's spreadsheet. They also transform Novell into a software powerhouse with annual revenues of close to Dollars 2bn, second only to Microsoft, the world's largest software company with revenues last year of Dollars 3.75bn. For the first time, Microsoft will face competition from a company with the size and breadth of products to challenge its own market dominance. Novell seems to relish the opportunity for a market battle. There is no love lost between Novell and 'the boys from Seattle', as Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell chief executive, calls Microsoft's youthful executives. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has charged that Novell 'has a vendetta against us', and Mr Noorda has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive business practices. Microsoft is being investigated by the US Justice Department, and Novell has played an active role in providing information to the anti-trust investigators. Novell has also filed an anti-trust complaint against Microsoft in Europe. However, Mr Noorda carefully avoided any comment on Microsoft yesterday, and analysts said his plans to expand Novell may shift attention away from Microsoft's market dominance. Until now, Novell has competed with Microsoft only in the area of operating systems, the software that controls the basic functions of a computer or network of computers. Novell's Netware is the leading network operating system. Last year, Novell also acquired Unix, a computer operating system widely used in 'open systems' computing. Novell faces increasing competition, however, from Microsoft's recently-introduced Windows NT, an operating system for networked computer systems. With its acquisition of WordPerfect and purchase of Borland's spreadsheet, Novell will now go head to head with Microsoft in the booming market for office software 'suites', or bundles of business software applications, including word-processing, spreadsheets and database management. Novell also plans to leverage its leadership in networking software to create a class of applications products called 'groupware', aimed at teams of workers. Such software would include messaging, task management, document management and workflow tools, Novell said. In this market segment, Novell will compete with Microsoft and Lotus Development, the third-largest personal computer software company. 'The era of stand-alone personal computing is evolving into group collaboration that connects individuals, groups and companies,' said Mr Noorda. 'Novell's objective is to accelerate this market transition.' Yet Novell's expansionary moves also reflect tough times in the software industry, as smaller companies find it increasingly difficult to compete with 'mighty Microsoft', with its broad distribution and marketing clout, and to keep pace with a price war. WordPerfect and Borland have both lost market share over the past year, according to market analysts. WordPerfect has recently laid off more than 1,000 employees, or 17 per cent of its workforce. Borland has faced cashflow problems as it slashed prices in an attempt to gain market share. Borland said on Monday it would restructure its operations, following the sale to Novell of its leading product. Large staff cuts are expected. Novell's extensive distribution network, with 25,000 resellers worldwide, could breath new life into WordPerfect and Borland's spreadsheet business, industry analysts say. Novell faces the challenge, however, of integrating the new businesses into its established operations. 'Mergers are difficult in any industry, but more so in software because you have to combine different code bases, as well as different cultures,' said Mr Pete Higgins, Microsoft vice-president. However, Novell is not new to these challenges. Over the past 10 years the company has acquired no fewer than 15 software companies, although none the size of WordPerfect. And Mr Noorda says long-standing friendships between executives of the two companies, whose offices are just a few miles apart, will help to make the combination 'a natural merger'. A more pressing problem for Novell is who will replace Mr Noorda, who at 69 is about to retire. 'We are on track to find my successor by mid-June,' said Mr Noorda, who has been talking to several industry executives outside the company. Thus, although Mr Noorda may have realised his dream of creating a new 'software powerhouse', the newly-expanded Novell faces significant uncertainties. It also remains to be seen how Lotus Development will react to Novell's expansion plans. Four years ago, Lotus and Novell aborted a planned merger, after the two companies failed to agree on who should head the merged businesses. Mr Noorda says he recently rejected an attempt by Lotus to resurrect talks. Novell's acquisitions do, however, confirm a broad trend in the software industry toward consolidation. Last week, Aldus and Adobe Systems, two leaders in desktop publishing software, also announced plans to merge.</p>

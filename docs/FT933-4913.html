			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Shortlist for Greek railway project THE Greek government has shortlisted five international consortia to bid for a Dr80bn (Pounds 225m) project to build a single-line underground railway for Thessaloniki in northern Greece. The Public Works Ministry said the contract for the 9.3km underground would be awarded at the end of this year, with construction due to start early in 1994. The ministry indicated that bidders who could guarantee completion of the turnkey project by 1997, the year when Thessaloniki becomes cultural capital of Europe, would hold an advantage in the selection process. Thessaloniki has already launched a Dr30bn public works programme to improve the city's infrastructure and cultural facilities. The twin-track line, crossing the city centre, will be constructed at a depth of 15 metres, well below an extensive archaeological layer containing remains of the city's Roman and Byzantine past. However, a considerable amount of archaeological excavation, which could cause delays, will still be needed. The Greek state is to cover half the project's cost and will also subsidise fares. The remainder of the financing is to be provided by the contractor, which will be entitled to operate the system for 25 years. According to preliminary studies, 30m-50m passengers a year would use the underground. The five contenders are: Interinfra, a French consortium involved in a project to extend the Athens underground system; Alexandrian Metro, led by Siemens of Germany, which is also participating in the Athens project; Mechaniki, led by a northern Greek construction company; Louygues, a French, Canadian and Greek consortium including Bouygues of France and Bombardier of Canada; and Iris-Rommetro, a Greek-Romanian group.</p>

The Area Must Have Attained the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Cabinet's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar year 1989 through calendar year 1991 show an expected exceedance rate of less than 1.0 per year of the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS in the marginal nonattainment areas. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) In addition, there were no violations reported for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  seasons. Because the nonattainment areas have complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the areas have met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS. The Commonwealth of Kentucky has committed to continue monitoring in the nonattainment areas in accordance with 40 CFR 58.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110, and Part D of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 25, 1980, August 7, 1981, November 24, 1981,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 30, 1981, and March 30, 1983, EPA fully approved Kentucky's SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 6092, 46 FR 40188, 46 FR 57486, 46 FR 58080, and 48 FR 13168). The approved control strategy did not result in attainment of NAAQS for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Additionally, the amended CAA revised section 182(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed the Kentucky SIP to ensure that it contains all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted its redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 110 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 110 was amended by the CAA of 1990, the Kentucky SIP for the marginal nonattainment areas meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Part D Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the nonattainment areas may be redesignated to attainment, they must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Owensboro and Edmonson County nonattainment areas were classified as marginal (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.318). The Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted their request for redesignation of the marginal nonattainment areas prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the Commonwealth of Kentucky must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176, but is not required to meet the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D, which became due on or after November 15, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

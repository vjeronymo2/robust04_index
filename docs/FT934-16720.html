			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Victory for all the president's men: Parliament's defeat might tempt Yeltsin to prolong autocratic rule and delay reform In retrospect, what had seemed on Sunday a rout of the forces of President Boris Yeltsin by the pro-parliamentary mob on the Moscow streets was, wittingly or not, a bloody but brilliant trap. Released from their 12-day confinement in the White House, the parliament building, the defenders, led by ex-general, ex-vice-president, acting President Alexander Rutskoi, launched themselves on the mayoral offices and the Ostankino TV centre. Their easy success at the mayoralty - from which the riot troops fled ignominiously - made them drunk with success (some were already literally so). Their attack on Ostankino, initially partially successful, was halted late last night and by early yesterday morning repulsed. From 7am, divisions loyal to the president had removed any doubts as to their willingness to fight fellow Russians - blasting away at the White House with enthusiasm, blackening its shining facade in hours. From the president's men came a steady barrage of propaganda, identifying those within the building as criminals, communists and fascists: 'Our only task,' said General Dmitry Volkogonov, Mr Yeltsin's military adviser, 'is to clean these fascist bandits out of parliament and out of Moscow.' Mr Yeltsin's television appearance early yesterday was almost contrite. His weakness, he said, was in being over-patient, not prepared for the ferocity of his opponents. He had taken a calculated risk, but his citizens could well ask why he was not prepared, given that the omission caused many deaths. However, he knows well the psychology of his fellow countrymen and women, which tends towards pity for the underdog and the victim - a fact that inhibited him from attacking parliament building before it clearly revealed itself as the aggressor. Before and during his troops' recapture of the White House, his moderate opponents were forced to choose - and chose him. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the most prominent candidate for Mr Yeltsin's job when elections are held, called on him to attack the parliament ruthlessly. Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, head of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, who has been consistently critical of the president, said: 'His weaknesses are well known, but now we don't have a choice: we support the president.' The sight of armed bands roaming Moscow's streets, prepared to capture, beat or kill mayoral aides and television staff, flaunting communist or fascist banners, sickened all but the most hardened anti-Yeltsinites. Once more, Mr Yeltsin has shown he is a good man in a tight corner. But this time he has also shown that he, or his advisers, can construct and execute a plan successfully. Preparing the ground with visits to the crack divisions around Moscow (exactly those that came to his aid); giving an elaborate display of willingness to compromise with parliament; insisting on constructing a government and a team from one spectrum of politics (at the cost, of course, of confusion in economic policy) - all of these came to serve him well. He has waded through blood, but he can plausibly say he had no choice. The hard fact is that he has probably benefited from so doing. Communism has been convincingly identified with violence, extremism and its supposed opposite, fascism. The flag most in evidence around the White House before the attack, the most common banner on the victorious marches on Sunday, was the red flag. Its more moderate supporters claimed they were fulfilling part of their old duty of protecting the wretched. Now, they have supported an uprising which claimed many victims - and which failed. To be sure, the spectacle - watched up close by many in Moscow - of armour pounding parliament, roused feelings of sympathy for the people inside. But the winner in Russia still takes, if not all, a great deal: and one would expect many of the regions, shorn of a federal parliament with which to ally themselves, to seek an accommodation with a victorious president. The neighbouring states, led by Ukraine and Lithuania, yesterday reaffirmed their support for the 'democratic forces' under the president. They had little choice, since his opponents were increasingly clear that they wished to resurrect the Soviet Union from which the states had escaped. The regions, still to respond, will also have to live with Mr Yeltsin, and few will see much profit in continued principled opposition. If he goes to an election quickly - and the Interfax news agency, citing his advisers, yesterday said he now thought he should have simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections in short order - he can probably win as a law and order president. There is, again, the risk of his losing as a slayer of Russians and a destroyer of the constitution. But if he continues to insist that he wants to construct a new democracy, he may convince many of his citizens to support him, because in the main they simply want peace and elementary order. It is here, of course, that the largest danger lies - one that has been imminent since he closed down parliament and thus precipitated this turn of events two weeks ago this evening. The threat is of a president who finds the exercise of sole, untrammelled power attractive, and who convinces himself and his circle - or is convinced by his circle - that the prolongation (temporary, of course) of presidential rule is best for the country. This passage of arms gives him cause to think so. Here was, it seems, a monstrous and murderous conspiracy to overthrow the state with armed force. As Gen Volkogonnov and Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, said yesterday, the 'mopping up' operations of armed extremists in Moscow and elsewhere will take some time - a curfew has already been imposed. Mr Yeltsin has banned all groups that took part in the defence of the White House, and frozen their funds. Mr Yuri Afanasiev, the veteran radical democrat who was at the forefront of perestroika under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and who deserted Mr Yeltsin because of his lack of commitment to reform, sounded doubtful yesterday: 'I hope we can get through this to democracy: if the president can manage this, we may yet build a secure foundation for it - but everything now depends on him.' Everything now does indeed depend on him and on his advisers and ministers. In removing parliament he has cut out a poison, but not yet cauterised the wound. If left to gape, it could fester well beyond Moscow. After the exhaustion of the past few days, he must again gird himself to give new impetus to reforms that will produce no quick results, but without which his country could more easily fall to the forces defeated yesterday. History is replete with dictators who destroyed or rendered servile their popular assemblies in order to have unimpeded power. Mr Yeltsin claims to be an exception. He has acted, he says, not to rule without hindrance but to construct a balanced division of powers on a democratic basis. His case is also that the parliament - which originally elected him, supported him, then turned against him - is a remnant of an irrelevant communist past. This claim is at once full of sense and full of danger. Many ordinary people, by their testimony on the streets, find Mr Yeltsin threatening - both because he has smashed the countervailing power and because he ploughs on with reforms that they cannot understand and from which they do not benefit. On the bridge overlooking the White House yesterday morning, as the shells crashed into its walls, Mrs Yevgenia Zaglyadina, a middle-aged teacher, was semi-hysterical: 'Look, this is fascism; this is how it comes,' she said. 'This is its victory. Yeltsin is at its head.' Now, Mrs Zaglyadina and others have no choice: there is no one else in a position of independent authority in whom they can place their trust. Mr Yeltsin has survived a test of fire. He faces the longer, less controllable test of bringing together, constructing and letting grow new - and opposing - forces that will form a new Russia. The shedding of blood - and the toll will be many hundreds - will be of some value if this massive task is accomplished through its sacrifice.</p>

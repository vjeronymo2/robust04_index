			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Codelco output boost ruled out Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, would not change its production plans to compensate for Dollars 207m losses on futures trading, said Mr Alejandro Noemi, who resigned as president at the weekend. The plans aimed to give it maximum output without damaging its long-term viability and this would not be put at risk by a boost in output for two or three months, he added. An interim report into the losses concluded that failure to implement controls had allowed Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the chief futures trader, to mount more than 5,000 operations in the four months from September 1993 that caused losses of Dollars 164m on copper futures, Dollars 30.6m on silver and Dollars 12.1m on gold. Codelco confirmed that Mr Davila put details of transactions into his computer incorrectly last September. Failure of controls had allowed him to start a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort trade Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the London market yesterday as Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) placed its entire stake and finally put an end to the takeover speculation that had surrounded the two banks. The French state-owned bank, which is at the top of the country's ambitious privatisation programme, sold its stake, which represented 4.68 per cent of the Kleinwort equity or 6.15m shares, via Cazenove and Smith New Court. The two securities houses placed the shares with investment institutions at 488p apiece, a 10p discount to the underlying share price. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, the French bank said yesterday that it had an 'excellent working relationship with the Kleinwort Benson group, which it envisages will continue'. BNP bought the stake in March 1991 at 340p a share and there were indications last year that it harboured ambitions to take over the merchant bank. However, Mr Philip Gibbs, merchant bank analyst with BZW, said: 'I think relations did cool between the two and what might have become an agreement ended up as merely an investment.' The sale follows the decision only a fortnight ago by American International Group (AIG), a leading US insurance group, to sell its 6.6 per cent holding acquired in 1988. Yesterday, Kleinwort Benson eased a penny to 497p in the market on turnover of 15m shares.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Keating's party trick WHEN THE time came, Mr Paul Keating said, he would flick the switch to vaudeville. And so he did. The Australian prime minister's victory in Saturday's election is a triumph for his political skills and street-brawler instincts. When he ousted Mr Bob Hawke in December 1991, the best hope of the Labor party was that he would limit the extent of an apparently inevitable defeat. Instead, he won by making the opposition's modest tax reform plan, which was similar to one he himself had once advocated, appear to be a fundamental attack on egalitarian Australia's way of life. The conservatives become the latest opposition to rue tax proposals that could be portrayed as increases likely to hit the broad electorate. In fact, the general sales tax proposed by Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader, would have been accompanied by abolition and reduction of other taxes. Food prices might have fallen. But Mr Keating pressed every button guaranteed to win votes: the GST would cause a blanket 15 per cent rise in prices of everyday goods; it would benefit the rich at the expense of the poor; it provoked Canadians into ejecting prime minister Brian Mulroney (at best, only partly true). That Labor should win a fifth consecutive term is the more remarkable given that voting is compulsory and more than 1m of a population of 18m are unemployed. Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, federal treasurer for eight years, cannot carry all the blame for the recession from which Australia is emerging. Financial deregulation in the 1980s brought an explosion in financial assets and entrepreneurs' excesses. Biggest problem As a result, Australia's recession began earlier than those in the rest of the industrialised world. But, overall, Labor's policies of opening up the economy - reducing tariffs, floating the currency, deregulating markets, freeing labour markets, and shifting the attention towards Asia - were what Australia needed. The biggest problem for Labor was that, like the Republicans in the US and the Conservatives in Britain, the party ran out of new ideas. Mr Keating's campaign provided little evidence that he has yet hit upon any. However, the fact that he has now definitively established his party leadership may allow him to force new blood into government. After the pain of the recession, the new administration inherits a fundamentally favourable situation, with the economy growing moderately, inflation squeezed virtually to zero and rising demand generating higher productivity. Its challenge - one in which Australia is scarcely unique - is that the economy's projected growth, even after promised fiscal stimulus and a likely further easing of monetary policy, is unlikely to be fast enough to reduce unemployment. Basic approach This is not easy for any government to correct. However, a renewal of Labor's basic approach of the 1980s would help the economy to grow along lines likely to lead in the end to faster job creation. Labour reform has slowed: exporters would be more competitive if labour market rigidities in the docks and in domestic freight services were addressed. Tariff cuts need to be implemented with greater determination, to help make the automobile, textile and sugar industries more competitive. That would help redirect investment capital into areas, such as computer software development, where Australian industry is showing promising signs. Remaining curbs on financial markets should be lifted. The irony is that, while the ruthless campaign has narrowed his options, tax reform should nevertheless be on Mr Keating's agenda. The current structure is biased against exports and savings, both of which Australia, with its heavy foreign debt burden, needs urgently to increase. Mr Keating has made it clear that he sees Australia's future in Asia. Given the extraordinary dynamism of the region, this is a sensible attitude which he should develop further, even though its aim is partly a defence against European and American trade blocs. If he is to hold office with as much skill as he showed in winning it, however, he has to demonstrate that he has a freshness of vision across other areas of policy as well.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hu Deqiao (5170 1795 1564), affiliated with the </F> State System Reform Commission's General Office: "Storming the  Fortifications: Reform of China's Property Rights System"]    [Text] As property rights is a crucial economic system  matter, property-rights system reform is the crux of economic  system reform.    In China's 15 years of reform and opening, our property  rights relations have undergone a great change. In the last two  years in particular, our pace of property rights reform has  clearly accelerated.  <H5>  I. The Ownership Structure </H5>   As to the proportional structure of our national GVIO and  retail commodity sales, from 1978 to the end of 1992, our ratio  of output value to gross value of industrial output dropped from  77.6 percent to 48.3 percent for state industrial enterprises,  with this ratio for collective industrial enterprises up from  22.4 percent to 38.2 percent, and for other industrial  enterprises, such as foreign-funded enterprises, individual, and  private, up from zero to 13.5 percent. In retail commodity  sales, the state-sector percentage dropped from 54.6 percent in  1978 to 41.3 percent by 1992, with the percentage down for the  collective sector from 43.3 percent to 27.9 percent, but up for  other economic components from 2.1 percent to 30.8 percent. This  shows that our unitary public-ownership system has been replaced  by a group-ownership structure dominated by public ownership.  <H5>  II. Upgrading the Shareholding System </H5>   In the last two years, China has created a good public  climate for shareholding-system experiments, making these two  years our historical stage of the best and fastest growth for  shareholding-system enterprises. By the end of 1993, China had  over 10,300 experimental shareholding enterprises in all fields,  with 182 joint-stock companies from more than 20 provinces and  autonomous regions throughout China listed in Shanghai and  Shenzhen, for an overall stock market value (for A shares) of  about 400 billion yuan. In 1993, while actively issuing shares  to the public and continuing to expand the supply of  experimental B shares offered to foreign investors, nine of our  strongest state enterprises raised capital on international  money markets. In addition, the number of urban shareholding  enterprises had topped 100,000 by the end of 1993. And rural  shareholding-cooperative enterprises have grown rapidly in  number to 2.08 million, making up 10 percent of all township  enterprises in China.  <H5>  III. Foreign-Investment Attraction and Capital Export </H5>   China has basically evolved a new order of a "three-coast"  open front along the coast, the rivers, and the borders and an  overall opening on all levels in the hinterland regions,  steadily improving our foreign investment climate. Statistics  show that 126 countries and regions have invested in China, with  the largest investment from Hong Kong, and next from Taiwan and  the United States. We have accumulated 167,500 foreign-funded  enterprises. By the end of 1993, China had approved 174,000  foreign-invested projects, for contracted foreign investment of  $217.216 billion, and an actual foreign investment of $56.912  billion. China has become the country with the largest inflow of  foreign investment in the world.    In the last two years, foreign-funded enterprises have begun  to gradually expand from coastal zones toward inland provinces  and cities and western China.    China is not only the largest recipient of foreign  investment, but also the largest capital exporter among  developing countries. China has set up and invested in 4,497  enterprises in over 120 countries and regions, with 2,927 being  trading enterprises, and 1,570 non-trade ones, for an overall  Chinese investment of $5.16 billion.  <H5>  IV. Practicing "State Ownership but Private Operation" for </H5> Small State Enterprises    In the last two years, we have conducted reform experiments  mostly in the forms of leasing and leased sale, which has become  a reform hotspot for our state commercial, supply and marketing  cooperative, and grain systems throughout China. Provinces or  prefectures, cities, and counties in northeastern, northern,  western, eastern, and south-central regions are practicing  "state ownership but private operation" for enterprises on a  large scale, with this percentage at 60 percent for Henan, 43  percent for Hebei, 20 percent for Anhui, 35 percent for Nanjing,  60 percent for Chongqing, and 60 percent for Beijing's  commercial system. This reform has achieved marked success.  <H5>  V. Property-Rights Transaction Markets </H5>   Over 20 provinces and more than 10 cities authorized to  formulate their own plans independently throughout China, such  as Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei,  Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Changchun, Shenyang,  Dalian, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning,  Kunming, Wuxi, and Lanzhou, have established over 120  property-rights transaction markets of varying degrees and sizes.    As China's property-rights transactions have just now  started, their volume is still less than 1 percent of the proper  market access, far below the property-rights transaction  economies of scale. Analysis estimates that our domestic assets  in urgent need of turnover amount to 1 trillion yuan, with 30-40  percent in a state of inefficiency or idle. This shows that  China's property-rights markets and transactions are in urgent  need of breakthroughs.  <H5>  VI. Individual and Private Economies </H5>   By the end of 1993, China's private enterprises had grown to  238,000, employing 3.726 million, with registered capital of  68.05 billion yuan, and annual tax payments (including  individual industrial and commercial operations) topping 29  billion yuan. Private enterprises accounted for respectively 4.1  percent, 18.1 percent, and 7.8 percent of our national  industrial output value, retail commodity sales, and industrial  and commercial taxes. Our private-economy industrial structure  grew steadily more rational, with the percentage of private  enterprises engaged in tertiary industries at 41.9 percent, of  which private S&amp;T advisory enterprises grew fastest to number  3,871, up 220 percent from the same period in 1992.    Meanwhile, individual industrial and commercial household  operations have also grown quickly. By the end of 1993, they had  grown to 17.67 million throughout China, with registered capital  of 85.48 billion yuan, employing 29.39 million. In addition,  China's private S&amp;T enterprises have also shown much  vitality.  Incomplete figures show that by the end of 1993, they had topped  50,000, employing more than 800,000, with gross income from  technician trade exceeding 25 billion yuan.  <H5>  VII. Enterprise Mergers and Bankruptcy </H5>   1. As enterprise mergers began sooner, they have made smooth  progress. Data for the 1980s show that 25 provinces and cities  and 13 cities authorized to formulate their own plans  independently throughout China merged 6,226 enterprises with  6,906 others, for newly moved stock assets of 8.25 billion yuan,  reducing losing enterprises by 4,095 and enterprise losses by  522 million yuan. In the last two years, enterprise mergers have  been even more successful. By the end of 1993, the number of  merged enterprises had topped 10,000, cutting down on a large  group of losing enterprises, and freeing up a large amount of  idle assets.    2. A number of enterprises have been eliminated through  market competition and gone bankrupt according to law. From the  time our "Bankruptcy Law" took effect in 1988 through the first  half of 1993, 356 enterprises went into legal bankruptcy due to  poor management and longstanding losses, of which 88 were  state-owned, and 268 were collective and other types of  enterprises. Enterprise bankruptcy is an inevitable outcome of a  market economy and the laws of competition. We need to improve  our dynamics in this area so that, while continuing to set up  and improve our social security system, we can promote more  enterprise bankruptcy according to law, and establish as quickly  as possible bankruptcy mechanisms suited to modern  market-economy needs.  <H5>  VIII. Inventorying Assets and Funds </H5>   The experimental job of inventorying assets and funds  throughout China began in 1992. By 1993, the experimental scope  had expanded quickly to 9,401 state enterprises, with 825,000  administrative-institution units conducting assets checks. These  checks began to clarify "resources," reinforcing enterprise  development stamina. After revaluation, the fixed assets of the  9,401 enterprises appreciated 42 percent, or 180 billion yuan.  As to the checking of administrative units, by 31 December 1992,  for 824,496 state administrative-institution units throughout  China at and above the town and township level (not including  Shanghai Municipality, enterprises, and military institutions),  overall verified assets were worth 836.479 billion yuan, up  143.623 billion yuan from their pre-check book value of 692.856  billion yuan, or 20.7 percent. Our inventorying of assets and  funds in 1994 will focus mainly on experiments in converting  enterprise operating forces, practicing a state-assets oversight  system, and setting up a modern enterprise system, with the  number of experimental enterprises kept at about 10,000, mostly  large and midsize ones. This will include 1,000 enterprises  experimentally practicing the state-assets oversight system, 100  experimentally setting up a modern enterprise system, and other  enterprise experiments in areas, such as incorporation and  shareholding.    As to state-assets property-rights registration, we  completed  in 1992 yearly property-rights registration for 1,373 grade-1  central enterprises, registering state assets worth 891.86  billion yuan, for state capital worth 634.92 billion yuan. We  conducted a yearly registration for 15,357 enterprises below  grade-2 with trustee management by all sectors, registering  state assets worth 120.6 billion yuan. In addition, we also  counted state assets. The data for 1992 show state assets  throughout China worth more than 3 trillion yuan.  <H5>  IX. The State-Assets Management System </H5>   1. We have actively conducted comprehensive reform  experiments of our state-assets management system. To promote  the separation of government administration from business  management, sever the administrative subordinate relations  between enterprises and the government sector, and separate the  government's administrative functions from its  state-assets-ownership management functions, in 1992 in Tianjin,  Shenzhen, Fujian's Quanzhou, and Sichuan's Deyang we first began  to set up and prepare to set up full-time government management  organs for state-assets ownership, establishing first in  Shenzhen and then in Quanzhou city-level state-assets management  commissions. Shanghai set up in 1993 a state-assets management  commission. Shenzhen and Quanzhou have also conducted  experiments in giving property-rights mechanisms access to  enterprises, in which experimental enterprises set up ownership  representative-agency boards of directors, to practice the  president responsibility system under the leadership of a board  of directors.    2. We have conducted experiments in establishing  investment-management and special property-management companies  subordinate to the State Administration of state property  sector. Data from some provinces, cities, and regions show that  by the end of 1992, 36 such companies had been set up. Cities,  such as Shenzhen, Beijing, and Qingdao, have also set up special  state-property management companies. Qingdao has removed its No  1 Light Industry Bureau, establishing the Qingdao Yiqing  Industrial Corp to specially manage its state property. This  corporation is commissioned by the municipal government to  manage the state-enterprise assets of the former No 1 Light  Industry Bureau, having used operations, such as investment,  shareholding, mergers, joint operations, compensated transfers,  assets transfers, and joint and contractual joint ventures, to  optimize its industrial structure and product mix, achieving  assets appreciation and profit maximization.    3. We have conducted reform experiments in authorized  management of state property. In April 1993, the state set eight  enterprise groups as China's first batch of  authorized-management experiments for state property, in which  the State Administration of State Property sector uniformly  authorized the enterprise groups' core enterprises to manage the  state property of their closely integrated member enterprises,  establishing a property-rights link between the core enterprises  and their closely-integrated members, making the core enterprise  the enterprise group's parent company, and the closely  integrated members its subsidiaries, to achieve group  management, and bring overall advantages into full play.    4. State-property evaluation organs are essentially  established, with evaluation services beginning to form up.  Incomplete figures since 1990 show that there are now over 1,000  evaluation organs qualified for assets evaluation and authorized  at the provincial level and above, with staffs of nearly 20,000.  By June 1993, over 22,000 assets evaluations had been conducted  throughout China, with the evaluated assets having an original  book value of 290 billion yuan, and a net book value of 230  billion yuan, which appreciated to 360 billion yuan after  evaluation, for an average appreciation rate of 57 percent.  <H5>  X. Legal Establishment </H5>   Since reform and opening, China has drawn up and put into  effect a series of laws and regulations concerning  property-rights system-reform. We are now preparing to draw up  others, such as a state property law, a shareholding-cooperation  enterprise law, a real estate law, a stock law, an auction law,  and a wholly foreign-owned enterprise law.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Dynamic dancing THE PLACE'S policy of 'come one, come all' indicates a generosity of artistic nature that verges on the saintly (and few saints, on pyre or rack, have known the torments that a gently raised critic suffers when faced with some of the Euro-trash on offer). The Place's assumption that from a flood of nincompoopery something valuable might emerge bore fruit a couple of years ago when the Flemish choreographer Wim Vanderkeybus first came to London. His was a dance theatre of blatant physicality, where risk-taking, and the body launched Exocet-like on a destructive path, was a searingly effective means of expression. Vanderkeybus has returned to The Place with his latest creation, Always the Same Lies. It is a piece which proclaims the continuing ferocity of his movement style, but shows that style now sitting at odds with pretention, chit-chat, and politely anarchic games. (Much sticky fun is had by the cast in throwing, and dropping, eggs.) The show lasts ninety minutes, of which half is devoted to bad behaviour: there is something infantile in the tantrums, the secret little activities, that serve as breathing-space between bursts of wild and exquisitely gauged physical bravura. I cannot believe that a creator as able as Vanderkeybus is beating his head against the ancient stone-wall of People's Failure To Communicate, as his cast babble in various languages. Nor that the caprices of a girl filling her pockets with water, or another girl scraping her amplified boot over the floor, serve any dramatic purpose. The indiscernible theme to the evening is 'the life and memories of an eccentric octogenarian seaman', and film clips mock and patronise an old man in unedifying fashion. But the value of Vanderkeybus' work lies in its daring, physical and emotional. For this we forgive the muddled dramatics, the messy, juvenile sport. (Twice the cast throw garments at the audience and then, like a child with a lost ball, ask for them back. Their bravado is as hollow as their posturing). But there is nothing indecisive about the movement made by the five men and three women, nor any uncertainties in the visual power of the dance or the general design (a patchwork floor-cloth that becomes a luminous back-drop is beautiful). Three chairs, three hammocks, hang from the ceiling. The men play Tarzan games, and plummet from the chairs; the women lie and swing in hammocks that are like worlds for them. But the greater and most exhilarating part of the text shows the cast racing in long loops around the dance area, ducking under each other, crashing to the floor and moving on in bold phrases of energy that argue split-second timing, extreme physical skill, vast security of ensemble-playing. It is a dynamic style owing much to 'slamming' (that dangerous punk-dance fashion), and its tireless physicality, the sense of communicated bravado and relentless tempo, more than compensate for its ultimately limited range of effects. (Well, trapeze-artists and wall-off-death performers - whom Vanderkeybus' troupe passingly resemble - have a no less limited resource of tricks). It is in this that Vanderkeybus' true theatre resides. Angry, desperate, bitterly mocking - and exhausted by these emotions - it makes the intervening muddle seem even less convincing. Wim Vanderkeybus is at the Place until Saturday, May 16. His visit is supported by The Ministry of the Flemish Community in Belgium.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has been conveying its concern to the  United States and other countries about the deployment of  Prithvi and continued development of Agni missile by India.  Answering questions by newsmen at a briefing in Islamabad  today, a Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan pointed out to  member countries of Missile Technology Control Regime that this  will be a serious development. India could deploy these missiles  with its nuclear capability, raising the specter of nuclear arms  race and endangering peace and security in the horn of South  Asia. He said Pakistan still hopes that international community  will prevail over India to stop its reckless move toward this  new arms race.</p>

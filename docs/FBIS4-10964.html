			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, April 19 (CTK) -- Czech Premier  Vaclav Klaus arrived for an official visit to Argentina last  night.    His Argentinian visit is the first on his ten-day trip  around  South America, which is to lead him also to Chile and Brazil.    At a briefing held after his arrival, Klaus told journalists  that his trip was aimed to establish the best possible mutual  contacts and find methods of the extension of mutual trade. The  Czech Republic is open to the world and, like Argentina,  fighting against all kinds of protectionism, Klaus said.    Argentinian Economic Minister Domingo Cavallo, at present  also in charge of foreign affairs, who met Klaus at the airport,  showed interest in the privatization process in the Czech  Republic.    Later in the night, Klaus was to visit the prestigious  Argentinian Committee for Foreign Relations, where he was to  acquaint leading Argentinian politicians with the transformation  process now underway in the Czech Republic, and with his  country's integration into European political, security and  economic structures.    During his three-day stay in Buenos Aires, Klaus is to hold  talks with Cavallo and meet with Argentinian President Carlos  Menem. He is to lecture at Buenos Aires' Belgrano University  and meet with representatives of Argentinian financial, business  and industrial circles.</p>

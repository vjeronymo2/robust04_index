			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Bad blood flows after Japanese media coup d'etat: Fujisankei ousts chairman FUJISANKEI, one of Japan's biggest media groups, yesterday ousted its chairman, provoking the unusual spectacle of a Japanese boardroom row being conducted in public as well as a mutiny in the deeply conservative empire. The departure of Mr Hiroaki Shikanai, 47, was described variously yesterday by Mr Shigeaki Hazama, president of Sankei Shimbun, the 2m circulation daily which is a main part of the group, as a 'duel', an act of 'self-catharsis' and 'house-cleaning for Sankei'. Mr Shikanai, a banker before he became chairman just two years ago, was given the job after marrying into the founding family. Mr Shikanai, who was first ousted from Sankei Shimbun and then resigned his remaining group posts, at a press conference condemned the decision by the newspaper's directors as 'illegal because it was unilaterally taken without any specific reason'. While saying he was willing to meet the group board to 'avoid further confusion and turmoil', he added that he was contemplating legal action. Mr Shikanai owns key minority shareholdings in various parts of the interlocking, privately-owned organisation, which also controls the Fuji television network, a Tokyo radio station, and Pony Canyon, a music and video cassette supplier which owned a quarter of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music before he sold the division to Thorn EMI. The fact that these holdings did not protect him signals the carefully concerted nature of the putsch by fellow directors. Their troubles may not now be over, though - Mr Shikanai is suspected to have been stake-building in recent months by buying shares from family members. For example, his 6.8 per cent officially registered holding in Nippon Broadcasting, the radio station, is regarded by some to be on the low side. Yesterday he said only he would 'explore ways to develop and promote the group'. His ousting came a month after Japan's gaudy popular press began chronicling claims of his high-handedness - allegedly demoting those who displeased him and demanding that his photograph in an in-house publication be made larger. Yesterday such papers were describing him as a 'dictator' who 'rode the company like a souped-up trail bike'. However racy, his management style had no apparent ill effect on the group's trading performance. Fujisankei does not publish profit figures, but sales have been on a steadily rising trend and were up 8.7 per cent in 1991. At the heart of the affair, although not made explicit by Fujisankei directors yesterday, appear instead to be payments totalling Y1.7bn (Pounds 7.1m) which group companies made as a posthumous retirement allowance to Mr Nobutaka Shikanai, his father-in-law, who died in October 1990. (Mr Shikanai senior had adopted the younger man on his marriage and the death of his own eldest son, and allowed him to take the family name before succeeding him as chairman.) In response to observations that he would himself benefit from such payments as an inheritance, Mr Shikanai insisted that the decision had not been his personally, had been discussed within the group, and was in accordance with its rules. He was outraged that he had been 'fired as if involved in corruption'. While not referring directly to the payments, Mr Hazama said it was 'inexcusable for anyone to use a corporation as if it is his own personal property'. He added: 'A newspaperman is presumed to behave with special responsibility vis-a-vis society. In this connection, Shikanai lacks the qualifications to represent a newspaper.' Media professionals ascribed the upheaval to Mr Shikanai's status as an outsider - his previous career was with Industrial Bank of Japan. Professor Akihiko Haruhara of the journalism school at Tokyo's Jochi University said: 'The problem for the group is that a man who has nothing to do with journalism was placed in the top position.' But back on the outside, Mr Shikanai, unless he is persuaded to part with his stake of 12.6 per cent or more in Sankei Shimbun, may still be in a position to cause headaches for the board.</p>

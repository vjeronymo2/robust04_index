			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Yu Cheng (6735 2052) ] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 29 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--At its  regular meeting to discuss interest rates last week, the Hong  Kong Association of Banks suddenly raised the rate of interest  on Hong Kong dollar deposits by a big margin. This clearly  reduced the difference between interest rates on loans and  deposits. It can thus be seen that public opinion is effective  in supervising any commercial organization. The purpose of the  major banks in their willingness to readjust greatly divergent  interest rates is evidently to defend the interest rate  agreement, which is to their advantage.    The United States has tightened short-term money supply on  two occasions since the beginning of February, causing  preferential interest rates for commercial banks to rise by 0.25  percent. This has made it possible for Hong Kong to make  corresponding readjustments. However, various categories of  interest rates in Hong Kong have been slightly higher than those  in the United States for a long period, and the new interest  rates in the United states are still lower than in Hong Kong.  Therefore, Hong Kong can either increase its interest rate by  0.25 percent or maintain the existing interest rate structure.  The move by the Hong Kong Association of Banks to suddenly  raise the interest rate for Hong Kong dollar deposits by 0.5 to  0.75 percent, while the major banks have raised their  preferential rates by only 0.25 percent, is greatly different  from the practice of many years. Evidently, this is a result of  pressure from public opinion.    In the past few months, the debate in society on abolishing  the interest rate agreement has become heated again, and demands  for abolition have become stronger and stronger. Therefore, the  banks have to be at combat readiness. This is because the  existing interest rate agreement is the only thing that attracts  the attention of the society. Once the monetary policy function  of the agreement has faded away or been abolished, the image of  the association in society would be even less noticeable and  would attract less attention. On the other hand, since the  major banks have a certain influence on the association and the  interest rate agreement, they are less willing to have the  agreement abolished.    Since public opinion says the banking sector takes advantage  of the interest rate agreement to make considerable gains from  the difference between interest rates on loans and deposits, and  the recent increase in interest rates on deposits decided by the  association was far greater than the movement in preferential  interest rate for the commercial banks, people cannot but  associate this move with the idea that the banking sector has  made a concession to public opinion in society.    In recent years, the banking sector has made extraordinary  gains during a period of low interest rates. The low cost of  capital has set off the impact of an evident slow down in  capital growth and has given support to the achievements of the  banking sector. Therefore, the banking sector strongly wishes  to defend the interest rate agreement. Before the readjustment  of interest rates, the interest rate agreement of the Hong Kong  Association of Banks fixed the interest rate for Hong Kong  dollar deposits at 1.5 percent, but the best lending rate at the  major banks was 6.5 percent. The difference between interest  rates for loans and deposits was 5 percent. This meant the  banks gained more than three and a half times the cost of  capital.    As far as the present situation is concerned, although the  Monetary Authority has new accounting arrangements and a  regulatory mechanism for capital raising, and can effectively  and appropriately operate at any time in the open market in the  banking sector, the interest rate agreement has existed in Hong  Kong for many years after all, and the major banks have insisted  on maintaining the agreement and have made quite a big  concession to public opinion; therefore, we can consider  maintaining the agreement temporarily. However, society must  carry out supervision so that the banks cannot take advantage of  the agreement to reap staggering profits and that the legitimate  rights and interests of consumers can be protected.    In addition to reaping staggering profits by taking  advantage  of the interest rate agreement and the great difference between  interest rates on loans and deposits, some banking groups have  frequently increased charges in recent years and have even asked  for additional interest on loans under the pretext of so-called  rising costs or as compensation for loan risks. All this is  unfair to consumers. Banks are undoubtedly commercial  organizations, but they undertake great responsibilities in  society. Therefore, they should not collect charges at will and  society should exercise close supervision over them.</p>

Sailors Remind Presidents of Their Problems"]    [Text] Disputes about nuclear arms on Ukrainian territory  have relegated the Black Sea Fleet problem to the back burner.  The situation there remains tense, however, which was confirmed  by an appeal signed by officers of a Black Sea Fleet submarine  formation to the chiefs of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea, calling  for the status of the fleet and Sevastopol as its main base to  be determined as soon as possible.    The 1992 Russian-Ukrainian agreements called for a joint  command of the Black Sea Fleet during the transitional period  until 1995. In June 1993, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine  decided to split the Black Sea Fleet equally, and at the  September meeting in Crimea Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  agreed to hand the Ukrainian part of the fleet over to Russia  toward repaying Ukraine's debts for energy deliveries.    The appeal points out that uncertainty over the Black Sea  Fleet's political future may lead to a situation where Russia  will simply be left without a fleet in the Black Sea. Given  this, the authors of the appeal called on the leaders of Russia  and Ukraine to determine as soon as possible the status of Black  Sea Fleet servicemen and the city of Sevastopol as the fleet's  main base, and also to speed up the solution of the question of  dual citizenship for Black Sea Fleet sailors and their family  members. The appeal also suggests that Black Sea Fleet sailors  be allowed to receive pay on Russian territory if Ukraine is  unable to provide Black Sea Fleet servicemen with money.    Meanwhile, a lack of a definitive solution to the problem of  the Black Sea Fleet's status leads to a further heightening of  tensions. On Tuesday, the Black Sea Fleet press service  denounced attempts by the command of the Ukrainian Navy and the  authorities of the city of Izmail to establish control of the  Black Sea Fleet's naval engineering service units deployed in  far-flung garrisons. The statement says that the blackmail and  threats to which the Ukrainian authorities have subjected the  sailors may lead to unpredictable consequences. Some crews are  even ready to stop navigating the Danube as a protest.</p>

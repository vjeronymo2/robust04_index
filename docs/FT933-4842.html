			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Optimist in search of realism Sir, In answering Professor Furnham's questionnaire, 'Are you an optimistic or pessimistic boss?' (September 1), my score of 21 puts me firmly in the optimist's camp. The professor's 15 questions, however, must have caused many readers to think that 'realistic' or 'unrealistic' would be a more suitable tag for these bosses, according to the answers they gave and the final score totals achieved. Anyone, for instance, who 'strongly agrees' with the question, 'The most effective supervisor is one who gets the results management expects, regardless of the methods used in handling people', is not merely being pessimistic but totally unrealistic. It would be just such an unrealistic management attitude which would cause staff morale to flag and, ergo, company under-performance. Professor Furnham also refers to 'soft' management techniques and, although he does not say what these might be, he would doubtless agree that such techniques would come from what he calls the 'optimistic' bosses. Again I would say that these are the 'enlightened or realistic' bosses who understand the psychology of motivation. The use of staff incentives and motivation programmes continually proves not to be an optimistic or soft option. Indeed, by the results achieved, this enlightened style of management proves to be the realistic one.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Ciments chairman resigns CIMENTS Francais, one of France's largest cement companies, was yesterday clouded by controversy after the revelation of losses on off-balance sheet financial dealings believed to amount to several hundred million francs. The announcement triggered the resignation at an emergency board meeting yesterday morning of Mr Pierre Conso as chairman. The discovery could have serious implications for the sale earlier this year of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais to Italcementi, the Italian building materials concern, by Paribas, one France's most prestigious investment banking groups. Italcementi, which in April agreed to pay about FFr6bn (Pounds 700m) for a controlling holding in the heavily indebted French cement maker, identified the off-balance sheet losses after an in-depth audit into Ciments Francais. The discovery, first disclosed by a report in yesterday's Les Echos newspaper, was later confirmed by the Ciments Francais board. The original deal between Italcementi and Paribas preceded an unsuccessful share placing in July, which left the French bank and Italy's Mediobanca with large chunks of Ciments Francais' equity. Italcementi owns 45 per cent of Ciments Francais, with Mediobanca holding 15 per cent and Paribas 34 per cent. Yesterday's revelation fuelled speculation that Italcementi may claim compensation from Paribas for part of the purchase price. 'It looks as though Italcimenti will try to get some form of compensation, even if it involves a legal battle,' said Mr Pierre Boffet, construction analyst at the James Capel securities house in Paris. Paribas's shares fell sharply yesterday in Paris from FFr291 to FFr278.5. Ciments Francais' shares were suspended in Paris, as were those of Italcementi in Milan. Trading in the shares of Italmobiliare, which controls Italcementi, was also halted. Ciments Francais has been the centre of speculation upon its failure to publish interim results, expected by analysts 10 days ago. They had been expecting a sharp fall in operating profits from the FFr140m produced in the first half of 1991, because of the depressed state of cement sales in its main markets, France and Spain.

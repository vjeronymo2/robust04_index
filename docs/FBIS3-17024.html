Perry told reporters that the U.S. would give Ukraine an  additional $50 Mn to dismantle nuclear missiles. Last December,  the U.S. extended to Ukraine $135 Mn for this purpose.    Perry said that American-Ukrainian cooperation was of great  strategic significance and that interaction between the two  countries' military agencies was important too. He also  announced that an agreement had been reached in Kiev on frequent  and close contacts between the Ukrainian and American general  staffs.    Radetskyy said that with U.S. assistance Ukraine had got out  of the nuclear deadlock and signed the Moscow tripartite  statement, which was an event of historic significance. He also  pointed out that now nothing hampered Ukraine's joining the  nonproliferation treaty.    According to Interfax-Ukraine, during Perry's visit to  Ukraine a number of documents will be signed on the granting of  about $100 Mn to Ukraine.</p>

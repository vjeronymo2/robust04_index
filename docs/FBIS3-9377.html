The trucks had left Zagreb in the morning with 90 tonnes of  food and other relief material and were seized in the Tezlic  region southwest of the Moslem city, officials said. The  drivers were abducted and held for several hours, and turned up  later in the town of Zepce, controlled by Bosnian Croat forces,  said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees.    "It's a very serious incident," he said. One of the trucks  was later recovered but it was empty, he added.    Maglaj received its first aid convoy in five months on  Sunday  after Serb forces that had been attacking it eased their siege.  The town has a population of around 16,000.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Management: From boardroom to classroom - Tim Dickson on a programme that lets Britain's movers and shakers see what life is like in local communities HRH The Prince of Wales and Julia Cleverdon make a powerful combination. What other double act could persuade 80 top business people (many of them chief executives of Britain's biggest companies) to defy this week's rail strike and sultry weather for a worthy three-hour seminar in central London? An almost full house at St James' Palace, though, was what the heir to the throne and chief executive of Business In The Community achieved on Wednesday when the likes of British Aerospace's chief executive Dick Evans, Tesco marketing director Terry Leahy and National Westminster Bank chief executive Derek Wanless reported back on recent visits to inner-city schools, housing estates and homelessness centres around the country. Launched in 1990 as a means of widening the commitment of top managers to corporate community involvement, BITC's Seeing Is Believing initiative was originally intended as a one-off experiment. The outings just completed, however, were the ninth in the series and organisers say the exercise has proved very successful in enabling the nation's commercial movers and shakers to see the challenges at first hand, and in demonstrating to them the beneficial impact on community projects of corporate money and time. Community involvement has won a host of new corporate converts over the last decade. Membership of BITC has expanded steadily and the issues are increasingly aired these days in the annual reports of large public companies. Even so not all the sceptics are convinced, motives and strategies in many cases remain confused, and the sheer scale of social and economic deprivation can induce feelings of despair. One significance of Wednesday's seminar was that small business creation and enterprise agencies - the focus of much of BITC's effort 10 years ago - were barely mentioned. The real value of the session was the opportunity it provided to pool impressions, set priorities and draw up tentative action plans for the future. At least one participant alluded to the loneliness and isolation of top executives and said he was grateful for the opportunity to see 'the real nature of the street'. He confessed that his 'team' of fellow executives had been predisposed to see homelessness as an exclusively public-sector preoccupation. But the 'eye opening' visit convinced him and others that the problem was closely related to mental health, demonstrated that most young people on the streets are determined to escape their plight, and suggested to them that homelessness and joblessness were part of a vicious spiral of poverty. Perhaps the most touching request for support came from children on a Plymouth housing estate, whose placards called on their distinguished visitors to provide equipment for a play area. Burger King, whose general manager-Europe David Geddes witnessed the mini 'demo', subsequently obliged. The Plymouth team's lobbying 'clout' may be of greater strategic significance. Led by BAe's Evans, they have agreed to approach the Ministry of Defence with a view to releasing unused dockyard space for local business development. The clear message articulated by this group is that private- and public-sector businesses alike have a responsibility to help regenerate the local economy when they 'retreat' from a region. Frank Nicholson, managing director of Vaux Breweries, offered an upbeat account of the impact of private-sector involvement on the Pennywell estate two miles from the centre of Sunderland. Close to the bottom of most UK unemployment leagues, Pennywell had been depicted in the media as a sort of north-east equivalent of Al Capone's Chicago and a haven for drug dealers. But thanks to the efforts of local people - backed up by local business - Nicholson claims the whole area 'is unrecognisable from what it was five years ago'. The Vaux boss outlined three principles for successful action: the establishment of a partnership between all the influential locals; the outlining of a vision to which everyone could aspire; and the setting up of projects aimed at realising that vision. 'It became obvious to us that lots of people had been pursing their own agendas,' says Nicholson. 'By looking at the horizon rather than at the end of our noses we realised that we all had the same objective: to make Pennywell a place of which we could be proud.' The business case for corporate community involvement, meanwhile, was articulated by NatWest's Wanless. He admitted that until three years ago the bank's efforts were motivated largely by philanthropy, but that such activities are now more fully integrated and the benefits measured. NatWest's initiative to spread financial literacy in secondary schools, he explained, was equipping young people with the concepts of lending and enterprise and producing potential customers of the future. Participation in projects improved staff problem solving, leadership and communication skills (and was linked to the bank's appraisal). Other themes to emerge from Wednesday's discussion were: A widespread conviction that skills, time and other 'human' resources were more important gifts than money. The importance of finding a leader to co-ordinate the often confusing array of local initiatives (integral to the success of the Sunderland project). The value of short placements in companies for jobseekers. The potential to involve a greater proportion of the workforce (notably by 'gearing up' their out-of-office activities with office time). The strong focus on education (school visits, teacher placements, mentoring, encouraging employees to become school governors). The need to overcome apathy (particularly where projects fail to touch the lives of those they are supposed to help).</p>

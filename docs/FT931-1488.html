			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Greece awards river project THE Greek government yesterday signed an agreement with Tayeuro, a consortium led by Taylor Woodrow International, the British construction group, for a river diversion project in central Greece that has aroused strong opposition from international environmental groups. The Dr82.7bn (Pounds 268m) agreement, which is subject to approval by the Greek parliament, calls for building a dam and tunnel diverting the Acheloos river from west to east into the Thessaly plain. The diversion, due for completion in six years, would feed two hydro-electric power stations to be constructed in the Pindus mountains in central Greece as well as providing water for irrigation. The environmentalists claim the project will destroy wetlands in western Greece frequented by rare European birds. The government argues that damage will be limited because only 30 per cent of the Acheloos water will be diverted to eastern Greece. Farmers in Thessaly, the country's main grain-producing region, are facing problems because the water table has dropped sharply in the past few years. Nevertheless, government officials said yesterday that plans were being prepared to channel water from other sources to the Acheloos delta in western Greece to conserve the wetlands. The Acheloos project was originally planned on a much larger scale, but was cut back.</p>

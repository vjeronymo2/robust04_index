			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Spain defies downtrend in Europe - But its gains were based on flawed logic European bourses, last month, once again showed little inclination to scale the heights of activity that they reached in the first three months of 1993. After a fall of 25 per cent in April from the March level, aggregate turnover in senior markets declined by a further 2.5 per cent in May. Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest Securities, which produces the figures, notes that the fall in activity came in spite of a 1.2 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries European index in May. Turnover on Seaq International, London's screen-based dealing system for foreign shares, rose by 2 per cent over the month so, says Mr Cornish, London volume as a percentage of domestic market turnover continued to increase. The total conceals big swings in individual markets. In Spain, turnover jumped by 86.5 per cent on the month and there was a switch here in the Seaq International trend as the latter's gain was held to 49.9 per cent. This is significant because Seaq International, trending upwards since 1990, does up to 40 per cent of Spanish equity business; its share last month fell from 38.7 to 33 per cent. The reasons for the excitement, after an averagely poor month in April, were the Spanish general election, expectations of a change in government, and forecasts that the peseta would, first, be devalued - as it was, by 8 per cent, in mid-May - and, secondly, that it would be floated after a win for the Partido Popular. As it happened, the Socialists won and volume has since dropped. Other winners in May included Switzerland, France and the UK. Switzerland's turnover rose by just under a fifth on the month as the market outperformed Europe in the FT-Actuaries World Indices, and reached new highs, helped by the recovery in the pharmaceutical sector after analysts decided that the nervous reaction to President Bill Clinton's health service review in the US might have been overdone. France was up 4.7 per cent after a weak April. Volume has been climbing again in June, as the Paris market has recovered confidence and French interest rates have cut loose, on the downswing, from the Bundesbank's straitjacket. The UK also rose by 4.7 per cent, helped by rights issues, which produce extra trading on the announcement of funding, and afterwards as investors tidy up their holdings. Italy had the fall it might have had a month earlier. Turnover was down 37 per cent on the month and 35 per cent on the previous three-month average, after hitting record highs in March and April. Elsewhere, Belgium dropped 29.6 per cent to the lowest level since last June.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                   Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse               Feb       Mar        Apr         May       US                     1993      1993       1993        1993   Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium            57.35      70.30      58.18      40.98     1.26 France            127.98     159.17     117.45     122.95    22.94 Germany           133.88     168.06     113.50     104.40    65.78 Italy          28,045.20  31,337.60  31,098.40  19,665.60    13.44 Netherlands        16.80      21.80      16.80      15.70     8.82 Spain             664.91     856.96     598.87   1,116.74     8.90 Switzerland        17.60      18.90      14.00      16.70    11.78 UK                 43.58      51.82      38.79      40.62    63.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Capitalism grew in my courtyard: Leyla Boulton reflects on the changes that market reforms have brought to Moscow in four years In the four years since I arrived in Moscow, my courtyard has been transformed by President Boris Yeltsin's market reforms. The children who used to play in it have been replaced by armed men in bullet-proof vests who guard a new commercial bank which rents office-space in our building. The courtyard administrator, who has visibly prospered from the arrangement, tells complaining residents he would be 'killed' if he tried to remove the bank. My husband was threatened with a pump-action shotgun after protesting when a bank security van almost knocked down my mother, who was on a visit. Complaining about the aptly named Moscow Business World Bank is as useless as demanding action from the police against the all-night disco adjoining the courtyard. Nothing happens. A 10-minute walk down the road, at Paveletsky Station, the driver of the manager of a big car-dealing company recently had his head blown off by a car-bomb aimed at his boss. There is no point in complaining, for this free-for-all is capitalism, Russian-style. Like many Muscovites, I have learnt to live with impotent indignation at the power of crooks and corrupt officials, and to consider myself lucky to be healthy and solvent. Less fortunate are the hundreds of thousands of Muscovites likely to lose their savings in dubious financial companies like MMM. Irina Yasina, a friend with her own financial news agency, argues: 'The country has gone mad . . .Everybody now wants to make money, but only Russians could play this sort of Russian roulette.' On the positive side, the queues and shortages at Gastronom number 45, the local food shop which now calls itself Zamoskvarechiye Supermarket, have disappeared since the abolition of price controls in January 1992. Thanks to the liberalisation of imports decreed at the same time, Muscovites today are far better-dressed than in the Soviet era, and despite (justified) grumbling at still very high prices, can find whatever they need in the shops and in the kiosks which have mushroomed in the capital. There is little that is not for sale in Moscow today. 'Afghan war veterans available for all manner of security services,' says the advertisement on the trolleybuses passing my kitchen window. Thrown into a market at the deep end by the young reformers, led by the former deputy prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, Russians are shedding communist-era expectations that the state will 'feed' them from the cradle to the grave. My friend Sasha, an underpaid army officer who moonlights as a security guard, says: 'We can rely only on ourselves.' Deep-rooted prejudices that business is crime and that trade is 'speculation' are proving more persistent - hardly surprising, given that much of Russian business still operates in an unregulated and illegal manner. But gone are the days of total ignorance, symbolised by a middle-aged Russian journalist who, in December 1990, asked the then finance minister Boris Fyodorov how speculation could be avoided on the country's first stock exchange. At a seminar for young financial journalists last winter, the only questions were about how to report financial fraud and companies like MMM. Muscovites like Irina Yasina are setting up businesses, in spite of daunting official red tape and prohibitive taxation. The Moscow Currency Exchange, established in a Stalinist skyscraper which houses official institutions such as the Management of Tall Buildings, is manned by youths with mobile telephones who trade dollars and D-Marks as if they had been doing so all their lives - even though a western-style currency market has existed in Russia for little more than than two years. When I first arrived in Russia in May 1990, the old communist order appeared as solid as the bronze statue of Lenin, which still stands outside my courtyard on October Square. Today the statue is nothing more than a rallying point for nostalgic pro-communist demonstrations by pensioners. Arrogant officials continue to race around Moscow in official limousines without regard for speed limits. But apart from the fact that many now ride in Mercedes rather than ramshackle Volgas, the officials' own significance has radically altered with the demise of the old state-run economy. Many former Communist party officials have gone into business. Nikolai Ryzhkov, Soviet prime minister from 1985-90, is now chairman of a commercial bank called Tveruniversalbank. Nicknamed the 'weeping Bolshevik' for his sometimes emotional behaviour, Mr Ryzhkov accelerated the collapse of the Soviet economy when he and former President Mikhail Gorbachev failed to proceed with the '500-day plan' for radical market reforms in September 1990. Then, officials were all-important, both for the reforms they rejected and, after Mr Yeltsin came to power as master of a newly independent Russia, for what they changed. I particularly remember Grigory Yavlinsky, a young reformer brought into government on the eve of the Soviet Union's collapse in December 1991, complaining about the refusal of 'idiotic' republics to endorse his proposed economic union - a refusal most now bitterly regret. Or Boris Fyodorov, expressing fears of an 'economic coup' by old-style lobbyists who detested his attempts to impose 'ordinary financial discipline' before his second resignation as finance minister in January 1994. With inspired young reformers now firmly out of the way, old-style bureaucrats are defensively reasserting old secretive methods of conducting official business. President Yeltsin himself pointed out that many officials had become as remote as in the old days. This remoteness was underlined by a remark by his own spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, at a Moscow reception. Before Mr Alexander Livshits, the president's economic adviser, could answer a question on why the government had failed to keep a promise to scrap quotas on oil exports on July 1, Mr Kostikov blurted out: 'I think it is better if he doesn't answer that question. We are here to relax.' This long-promised foreign trade reform would have increased tax revenues and removed a big source of corruption. The truth is that, after the young reformers released the genie of market forces, their successors lost their grip on almost everything except export quotas and their own secrets. The supreme power today is money, and those who wield that power are businessmen, mafiosi and the officials who extort bribes in return for not hindering their activity. It is that power, as expressed every day in my courtyard, which is the main guarantee against a return to the past. It is true that Moscow is not Russia. But that does not make thoughts of the future, which will be largely decided in the capital, any less unsettling.

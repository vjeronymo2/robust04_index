			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The Swiss army goes under the knife - Ian Rodger reports on the cuts being made to Switzerland's militia, the role of which has become more social than military On a crisp September morning, the Schwagalp in the middle of the Appenzeller uplands looked like any other Swiss Alp, alight with autumn colours and a dusting of snow on the higher peaks. A keen observer might have noticed the absence of cows and ramblers. Then, suddenly, 50 soldiers pounded over the crest of a hill, dived to the ground and started firing multiple rounds from their automatic rifles into the mountainside 50 yards away. From their left flank, another score rushed in, heaving grenades towards the same spot. Orders were shouted while officers and other observers stood by with flags, calmly scrutinising the pandemonium for several minutes. Then, as suddenly as it began, this 'attack on an enemy command post' ended, the troops retreated for a few yards and then relaxed and sloped off for a snack and a debriefing in the midday sun. On a normal day, the young men who make up the 25th grenadier company of the 25th motorised infantry regiment of the Swiss Army would be working as bankers, doctors, lawyers, students, taxi drivers and many other occupations. But for three weeks every year until they are 32, and less often until they are 50, they are called up for their WK (Wiederholungskurs) refreshment training in Switzerland's 600,000 strong citizen army. During those periods, depending on their function, they patrol borders, manoeuvre tanks, pilot fighters and helicopters (pilots have to do six weeks training a year) and carry out all the other jobs that need doing in a large modern army. The training is always rigorous. Soldiers regularly use live ammunition on exercises like that on the Schwagalp. To an outsider, it all seems a bit silly at first glance. Toys for boys on a heroic scale. The Swiss have not taken up arms against anyone for more than 200 years and the prospect of them doing so in the foreseeable future seems remote. No one has invaded their mountainous country since Napoleon. Gradually, however, it becomes clear to the visiting resident that the Swiss Army's most important role is not military at all but social. Many western countries, including France, Germany and Italy, still oblige most or all able-bodied men to do military service. But Switzerland alone has an army composed almost entirely of militia troops. Men start their military service at age 20 or on completion of their education or apprenticeship with a 17-week basic training course and they are then constantly available for call-up and keep their kit at home until they are dismissed at 50. By then, they have given nearly a full year of their lives to the army. Those who choose to train to be officers must give much more time: a full colonel will have spent five years in uniform. As a militia, the Swiss army permits no class distinctions. Bank executives rub shoulders with dustmen, scientists with waiters. Middle managers more and more find themselves giving orders to their civilian bosses, because the bosses no longer have the time to devote to officer training. The men meet and test each other in severe conditions, bivouacing in a blinding snowstorm on a mountainside, surviving a two-day slog over mountains and through swamps. Strong friendships and enmities are formed and renewed every year. It is at least arguable that one of the reasons that Swiss banks and big Swiss industrial companies have been so successful over the years is the ability of their leaders, thanks in part to army experience and contacts, to avoid egregious mistakes in selecting top managers. Today, the Swiss army is in the midst of its most important shake-up since 1910, adapting at a stroke to the post-cold war world and the increasing sophistication of military equipment. Its complement is being slashed by a third to 400,000; more professionals are being engaged; and ordinary citizens will from next year train less and sign off at 42. While the restructuring has been widely accepted on security grounds, many people fear that the considerable social benefits of the old system will be reduced or lost. Since the 1815 Council of Vienna imposed armed neutrality on Switzerland, the role of the military has been restricted to defence. Its current structure dates from 1961 and was designed to implement the hedgehog or porcupine strategy developed during the second world war. The Swiss realised they could not stop an invasion, but they reasoned that an invader's only purpose would be to gain control of the Alpine passes. So they set out a defence strategy that make this virtually impossible. To this day, railway and road bridges and tunnels are armed with explosives at 2,000 points throughout the country. This strategy survived the second world war, but not the great technological advances in military hardware that came with it. In 1966, the Swiss announced a more ambitious strategy, to defend the country to its borders using the most modern mechanised and mobile equipment. The army now has 1,800 armoured vehicles and more than 300 aircraft as well as some of the latest self-propelled artillery and wire-guided anti-tank weapons. Cavalry battalions were disbanded in 1974, although the army did not give up all the old ways. Its tough bicycle infantry is a modern-day rarity, as are the carrier pigeons, now threatened with demobilisation as an economy measure. Already in the 1980s, the army was being contested on a variety of fronts. Environmental protection groups objected to the disturbances caused by army exercises. Women, hitherto restricted to auxiliary roles, demanded a chance to enlist as regulars. Swiss companies, which previously made it a point of pride to count a few colonels among their top executives, were beginning to regret the long absences of those colonels. And Swiss wives began to complain openly about the long periods they had to look after the children alone, not to mention the huge loads of dirty laundry their husbands sent home from the field (postage free). The public was also becoming more sensitive about the dangers inherent in military training. Newspapers now give full coverage of the inevitable accidents. In 1989, the government was stunned when more than a third of voters accepted the proposal in a pacifists' referendum that the army should be abolished. It rushed out a new security policy for dealing with 'a world in mutation' which, in turn, led to the elaboration by the defence ministry in early 1992 of a complete overhaul of the military establishment. Army 95, as the plan is called, is based on the idea of a more flexible security force, able to help in international peacekeeping activities, to protect the population in the event of natural and military catastrophes and to combat terrorism. It saw the need for fewer soldiers, so the army's manpower could be reduced by a third. On the other hand, the complexity of military equipment meant the new army would need more full-time, professional soldiers. And as Mr Kaspar Villiger, the defence minister, points out, troops going on overseas peacekeeping missions will have to be professionals. 'You cannot motivate a militia army sent to some distant corner to resolve a problem,' he says. Mr Villiger refuses to accept that the militia will become a second-class army, and leaves no doubt that his main concern is the social role the institution plays. 'It contributes to the psychological strength of the country,' he said in a recent interview. Full implementation of Army 95 is two months away, and dozens of battalions and companies are about to be stood down for the last time. I returned to the mock battlefield in the Schwagalp a few weeks after watching the 25th grenadiers. I looked carefully, but could not find a single spent shell or cartridge case or any evidence that anything had happened. The Swiss keep things clean, even in their war games.</p>

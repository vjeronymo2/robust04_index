			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed H. M., N. Mattem, and Farid Kemmar: </F> "Demonstrations Against Terrorism Increase Throughout the  Country; Marches Under Rain and Snow"--first paragraph is ALGER  REPUBLICAIN introduction]    [Text] In such cases, in spite of what some media would  have us believe, stereotyped political language becomes  irrelevant. Similar events keep occurring again and again in  inland towns. The phenomenon is turning into a vast, broad,  irresistible mass movement. Fearful and enraged, our fellow  citizens took to the streets to denounce terrorism and express  their support to the forces engaged in a merciless fight to  contain and eradicate it.    How shall we interpret the demonstrations that took place at  Sidi-Aich, Biskra, Laghouat, Tizi-Ouzou, Bejaia, Tamanrasset,  Babar, and Souk-Ahras? Or those of yesterday at Ouargla, Setif,  Touggourt, and Bordj-Bou-Arreridj? Or those that are announced  for this weekend? Rallies or demonstrations against terrorism  and in support of a government determined to eradicate it and  restore law and order to Algeria, bled white, on its knees, and  undergoing an economic perfusion. The people increasingly  understand what situation the country is in, and they are  getting better at discerning what games are being played.  Somehow drugged, abused, and robbed, the people understand more  clearly the true problems faced by our society. Believing in  integrity, they expected to be helped by angels coming down from  heaven. All they saw was death, grief, destruction, and  abominable exclusions. Actually, they were the terrorized  witnesses of the rise of fascism. This slow and painful  realization actually amounted to the political education of an  entire people. Remember that in 1954 there were only a handful  of men determined to take up arms and liberate the country.    How can we fight against a massively armed army, NATO, air  and naval forces, with mere peashooters, people would ask then.  Yet, against this armada, there was the concept of justice:  Algeria must be freed from the settlers that oppressed it. It  was hard. Very hard. Our revolutionary experience may well have  been unique. This is what we risked losing with the Afghan runts.    What is the ideal of the fundamentalists and their mafia  supporters? Perhaps it was this aspect that determined the  choices of Algeria, the green multinational, and its masters. It  was an entire people, trusting and naive, that was almost led to  the slaughterhouse or in the arena where dwarfs assemble.    It was like a breath of fresh air when we learned,  yesterday,  that thousands of Algerians had marched under the snow at  Bordj-Bou-Arreridj. This courageous march is quite a symbol.  Does it mean that something more profound is on the move?    Patriots, democrats, and republicans will have to pay  attention to these demonstrations.  <H5>  At Bordj-Bou-Arreridj </H5>   Despite the cold and the snow, a march against terrorism and  in support of President Zeroual took place on Wednesday at 1000,  at Bordj-Bou-Arreridj.    Initiated at the governorate's second conference of the UNJA  [National Union of Algerian Youth] High-School section, held on  Monday, 7 February, at the Belgharbi junior high school, this  demonstration was organized by Bordj civil society. They thus  expressed their support for law and order and for the country's  new government.    What is remarkable, too, was their boldness in displaying  banners bearing the slogans: "No to terrorism!" In Bordj, that  is something new.    Thousands of demonstrators met near the stadium and marched  all the way to the town hall. From the balcony of the building,  overlooking Place de la Liberte, a youth read a motion  denouncing the terrorists' barbarity and supporting the new  president.    The bad weather that prevailed in the last two days did not  discourage the citizens. They came in great numbers to take part  in the march that took place under the snow. Young people  expressed their joy by throwing snowballs.    According to demonstrators belonging to mass organizations  (the UNJA and UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] in  particular), local FLN National Liberation Front]  representatives, including one member of the Central Committee,  did not hesitate to put pressure on their militants to prevent  them from taking part in the march. These FLN officials intended  to continue boycotting what the country started after the  National Conference of 25 January.    This demonstration of the Bordj-Bou-Arreridj civil society  can be improved upon. But it remains independent from  politicians' calculations.  <H5>  In Setif </H5>   On Wednesday morning, in spite of the bitter cold and  driving  rain mixed with snow, hundreds of Setif governorate citizens  made it a point to express their support to the chief of State,  Mr. Liamine Zeroual, by organizing a march through the streets  and main avenues of the governorate seat.    Thus, participants from all walks of life, representing  civil  society, took part in the march, carrying banners and calling to  the fight against terrorism and for a total break with the  former regime.    We should mention that the march ended with a motion of  support for the chief of State, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, which was  read to the audience and in which citizens repeated their  demands for the institution of a modern state and a return to  the moral and cultural values of the Algerian people.  <H5>  In Touggourt </H5>   Last Tuesday, over 3,000 citizens of Touggourt--a town  located 160 km from the governorate center--organized a march in  support of President Liamine Zeroual's recent speech to the  nation.    During the march, which was organized by local social and  cultural associations, the demonstrators displayed banners in  which they called for the preservation of national unity and  recourse to dialogue, while denouncing the use of violence to  solve political problems.    After the march, which ended at the district seat, the  organizers read a motion of support to President Liamine  Zeroual, whom they called a man of integrity and a patriot. They  also denounced foreign interference in Algeria's internal  affairs.    The participants also expressed their profound attachment to  national values and their conviction that pursuing the dialogue  is the only sure way to achieve stability and find a global  solution to the present crisis.  <H5>  At Ouargla </H5>   At Ouargla, yesterday, several hundreds of people took part  in a march to support President Liamine Zeroual and his recent  speech to the nation.    Organized by local popular associations and organizations,  the march brought together citizens of both sexes and all ages,  carrying banners and shouting slogans to express their support  to the president, denouncing violence, calling for an end to the  bloodshed in Algeria, and appealing to society to unite and  build a strong and prosperous Algerian nation.    The demonstrators started from Place Sedrata and headed for  the governorate seat, where a motion was read in which they  expressed their support to Mr. Liamine Zeroual, and emphasized  the need for a serious debate to overcome the crisis, and their  commitment to help bring Algerians together and put an end to  violence and bloodshed.  <H5>  At Annaba </H5>   Union leaders of the Annaba governorate held a general  meeting this Wednesday at the town's union college, and  expressed their "support to Mr. Liamine Zeroual's appointment as  chief of State which they believe represents a guarantee of  reinforced national unity and the materialization of the  strength of political authority."    In addition to supporting any political measure aiming to  ensure stability in the country, end criminal attacks, establish  law and order, and stimulate the national economy, union leaders  promised "to oppose any attempt against national unity, the  nation's values, and the principles of the glorious November  revolution."    "The defense of the basic interests of the working class and  the preservation of its dignity, under the law, with no  demagoguery or maneuvers to involve it in political  confrontations, remain, according to union leaders, immutable  principles dictated by their commitment to putting the nation's  highest interest ahead of any other consideration, in the name  of a united Algeria and the principles of the November  revolution."  <H5>  Students' March in Tizi-Ouzou; No to the `Zaouia' University </H5>   Yesterday, in Tizi-Ouzou, thousands of university and  high-school students answered the call to march issued by the  local students' committee.    A march had already been scheduled for last Sunday, but it  was not authorized and did not take place.    At the opening of the national conference on universities,  the local students' committee organized a march to protest  against exclusion and the policy aiming to sell off the  university.    The march started around 1030 at the Hasnaoua campus. As  soon  as the participants had gathered, squares were formed, with  banners reading: "Repeal first; national conference later," "No  to university selloff," etc. The demonstrators also shouted  slogans such as "Djeba bara," "Outdated system," "Enough is  enough; the university has its honor." All the way, from the  Hasnaoua campus to the hospital, the cultural center, and the  governorate seat, university and high-school students shouted  their rejection of ministerial circulars and their hope in a  modern university. The students themselves were in charge of  controlling the crowd, and they did so impeccably.    During the demonstration, a spokesman for the students'  committee told us: "We are always mobilized; we are determined  to struggle to the end, for the pure and simple repeal of the  circular." Concerning the opening of the national conference, he  said: "Our efforts came after a vague protest movement. We set a  condition for our participation; the circular must be repealed  (...).    Circular 22/23 of 1993 deals with students' orientation and  evaluation, disqualifying marks, and the exam system.    During the entire march, students denounced the system that  is turning the university into a "zaouia."    On reaching the end point, one committee member stated: "The  committee thanks the 15 high-school students who contributed  their support to the march, as well as the citizens who answered  the call. We shall continue our struggle for a new university  project in Tizi-Ouzou."    A biology student told us: "The future of the University is  at stake; it is the entire school system that must be  redesigned." Right after the march, the crowd scattered  peacefully, with hope in their hearts.    According to the organizers, "the march was a success; we  will remain mobilized until our demands are met and until we  have a new University project." Note that, as the march went by,  the town's merchants pulled down their shutters until the  demonstration was over.</p>

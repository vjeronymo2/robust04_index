			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Growth, gold and the G7 FOR THE best part of a decade, economic co-operation in the Group of Seven industrialised countries has been a euphemism for protracted haggling over the structure of exchange rates, with the US occupying the role of arm-twister-in-chief. In this respect Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, has shown himself to be a worthy successor to the great architect of dollar decline in the 1980s, Mr James Baker. Japan bashing has been his forte. But since this week's meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, all is harmony on the currency front. In a sudden access of diplomacy, Mr Bentsen has condemned attempts to manipulate exchange rates. The G7 communique, meanwhile, stresses the role of structural reforms in promoting domestic adjustment and reducing the exchange rate changes that are required to restore external balance. The question is how long this outbreak of peace will last. While there may have been good reasons for talking up the yen, the need to curb Japan's trade surplus, which now stands at 3.3 per cent of GNP, was not one of the better ones. Since a high proportion of Japanese imports are dollar-denominated commodities, the initial impact is to make the deficit widen. To make matters worse, Japanese exports are notoriously insensitive to price changes. Recent history suggests that the response of the Japanese tradeable goods sector to a currency-driven squeeze is anyway to restructure and become yet more competitive. Deceleration Nor is the latest bout of yen appreciation persuading the over-indebted Japanese consumer to come out of the shell. After the excesses of the bubble years, households are choc-a-bloc with consumer durables; and wage settlements are at their lowest level since the last yen surge induced the recession of 1987. The only good news on the US-Japan trade imbalance is that the US economy is growing more slowly than in any normal recovery - and that is bad news in most other respects. The deceleration in US growth to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of the year was partly due to a sharp contraction in exports, from an annualised rate of growth of 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter to shrinkage of 7.1 per cent. So much for the impact of currency manipulation on the US trade performance, though too much should not be read into a single quarter. But nor does the decline in yesterday's figures for US factory orders in March suggest any immediate change in the picture. As the G7 communique rightly puts it, the restoration of sustained non-inflationary growth is critical to our efforts to deal with domestic and international challenges. But precious little growth is in evidence at the moment. Outside the US, the Japanese are dependent on government spending to promote recovery, which takes time. The German economy is contracting, and gradual cuts in interest rates by the Bundesbank point to a very slow move out of recession for the rest of continental Europe. Even in Britain, where the substantial relaxation of monetary policy since last September finally appears to be working some magic on domestic confidence, it is too soon to predict the strength of recovery. Unsynchronised It is paradoxical, then, that commodity prices have turned up this year and that some high-profile investors have been telling impressionable journalists about their enthusiasm for that great anti-inflationary hedge, gold. The striking feature of the commodity upturn is the low base from which it starts. Nor is a modest upturn necessarily a bad signal. In those economies which are over-burdened with debt, it is desirable that investment should play a greater part in recovery than consumption; and an investment-led cycle, marked by large infrastructure spending, especially in Asia, would naturally tend to be more commodity intensive than one in which growth is related to consumption and the service industries. In the present economic cycle growth is wholly unsynchronised across the world, so there is little risk of a commodity-based global inflation of the kind that marked the mid-1970s. If there is an inflationary risk, it is in the latter part of the decade and it relates to the difficulty G7 governments have in restraining structural budget deficits. If, for example, the Clinton administration's plans for healthcare impose excessive burdens on an already weak budgetary position, there could be trouble. The pressure of an ageing population in Japan and in continental Europe could similarly undermine fiscal policy, in the absence of pre-emptive effort to improve the financing of pensions and healthcare. But the bond markets are highly sensitive, after the losses incurred by investors the 1970s, to such threats. If governments do look like losing their grip on fiscal policy bond prices will collapse and interest rates will rise well in advance. It may still be possible for governments to inflate their way out of their debts, but the electoral consequences will be swifter this time round.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [PASASON Editorial: "We, Lao People, Wholeheartedly Hail </F> and Welcome the High-Level Delegation of the House of  Representatives of Malaysia" -- date not given]    [Text] At the invitation of His Excellency [H.E.] Saman  Vi-gnaket, chairman of the National Assembly [NA] of the Lao  People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Mohamed Zahir  Ismail, speaker of the House of Representatives of Malaysia  [HRM], and a high-level HRM delegation will pay an official  friendship to the LPDR from 27 to 30 March.    The multiethnic Lao people nationwide, especially residents  of Vientiane and members of the LPDR NA, are very pleased and  extremely exuberant to have the honor to welcome H.E. the  speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM.    The visit to the LPDR by H.E. the speaker and the high-level  delegation of the HRM takes place after several delegations of  the LPDR and Malaysia at various levels have exchanged visits  with one another, especially delegations concerned with the  economic and cooperation sectors of the two countries.  Therefore, it can be said that the visit to the LPDR by H.E.  and speaker and the high-level delegation of the HRM tomorrow is  very significant and will contribute to strengthening the  long-standing relations of friendship and cooperation of good  neighborliness between the two countries and peoples of Laos and  Malaysia, especially to developing and increasing the relations  and cooperation between the legislative organizations of the two  countries.    The relations of friendship and cooperation as good  neighbors  between the two countries and peoples have existed since ancient  times. The Lao people always follow with profound interest the  development of Malaysia. Lao and Malaysian peoples share  similar traditions, customs, and characteristics. We cherish  peace, self-mastership, national sovereignty, progress, and  social justice. We detest aggression, interference, and  exploitation of other countries. Nonetheless, our two countries  were once victims of foreign aggression and occupation.  Therefore, both Lao and Malaysian peoples encountered the same  fate in the past.    Through the arduous and prolonged struggles for national  liberation and independence, the Lao and Malaysian people deeply  appreciate the value of peace, freedom, and national  independence. We also realize the utmost importance of the  genuine friendship and cooperation for mutual benefits in the  relations of our two countries and legislative institutions.    With regard to the issue of promoting peace, friendship, and  cooperation among the countries in Southeast Asia, we are of the  view that Malaysia has played an important role in this  initiative and has actively carried out activities regarding  this issue, notably in initiating a plan to turn Southeast Asia  into a region of neutrality, creating the economic grouping of  the eastern Asian countries, and implementing the Vision-2020  policy outlined by H.E. Prime Minister Datuk Mahathir bin  Mohamed.    The success expected from the official friendship visit to  the LPDR by H.E. Datuk Mohamed Zahir Ismail, speaker of the  House of Representatives of Malaysia, and his delegation will  open a new era for the legislative institutions of the two  countries to normalize and broaden mutual relations and  cooperation and to more frequently exchange visits by  delegations at various levels. The delegations can draw  experience and lessons from one another aside from the current  development of cooperation in various fields between the  governments of the two countries.    We hope that the friendship visit to the LPDR by H.E. the  speaker of the HRM and its high-level delegation will be a  brilliant success.</p>

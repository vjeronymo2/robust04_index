Ramos's official friendship visit to Vietnam expected here today  is a significant event in the friendly and cooperative relations  between the two countries, says NHAN DAN in an editorial today.    The editorial continues: Vietnam and the Philippines have  had  time-honoured culture and trade exchanges. Over the past recent  years, there have been positive changes in the cooperative  relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet's official visit to the Philippines in 1992 is a great  landmark in the promotion of mutual understanding and trust,  creating and impetus to their economic-trade cooperation. The  two-way trade value increased to nearly USD [U.S. dollars] 50  million in 1993 from USD 12 million in 1988. The Philippines  has 11 investment projects in Vietnam with a total capital of  USD 60 million, ranking 18th among foreign countries investing  in Vietnam. 'As neighbour, Vietnam and the Philippines have a  common aspiration for each country's socio-economic progress,  for peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the  region. The Philippines and Vietnam have had a common voice in  seeking peaceful solutions, conforming to their interests as  well as international laws and pratices, to solve problems left  behind by the history and foster the friendly and cooperative  relations between the two countries'.    The paper wishes President Ramos's visit a success, thus  contributing to further promoting the Vietnam-Philippines  relations for happiness and prosperity of the two nations, and  for peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region  and all over the world.</p>

The concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired gas in closed-circuit apparatus will be measured at the mouth while the parts of the apparatus contributing to dead-air space are mounted on a dummy head and operated by the breathing machine as in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) During the testing required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired gas at the mouth will be continuously recorded, and the maximum average concentration during the inhalation portion of the breathing cycle shall not exceed the following limits:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,20 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Where the service time is <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Maximum allowable average concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired air percent by volume <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Not more than 30 minutes <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 hour <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 hours <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 hours <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 hours <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) In addition to the test requirements for closed-circuit apparatus set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, gas samples will be taken during the course of the man tests described in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this subpart. These gas samples will be taken from the closed-circuit apparatus at a point downstream of the carbon dioxide sorbent, and they shall not contain more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide at any time, except on apparatus for escape only, using a mouthpiece only, the sample shall not contain more than 1.5 percent carbon dioxide at any time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.98  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Tests during low temperature operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The applicant shall specify the minimum temperature for safe operation and two persons will perform the tests described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, wearing the apparatus according to applicant's directions.

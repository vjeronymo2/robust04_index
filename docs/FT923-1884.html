			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / People: Midland's Goldthorpe retires Midland Bank executives hoping that the integration of their bank with its new parent will proceed painlessly must be dismayed to learn of the sudden resignation of Brian Goldthorpe, 59, deputy chief executive and a director of both Midland Bank and Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation. Goldthorpe's retirement after 43 years with Midland (he started at the bank's Barnsley branch when he left school at 16) was made solely on health grounds after advice from his doctors. His abrupt departure robs the group of the most senior survivor from the old days in Midland who has also worked closely with HSBC since the two banks struck up their alliance in 1986 and who was expected to play a key part in their integration. Goldthorpe joined the HSBC board last May when Sir Kit McMahon resigned. His departure also creates gaps in other parts of the Midland Group; he was chairman of Forward Trust Group, the group finance house, and the Midland Bank Pension Trust.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henry Vargas and Irma Franco] </F>   [Text] Ocotal, Nueva Segovia -- In an attempt at rebellion,  150 former members of the 3-80 Northern Front blocked the  entrances to the city of Quilali for one hour. They said it was  a peaceful seizure to protest the government's noncompliance  with an agreement to distribute land before the beginning of the  current agricultural season. The seizure occurred at 1100 on 20  April, and they decided to withdraw from the city when they  found no support from the local population.    The former fighters said their main demand is the  distribution of land, as stipulated in the demobilization  agreement recently signed by the government of Violeta Barrios  de Chamorro and El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera], their leader.  During the brief seizure of the city, they also demanded bank  financing for the planting of basic grains, as the government  had promised.    According to a military report, this seizure had no  significance because it did not have the people's support. The  townspeople say they have faith in the agreements signed with  the government, indicating that peace and harmony with the  former fighters and good harvests in the coming agricultural  season depend on the fulfillment of the agreements.  <H5>  "Esteban" Explains Situation </H5>   Salvador Talavera, alias "Esteban," confirmed that a group  of  sympathizers and members of the 3-80 Northern Front, who had  demobilized in 1990, gathered at midday yesterday near Quilali's  park to demand that the government fulfill the agreements signed  four years ago. "Esteban" added that this group of demobilized  individuals wanted to take advantage of the dialogue that is  currently taking place between the government and the 3-80  Northern Front General Command to publicize their demands.  However, at their first attempt at gathering, the police and  former 3-80 Northern Front Commanders "Pajarillo" [not further  identified] and "Cascabel" [Jose Santos Sanchez] arrived. The  two former commanders are currently in charge of the  demobilization in Quilali.    "Esteban" reiterated that the group gathered spontaneously  and on their own, without any authorization. He said that the  CIAV [International Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS  was the first organization to learn about the action and that it  immediately reported it to the Government Ministry.    Salvador Talavera, El Chacal's brother, said "the alleged  seizure only exists in the complete disinformation irresponsibly  released by certain media."</p>

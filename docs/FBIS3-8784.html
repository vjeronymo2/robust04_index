			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veronika Seyr from Skopje] </F>   [Text] The disputed Alexander flag defies the stiff Balkan  winds -- Krivulak, the largest firing range of the former  Yugoslav People's Army [JNA], is now deserted and waiting for  new occupants. Krivulak is located in the strategically most  important location in the Balkans, at the bottleneck of the  Vardar Valley. With 10,000 recruits, without any heavy weapons,  and without a defense budget, the young state of Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] can put the  valley to less use than the farmers who live in the vicinity.  During maneuvers up to 5,000 JNA soldiers used to camp here.    [Begin recording of Major Stanko Sokolovski of the FYROM  Army] Here in Krivulak the Yugoslav -- excuse me, Macedonian --  infantry gets its final polish. [end recording]    The major still has problems with the new conditions.    [Begin Sokolovski recording] About a month ago a unit of the  U.S. UN battalion held firing exercises here. [end recording]    This might become a permanent state of affairs, because  there  are constant media reports that Krivulak might become the base  for 3,000 to 5,000 Americans. For the time being the U.S.  UNPROFOR contingent will be increased by 400 to 700 men. The  United States seems to want to make Macedonia a calm pole of the  Balkans with its presence.    After Albania, should Macedonia, which is located at the  crossroads of interests in this region, also be firmly taken  into U.S. hands?    The defense minister in Skopje naturally denies this.    [Begin recording Defense Minister Vlado Popovski] This idea  of stationing 4,000, 5,000, or 7,000 Americans in Krivulak  exists only in the press. It was launched by the Greeks.  Serbian newspapers took it over, then it was taken over by  Bulgarian papers, or the other way round. However, it is clear:  Macedonia is located in an unstable region. The war in Bosnia  is not over, and there is the risk that it might spread.  Kosovo, too, worries us very much. We are threatened by all  military activities. [end recording]    The Swedish UN soldiers have the longest experience with  this  kind of coexistence. They have been sharing a barracks in  Kumanovo with the Macedonian Army for two years now.</p>

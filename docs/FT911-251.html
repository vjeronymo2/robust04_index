			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Tory peers concerned over ECGD sale: Protests on level of export insurance support may force government concessions SENIOR TORY peers, including a former trade minister, are seriously concerned about the level of government support for insuring exports, as ministers press ahead with the privatisation of part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Protests over aid for insurance on exports to politically sensitive countries in particular could force the government to make concessions in the House of Lords through fear of provoking a large-scale revolt. The bill paving the way for privatising the short-term credit insurance operations of the ECGD is expected to reach the Lords next month. Conservative peers publicly voicing anxiety include Lord Trefgarne, a former trade minister, and Lord Weir, a former president of the Federation of British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers' Associations. Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, is believed to share their anxiety. Others include Lord Tombs, chairman of Rolls-Royce, who sits as an independent crossbencher. At the DTI, Lord Trefgarne was responsible for much of the early preparation for the sale - including negotiations with the Treasury. The disquiet reflects the widespread concern among British industrialists about the level of state aid for exporters compared with overseas rivals, and adds to the difficulties the government faces on the ECGD sale. Only three companies have responded to the government's invitation to tender for ECGD's short-term insurance business. One tender, from Trade Indemnity, was an offer to collaborate with no money on the table. In the Commons, Tory rebels succeeded at the bill's committee stage in inserting a new clause committing the government to continue insuring UK sales to politically risky developing countries for three years after privatisation. The clause was overturned by the government, but is expected to be reintroduced in the Lords. Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, sought to appease MPs and exporters with an assurance that the need for a 'national interest facility' for political risk reinsurance would be kept under review. The government's intention was that the facility would continue as long as it was considered 'essential to meet the reasonable needs of exporters', Mr Sainsbury said. However, Lord Trefgarne said: 'The assurances Mr Sainsbury gave, while helpful, really didn't go far enough.' He also complained about recent rises, in the face of substantial debts incurred, in the ECGD's premiums for exports to more difficult markets. 'Ministers should follow the policy that I think previous ministers have followed which is that British exporters should not be placed at any disadvantage with their competitors . . . The truth of the matter is that most of our competitors have lost even more and are prepared to go on doing so,' said Lord Trefgarne. Lord Weir said the government had to give 'strong, clear' assurances about its support for export insurance in the event of the privatisation failing to have the effect ministers predicted. 'Behind this, one really sees the hands of the Treasury,' he said. Lord Tombs said the DTI's stand on political risk insurance was 'indicative' of its lack of commitment to supporting exporters. Manufacturers only wanted the level of government support brought up to the same level as foreign competitors. 'I think privatisation of the insurances is unlikely to improve the position in the short term because of the government's refusal to take on what can only be a government responsibility,' he said.</p>

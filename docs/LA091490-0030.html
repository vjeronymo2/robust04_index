			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS / OPEN FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> COMEDY OF FEMALE CO-DEPENDENCY  </P> <P> Sometimes the idea behind a play is too well shaped for the drama to be quite  real. It's an alluring flaw -- like having physical features that are too even  for your own good.  </P> <P> Take "Sally and Marsha." Co-dependency doesn't usually free people from their  problems but in this two-woman comedy mutual dependence is a balm.  </P> <P> "Co-dependency: Can it be all bad?" asked psychologist Marilyn Ruman at a  post-show discussion at Theatre West. Women love this play and with reason.  Sybille Pearson is writing about female friendship, and she has a knack for  capturing how women talk about husbands and sex and other things.  </P> <P> The actresses, under Helen Murray's direction, are so flavorful they almost  obscure the sense of calculation: the scorching one liners, the curious absence  of husbands and children (over two acts and seven months!) and the predictable  sparring.  </P> <P> Ursula Martin's tall and loopy Sally, a chirping homemaker into self-denial,  and Joanna Lipari's squat and literary Marsha, a neurotic Jew, are touching and  funny. One hellish fight in the jumbled Gotham apartment is electric. But  there's something by-the-numbers in this theatrical tennis match.  </P> <P> At 3333 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 and 8  p.m., in repertory with "Benchwarmers," through Oct. 7. $12.50. (213) 851-7977.  RAY LOYND  </P></p>

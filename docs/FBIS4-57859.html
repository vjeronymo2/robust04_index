			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janio de Freitas] </F>   [Text] The first technical test has not confirmed the  authenticity of the typewritten sheets of paper that Rio de  Janeiro Prosecutor General Antonio Carlos Biscaia presented as  the numbers game kingpins' accounting sheets.    The test conducted by the Del Picchia Institute of Sao Paulo  indicated that the sheets had not been prepared one month after  the other, as monthly accounting sheets would have been expected  to be. The test indicated that they had been prepared recently.    Biscaia did not allow an official test to be conducted. He  used the documents as evidence in charges that involved bribery  with money resulting from the illegal game, drug trafficking,  and arms smuggling. Appellate Court Judge Gama Malcher ordered  that the documents be tested again.</p>

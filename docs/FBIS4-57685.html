			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Federation of Central  American Industrial Chambers and Associations (Fecaica) have  said the signing of bilateral treaties between Central American  countries and Mexico is jeopardizing fragile regional  integration.    Juan Jose Gutierrez, Guatemalan Chamber of Industry  president  and Fecaica Guatemalan representative, said: "Aside from the  treaty signed between Mexico and Costa Rica, we believe that as  the Central American countries negotiate bilateral treaties with  Mexico, they are jeopardizing the integration process, which is  still fragile."    Carlos Enrique Rivera, Fecaica executive director; Luis  Mejia, Salvadoran Industrialists Association president; and  Gutierrez himself reported that one of the most important  resolutions of the bimonthly Fecaica meeting was the need to  negotiate any commercial treaty as a bloc.    We believe the efforts and work of so many years would be  lost, and Central America would not be able to subsist without  integration," added Gutierrez, also president of the Pollo  Campero restaurant chain.    Fecaica representatives urged their Nicaraguan counterparts  to "accompany Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in  negotiating with Mexico, which, in their opinion, will benefit  Nicaragua. In addition, they said Nicaragua can negotiate  preferential aspects that Mexico has offered .  <H5>  Fecampco Agrees </H5>   Rivera added that the Federation of Central American  Chambers  of Commerce (Fecampo) and the Federation of Export Chambers  (Fecaexca) agreed to support Fecaica's joint declaration in the  sense that negotiations with third countries will be carried out  jointly, not on a bilateral basis.    Fecaica representatives met on 20 May with Salvadoran  Economy  Minister Enrique Cordova, who informed the Central American  industrialists of the progress made in negotiations with Mexico.    Another Fecaica resolution deals with the deadline the  governments have established for signing the treaty, which is  supposedly set for December of this year. In that sense, Leonel  Mejia, president of ASI [Salvadoran Industrialists Association],  said "signing a treaty quickly does not make it good."    Upon returning from a meeting with Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari, Salvadoran President-elect Armando Calderon  Sol recently announced his intention to sign a treaty with  Mexico before the end of this year, if possible.</p>

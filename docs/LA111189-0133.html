			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> PARK IS NAMED FOR LATE JEAN WOODARD  </P> <P> A Name the Park contest conducted by the Department of Parks and Recreation  resulted in the naming of a lot on Granby Street north of Avenue Adobe in honor  of Jean Woodard, who was active in community affairs.  </P> <P> The City Council unanimously approved the name Jean Woodard Park after several  of Woodard's friends appeared on her behalf at the council meeting earlier this  week.  </P> <P> Woodard, who died of lung cancer in 1984, was one of the founders of the Yorba  Linda YMCA and a member of the Yorba Linda Service League, as well as serving  twice as chairwoman of the city's Fiesta Days Parade.  </P> <P> Robert Woodard entered his mother's name in the contest, which invited any  interested individuals to suggest names for six new and proposed parks.  </P> <P> "She did a lot and never was one to brag about all she was doing," he said. "I  think it would be appropriate to name an area whose purpose is relaxation, fun  and happiness after someone who gave so much time and energy to see that others  were having fun and being happy."  </P> <P> The council has not yet adopted names for the remaining five parks.  </P></p>

But Ken Reiser, one of the leaders of the proponent People for  Progress, said he was elated at the jobs the facility could bring to the area.  At the office of US Ecology, the project developer, manager Bob Wittry handed  out job applications even though the company won't even submit its license  application to the state until July.  </P></p>

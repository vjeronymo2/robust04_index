			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Observer: Don't call us Given all the hype about the wonders of global communications, making an international telephone call ought to be getting easier. Yet a growing number of organisations in the US seem intent on taking a giant step backwards by installing electronic switchboards which tell callers to punch in the name of the person they wish to speak to 'using the letters on your telephone'. The result is to render incommunicado callers from Britain and many other parts of Europe, where letters disappeared from telephone dials years ago. Odder still, the European Commission's Washington office has taken to using one of the machines. Has it gone native? Or does nobody from Europe ever try to call?</p>

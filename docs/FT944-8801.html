			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / PIA to go ahead on advice guidelines Financial regulators are pressing ahead with plans to inform customers of whether any financial advice they receive is independent, in spite of resistance from banks and building societies. From next May, financial organisations will have to make clear to consumers whether they provide independent advice or advice only on a particular company's products. The Personal Investment Authority, the retail investors' watchdog, yesterday outlined rules saying that the type of advice given by each of its members should be disclosed by signs in branches and in marketing material. The PIA also says the disclosure requirements should apply to broadcast as well as printed advertisements for mortgages, unless the material refers only to repayment mortgages. Most banks and large building societies have their own life insurance subsidiaries or are linked with a single life insurer, and so do not provide advice about products from a range of companies. Of the large high street financial institutions, only Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society offer solely independent advice.</p>

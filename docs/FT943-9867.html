			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Most wage deals 'at least 2.5%' More than four in five recent pay deals have produced rises of 2.5 per cent or more, says the latest study of wage trends published today by Incomes Data Services, the independent information and research organisation. Half of about 100 most recently monitored settlements provided for wage increases of between 2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, and a third from 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. The IDS report found 'only a handful' of deals provided for increases of 4 per cent or more. The economic recovery has started to raise the level of earnings, mainly through increased overtime. The average annual rise in earnings in the year to May was 4.3 per cent, with an underlying 3.75 per cent rate of growth. The largest growth in earnings in the year to May was in the motor vehicles and components production industry, where there was an increase of 6.8 per cent. There was a 5.5 per cent rise in mechanical engineering. Banking and finance has seen the highest earnings increase in the service sector with 4.4 per cent. Distribution and retail have had pay rises of up to 4.2 per cent. In a commentary on overall pay figures the report says that as the economy has moved out of recession 'the inflation rate has become much more of a floor for pay settlements than it was previously'. The report adds: 'Actual wage increases for many individual employees are much higher than between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, through incremental movement or merit pay on top of general awards.' It says the Bank of England is a good example of such deals. Staff there received general pay increases of 2.5 per cent from July 1 with an additional 4.5 per cent on the wage bill to fund performance-related rises and promotional increases. The average salary has been increased by 7 per cent in this way. Report Number 670. Incomes Data Services, 193 St John Street, London ECI 4LS.</p>

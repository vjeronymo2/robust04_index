			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tikhiy under the rubric "Eurasia": "The </F> President Looks Lonely"]    [Text] For several days now a couple dozen pensioners have  been spending the night in the tent city thrown up in front of  the building of the Supreme Council of the Crimea, where the  administration of the peninsula's first president is now housed.  It was with them that Yuriy Meshkov began his ascent to power  three years ago. On the wall of the largest tent is a pencil  portrait of Meshkov of an extremely impressive size with the  inscription "Long live the president!" The rest of the  decoration of the compound shows its inhabitants' lack of  acceptance of Ukraine in all of its manifestations--from the  Ukrainian language to Ukrainian salt pork. Anatoliy Los, the  leader of the picketers, speaks at the small rally several times  a day. In his words, the old men and women (with the latter  clearly in the majority) have gathered here in order to protect  their president from the intrigues of Ukrainian nationalists.    Incidentally, a situation is developing in the Crimea in  which, most likely, Meshkov will have to be protected not from  the persistent fighters for the Ukrainian idea, who are nowhere  to be found here, and not from the opposition, who suffered a  crushing defeat in the elections to the Supreme Council of the  Crimea, but from his own advisers. It is true that the Russia  bloc won an absolute majority--54 of the 90 positions that are  occupied as of today (four mandates have not been won by anyone  yet). But the unanimity with which representatives of sometimes  diametrically opposed political forces speak both about Meshkov  himself and about the qualitative composition of the parliament  shows that if the president of the Crimea is fostering hopes  that the Supreme Council will automatically rubber stamp any of  his decisions, they are in vain.    This can be seen both from the deputy chairman of the  Council  of the Crimean Tatar people, Rifat Chubarov, and from Meshkov's  former rival for the presidential elections, Sergey Shuvaynikov  (Russian Party). Another former claimant to the high state post  in the Crimea, the chairman of the Communist Party of Crimea,  Leonid Grach, told a MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent: "I do  not rule out the possibility that this Supreme Council of the  Crimea in general will be unable to begin to function and  realize itself as a parliament. And this could raise the  question of repeat elections in the near future. The Russia bloc  even today is coming apart at the seams. But if the deputies  from it continue to refuse to take Ukraine into account, we will  not give our consent. The Tatars, who have 14 mandates in the  Supreme Council, will not go along with this either."    Moreover, Grach states that he is ready to consider the  proposals (and Grach is convinced that there will be some) to  nominate him as a candidate for the post of chairman of the  Crimean parliament. True, the Russia bloc is considering other  candidates, but Leonid Grach would suit many. If this election  occurs, the confrontation within the "Russian type" along the  lines of parliament-president in the Crimea will be more than  likely.    Many of the president's advisers in the Russia bloc have a  personal score to settle with him as well: He very blatantly  failed to take their wishes and hopes into account when dividing  up the portfolios. Moreover, having abolished the Council of  Ministers of the Crimea, except for appointing Yevgeniy Saburov  as deputy prime minister, the president has practically not  distinguished himself in the field of state construction.    Workers of the Crimean SBU (Security Service of Ukraine)  administration, in which Meshkov tried to change the leadership  with his edict, adopted an appeal to the president requesting  that he not involve them in political conflicts. In so doing  they revealed an open secret: where the previously unknown  people on Meshkov's team had come from. In their message the  Chekists express their surprise that their former colleagues who  are now in the president's circle do not understand such simple  things. According to numerous pieces of evidence, Meshkov's team  includes people who are directly linked to criminal structures  who have served their term for various reasons. In any case it  became unofficially known that Meshkov had prepared an edict  which envisions a radical purge of the ranks of presidential  advisers.    During the two months of his presidency Yuriy Meshkov has  used up his extremely small reserve of strength in relations  with Kiev. His statement to the effect that the present  Ukrainian government is "the greatest threat to peace in Europe"  practically rules out the possibility of businesslike contacts  with this government. Yet Meshkov had every reason to count on  the idea that with an indisputable victory of the left wing  (inclined toward alliance with Russia) in the elections to the  Supreme Council of Ukraine he would have a real chance of  working with different leaders in Kiev. But here again he could  not refrain from inciting passions by calling for a boycott of  these elections. Even Crimean politicians who are far from  sympathizing with the current Ukraine note that the fight  against Ukrainian nationalism in the Crimea is beginning to grow  into Russian chauvinism.    But one can see how the tension is growing from the example  of the war of edicts between Kiev and Simferopol which broke out  in the middle of March. First Meshkov, violating not only  Ukrainian but also Crimean legislation, fired the chairman of  the telephone and radio company of Crimea, Valeriy Astakhov. The  president of Ukraine overrode this edict. Then followed the  aforementioned firing of the chief of the SBU with an attempt to  appoint "his own person" to the special unit.    At the same time the stirring up of passions causes harm to  the sphere which could help the economy of the Crimea very much  this year: It is difficult to imagine how many lovers of the  Crimean sun and sea have rejected the president's invitation to  come to the blessed peninsula this summer. It is impossible to  understand what future awaits the three edicts Meshkov signed at  the suggestion of Deputy Prime Minister Saburov: "On Currency  Regulation and Currency Control," "On Taxation," and "On Banks  and Banking Activity on the Territory of the Republic of  Crimea." The purpose of these edicts was to step up the  circulation of funds and encourage investment of money in the  economy of the Crimea. But who will invest money in a territory  where "it smells like thunder in the air"?    A special podium with a separate dais has already been  constructed in the meeting hall of the Supreme Council of the  Crimea for Yuriy Meshkov, who is keenly attentive to the  presence and observance of a presidential environment and  vocabulary. Eyewitnesses who have seen him sitting at his  assigned place during the last session of the Supreme Council of  the old convocation note that he looked very lonely there....</p>

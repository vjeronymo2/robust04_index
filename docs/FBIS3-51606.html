			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoya, special correspondent in the </F> Chiapas region, from the "Vector 21" newscast]    [Text] The Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] issued  communiques early this morning to announce its conditions for  negotiations.    The first communique addresses who must ask for pardons and  who can grant them. That is the title of the communique, which  ponders why amnesty makes sense in some aspects but not in  others and who should do the pardoning, wondering if it should  be the peasants and Indians who for years have been humiliated  and exploited.    The EZLN communique also questions wealth in Chiapas; that  is, why there are big landowners -- people who have always had  everything, like better food and medical services -- while there  are Indian communities where smallpox or any other disease means  death. The communique notes that many people sit at well served  tables with food for all family members, while Indian and  peasant families must sit with death at their side because death  is their daily companion. That is why we took up arms, the  Zapatists explain.    The next communique is very important. It deals with the  amnesty bill that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sent  to Congress. In this document the EZLN states that some  conditions must be met so the amnesty will be real. The  document states that so far the Zapatists have not seen an  original text of the bill, something they had been promised and  which they were supposed to receive through San Cristobal de las  Cases Bishop Samuel Ruiz from Manuel Camacho Solis, the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas.    One of the points of the communique states: Judging from  what we have heard in the media about the amnesty bill, we can  only give general opinions, considering that the position toward  amnesty is premature in the face of the current dialogue  process, which so far has not really entered the essential phase.    The EZLN notes that once this phase arrives, one fundamental  step would be to make statements available to the Zapatists in  writing so they can be analyzed. The EZLN adds that there are  still fierce clashes between units of the Mexican Army and the  Zapatists. The document notes that one of the EZLN's demands  has not been met; that is, the withdrawal of the Armed Forces to  their quarters.    Today we visited some places near San Cristobal de las  Casas,  Chiapas, where we knew the Mexican Army had been mobilized, and  we noticed that right now there are fewer soldiers guarding the  city.    As we reported yesterday, Army elements in some sites will  remain. Some camps will be built to provide security to the  towns.    The EZLN reports that the Zapatists are not opposed to a  dialogue. On the contrary, they say they are amenable to making  it an increasingly open process. The communique notes that  right now the EZLN wants some time to analyze the points of the  amnesty. The communique states: We are open and prepared to  negotiate.    There is also a third communique that is very, very,  important. Here the EZLN acknowledges Manuel Camacho Solis, the  special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, as  a valid interlocutor for these talks, an interlocutor for peace,  as they call him.    In this communique they explain that Camacho Solis has  positive characteristics for engaging in this dialogue with the  EZLN. The communique adds that Camacho Solis has demonstrated,  with his words and deeds, that he has goodwill and good  intentions to reach a dialogue that could be fruitful and bring  to Chiapas the justice it needs.</p>

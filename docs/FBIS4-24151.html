			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 24 SAPA -- Members of the African  National Congress serving in the government should set an  example by disclosing their role in past acts of terror, nine  former heads of the SA Police and SA Defence Force said in a  statement on Friday [24 June]. In the statement issued on their  behalf, former Police Commissioner Gen Mike Geldenhuys said  certain principles needed to be followed if Justice Minister  Dullah Omar was serious in his intention to expose the truth in  the interests of reconciliation.    The first was that members of the ANC National Executive  Committee, especially those serving in the government, set an  example by disclosing their roles in the "planning,  decision-making, policy, approval, instructions and acts which  led to deeds of terror and death and mutilation of defenceless  persons, including women and children".    Gen Geldenhuys said a second principle was that all parties  and persons who were guilty of unlawful acts during the  political struggle be dealt with "in all respects in the same  way".    "The ANC and organisations which supported it cannot be  excused on the grounds that they were conducting a so-called  freedom struggle," the generals said.    Other principles included that basic justice should prevail  and that the charter of fundamental human rights be upheld  properly; that the activities of all organisations that played a  role in undermining law and order and in promoting terrorism, as  well as the misuse of funds collected for welfare purposes, be  investigated; and that the police, defence force and national  intelligence service disclose all available information and  documentation they have in that regard.    Gen Geldenhuys said it was of vital importance that the  advantages and disadvantages of the proposed truth commission  and its contribution to the reconciliation process be considered  carefully.    It needed to be questioned whether the consequences of the  commission's investigations would bring about division,  distrust, bitterness and the rejection of political leaders and  the security forces.    The statement was issued by Gen Geldenhuys on behalf of  Freedom Front Leader Gen Constand Viljoen and Generals J P Gous,  Gideon Joubert, Gertjie Prinsloo, Johan Coetzee, Hennie de Witt,  Jannie Geldenhuys and Kat Liebenberg.</p>

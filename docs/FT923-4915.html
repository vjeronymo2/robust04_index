			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Classic blast for Radio 3 CLASSIC FM, Britain's first national commercial radio station, yesterday criticised BBC Radio 3 for moving towards its position in the marketplace. Mr John Spearman, chief executive of the new station, to be launched on Monday, said the recent format changes at Radio 3 seemed to be taking it towards the position it thought Classic FM would occupy. Mr Spearman, who said he was an avid Radio 3 listener, said: 'This reduces consumer choice rather than expanding it. I am sorry about that.' There was plenty of room for both Radio 3 and Classic FM in the market, he said. The new station, which will broadcast on a range of frequencies from 100-102 FM in different parts of the company, will open at 6am on Monday with Handel's God Save The King. The first advertisement - advertising sales have already exceeded Pounds 1.3m in just over two months - will be for Barclays Bank. Classic FM, which will concentrate on melodic classical music, hopes to attract a weekly audience of 2.8m - 70 per cent of them from the ABC1 social groups.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The advisory panels to the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] -- the Industrial  Structure Council and the Small and Medium Enterprise Policy  Making Council -- have jointly worked out revisions for the  Large Retail Store Law.    While the Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren]  and other business associations had been urging an abolition of  the law, the joint panel decided not to do so. Instead the  panel prepared a revision bill for relaxing restrictions on  large stores. The law currently requires difficult procedures  for opening stores larger than 500 square meters, but  liberalizes in principle the opening of stores smaller than  1,000 square meters. Also, the bill relaxes restrictions on  business hours and days.    The joint council is expected to provide the final draft of  the bill on 28 January, but the revision may face rough going  due to opposition from smaller retail stores.    Presently MITI's Large Retail Store Council controls the  opening of retail stores larger than 500 square meters. The  bill still has the 500-square-meters rule, but adds a provision  that the opening of stores smaller than 1,000 square meters  should not be intended for governmental inspection unless local  business communities complain. The bill also seeks deregulation  for large retail stores by: 1) while the regulation in effect  urges all large stores to close at 1900 hours, business hours  will be extended to 2000 hours; and 2) the annual off-business  days for restricted large stores will be reduced from 44 to 24.</p>

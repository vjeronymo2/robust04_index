			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning from Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] A few minutes ago, we received a letter addressed  expressly to Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network,  signed by insurgent Subcommander Marcos. I will read it quickly  for our viewers.    Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network, News  Directorate, Federal District of Mexico, from Insurgent  Subcommander Marcos, Indian Revolutionary Clandestine  Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist Army  of National Liberation], mountains of southeastern Chiapas,  Mexico.    Gentlemen, a few minutes ago I was informed that on Mexico  City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network's [3 February] evening  newscast, a letter from reporter Francisco Rubio, who works for  the station, was read. The letter was addressed to the EZLN and  explained the events that occurred while he was covering the  area under our forces' control. The letter explained the  circumstances surrounding the offer to pay members of the EZLN  in exchange for their statements.    With the approval of the CCRI-CG of the EZLN I hereby state  the following:    1. The CCRI of the EZLN is satisfied with the explanation  given by reporter Francisco Rubio, hails Mr. Rubio's attitude  and that of Azteca's news directorate for broadcasting it, and  is pleased that this regrettable misunderstanding has been  clarified.    2. The CCRI of the EZLN is lifting its veto on Azteca  Television's coverage of the peace and reconciliation talks  between Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis and the EZLN, with the  mediation of Mr. Samuel Ruiz Garcia.    3. The EZLN hereby declares it will grant Azteca Television  reporters and envoys, including Mr. Francisco Rubio,  accreditation to coverage the event without any problem  whatsoever. The EZLN will do all it can to facilitate their  journalistic work within the territories under our control.    4. The EZLN hereby declares that if it is possible, it will  be glad to meet with reporters from Azteca Television and other  news media mentioned in its 29 January 1994 communique.    [Signed] Insurgent Subcommander Marcos, 3 February 1994.</p>

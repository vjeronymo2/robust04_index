			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Democratic societies The government has bought the line that building societies will become more accountable if voting rights are given to ordinary depositors. This faith in building society democracy is touching but naive. Millions of society members already possess the vote but can rarely be bothered to use it. Inflating their ranks will merely increase the number of wasted votes. Instead of extending voting rights, the government should define clearly members' economic rights. At present, these rights are fuzzy. Members collectively own the societies' assets. But the legal framework does not specify how these assets should be distributed among individual members. This vagueness most obviously has drawbacks if a society is taken over or acquired. Should its value be divided among members on a flat-rate basis, in proportion to their savings or according to number of years they have saved with the society? There is no clear answer. Not surprisingly, there is grumbling over who receives the spoils, as shown in Lloyds Bank's bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. The planned Halifax-Leeds merger may provoke similar disgruntlement. Clear economic rights could also improve accountability. If members had identifiable financial interests, there would be greater point in using their votes. There are several ways of doing this. One would be to pay members' dividends reflecting their society's performance, as if they owned equity in an ordinary company. An alternative would be to pay higher interest rates - with the portion attributable to financial performance clearly earmarked. Spelling out economic rights in this way would also clear up the widespread confusion over who is a member and who is not. Such a reform would not merely give substance to the idea of building society democracy. There would be broader economic benefits given the billions of pounds of capital tied up in the movement. Societies' positive image in the high street may give the impression that they are performing well. In fact, their managements are often sleepy. Many only perform tolerably well because they are sitting on vast inherited capital bases on which no dividends are paid.</p>

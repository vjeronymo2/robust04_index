			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Clemente Nicado] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- According to Foreign Ministry  specialist Omar Morales, the spirit of agreement among the  various Latin American integration mechanisms was reiterated in  the preparations for the creation of the Association of  Caribbean States [AEC].    In a statement to PRENSA LATINA, Morales said the  integrationist trend was evinced during recent meetings held by  the Latin American Economic System and at the Ibero-American  Summit.    The spirit is very healthy for the hemisphere -- Morales  said  -- because it opens the path toward the continent's economic  unity, which will put the area in a better position to compete  with blocs in other areas of the world.    Morales said the AEC is made up of three regional blocs, the  Anglo-Caribbean Community (Caricom), the Central American  Integration System (SICA), and the Group of Three, made up of  Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia.    We hope this integrationist trend to link all regional blocs  on the continent, including Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) and the Andean  Pact (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia), will  continue, he added.    Morales said he will attend a technical meeting in Caracas  on  27 and 28 June to complete the future organization's charter.  In addition, he said, we will continue to work on new subjects,  like the AEC's working agenda and formulas for the secretariat's  structure and operation.    He confirmed that a foreign ministers meeting will be held  on  29 June in Caracas, where the charter will be approved and the  date and place for the definitive creation of the AEC will be  established.    So far, Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, is scheduled to  begin receiving on 4 July heads of state of member countries to  form the AEC, which is regarded as an intergovernmental  organization for regional consensus, consultation, and  cooperation.</p>

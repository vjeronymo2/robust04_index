			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DOCTOR WON'T QUIT CUSTODY FIGHT  </P> <P> Dr. Erich Foretich today denied a report that he is giving up the international  custody battle for his 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, now living in New Zealand  where she was secreted by her maternal grandparents.  </P> <P> Foretich, in an interview published in New Zealand's Christchurch Star, was  quoted as saying he was forced to accept that Hilary would live in New Zealand  with her grandparents and Foretich's former wife, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan.  </P> <P> The dental surgeon also was quoted as saying he would not pursue the custody  case unless he had evidence that Hilary was in physical danger.  </P> <P> The case has been before the New Zealand courts since Hilary was discovered  living there in February.  </P> <P> "While I continue to believe that protracted litigation is not in the best  interest of my daughter, I continue to oppose Dr. Morgan's application for  custody in New Zealand," Foretich said in a statement released through his U.S.  attorney, Elaine Mittleman.  </P></p>

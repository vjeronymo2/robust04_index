			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Canada Is in Recession, Government Says: After seven years of robust growth,  Canada's economy has officially slipped into recession, the government said.  </P> <P> It reported that gross domestic product, a wide measure of economic activity,  fell for the second consecutive quarter -- Canada's definition of a recession.  In the July-to-September period, the economy contracted at an annualized rate  of 1%. In the second quarter, output declined at a 1.2% rate. Economists said  the downturn is mild, however, and, barring a Persian Gulf war and further oil  price increases, should end sometime next year.  </P></p>

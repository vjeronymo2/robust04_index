He said  that consultations would begin at 10:00 at the Institute of  Economic Problems of the Transitional Period (5 Ogaryova Street)  and will be attended by leading politicians, public and cultural  figures, and representatives of trade unions and associations of  entrepreneurs.    "The talks will concentrate on the establishment of a new  political association involving politicians close to Russia's  Choice and representatives of a wide range of non-political  organizations, said the source.    The same problem will be discussed during closed emergency  consultations at one of Moscow's suburban recreational  facilities over the weekend, involving deputies of the Russia's  Choice parliamentary faction.</p>

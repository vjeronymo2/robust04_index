			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Books: Jury stays out on women detectives - Crime TUNNEL VISION by Sarah Paretsky Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 483 pages MALLORY'S ORACLE by Carol O'Connell Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 282 pages EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE by Michelle Spring Orion Pounds 14.99, 210 pages CATNAP by Gillian Slovo Michael Joseph Pounds 9.99, 277 pages Is it time to blow the whistle on the female private eye? Everyone has been trying it and the books are not getting any better. There may be a message in the TV moguls' recent decision to abandon the Anna Lee series based on Liza Cody's tame and miniskirted English investigator. A decade ago, Sarah Paretsky's creation of VI Warshawski summoned premature and inaccurate comparisons with Runyon, even Chandler: the new genre was evidently a part of the feminist agenda, and why not. The men fought back - Leonard, Parker, Block, Hiaasen and the rest - and they did so by seeking out new angles, new relevances, in their traditional male preserve. Let the jury stay out for a few more years, but let us not abandon standards. Paretsky's latest, Tunnel Vision, is a near-disaster. It is far too long, it takes 100 pages to get going, the prose is flat to the point of drab, utterly inadequate to cope with any drama, and the dialogue is perfunctory. Much worse, her famous protagonist, Warshawski, is getting to be a bore as she keeps on about her 40th birthday. 'VI', the tough Polish-Irish ex-cop in Chicago, is still the radical, liberated, bolshie, private investigator who caused such an impact eight books ago. Trouble is, she hasn't changed. She is as bossy as ever, she goes on and on about her clothes and her cooking and her exercises, she worries about Chicago's homeless families and abused children and battered women and, not so surprisingly you might agree, she begins to fall out with her black cop boyfriend. She discovers big fraud and laundered money in Chicago's high society. Then she plunges, literally, into the underworld of the city's flood tunnels in a long, slow, procedural PI drama in which she takes an unbelievable amount of physical punishment. At least she vomits when she finds her friend's head mashed into her personal computer - and, typically, Paretsky's pedestrian prose can make nothing of the scene. This is a successful author on auto-pilot. Since the comparisons have been made, it is necessary to say that Paretsky on present form has nothing of the magic of the early masters of the trade. Carol O'Connoll is apparently the big discovery of the season, with a million dollars for her first novel, Mallory's Oracle. The gimmick - all these books have to have one - is that the woman heroine-cop, Sergeant Kathy Mallory, adopted daughter of a New York police officer, is a computer whizzkid with the soul of a thief. Mallory is shown to be a deeply damaged human being. It would be interesting to see how she might emerge from her traumas in the course of her pursuit of the serial killer who is responsible for her foster father's murder. If this is the central theme, it is evaded because Ms O'Connell has so much else to explain to us - lots of computer expertise, false leads and old-fashioned research to do with elderly New York ladies who go to seances. The dialogue is good; the rest of the prose is overwritten, without the necessary pauses or periods of quietness: the interesting creation - Kathy - is allowed to drift out of focus in the welter of surrounding detail. Ms O'Connell needs a tough editor. Back to Britain, and cosy Norfolk, with another debutante, Michelle Spring's 'Laura Principal', in Every Breath You Take. This is a spin-off from the ancient English tradition of carefully-penned dramas of varsity-dons-as-sleuths. Who kills Monica, the art lecturer who joins Laura and Helen in their Country Life cottage? Why is the Provost such a shit? Will Laura Principal survive to tell the tale? And do we care? The prose is a genteel beta-plus, the plot an unadventurous and very English beta-minus. All these books emphasise the 'psychological' angle - Chandler would have choked on his martini - perhaps because this seems to offer a more appropriate, or more credible, area of feminine wisdom. Or perhaps it is more realistic, and interesting, than women performing physical violence on villains who are usually male. Note too that all the women protagonists in this batch are into middle age. Gillian Slovo's Catnap is the most interested of the four in developing this psychological angle. Her Kate Baier is yet another woman private detective, though recently a foreign correspondent, operating in London's Dalston of all places (talk about 'down those mean streets - ']). The plot, a slow and not-at-all exciting drama about the looting of pension funds, is more concerned with Kate's need to come to terms with the death of her lover five years before. It is obsessive, worthy, under-powered, and it lingers in the memory. She, like the others, needs to write with more pizazz if we are to look forward to her next.</p>

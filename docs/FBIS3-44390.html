I wish you success in everything and family happiness in the  year ahead.    Friends, the past year has been a year in which the Chinese  people, working under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line, continued their triumphant advance in  accordance with the strategic policy decision to seize the  opportunity to deepen reform and bring about rapid and healthy  development. It has also been a year in which major progress  was made in implementing the decision of our party's 14th  National Congress on establishing a socialist market economy.  China is now enjoying economic growth, political stability,  national unity, and social progress. Facts show that the line,  principles, and policies formulated by our party and government  for economic and social development are correct. Facts also show  that the experience of our party and government in keeping the  overall development situation under control and in improving  their macro guidance is becoming richer and more mature. The  tasks we shoulder are very arduous and we still face  difficulties and problems in our advance, but we have the means  and abilities to overcome them. We will begin the new year and  march toward a bright future with even fuller confidence and  greater strides.    Building socialism with Chinese characteristics means  adherence to the policy of reform and opening up to the outside  world -- the only way to develop contemporary China -- to build  our country into a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modern  socialist country with the persistent hard work of several  generations. To shake off poverty and backwardness and achieve  a prosperity in our motherland is a common aspiration which all  the Chinese people and the entire Chinese nation longing day and  night to realize. China is a large, oriental country with a  history of 5,000 years of civilization and a population of some  1.1 billion. A prosperous and strong China will not only  contribute to the happiness of the Chinese people and Chinese  nation. It will contribute even more to the civilization of all  mankind. China's stability and development cannot be separated  from the peace and development of the world as a whole, and vice  versa; this has become the common understanding of more and more  people.    Friends, the present world is in a period of transition from  an old to a new structure. On the one hand, some positive  tendencies have appeared in international relations, the process  of multi- polarization of the world is being accelerated, and  the people of all countries in general are demanding detente and  cooperation. On the other hand, the world is still far from  peaceful. The contradictions in some regions have intensified,  resulting in turmoil and endless armed conflicts. Hegemonism  and power politics are still very conspicuous, seriously  challenging world peace and development. The Chinese Government  and people, firmly adhering to an independent and peaceful  foreign policy, have played an important role in the complex,  changing international situation and made positive contributions  to promoting peace and development in the world. China's  international prestige has risen remarkably, its international  environment has been further improved, and we have friends all  over the world. The world is varied and colorful. Any country  should respect the right of people in other countries to  maintain independence and keep the initiative in their own  hands. A strong, big, and rich country can never achieve its  goal by bullying a weak, smaller, and poor country, and will  only end up hurting itself. China will never seek hegemony, and  its development will not constitute a threat to any country. We  will, as always, persistently develop friendly and cooperative  relations with other countries on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence, and make unremitting efforts  to build a peaceful, stable, fair, and rational new  international order.    It is the sacred mission of the whole Chinese people,  including our Taiwan compatriots, to complete the peaceful  reunification of the motherland. Peaceful reunification is also  the general trend in the development of China's history. People  on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are longing for  reunification. Any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China,  one Taiwan," and "one China, two governments" goes against the  aspirations and fundamental interests of people on both sides of  the Taiwan Strait. It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities  will follow the general trend and the people's aspirations, put  national interests above all, do more solid work for the  reunification of the motherland, and together with the mainland  create a more prosperous China. The dates when Hong Kong and  Macao will return to the motherland are approaching. Due to the  fact that the British side persists in its wrong stand on the  Hong Kong issue, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong have broken  down. This is something that we did not want to see. No matter  what happens, we share the feelings and aspirations of the  patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong. Our policy of "one country,  two systems" will not change, our principal stand of adhering to  the Basic Law on Hong Kong will not change, and our resolve to  restore China's sovereignty over Hong Kong will not change. We  are fully confident that we have the ability to keep Hong Kong  prosperous and stable for a long time to come.    Friends, a solid foundation for the people of all countries  to strengthen unity and cooperation is working together for  peace and development. Unity and cooperation need mutual  understanding. In the past year, tens of thousands of guests  from abroad have visited China. Many foreign guests I have met  have told me that the China they had personally witnessed is  entirely different from what they thought and originally  understood it to be. An old Chinese proverb says, "It is better  to see once than hear a hundred times." The year 1994 is the  45th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of  China. In the coming year, we earnestly welcome more foreign  friends to come to China and see for themselves. Such contacts  will promote mutual understanding, trust, and friendship. For  decades the China International Broadcasting Station has been  introducing China's developments to overseas audience, and it  has been a bridge linking China with the outside world. I hope  it will play a still greater role in enhancing friendship and  cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of various  countries of the world.    Finally, I once again wish you Happy New Year! Thank you.</p>

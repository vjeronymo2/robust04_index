			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of  the state of Palestine, and chairman of the Executive Committee  of the PLO, has reiterated that the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the  crossing of Palestinian police into the Gaza and Jericho areas,  and the installation of the first national authority there, are  not the limit of our ambitions, but steps on the road toward an  independent Palestinian state.    In remarks, carried by the Qatari News Agency, during a  visit  today to the martyrs cemetery in the Hammam al-Shatt District  near the Tunisian capital to mark the blessed 'Id al-Adha,  'Arafat said what has been achieved thus far is something like a  newborn that needs all the care and attention it can get until  it is able to hoist the Palestinian flag over Jerusalem. Our  Palestinian people are an integral part of the Arab nation,  'Arafat stated.    Brother Abu-'Ammar thanked the Tunisian Republic for the  support it has given to the Palestinian people and cause and for  playing host to their leaders.</p>

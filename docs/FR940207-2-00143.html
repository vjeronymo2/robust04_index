			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5). <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs, by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect to options on common stock. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if an investor wants to invest the ADRs but does not have sufficient cash available until a future date, he can purchase an ADR option now for less money and exercise the option to purchase the ADRs at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See e.g. Report of the Special Study of the Options Markets to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (Comm. Print No. 96&hyph;IFC3, December 22, 1978).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new securities product upon a finding that the introduction of such new product is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to permit the Phlx to list and trade options on ADRs given that these options will be subject to specific requirements related to the protection of investors. First, Phlx rules require that the ADRs underlying these options meet the Phlx's uniform options listing standards in all respects. As described above, this would include the initial and maintenance criteria. These criteria ensure, among other things, that the underlying ADRs will maintain adequate price and float to prevent the ADR options from being readily susceptible to manipulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the ADR Approval Order requires that the Phlx make a reasonable inquiry to evaluate foreign securities underlying the ADR options to ensure that these securities are generally consistent with the requirements set forth in the Exchange's options listing standards. In the ADR Approval Order, the Commission recognized that in some cases, an ADR underlying an option could meet the options listing standards while the foreign security on which the ADR is based may not meet these standards in every respect. For example, in the case of ADRs overlying certain foreign securities, one ADR could represent several shares of a specific stock. For this reason, it is possible that the price of the ADR will meet exchange listing standards even though the market price of the foreign security underlying the ADR may be less than the Phlx standard. The Commission believes, however, that requiring the Phlx to review the foreign securities underlying the ADR options to ensure that they are generally consistent with the Exchange's options listing standards, along with other market safeguards, will adequately protect investors from the possibility that these ADR options can be potentially manipulated. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, we would expect the Exchange to consider delisting an option on an ADR if the price and public float of the underlying security did not meet trading or size maintenance standards, or if the security underlying the ADR failed to meet other standards that raised manipulative concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the Phlx has in place an adequate mechanism for providing for the exchange of the surveillance information necessary to adequately detect and deter market manipulation or trading abuses involving ADR options. Although the proposal does not require the Phlx to have a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place with the foreign exchange on which the security underlying the ADR options trade, the Commission believes that this does not impair the ability of the Phlx to detect or deter manipulation because the proposal requires that the 50% or more of the trading activity in the underlying foreign securities occur in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission notes that proposal requires the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that constitute the U.S. ADR market to be members of the ISG, which will provide for the exchange of necessary surveillance information concerning trading activity in the ADR options, and the respective underlying ADR market. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

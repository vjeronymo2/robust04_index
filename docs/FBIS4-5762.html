			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT]  has begun to move on establishment of a commercial Internet  group. The move is viewed as an attempt to gain a leadership  role by establishing an industry group because of the expected  rapid growth in new information-communications businesses.    Services connecting with the domestic commercial Internet  system were initiated in November of last year. Two companies  known as AT&amp;T Japan ENS (AT&amp;T JENS) and Internet  Initiative  (IIJ) have already begun offering services and Fujitsu will  initiate services in June. Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) is also  considering the idea of joining in the competition because its  operating base will be compromised if international telephone  calls are routed through the Internet system. Nippon Telegraph  and Telephone (NTT) is also studying the situation.    Internet is a worldwide computer network created in the  United States and its subscribers are estimated to total 20  million. It can be used for electronic mail exchanges and to  access remote data bases through the use of computers. It is  projected to develop into a multimedia system for the  transmission of voice and animated images.    In December of last year, MOPT began seminars attended by  companies involved with Internet. The seminars have been  attended by a total of 14 companies, including two commercial  services firms, NTT, KDD, personal computer Communications firm  Nifty, and communications equipment maker Japan Cisco Systems,  and three academics, including professor Junsuke Murai of Keio  University.    As stated in the prospectus for the seminar, its goal is "to  aid in the growth of our nation's Internet system," but the  collective opinion of several attendees say MOPT has an ulterior  motive. The aim of MOPT is to operate an agency called  Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) under its initiative to  provide for the efficient interconnection of commercial networks  and to use the seminars as a means to set up such an  organization.    The seminars were originally scheduled to end in March, but  a  decision has been made to extend them beyond April. The seminars  will soon progress into a discussion on the establishment of CIX.    The Japanese international communications market is valued  at  300 billion yen. Currently, fewer than 500 firms subscribe to  Internet. However, when the services are expanded on a  full-scale basis, the market situation could change drastically.  Some sources take the view that, "MOPT has embarked on a program  to regulate the market as a means to extend aid to KDD and  existing communications companies that will be impacted by  changes."</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Technology: Neural networks track Footsie - Worth Watching Artificial neural networks, comprising layers of interconnected neurons, have become a unique tool for processing complex financial data because they can be 'trained' to recognise patterns and discover relationships within them. Now Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, working with University College, London, has developed a prototype stock forecasting system using neural technology. Its accuracy at forecasting the FT-SE 100 share index (the Footsie) is typically above 80 per cent, reaching 93 per cent on a number of occasions. This compares with about 50 per cent accuracy for traditional forecasting methods. BZW's team, headed by Frank McGroarty, has spent two years with Professor Philip Treleaven and Siew-Lan Loo of UCL's computer science department to optimise the neural network specifically for the Footsie. A prototype system has been installed at BZWIM. Professor Treleaven: UK, 071 380 7288.</p>

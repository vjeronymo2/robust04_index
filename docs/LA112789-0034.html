			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE FARM'S FUTURE  </P> <P> I applaud all the exciting ideas for the future of Pierce College Farm in Ruth  Loring's letter (Nov. 12).  </P> <P> In a recent copy of the Pierce Roundup, I see that the president has already  appointed a top-flight committee of business people to help him save the farm.  With their combined expertise they will certainly produce some sound and  innovative plans. Above all, these community leaders have the know-how to put  their plans into immediate action.  </P> <P> As a longtime resident, I am very pleased that the administration and the  committee are anxious to preserve the farm as a profitable and attractive  enterprise, which will greatly enrich the education of the students.  </P> <P> BEVERLY TABER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

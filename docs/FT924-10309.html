			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Schools bill will widen central state powers RADICAL proposals to extend the government's powers over the education system and wind down local education authorities in England and Wales were published yesterday. The Education Bill, which implements reform plans set out in a white paper in the summer, proposes to give Mr John Patten, education secretary, wide-ranging powers to close schools with surplus places and send management teams into failing schools. It also proposes a funding council, appointed by Mr Patten, for grant-maintained schools - schools that have opted out of local-authority control. The bill gives to Mr Patten and the funding council powers over grant-maintained schools as extensive as those at present possessed by local education authorities, including the powers to close and reorganise schools. More than 45 new powers would be conferred on the education secretary by the proposed legislation. Even the power to reorganise schools would be subject to his absolute discretion once a public local inquiry has been held. That will disappoint many grant-maintained schools, particularly schools with falling rolls that opted out - or are considering doing so - in order to evadeaction being taken against them by their local authorities. The bill, which will be debated by MPs within 10 days, is intended to boost the number of grant-maintained schools from the current 313. It would make it easier than at present for schools to opt out. Mr Patten said his plans would 'expand choice, diversity and specialisation' in the education system. 'All schools will be encouraged to specialise in their particular curricular strengths, if they wish.' The most novel feature of the bill is the plan for education associations to take over the management of failing schools where the governing body and local authority have shown themselves 'unable or unwilling' to bring about improvements identified by the Schools Inspectorate. It would also set up a School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, to replace the School Examinations and Assessment Council and the National Curriculum Council; and an independent tribunal to hear parental appeals against the treatment of pupils with special needs.</p>

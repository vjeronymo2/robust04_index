			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STEWART GETS HIS 18TH VICTORY AS ATHLETICS EASILY HANDLE YANKEES, 7-3  </P> <P> Nolan Ryan and Dwight Gooden get more accolades. Orel Hershiser and Roger  Clemens get more money. But no pitcher in baseball gets more victories than  Dave Stewart.  </P> <P> Stewart became the first 18-game winner in the major leagues and Dave Parker  and Walt Weiss each hit home runs as the Oakland Athletics beat the New York  Yankees, 7-3, at New York Monday.  </P> <P> "As always, I did just enough to win," Stewart said. "When it comes time to  take control, I do that."  </P> <P> Stewart (18-8) moved closer to his third consecutive 20-victory season, a feat  last accomplished by Jim Palmer, who had four in a row, from 1975-78.  </P> <P> Against the Yankees, Stewart didn't need that much. Oakland tagged Andy Hawkins  (13-13) in taking a 5-1 lead in the third inning and made New York 2-10 under  Manager Bucky Dent. Dennis Eckersley earned his 28th save.  </P> <P> Boston 6, Detroit 3 -- Nick Esasky hit his 26th homer, a three-run shot in the  first inning, and took over the league RBI lead with 93 as the Red Sox beat the  Tigers at Boston.  </P> <P> The Tigers have lost nine in a row, with the Red Sox completing a five-game  sweep. Boston extended its longest winning streak of the year to seven games.  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker (12-9) shut out the Tigers on three singles for five innings  before tiring and getting relief help in the seventh.  </P> <P> After giving up three hits and one run in the sixth, Boddicker gave up two  singles to start the seventh and was replaced by Rob Murphy, who pitched 2 1/3  innings and allowed a run. Lee Smith got the last two outs for his 19th save.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 8, Toronto 2 -- At Toronto, Robin Yount had three hits, including his  15th homer, and newcomer Ed Romero drove in two runs as the Brewers snapped a  six-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Tom Filer (5-2) gave up two runs and four hits over five innings, as the  Brewers stopped the Blue Jays' six-game winning streak. Bill Krueger earned his  third save.  </P> <P> Toronto's George Bell extended his hitting streak to a career-high 19 games.  </P> <P> Minnesota 5, Seattle 4 -- The Mariners tied a club record when their losing  streak reached 12 in this game at Minnesota. Kirby Puckett doubled home Dan  Gladden with two out in the 10th inning to give the Twins their sixth  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> With one out in the 10th, Wally Backman singled and was forced at second on  Gladden's grounder to third before Puckett doubled against reliever Mike  Schooler (1-5).  </P> <P> Jeff Reardon (5-3), who blew a save opportunity in the ninth, retired Seattle  in order in the 10th inning for the victory.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Drink suppliers to open market THE UK's largest carbonated drink suppliers yesterday agreed to give undertakings aimed at guaranteeing competition in the soft drinks industry, nearly two years after they were first recommended by a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages, Coca-Cola Bottlers (Ulster), and Britvic  - which together account for more than half the UK's Pounds 5.5bn carbonated drinks market - agreed to end exclusive or restrictive supply agreements with pubs and leisure outlets. Coca-Cola Schweppes also agreed to seek approval from the Office of Fair Trading before it acquired any business involved in supplying draught soft drinks through dispensing machines. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, asked for the undertakings last June. His request followed consultation between the Department of Trade and Industry and the companies, after a commission report on the carbonated drinks market published in August 1991. The report found competition was generally effective in the take-home trade, but that practices in the leisure trade could restrict choice and lead to higher prices. Mr Hamilton called the undertakings a 'very satisfactory outcome'. Coca-Cola Schweppes, a joint venture between the US Coca-Cola Company and Cadbury Schweppes of the UK, which has 30 per cent of the carbonated drinks market, said the undertakings would have 'no significant impact' on its business as they affected only about 1 per cent of its sales volume. Britvic, owned by brewers including Bass, Whitbread and Allied Lyons, which has about 20 per cent of the UK market, said the undertakings would have 'no effect on its ongoing business'.</p>

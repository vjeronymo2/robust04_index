			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel strong Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bucked the poor market trend in London, moving sharply ahead after stating that the 23 leading banks of its creditor syndicate had approved its funding plans. Market watchers said the agreement clears the way for a likely rights issue within the next few months. The shares rose 20 to 630p in active trade of 2.7m, and were heavily traded in Paris where the group is also listed. Sentiment was further boosted by confirmation of its tariff for users when it opens in May, and analysts suggested that novelty value was likely to attract users in spite of the rather expensive tariffs. Yesterday's announcement followed the recent agreement by the French and British governments to extend the Channel tunnel concession for an extra 10 years. Hotel, racing and property group Ladbroke was the best performing FT-SE 100 stock as a variety of pundits and brokers tipped it as a likely outperformer in 1994. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant banker, has included it in its top 10 buys of the year. Analyst Mr Paul Slattery said: 'The on-going managerial changes at Ladbroke are leading to improved disclosure and empathy with investor concerns, while the trading recovery will boost earnings performance in 1994. We expect the share price to outperform strongly as the year progresses.' The shares have underperformed the market by 28 per cent, 51 per cent and 58 per cent over the past 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Yesterday the stock jumped 12 1/2 to 175p, with 11m shares traded. BT was an easier exception in a strong telecoms sector as Hoare Govett underlined market sentiment that the stock was looking overbought. Hoare said worries over new competition, Oftel-induced price cuts and the threat of a more aggressive pricing from Mercury, hung over BT. The shares later rallied to close just a penny off at 471 1/2 p. News of a wide-ranging review of UK cross-media ownership once again led to renewed bid speculation for several television stocks. Those said to be bid targets include Anglia TV, which put on 5 at 433p, and HTV, 4 up at 113p. Yorkshire, currently in merger talks with bid target LWT, jumped 18 to 174p. LWT was unchanged at 606p. Bargain hunters were active in the much-maligned food manufacturing sector. Many stocks benefited from 1994 tipping in the media. Among them, Cadbury-Schweppes rose 9 to 518p, Unigate 3 to 369p, Tate &amp; Lyle 9 to 409p and Bensons Crisps 11 to 67p. Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries shed 3 to 551p after James Capel was said to have trimmed its profits forecast. News that the chief executive of international conglomerate BTR had sold part of his holding in the group at 374p a share brought a retreat of 15 to 358p in the stock. The recovery in the gold price boosted mining group RTZ late in the session. The shares jumped 32 to 844p. Worries that the Channel tunnel will prove strong competition for the ferry services left P&amp;O down 8 at 638p. Volume in computer maintenance company Wakebourne jumped to 404m shares, making it by far the day's most actively traded stock, after the placing of the rump of last month's rights issue which received a 68 per cent take-up. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 p. Seasonal support lifted Fairline Boats 30 to 350p. The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices shown below are the first to use the revised classification of industry sectors. A table explaining the new system can be found on the UK Company News pages. The FT's share price listings, the London Share Service, have also been adjusted to reflect the new classification. A complete alphabetical guide to where companies fall in the new classification was published in yesterday's FT.</p>

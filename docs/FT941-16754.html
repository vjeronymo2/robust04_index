			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / China pressed over N Korea Japan is expected to press China to use its influence to encourage North Korea to allow international inspections of all its nuclear sites when Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister, arrives in Beijing today to meet his counterpart, Mr Qian Qichen. 'This is of vital, vital interest to both countries' and Japan expected China to play a 'big role', said a foreign ministry official. Earlier in the week, North Korea agreed in principle to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of seven sites, but did not agree to let inspectors visit two more suspected and undeclared nuclear facilities. Mr Hata's two-day visit is his third meeting with the Chinese foreign minister since Japan's coalition government took power last August. Contacts have increased partly for economic reasons, as bilateral trade between China and Japan rose to an estimated record Dollars 35bn last year, from Dollars 25.3bn in 1992. China is still unsure of the new government in Tokyo. It wants to maintain continuity of relations with Japan, which it sees as an important intermediary with the US, as well as a trade partner. Japanese loans to China, nuclear testing and environmental policy could also be discussed, said Japanese officials.</p>

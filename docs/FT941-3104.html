			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Britton Pounds 2.7m in black - Gelpack and Taco help with turnround Britton Group, the packaging company created from the shell of Firstland Oil and Gas, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.73m in 1993. The figures included a full year from Gelpack, acquired in October 1992 and five months from Taco, bought last August for Pounds 36.7m funded by a rights issue and placing. In 1992 the group recorded a loss of Pounds 2.32m, of which Pounds 2.1m was the disposal loss on the oil and gas interests. Group turnover was Pounds 26.8m, with Pounds 13.3m coming from Gelpack and Pounds 13.5m from Taco. Operating profits were Pounds 2.96m, with Pounds 1.96m contributed by the higher margin Taco business. Interest charges were Pounds 226,000. Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, said the group's strategy was to develop a packaging group with two or three divisions in fragmented sectors of the industry. With two acquisitions Britton was already the second largest UK polythene extruder. Adding another division would require further external funding. Gearing was 17 per cent at the year end, assuming full payment of Pounds 5.5m deferred consideration for Taco. However, Taco is now not expected to meet its earn-out target and Britton hoped to claw back much of that money, giving the group's negligible gearing, said Mr Simon Beart, finance director. Britton is planning a 10-for-1 share consolidation as it has 514m shares in issue. A final dividend of 0.09p is proposed to give an effective total for the year of 0.15p. Earnings per share were 0.68p. Mr Beart said the 26 per cent tax rate in 1993 was artificially low and would probably rise to about 31 per cent in future.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Egypt denies Israeli gas deal The Egyptian oil ministry yesterday denied it had agreed to supply natural gas to Israel through a pipeline to be built from the Nile Delta, Reuter reports from Cairo. Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi said he and Israeli Energy Minister Moshe Shahal had agreed to co-operate closely and exchange visits by experts. But his spokesman, Mr Mohammed Shawkat, denied a statement by Mr Shahal's ministry that Egypt had agreed to supply Israel with 2m tonnes of natural gas a year for 25 years, using a pipeline that would also supply the Gaza Strip. 'There is no mention of any pipelines or agreements to supply certain amounts of natural gas to Israel and any reports to this effect are factually wrong,' Mr Shawkat said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by sr: "According to Klaus, Higher Bodies Are Not </F> the Most Urgent Problem"]    [Text] Prague--As Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on the  Debata television program on CT1 yesterday, he knows there are  much more important and urgent problems than the establishment  of higher administrative bodies. Thus he responded in the new  program to questions by reporters concerning the establishment  of these bodies and the state administration reform.    Moreover, he said that it is questionable whether this issue  requires an immediate and deep involvement. He, himself, as he  said, will not support this rather harsh approach. He said  further that he supports such an approach only if he is certain  that an immediate and harsh solution to a particular problem is  useful and necessary. At present, however, he does not see the  constitutional arrangement as the most important and urgent  problem.    Further, the prime minister pointed out that the higher  territorial bodies "undoubtedly will cost something, and it will  not be little." Here, he added, one could ask whether the price  is worth the gain brought about by the establishment and  operation of these bodies. To a direct question concerning the  quality of the documentation submitted by Kalvoda's Office for  Legislature and Public Administration regarding the issue of the  constitutional arrangement reform, Klaus replied that this  document is a topic for discussion in the government, but he  added that the document does not deal with the problem of  financing the establishment of the higher administrative bodies.  "Some people see only the advantages of the administrative  bodies, others are concerned precisely with the cost of their  establishment and operation. That is the basic conflict," the  prime minister added. According to him, the questions of powers,  budget, financing, property relations between the territorial  bodies, and other points that are connected with the  administrative reform have not yet been solved. Nevertheless, he  himself does not reject the administrative reform, and the Civic  Democratic Party will not, according to him, block the emergence  of the higher bodies. In this context, he pointed out that the  government found a solution to the constitutional arrangement  problem, which was sent to the parliament just before the end of  last year in the form of draft principles for the constitutional  law on the establishment of higher autonomous territorial bodies  and a schedule for legislative measures toward the  implementation of the administrative reform. He also mentioned  individual deadlines for the implementation of the gradual steps  that would lead to the establishment of higher bodies. He  denied, however, that the coalition leaders agreed on some  specific date for the election to these bodies. Nevertheless, he  said that for many reasons it would not be desirable for the  elections to take place every year.    [Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 4 January on page 9 also  carries a report on Klaus's appearance on the television program  and adds: "Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus rejected on the  Czech Television program that part of President Vaclav Havel's  New Year's address that deals with the tasks of the Cabinet.  Klaus is convinced that his government is paying equal attention  to all important issues."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- North-east China's  Liaoning Province will launch a massive campaign to build new  reservoirs and river diversion works, in a bid to remove the  ever-worsening water shortages.    On top of the agenda are four huge reservoirs -- Guanyinge,  Dongfeng, Baishi and Yanwangbizi -- the first of which will be  able to hold 950 million cubic m of water, official sources here  said.    River water will also be diverted into Jinxi and Dalian, to  relieve the water shortages in the two major manufacturing  cities in the province.    Another diversion project is planned to start in 1998 to  supply 1.88 billion cubic m of water a year to the western part  of the province from the eastern.    As one of the Chinese provinces with the largest industry,  Liaoning's available water resources per person are only  one-third of the national average. Its industry is losing 10  billion yuan a year from water shortages, according to the  sources.    The province plans to invest as much as 11 billion yuan in  these projects, which will be completed by the year 2010.    To secure its water demands up to the year 2030, Liaoning  also plans to divert water from neighbouring Heilongjiang and  Jilin provinces, the sources said.</p>

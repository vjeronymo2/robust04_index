			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Benetton's ads not consistent with its values Sir, Your analysis of the controversy surrounding Benetton's Aids advertisement (Management: 'Shocking tone for united colours', January 30) overlooks the fundamental point. All of our research suggests that companies must look to corporate branding and to novel ways of communicating their image. Not only is there a hard core of 20-30 per cent of consumers across Europe who are what we would call 'ethical consumers' - who use non-product related criteria in making their purchasing decisions - but, at a time when there is a danger of the public becoming overloaded with information and confused, there is a need for strong brands to reassure consumers. In this respect, the trouble with the Benetton campaigns is not that they shock people, but that they are not consistent with Benetton's real brand values. As far as I know, Benetton has not done anything in its employment practices or in its dealings with suppliers to promote equal opportunity for women and racial minorities or to help people suffering from Aids. I would have no problem with companies such as Marks and Spencer or Shell 'shocking us' into changing our attitudes regarding staff welfare or the environment, if it were clear they were committed, in practical terms, to doing something about it. The Benetton campaigns seek to make statements about issues to which Benetton's own corporate policy appears to have little to offer. The brand image which it promotes appears false and inconsistent.

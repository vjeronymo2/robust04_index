			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mercedes takes stake in Ssangyong Motor MERCEDES-BENZ, the German carmaker which is part of the Daimler-Benz group, yesterday acquired a 5 per cent shareholding in Ssangyong Motor, South Korea's fifth biggest vehicle producer, with the formal signing of a contract in Seoul. Mercedes is the first European company to hold equity in a Korean automotive company. It has an option to increase its shareholding to 10 per cent by the end of 1996. Mercedes wants to strengthen its presence in Asia to counter regional market competition from Japan. Korea's other main vehicle companies already have foreign equity partners, including Hyundai Motor with Mitsubishi, and Kia Motors with Ford and Mazda. Daewoo Motor is co-operating with Honda after ending its joint venture with General Motors last month. Mercedes and Ssangyong have been co-operating since early last year when the German company agreed to provide technology for diesel engines and light commercial vehicles. Mercedes' proposed acquisition of Ssangyong equity, through the issue of new shares, was announced in September as part of a deal in which the German concern would provide technology for the manufacture of gasoline engines. Ssangyong now produces commercial vehicles and jeeps, but hopes to enter the passenger car sector as a result of its partnership with Mercedes. Ssangyong will begin producing trucks, using Mercedes technology, at its Songtan plant near Seoul in 1994 after completing a new engine plant at Changwon in southern Korea. It plans to expand the annual production capacity of the Songtan facility from 30,000 to 160,000 by 1996. It will export 15,000 of its trucks and vans to Europe, where they will be sold by Mercedes. Ssangyong, which had sales of Won401.7bn (Dollars 504.9bn) in 1991, wants to increase sales to Won1,700bn by 1996.</p>

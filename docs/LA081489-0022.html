			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FINAL INSTITUTE CHAMBER MUSIC CONCERT AT SCHOENBERG  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute closed its series of free chamber music  concerts Friday. Vigorous performances of varied repertory and a star turn by  Institute director and cellist Lynn Harrell cheered a large audience at  Schoenberg Hall, UCLA.  </P> <P> The program began with the nervous acerbities of Lutoslawksi's String Quartet,  as coached by the composer, who had been in residence at the Institute.  Violinists Ashley Horne and Carolyn Huebl, violist Kirsten Monke and cellist  Trina Carey set forth both its attenuated insinuations and its jack-hammer  violence with purpose and elan.  </P> <P> Claude Frank, scheduled to take the piano part in Beethoven's Triple Concerto  with the Institute Orchestra at Hollywood Bowl Sunday, was featured in  Schumann's Quintet in E-flat, with violinists Josefina Vergara and Susan  Hytken, violist Caroline Coade and cellist Jonas Krejci.  </P> <P> Frank offered blocky, brassy, intermittently inaccurate extroversion in the  first movement, and then turned abruptly into an eminently supportive  team-player. The strings played well as a unit, balancing the work nicely in  sound and spirit.  </P> <P> Frank also backed Harrell in a prefatory Schumann indulgence: a suitably  yearning account of "Traumerei" in transcription.  </P> <P> The Suite for Brass Quintet by Vern Reynolds traces an overlong neo-Classic  course, clearly delineated and deftly scored. It received a bright, technically  resourceful and thoroughly musical performance from Timothy Divers and Chad  Foster, trumpets; Barbara Adamcik, horn; Jonathan Willis, trombone, and Douglas  Tornquist, tuba.JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Short Bros inclusion for year boosts Bombardier BOMBARDIER, the aerospace group which owns Short Brothers of Belfast and Learjet in the US, unveiled profit in line with analysts' estimates for fiscal 1991. Sales were up 35 per cent. For the 12 months ended January 31, net profit was CDollars 100.1m (USDollars 86m), or CDollars 1.41 a share, up from CDollars 91.5m, or CDollars 1.36, in fiscal 1990. Sales were CDollars 2.83bn against CDollars 2.1bn. Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 33.3m, or 46 cents a share, against CDollars 30.3m, or 45 cents, a year earlier, but sales were down to CDollars 802m against CDollars 837m. The gain in 1991 sales was due to inclusion of Short Bros and ANF Industrie for the full year, against only four months in fiscal 1990. Fourth-quarter sales were pulled down by problems in the business jet market. The recession and higher loan losses hit CT Financial Services, the biggest unit of Imasco, in the first quarter. Profit was CDollars 52.6m, or 42 cents a share, down from CDollars 59.9m, or 49 cents, a year earlier. CT Financial operates Canada Trustco, one of the country's two biggest trust companies. Sears Canada had a first-quarter loss of CDollars 25.8m, or 31 cents a share, against a loss of 12 cents a share in the same period a year earlier. Sales dipped 10 per cent to CDollars 817m, mainly because of the recession and tax changes.</p>

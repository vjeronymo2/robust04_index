Of course, the  main questions concerned the situation in Abkhazia.    [Ivlev] Today, Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr  Chikvaidze, who is in Moscow, said in regard to the events in  Kondor Gorge that they are the result of the Abkhazian side  shooting at civilians with Grad installations. Intercepted  radio communications talk of a large concentration of Abkhazian  military formations near Sukhumi. Supporters of the late  ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia are ready to join them.  Aleksandr Chikvaidze spoke tersely about the aims of these  military preparations by Abkhazia:    [Chikvaidze] They are getting ready to start an attack on  Mingrelia.    [Ivlev] However, at the news conference questions were asked  not only by representatives of the mass media. Among those  present, journalists were surprised to see Former Georgian  Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani. In an exclusive interview for  NTV he gave his forecast. If no peaceful solution to the  conflict is found, then just like the Soviet Union was able to  somehow be victorious over Germany during the Second World War,  so Georgia will in a fatal struggle conquer the Abkhazians, he  said.    [Kitovani] But at present more important goals will be  observed. In my opinion if a sensible, intelligent military  chief is found, then other things will probably happen in  Georgia.    [Ivlev] In reply to the question of whether a major war  could  break out, Tengiz Kitovani answered:    [Kitovani] This depends on the weather, both political and  also how quickly the snow melts.

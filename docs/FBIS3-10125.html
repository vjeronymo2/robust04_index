			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Honduran Central Bank President Daniel  Figueroa has announced that the legal reserve, the highest in  Central America, has been reduced from 36 to 34 percent for the  banking system and from 17 to 15 percent for savings and loan  associations. This reduction will release approximately $15.1  million into the system and lead to lower interest rates.  Figueroa said the government intends to keep lowering the legal  reserve down to between 20 and 25 percent to make it  competitive. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0119 GMT 18 Feb 94)</p>

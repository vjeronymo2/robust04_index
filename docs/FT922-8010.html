			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: GPA On the face of it, a multiple of 9.8 to 11.9 times historic earnings - well below the UK market average - looks a meagre valuation for a company with GPA's track record and global ambition. In view of the unusually public brouhaha over the offer price, it raises the question of whether investors are ending up with a bargain. Certainly GPA has had to counter an image problem from the start, not least because of unpleasant comparisons with the ill-fated business of computer leasing. Under UK and Irish accounting rules, to be sure, the company takes the profit on its aircraft sales up front notwithstanding any liability to meet lease payments if an airline customer goes bust. A depreciation policy of 25 years with a 15 per cent residual value, moreover, is a bit racy by some people's standards. That said, something pretty bizarre would have to happen for GPA's assets to end up as technologically obsolete as Atlantic's computers. The second-hand market for the sort of aircraft in GPA's predominantly modern fleet looks reasonably stable, and the manufacturers have a strong vested interest in keeping it that way. Given the one year lock-in provisions for existing shareholders and the company's prediction yesterday that a pick-up in leasing rates may still be 18 months away, some may be tempted to wait and pick up shares in the after-market. But this may be the kind of recovery story which stock markets like to climb aboard good and early.</p>

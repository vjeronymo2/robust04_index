They said the teachers of the  sole Moldovan school in the city are harassed and threatened to  be fired if they do not comply with orders of Dniester  authorities to use Cyrillic script. Pupils' parents decided to  protest by not letting their children attend the school  beginning with 7 February. Their initiative is supported by the  parents of pupils attending the two Moldovan schools in Tiraspol  and Tighina (Bender). With the emergency state decreed by Igor  Smirnov, Moldovans have no right in Dniester to protest against  the imposed Cyrillic script and the aggravated economic crisis,  caused by the Tiraspol leaders' refusal to use Moldovan national  currency. They also cannot protest against Smirnov's decree  according to which all state employees are compelled to adopt  until 15 February Dniestrian citizenship. In their opinion,  measures to stop the libertinism of Dniester's leaders should be  undertaken. President Snegur stated that for preserving  Moldova's integrity only political methods will be used and this  corresponds with CSCE Mission's recommendations. The president  requested Richard Samuel, new head of the CSCE Mission to  Moldova, to consider the complaints of Rabnita inhabitants.  Richard Samuel talked to representatives of Rabnita soon after  their meeting with Snegur, states the Presidential Press Service.</p>

It is obvious that this blockade, which has been continuing  for several years, is not aimed only at inflicting losses on the  national economy and increasing the difficulties arising from  the Gulf war, but also undermining national dignity and  inflicting political harm on a country that has always been an  element of stability and moderation in the region.    Had the naval siege of the port of al-'Aqabah been the  result  of the Gulf war, not only Jordan-bound ships would have been  searched to the exclusion of other countries in the region. No  such arbitrary inspection is carried out in any of the ports of  other states which have not attached great importance to the  Iraq-related sanctions resolutions.    Moreover, inspecting more than 1,700 ships bound for  al-'Aqabah during the last few years without detecting any  violation of the blockade or its causes should have caused an  end to such a naval farce if the blockade of al-'Aqabah was  really linked to the issue of the embargo imposed on Iraq.    Accordingly, it has long been clear to us that those  besieging the Port of al-'Aqabah are aiming at something else.  They are trying to dictate to us policies and positions that  neither agree with our national and pan-Arab considerations nor  conform with our priorities and concepts of the developments of  the current peace process in the Middle East.    Hence, the position His Majesty King Husayn expressed to the  ambassadors of the permanent member states of the Security  Council was starkly clear in projecting the fact that this  blockade and these harassments undermine the historic role  Jordan has always played in its capacity as a principal element  of moderation in a region that suffered and continues to suffer  from successive waves of extremism.    Given such a situation, Jordan, which counted much on quiet  diplomacy to end the siege imposed on its only port, cannot and  will not play its vital role in making peace before this totally  unacceptable situation has been promptly addressed in a manner  that respects the Jordanian will and refrains from doing  anything that harms it.</p>

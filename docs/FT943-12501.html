			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vocational training needs to perform a giant leap Sir, Your article ('Staying on can mean missing out', July 20) gives a timely reminder to young people to take a long-term view of what they can do when they leave school at 16. In a society which is biased towards the immediate, and with a government opposed to planning, there is little example to follow and the modern apprenticeship is seen by many as yet another small step for training when clearly a giant leap is called for. The lack of demand you highlight is matched by surplus supply - technical colleges mothball or eliminate potential training provision in construction and engineering. While the government vehemently denies a stop-go policy in the economy, you supply clear evidence of it in an area which is crucial to long-term consistent growth. The twin-track approach does not work. We are not Germany. We do not have parity of esteem between the academic and vocational routes, and until we do we will always have an under-achieving, under-resourced, Division Two, which attracts few and is dismissed by many.

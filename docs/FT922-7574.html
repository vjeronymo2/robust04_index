			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Hands-on experience for adviser Lance Anisfeld, one of Peter Lilley's special advisers at the Department of Trade and Industry, has decided to try his hand at making money in the real world rather than follow his boss to the Department of Social Security. 'At the DTI you are mixing with business leaders but at the DSS you are having to spend your time with the poverty lobby,' says the 30-year old Anisfeld. Conscious that Lilley often taunted his Labour rivals that 'none of them had ever spent a day in industry in their lives', Anisfeld has decided to get some hands-on experience. He has been appointed joint managing partner of East8, a small firm of property advisers specialising in Eastern Europe and founded by Philip Hudson, a 32-year-old architect. Anisfeld, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse, was first spotted by Madsen Pirie, president of the free-market Adam Smith Institute and the man credited with writing the nasty bits in prime minister John Major's speeches. A former president of the Cambridge Union, where he is remembered more for his yellow dinner jacket than his libertarian views, Anisfeld had worked in PW's privatisation group under Howard Hyman. At the DTI he concentrated on trade matters. Anisfeld contributed to East8's guide to Real Estate Development in Eastern Europe, and the firm is advising the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on its first real estate project in Europe - the National Bank of Poland's 800,000 sq ft banking centre in Warsaw which is being constructed in conjunction with US developers.</p>

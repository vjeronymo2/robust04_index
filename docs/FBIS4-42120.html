			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  repeated Greece's desire to improve its relations with Albania  and stressed that this improvement inevitably depends on respect  for the rights of the Greeks of Albania. Venizelos stressed:  We have legal political and diplomatic means at our disposal  which we will use if we find ourselves in a position to do so.  The international community and Albanian Government know very  well what these means are, he said.    The spokesman made the above statement when he was asked by  correspondents in Thessaloniki to clarify Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's statement made on Mega Channel to the effect that  there are other measures our country can take if the Albanian  side continues with the same stance.</p>

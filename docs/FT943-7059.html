			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Purchases help EFT show 41% upturn EFT Group, the Glasgow-based asset finance company, increased pre-tax profits by 41 per cent from Pounds 881,000 to Pounds 1.24m in the first half of 1994, on revenue up 17 per cent from Pounds 3.66m to Pounds 4.28m. Operating profits, before movements in bad debt provisions, increased 26 per cent at Pounds 1.29m. Better-than-expected contributions from acquisitions and a substantial rise in non-interest income from asset finance offset the effect of tighter lending margins on new business. New business volumes totalled Pounds 21m, up 13 per cent. Net outstanding receivables rose 9 per cent to Pounds 58.3m. In June, EFT raised Pounds 2.56m via a placing and open offer, having agreed Pounds 13.5m in extra banking facilities. Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said the two measures had substantially increased available funding and would allow the business to grow for the foreseeable future. The group was benefiting from the improved economic background and trading since the first half. He was confident of a very good result for the year as a whole. In the second half EFT expects to benefit from its 60 per cent share of a bonus paid to Mr Peter Stevenson, its former executive chairman who became chairman of Mackays Stores in 1990. Last year EFT rejected an offer to buy out the bonus, payable in 1994 and 1995, for Pounds 650,000. Earnings per share this time rose 44 per cent to 2.57p (1.79p). The interim dividend is increased to 0.525p (0.46p).</p>

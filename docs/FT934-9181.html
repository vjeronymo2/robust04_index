			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report White SUGAR futures had another active day after Tuesday's dramatic slump and steadied. By late afternoon in London the near December price had edged up Dollars 0.80 to Dollars 280 a tonne. However, dealers were still unconvinced about a sharp recovery being on the way. 'People will want to wait a while and lick their wounds before coming back in. The market really needs the power of the funds to pick it back up again and for that we need a strong technical signal,' one dealer said. The London Metal Exchange formally put an end to the recent COPPER squeeze controversy by rescinding the Dollars 5 a day limit on the backwardation (premium over the future price for metal for immediate delivery). Traders said the move had no impact in the market yesterday. 'The LME wanted to make sure the long had liquidated his position,' one said. 'Over the last few days the position has been further wound down to a level that causes no concern now,' he added. ALUMINIUM was firmer, helped by a 9,000-tonne fall in September International Primary Aluminium Institute producer stocks, and three-month prices closed at Dollars 1,062.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.75.

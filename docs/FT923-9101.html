			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / People: Departures LEP Group confirmed the retirement of its chairman Peter Grant and of William Berkeley alongside its restructuring proposals announced this week. Philip Hampton is not standing for re-election as a non-executive director. This leaves only three directors: David James, newly appointed chairman and chief executive; John East, finance director, who has been on the board for nearly four years; and Michael Kirkman, who joined the board last summer as human resources director. LEP says two non-executive directors will be appointed once the restructuring is completed. ***** Geoffrey Browne has retired from SUN ALLIANCE. ***** Alan Marsh has retired from HEWETSON. ***** Mark Billing has resigned from YOUGHAL CARPETS.</p>

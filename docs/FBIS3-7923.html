			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 2 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems and  Croats and Croatia signed an accord late on Tuesday [1 March] on  forming a federation of the two Bosnian nations and its  confederation with neighbouring Croatia. After four days of  intensive talks in Washington, held under strong U.S. diplomatic  pressure, especially on Croatia, the accord was signed by  Foreign Minister Mate Granic for Croatia, Premier Haris  Silajdzic for Bosnian Moslems and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir  Zubak for the Croats, in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.    Some questions, notably those in the military sphere, have  been left open and are shortly to be put on the agenda.    The former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina is being  torn apart by a civil and ethnic war which broke out nearby two  years ago among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats.    The accord guarantees repatriation and restoration of  property to all refugees and displaced persons.    The agreement between the Moslems and Croats envisages for a  federation of cantons, to be formed on the principle of ethnic  majority in individual regions. The document, the contents of  which have not been disclosed, provides for equal rights of the  Moslem and Croat cantons which should have their own police  force and pursue an independent policy in education, culture,  housing, (?public) works and radio and television.    The accord envisages for a central government which should  regulate the foreign, defence and foreign trade policies. The  president and vice-president of the federation should be elected  by a bicameral parliament, with the posts rotated between the  nationalities annually.    Apart from setting up a Moslem-Croat federation, the accord  envisages for the new state's confederation with Croatia. It  defines March 15 as the deadline for formulating a draft  constitution of the new state and the modalities of its  confederation with Croatia.    After the signing ceremony, Christopher said that the United  States and the Western allies would make every effort for the  accord to be implemented in practice and promised to assist  Bosnian reconstruction financially.    Moslem Premier Silajdzic said he was "hoping and praying"  this was the first step in the direction of peace and that the  United States would remain actively involved in the peace  process in the future.    The U.S. Administration hopes as the next stage to put  pressure on Bosnian Serbs to join the new bilateral federation,  although government circles are less than optimistic as to the  chances of this.    Washington hopes that the concept of a dual state would make  it possible for the Moslems to retain, at least partially, the  integrity of Bosnia, enlarge the territory under their control,  give them access to the sea and create a strong negotiating  (and, possibly military) bloc against the Serbs in the next  stage.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mustafa Kurtovic report from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] [words indistinct] a large concentration of their  hordes in several regions on the territory of the Gorazde  commune, and particularly in Ustipraca, Kozara, and (Mesici),  the Serbian-Montenegrin fascists have this afternoon launched a  fierce artillery and infantry attack on all the defense lines  and the town itself. The aggressor is intending to launch a  massive onslaught from the direction of Ustipraca at the Gorazde  defenders at (Borovik). With combined tank and infantry attacks  with artillery support from (Vojkovici), the enemy is trying to  capture the strategic points on this part of the free territory.  According to all the information available, this would be the  starting point for the chetniks to break through -- from the  direction of Ustiprcaca -- the defense lines at the very access  point to Gorazde.    We also have information that the aggressor used chemical  agents in the attacks on the defense lines. The aggressor has  also used artillery to fire on convoys of refugees fleeing the  burnt villages that the aggressor has captured in the offensive  so far. We do not yet have information on the possible  massacres of refugees heading for the town. The situation in  Gorazde is extremely dramatic.    Throughout the day the chetniks from the surrounding hills,  from the right bank of the Drina River, fired with snipers,  M-84s, and 82-mm mortars at the area of (Vitkovici), and from  (Lug) the chetniks [words indistinct]. Many civilians have been  killed and wounded. According to the latest intelligence  information, the Serbian-Montenegrin fascists are carrying out  extensive preparations for an even more intensive offensive on  the free territory on the left bank of the Drina River. The  full force of this offensive will be directed from the direction  of Foca and the valley of the Praca River at (Ostanica),  Orahovice, Bare, Jabucko Sedlo, (Trogrlo), and Ustipraca. The  commanders of the latest chetnik offensive have been hurriedly  bringing in new mercenaries, cutthroats, and other scum to this  region.</p>

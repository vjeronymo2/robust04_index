			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Drugs industry expects to escape lightly US DRUGS companies face a significant slowdown in earnings growth if President Bill Clinton's draft healthcare proposals are implemented. Growth in average earnings per share of nine of the top 10 US drugs companies will fall in 1996 to 6.6 per cent, from a previously expected 8.4 per cent, according to Salomon Brothers, the New York-based brokers. Its study excludes Marion Merrell Dow, whose earnings are expected to fall 27 per cent even without the reforms. The industry as a whole, however, sees the proposed health package as not as bad as it could have been. Most importantly, there will be no direct controls on the price of either new or existing drugs, a measure that was publicly contemplated at one stage by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton's healthcare taskforce. The administration appears willing to give the sector an opportunity to regulate itself. Nevertheless, Mr Clinton is expected to propose the creation of a board to look into the issue of new drugs pricing. The package is also expected to contain powers for the health secretary to be given the right to exclude from Medicare, the state programme for the elderly, medicines whose prices were deemed excessive. The proposals also include the government paying a proportion of out-patient drugs for the elderly under the Medicare system. Salomon Brothers estimates this will cost Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.67bn) over five years. To pay for these benefits Mr Clinton is proposing the introduction of 15 per cent rebates on Medicare drugs. These would be implemented by July 1 1996. Medicaid rebates for the poor already cost the sector Dollars 1.2bn a year, and the Medicare rebates could amount to Dollars 2.5bn by 1996, according to Salomon Brothers. If the rebates are implemented, Salomon Brothers estimates Merck's earnings per share in 1996 would increase 9.5 per cent (instead of 12.4 per cent), Bristol-Myers Squibb's 4 per cent (5.3 per cent), Pfizer's 14.1 per cent (15.6 per cent), Eli Lilly's 4.2 per cent (6.3 per cent), American Home Products' 6.4 per cent (8.2 per cent), Schering'Plough's 13.2 per cent (15.2 per cent), Syntex's 0.2 per cent (3.7 per cent), and Warner Lambert's 9.5 per cent (10.5 per cent). Upjohn's fall in earnings growth would be 2.1 per cent instead of 1.4 per cent, while Marion Merrell Dow's would be 29 per cent (27.4 per cent).</p>

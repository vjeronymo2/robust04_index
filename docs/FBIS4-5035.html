Evan Williams reports from  Bangkok that the body will boost relations by providing a formal  network for trade and foreign ministries:    [Begin Williams recording] Launching the second leg of his  Asian tour, Paul Keating meets his Thai counterpart Chuan  Likphai today before addressing a business lunch and having an  audience with the king. A new joint economic commission will be  set up, and Thailand wants Australia to play a more active role  in coordinating the future of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation].    Tomorrow, Mr. Keating will help open the Australian-funded  bridge to Laos in a ceremony chaired by the Thai king.

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The report on El  Salvador presented by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  to the Security Council is not consistent with the national  reality, Alfredo Cristiani, president of that Central American  country, said today.    On 28 March Ghali presented a report to the UN Security  Council concerning the development of the peace accords in El  Salvador. He emphasized the government's failure to comply with  several points of the Chapultepec Pact, signed in Mexico City in  January 1992. Ghali indicated in his report that "it was  necessary to adopt urgent measures so that the peace process can  get back on track" and to "demand" that the Salvadoran  Government comply with all the peace accords.    "The truth is that we are surprised because the reply  implies  that the government lacks the political will to comply with the  accords, and this is not true," Cristiani said. He said Ghali's  report does not explain to the Security Council all the reasons  that have prevented compliance with important aspects of the  agreements, and this has nothing to do with a lack of will.    The report says constitutional reforms have yet to be  endorsed in the judicial branch and that there are delays in the  distribution of land among former fighters, the National  Civilian Police's deployment, and the former National Police's  dismantling. Cristiani said: In the case of the constitutional  reforms, the decision is up to the legislative branch rather  than the executive branch, and "the (?government) is not  responsible for this."    He said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)  is also responsible for the lack of compliance with the peace  accords, particularly with regard to the distribution of land  among former fighters. Cristiani accused the FMLN of refusing  to participate in a high-level meeting to "leave the new  government with a clean slate concerning the accords."    He called into question the fact that no one had waited for  the report from Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, former chief of the  [words indistinct] mission, who handed over his post on 31 March  and whose analysis of the peace process is "more in accordance  with the country's reality."    According to Cristiani, the report presented to the UN  Security Council was prepared based on information delivered by  the UN secretary general's adviser, Alvaro de Soto, who made "a  quick visit to the country."    The Salvadoran president announced his government will send  a  written reply to Ghali next week, debating his report point by  point. It will also send a copy to the Security Council. "The  time to answer has come because it seems the government does not  want to comply," Cristiani said, who noted that the official  document would be released soon.</p>

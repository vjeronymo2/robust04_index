			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains 20,000 level for first time in four days Buying by public funds and investment trusts supported share prices, and the Nikkei 225 average closed above the technically important 20,000 level for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally up 128.83 at 20,046.11 after a low for the day of 19,826.37 in the morning session and a high of 20,097.02 in the afternoon. Volume picked up to 339m shares from Monday's 192m, but most overseas investors and domestic institutions remained on the sidelines due to the lack of fresh incentives. However, corporate fund managers stepped up profit-taking to boost their earnings ahead of the September book closing, while buying by public funds and arbitrageurs countered the rise in stock sales. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.34 at 1,592.51 and the Nikkei 300 added 1.72 at 290.76, but declines led rises by 531 to 440, with 201 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.19 to 1,300.56. In spite of the rise in share prices, traders said underlying investor confidence remained sluggish. Japan Telecom, regarded as the recent benchmark for market sentiment, declined Y70,000 to a new low of Y4.2m. The company has been a casualty of oversupply fears since its listing on the second section last week. DDI, another telecommunications stock on the second section, fell Y14,000 to Y884,000, while East Japan Railway, a leading shareholder of Japan Telecom, lost Y3,000 at Y500,000. But Nippon Telegraph and Telephone finished Y4,000 ahead at Y888,000 on buying by public funds after sliding to a low of Y879,000 during the day. Mitsui Trust and Banking advanced Y30 to Y1,080 on reports that it had started to clear its balance sheet. Other trust banks were also higher, Mitsubishi Trust adding Y40 at Y1,430 and Sumitomo Trust Y50 at Y1,380. Tsumura, a pharmaceutical company, retreated by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,170 on selling by individual investors. Reports of in-house squabbling among executives discouraged investors. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 22.47 to 22,250.59 in volume of 109.6m shares. Rohm, the semiconductor device maker, gained Y60 at Y4,320 for the second consecutive day. Roundup Trading in some of the Pacific Rim markets was restrained ahead of yesterday's key US inflation data. SEOUL turned back from an intraday high for the year as active selling of an estimated Won40bn of shares by a state-run fund wiped out most of the early gains. The composite index ended 0.32 easier on balance at 995.38, after touching a year's peak of 1,006.21. Brokers said the government wanted the index to remain below the 1,000 mark ahead of the Chusok full-moon holidays next week amid worries that a sharp rise in stock prices could provoke discontent among farmers, who have criticised government policies favouring city dwellers. Primary blue chips remained strong in spite of selling by the stock stabilisation fund. Volume totalled 41.1m shares, compared with Monday's 36.2m. HONG KONG picked itself up after the previous day's steep fall but the mood was cautious ahead of yesterday's US inflation data on worries that higher short-term US interest rates would feed through to local rates. The Hang Seng index ended 46.64 higher at 9,937.01, pushed up largely by selected blue chips, in turnover that shrank to HKDollars 3.7bn from Monday's HKDollars 5.19bn. H shares, which were sold off sharply on Monday, bounced back on Japanese buying. The H-share index of China-incorporated issues rose 40.47, or 2.8 per cent, to 1,471.89. Tianjin Bohai was the most active H share, up 12 cents at HKDollars 1.50, followed by Yizheng Chemical Fibre, 19 cents ahead at HKDollars 3.13. BOMBAY edged back from Monday's record peak, the BSE 30 index giving up 29.15 at 4,599.42 after testing a new high during the day of 4,628.93. Among the day's gains, Raymond Woollen Mills rose Rs37.50 to Rs400 on expectations of better half-yearly results. SINGAPORE saw a technical rebound as Malaysian speculative shares traded over the counter ignored Wall Street's weak overnight performance. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 19.27 higher at 2,299.66 after a day's peak of 2,310.30. KUALA LUMPUR traded in a tight range, the composite index finishing just 0.06 firmer at 1,169.11 in volume of 401m shares. Sateras Resources moved forward 20 cents to MDollars 3.40 on rumours that a politically linked group was buying a stake in the company. BANGKOK saw a rally in blue chips during the afternoon which brokers said was a technical rebound. The SET index added 17.32, or 1.16 per cent, at 1,507.73 in Bt7.1bn turnover. Siam City Bank topped the actives list and moved ahead Bt1 to Bt31. TAIPEI retreated as investors were seen moving out of industrial stocks, particularly in the plastics and petrochemicals sectors. The weighted index shed 12.46 to 6,955.02 in thin turnover of TDollars 56.87bn. Tung Ho Steel saw heavy profit-taking, ending 7 per cent down at TDollars 42.80 in spite of announcing a successful issue of global depositary receipts. Elsewhere, Hwa Nan Bank rose TDollars 4 to TDollars 215, First Commercial advanced TDollars 3 to TDollars 182 and Chang Hwa Bank gained TDollars 1 at TDollars 193 in late trade. MANILA recovered from Monday's fall on late buying and the composite index finished 33.9 higher at 2,953.24. Turnover came to 2.3bn pesos in volume of 3.2bn shares. Oil refiner Petron was the day's most active stock, although it closed unchanged at 23.50 pesos. PLDT again led the advances, rising 2.2 per cent to 1,580 pesos, while Meralco 'A' moved ahead 2.50 pesos to 285 pesos and the 'B' stock climbed 1.4 per cent to 367.50 pesos. SYDNEY was helped higher by Commonwealth Bank announcing an increase in profits. The All Ordinaries index closed 10.7 ahead at 2,043.6 after touching 2,051.7. Commonwealth Bank ended a net 19 cents up at ADollars 7.69 after jumping 4 per cent within minutes of the profits announcement. Other banks mostly rose in sympathy: ANZ appreciated 8 cents to ADollars 3.93 in turnover of 5.74m shares and Westpac 4 cents to ADollars 4.35 but NAB slipped 6 cents to ADollars 10. Coles Myer, the retailer, improved 9 cents to ADollars 4.03 on the back of strong earnings. WELLINGTON was depressed by a fall in forest sector stocks, although Telecom was a steadying influence. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 17.28 to 2,093.80 after a 2.2 per cent decline on Monday. Fletcher Challenge dropped 11 cents to NZDollars 4.14.</p>

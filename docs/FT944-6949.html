			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Gardening: Blankets for the beds in winter - How to deal with semi-hardy plants This month has proved remarkably mild in the south of England and a hard winter still seems a distant possibility. The ceanothusis are back in bud; evergreen choisysas are having a second flowering; and, out of doors, the fuchsias have still stopped. It is strange to be picking small bunches of roses when the larch trees have finally turned into the countryside's last burst of yellow. But take no chances and believe no signs of kindness: mother nature can be cruel and I do not trust her to behave herself from this weekend onwards. Any misbehaviour is hurtful to gardeners because we are all growing more semi-hardy plants than we used to 20 years ago. They multiply easily for the many small nurseries which have arisen since 1985. They look clean and fresh in late spring - exactly what supermarket shoppers now expect from plants. And they transform gardening in pots and small urban spaces. Since 1981-1982, we have not had the sort of winter which makes us all swear, briefly, never again. In normal winters salvation can come in different forms. Here are the options (doing nothing is not one of them  - and doing everything is pointless). Perhaps the geraniums are still flowering, but you are very lucky because they ought to have died weeks ago. Most of next season's half-hardy plants for pots will be much better if they are grown afresh as newly-rooted cuttings in 1995. All of my personal favourites are better thrown away, except for one or two parent plants from which cutting should be taken early next year of young growth which is being brought on under slight heat. Plants such as verbena, heliotrope, pelargoniums and penstemons will flower less freely from their second year onwards. All you need to keep is a parent, or perhaps two, to cover yourself against disaster. The others might as well be thrown away. The only exceptions are plants grown for their leaves. Here, the lovely forms of scented geraniums are admirable companions during winter inside the house. Trim them slightly at the tips of their stems to stop them becoming straggly, but save as many as you like because they improve with age. So does the widely-grown Helichrysum petiolatum with its felted grey leaves. It is worth training one or two plants in a large pot where they can be clipped and trained into mounds of grey leaves on a framework of arched wire from one season to the next. Otherwise, the plants which you lift can be clipped hard - very hard if they are tender geraniums which will otherwise become too leggy. For safe storage, they do not only need a place where the temperature will not fall below freezing. They also need light and air. In this mild spell, the dangers have been mould and mildew, especially on anything which was lifted with flowers and leaves waiting to turn brown. Many of my soft plants begin the winter in a frost-proof shed, which is only frost-proof if the door is kept firmly shut. Closure encourages mildew, especially if you overwater. Remember to open the door on mild days and try not to water too often when your plants are only ticking over. Once every 10 days is usually quite enough. Perhaps this lifting sounds too energetic and you are short of storage. On the margins of hardiness, you have another option - leave the plants outside and wrap them in a suitable blanket. A mound of bracken used to be the best answer but the business has changed - even though though most of the gardening books do not acknowledge it. Instead of bracken and rotted leaves, we can all use artificial blankets. The best of them allow water to seep through, avoiding the dryness which bracken usually causes. They take the edge off cold wind and mitigate the sharpness of an average frost. After three year's experimenting, I now swear by them and reckon that we all have more to learn about their possibilities. To the trade, they are known as crop covers and are most familiar when protecting early vegetables and seedlings. Garden centres now sell the lighter grades of blanket in small pieces for gardeners with a plant or two to be protected. These fibres and fleeces are helpful, but they are not as heavy as I would like for serious defence of big shrubs and soft summer-flowering plants. This year I am following up my researches at the summer flower shows and opting for the Envirofleece made by Agralan. Their blankets are heavyweights on wide rolls and trade discounts should apply to those of you who need 100m lengths at a time. Two new weights in this brand are the Agralan Envirofleece 30 which is a medium grade for small shrubs, half-hardy border plants and things such as salvias throughout the winter, and the Envirofleece 60, a heavier grade for large shrubs and climbers. Both these fleeces are made from polypropylene and are easily pinned round and in front of the plants whose hardiness causes you most worry. But why bother, when a really heavy frost will have its way regardless? From my experiments in recent winters, I have found that it is worth the modest expense and effort. In generally mild winters there have been a few short sharp shocks sufficient to knock out unprotected marginals such as Hebe hulkeana, the taller daisy-flowered osteospermums and the tender forms of salvia and diascia. Those which I wrapped in lightweight fibre-blankets had survived when I unwrapped them in April. Their unsheltered neighbours were stone dead, as usual. No doubt a really ferocious winter will go through your Envirofleece and be as lethal as ever, but these gentler seasons have certainly been abated by these new protections. The trouble is that most of them come in an intrusive shade of fleecy white which then turns dirty grey like a sheep in a wet November. Agralan have introduced a pale green medium fleece which takes the edge off the eyesore and is adequate for smaller shrubs. By lifting a few parents and blanketing the best of the rest, it should be possible to avoid the casualties which disfigured gardens in the 1970s and 1980s. Every pest is quick to outwit the latest predator and no doubt, mother nature will hit us with a really hard one just when I think that I have blanketed her out. Until she does, fleece the plants at risk during the next few weekends; peg the blankets down or weight them into place with stones before the winter fleeces the plants from you instead.

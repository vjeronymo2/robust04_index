			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Telecommunications: `Trans Europe </F> Line' now in Service"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS  Database]    [Text] The first section of the "Trans Europe Line," a vast  project launched by German giant Deutsche Telekom to link  Frankfurt with the main urban centres of East Europe and the  Balkans by means of an optical-fiber cable network, was brought  into service on January 13. This first section links Frankfurt,  Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest, as well as branching  into Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. Some 3,700 km of cable have  been laid, and the final project is expected to cover 14,000 km  in all.    Trans Europe Line (TEL) is likely to eventually reach as far  as Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Moldavia,  and talks are currently in progress on a possible extension to  Moscow and to Helsinki, according to Deutsche Telekom Director  Gerd Tenzer. Around DM700 million is being invested in the  project, the consortium for which includes 14 telecommunications  companies.    Deutsche Telekom first floated the idea of a trans-European  cable network in 1990. The various West European telecom  companies, such as BT, France Telecom and Belgacom which are  involved are not equity partners in the project, but will be  buying transmission capacity on the network to cover their  needs. "Germany sees itself as the hub of East-West  communications in Europe," declared Mr. Tenzer, and explained  that there was a need in East Europe for 60 million telephone  connections, representing investment totalling US$150 billion.    The Deutsche Telekom spokesman also explained that TEL is  not  a German foreign investment set-up, but that each country was  financing infrastructure work on its own territory by means of  bank loans or partnership agreements. Deutsche Telekom, on the  strength of its wide experience in modernising the former East  German networks, is offering its know-how, but will be entitled  to transmission rights only for the cable actually laid under  German soil. Mr. Tenzer stressed that existing cable systems  running into East Europe are completely outdated.    Apart from TEL, Deutsche Telekom is also working on some 30  other projects to develop communications sytems in East European  countries and is currently in talks with the Russian company  Rosttelecom on construction of a digital system to link 50  Russian cities with some 50,000 km of fiber optic cable.</p>

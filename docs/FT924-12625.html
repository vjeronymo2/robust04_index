			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Pay offered by headhunters falls SALARIES for people being headhunted for senior positions in industry are falling, in a development that underlines the impact of the recession. According to InterExec, a jobs-market consultancy, the average salary for jobs for which headhunters were seeking UK-based candidates fell by about 2 per cent in both the second and third quarters of this year, compared with the comparable periods last year. InterExec also reported that vacancies which headhunters were trying to fill were down 10 per cent in the third quarter, compared with the equivalent period last year. The findings mark the first time since InterExec started collating figures four years ago that it has recorded a year-on-year drop for salaries for jobs at director level. InterExec's figures illustrate the slack demand for senior executives as companies reduce their recruitment efforts because of the international economic slowdown. Another factor is widespread job shedding in top layers of industry, which has increased the numbers of unemployed executives and depressed the degree to which they can bid for higher salaries in a new job. InterExec specialises in finding jobs for out-of-work managers through linking up with headhunters. It reckons its figures cover between a third and a half of all vacancies for senior jobs for which employers are seeking UK-based candidates. The company said that the average salary on offer to people being headhunted was Pounds 50,272 in the third quarter. That was a drop of 2 per cent from the Pounds 51,273 recorded a year before. The year-on-year drop in salary in the second quarter was of the same order, at 2.5 per cent. In the first quarter there was a 2.5 per cent rise in salaries compared with the same period last year. InterExec says that in the third quarter headhunters were trying to find candidates for 1,581 positions either in Britain or overseas. That compares with 1,757 positions in the third quarter of last year, a 10 per cent drop. The new figures from InterExec highlight a big reduction in efforts by overseas-based companies to find UK managers for positions outside Britain, based on headhunting methods. In the third quarter, InterExec found out about 217 vacancies for overseas jobs, 15 per cent down on the figure of 255 in the same period last year. Taking into account only UK-based posts, 1,364 vacancies were reported in the third quarter compared with 1,502 in the July-September period last year, a fall of 9.2 per cent. InterExec reported earlier that between the second quarters of last year and this year UK vacancies fell 12 per cent.</p>

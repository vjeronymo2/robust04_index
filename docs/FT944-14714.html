			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad incurs larger than expected Pounds 20m loss Amstrad yesterday announced larger than expected annual pre-tax losses of Pounds 19.9m, blaming stock write-downs, rationalisation costs and operating losses in its mature consumer electronics business. Commenting on the results, Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, said market conditions throughout Europe in the consumer electronics industry 'remain depressed', resulting in margin pressure and reduced sales. The loss for the 12 months to June 30 - Amstrad's third consecutive annual deficit - was struck after exceptional stock write-downs of Pounds 6.9m and further European rationalisation costs of Pounds 4m mainly to cover redundancies. Analysts had been expecting losses of up to Pounds 5m and the shares were marked sharply lower in the immediate wake of the announcement. However, they subsequently recovered to close down 1 3/4 p at 25 1/4 p after Mr Sugar and Mr David Rogers, the new chief executive, outlined a new strategy for the group which will be divided into a number of 'autonomous' business units reporting to Mr Rogers. Under Amstrad's new strategy, the traditional consumer electronics business, dubbed Amstrad Consumer Electronics, will become one of the new units. Ace is expected to be subdivided into two businesses, a low margin/high volume trading company which will continue to sell mature consumer electronics products, and a development company charged with spotting market opportunities and designing new products. Other business units will include Dancall Radio, the cordless and cellular telephone manufacturer acquired in September, Viglen, the direct sales personal computer manufacturer which was purchased for about Pounds 60m in June, and Betacom, the publicly quoted telephone equipment group in which Amstrad has a 66 per cent stake. Mr Sugar said these investments and an ink-jet printer joint venture with IBM Jarfalla in Sweden 'leave me in a confident frame of mind that the company will turn the corner during the current financial year'. Sales fell almost 30 per cent to Pounds 217.1m (Pounds 308.5m) as Amstrad reduced its activities in those consumer electronics product areas, 'where it was impossible to obtain even a modest margin'. In the previous year, it incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 20.5m after Pounds 33.5m reorganisation costs, including goodwill write-offs on its Spanish operations. At the operating level, the group reported a Pounds 15.5m loss in the latest period after a Pounds 1.84m contribution from acquisitions, compared to a Pounds 15m profit the previous year. Mr Sugar blamed the depressed state of the market and the high level of overheads carried by the consumer electronics business. The losses were partly offset by net interest receipts of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 7.21m). The cash pile fell from Pounds 167.1m to Pounds 137.7m, reflecting part-payment for Viglen. Losses per share narrowed to 3.2p (4p) and an unchanged final dividend of 0.3p is recommended, making an unchanged total of 0.5p. Amstrad, in which Mr Sugar retains a 36 per cent stake, also announced a proposed 1-for-5 share consolidation.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes stem fall in equities THE DRUG stocks suffered another bout of selling in London yesterday, but declines elsewhere in the equity market had been largely recovered by the close of business. The final loss of 6.4 points on the FT-SE 100 Index took in a fall of nearly 11 points from ex-dividend adjustments in leading shares. The stock market's attention swung back in the direction of interest rates after suggestions in the UK press at the weekend that Britain's building societies were considering raising interest rates, including mortgage charges, because of competition for savings deposits. Such a threat was seen as direct pressure on the UK government to deliver the cut in base rates expected by the City of London at Budget time, but discounted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. The outcome of the French elections also put European interest rates in the spotlight again. UK investors continue to look to the Bundesbank for a lead to lower rates, although there were doubts whether any move would be made when the bank's policy-making committee meets in Frankfurt this week. The new equity trading account opened with shares quickly under pressure as last week's losses in Wellcome and Glaxo were extended. The technical markdown prompted by ex-dividend quotations was soon joined by a sell-off in the stock index futures sector. The Footsie was soon down by nearly 20 points at 2,833, although outside the pharmaceuticals there was little selling pressure. It was the absence of any big selling transactions, as much as any other factor, which laid the basis for a steady recovery in the second half of the session. London was also buoyed by a good start on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial Average was 24 points up in UK hours, as it responded to improvements in the latest data on consumer spending and home sales. At the close, the fall in the FT-SE 100 Index had been cut to 6.4 at 2,846.5. Traders were a little nervous at seeing the 2,850 support level lost, but remained confident that the institutions would soon move into equities if the Footsie dipped to the 2,820 area. A more revealing picture of the day's trading came from Seaq volume of only 484.9m shares, compared with 734.9m on Friday. The paucity of institutional interest suggested that retail volume was low. Retail, or customer, business in equities was high all last week, and recorded a value total of Pounds 1.57bn on Friday. The market was also suffering some indigestion yesterday from last week's rights issues; 'a rights too far' was the wits' comment. For the immediate term, the institutions have committed most of their available cash and their trading books are still holding the rights shares taken aboard. A test of market confidence will come when two impending new issues reach the marketplace. Heavy institutional interest was reported yesterday in the placing and intermediary offer for Hambro Insurance Services. While most of the market lacked enthusiasm yesterday, properties remained firm as the signs of recovery in the sector continued to attract support. Retail issues, although traditionally influenced by interest rate hopes, remained close to pre-weekend levels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential  Council chairman, has stressed our country's concern to  implement the UN Security Council resolution on the situation in  Yemen. In this regard, he noted that our country has from the  very beginning announced that it will abide by UN Security  Council Resolution 924 which was issued on Wednesday [1 June].    In a telephone interview with Voice of America the day  before  yesterday, brother 'Abd-al-Ghani said the Republic of Yemen  regrets the position of certain Arab states toward the situation  in Yemen. He stressed that the statement issued at the  conclusion of the meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council  foreign ministers is considered an interference in Yemeni  internal affairs. 'Abd-al-Ghani praised the position adopted by  the fraternal State of Qatar rejecting this statement that  failed to mention the Yemeni unity, which was underlined by the  UN Security Council resolution.    In his interview with Voice of America, 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani strongly denied that the Yemeni Air Force planes  have raided Aden refinery. He said such refineries are the  property of the Yemeni people and the government cannot destroy  its own installations. He also stressed that the forces of  constitutional legitimacy are concerned not to attack any  position close to any vital installation in the country. He  stressed that the forces of constitutional legitimacy have  always taken care not to hit Salah-al-Din Camp, which is  adjacent to the refinery, despite the fact that devastating Scud  missiles -- which left behind innocent victims and material  damage in the civilian neighborhoods where they fell -- were  being fired from that camp. He underlined the secessionist  elements' responsibility in hitting the Aden refinery to create  among the Yemeni people in Aden some kind of bitterness.</p>

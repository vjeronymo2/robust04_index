			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Markets: A case of intrusion into private grief - The Election and You / London THE NOTICE went up on the Palace railings just before lunch. 'The stock market and the Conservative Party are discussing a separation with their respective psephologists. These discussions are not yet complete and nothing more will be said until they are.' The torrent of media speculation and the consequent slide in share prices are seen as 'especially undesirable' during a general election campaign. One insider said that 'the knives are out' on both sides, with harsh words being muttered in private. For most of their years together, the couple seemed ideally suited. They shared similar interests, such as lower income taxes and easier money. Both formed part of a boisterous 1980s crowd, fond of talking loudly into mobile phones in restaurants. In retrospect, the summer of 1987 marked the emotional peak in the relationship, as the chart shows. Yet, though the relationship has cooled, friends of the couple say that there is no other party exercising an unhealthy attraction. Some 2,000 or so photographs of the stock market lunching with a sober-suited Scotsman called John Smith were found by a cleaner last year, but it is understood that the relationship has never progressed beyond polite acquaintance. Some of the stock market's friends fear that a rift may be inevitable. 'Frankly, unless something pretty miraculous happens, it'll all be over by April 9,' said one. Others, however, hope for the best. 'I think it is early days,' said another friend: 'If you have a boil and it bursts it often gets all right afterwards.' For most of the week, the stock market has been coming to terms with the possibility of a non-Conservative government. The FT-SE index dropped 19.4 points during the week, closing at 2,456.6. Within that overall decline, shares which might benefit from a Labour government have done markedly better than those which might benefit if John Major stays in Downing Street. Privatised utilities, singled out for tighter regulation in the Labour party manifesto, have done particularly badly. The week's trends included a continuing tendency - rewarded by the stock market - to pay uncovered dividends. BAT Industries, for example, promised an 8 per cent rise in the final dividend, leaving dividend cover at 0.83, less than half the 2 the company says is its target. BAT shares rose 43p, to close the week at 686p. Another company following the same trend was George Wimpey, the contractor, which maintained its dividend despite losing money. Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, said he was encouraged by flickers of life in the British and American housing markets. Wimpey's UK house sales in the first 2 1/2 months of this year were running about 10 per cent higher than the company had budgeted for, he said. The shares rose 21p on the week, to close at 150p. Few other bosses were as positive about trading prospects. But the results season is producing noticeably better results than analysts had expected, at least for industrial companies. Warburg Securities' running total of how profits so far compare with what its analysts had expected at the end of January show earnings declines for industrials of 10 per cent, nearly two percentage points better than had been expected. Industrials dividends have grown at 8 per cent, a percentage point better than forecast. Still, the election campaign and a steady rise in long-term interest rates have left the market jumpy. Evidence of that mood can be seen in the performance of one of the week's big losers, Cable &amp; Wireless. A number of unremarkable pieces of news - the departure of a senior executive and the reorganisation of some of the company's activities - were a trigger for a small-scale sell-off. C&amp;W shares closed the week at 538p, down 62p. The market's reaction seemed to owe as much to a lingering uncertainty about whether Lord Young was taking the company in the right direction as to any specific concerns about the week's news. Stock market analysts were divided on the stock. A certain ambivalence was also noticeable in the analysts' reaction to the news that Midland Bank was about to be taken over by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Midland shares were unambiguous gainers - they closed on Friday at 343p, up 91p on the week. Shares in the Hongkong Bank dropped: they fell 11 per cent on the week, to the equivalent of 300p. So far, so predictable. The ambivalence came in the analysts' assessment of the impact of the takeover on other UK banks. Their shares rose, reflecting the short term vote of confidence in the sector implied by Hongkong Bank's reappearance as a suitor for Midland. But in the longer term, the deal would strengthen Midland as a competitor in a sector where there is already - from the shareholder's view at any rate - too much capital.</p>

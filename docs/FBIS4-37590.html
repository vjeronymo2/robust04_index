			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"]    [Text] The forces of the ruling military regime today  continued their desperate offensive attempts on all fronts,  particularly in the direction of Aden Governorate. These forces  also continued to shell, in a savage manner, residential  quarters on the approaches to the capital, Aden. Our valiant  Armed Forces confronted, and are still confronting with rare  heroism and great steadfastness, all attempts by the forces of  the ruling military regime to continue their defiance of the  will of Arab and international society. Battles are still  continuing between our defending forces and the forces of the  (?corrupt) dictatorial regime in Sanaa and its arrogant  adventurist head, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Observer: Research bonus Much mayhem in Australian stockbroking circles - or, more precisely, the upper echelons of Ord Minnett, one of the country's largest broking firms which recently bought itself out from Westpac with the help of Jardine Fleming. Neville Miles, Kerry Packer's old chum who organised last year's MBO, has been deposed as joint managing director after losing the support of his troops. Matters came to a head when half a dozen top analysts and the head of the London office threatened to move to James Capel, which is desperate to be a big player in Australia. It is the second top management upheaval at Ord Minnett in less than a year and the swift response to the threatened defections may have been prompted by memories of what happened when S G Warburg took control of Potter Partners. The nucleus of Potter's research team defected to County NatWest's Australian operation and quickly turned it into number one in its field.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WHITE SINGERS LEARN THE BLACK GOSPEL BEAT;  </P> <P> MUSIC: A LONG BEACH PASTOR PROMOTES RACIAL HARMONY BY SHARING RELIGIOUS CULTURE  IN PREPARATION FOR A CONCERT NOV. 19.  </P> <P> The rafters at St. John Baptist Church in Long Beach received a thorough  shaking on a recent Saturday.  </P> <P> First came the rousing strains of such popular gospel numbers as "I'm Blessed"  and "Follow Me." Then, singing a tune called "Holy, Holy," the choir practiced  marching up the aisle behind director Johnie Mae Chambers.  </P> <P> "Are you going to show us how to walk now?" one singer asked. "You haven't done  that yet."  </P> <P> "Give a little shoulder movement," responded Preston Sterling, Chambers'  assistant. "You're just gonna slide."  </P> <P> Later Chambers advised the group to practice at home by "walking the holy holy"  during household chores because, she said, it "looks like we're gonna need lots  of practice." And some choir members expressed the frustration of doing  something that not too many before them have ever done. "I'm having trouble  with the time," Lorraine Roberts said. "I'm used to singing with music."  </P> <P> Welcome to an unusual experiment in interracial harmony and the first step in a  grand vision by the Rev. Ralph J. Mosby, a black minister. His idea: to promote  racial understanding through the sharing of religious culture. More  immediately, his goal is to teach white people how to sing the gospel like  blacks.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do something creative to draw us all together," said Mosby, the  pastor of St. John Baptist and president of the South Coast Ecumenical Council.  An interdenominational group with members from 100 churches in Long Beach,  Carson and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the council's goal is to promote ethnic  and religious understanding in the areas that it serves.  </P> <P> As the spiritual leader of a mostly black congregation, Mosby saw an  opportunity to do that through music. Like other black church choirs, he said,  St. John's sings in a uniquely black style that has evolved through generations  into a genre called "black gospel." According to Mosby, it speaks of his  people's heartfelt experience from slavery to the ongoing struggle for  equality. But the music's message is universal, he said. So why not put  together an interracial black gospel choir whose members and audience would  expand their horizons by learning from each other through the sharing of music?  </P> <P> Mosby's original vision called for a 500-voice ensemble that would put on a  concert in downtown Long Beach's historic First Congregational Church on Nov.  19. The concert date still stands. But the number of respondents --  representing churches throughout the area -- has been disappointing, the pastor  said. And rather than the racial diversity he envisioned, Mosby said, the vast  majority of singers attending the regular rehearsals scheduled at various area  churches have been white.  </P> <P> "Don't be disheartened," he told the 15 singers, mostly members of their own  church choirs, gathered on a recent Saturday morning. "You just do what you  have to do and have a joyous time in the Lord."  </P> <P> Mosby said he still expects to have 50 to 100 singers by Nov. 19, including a  large number of blacks who are not attending rehearsals because they already  know the music. Eventually, he said, he hopes to expand the project to include  the music and participation of other ethnic and religious groups. But for now,  he said, it would be nice to have more black singers on hand to help  demonstrate their musical style to the whites.  </P> <P> "We want (the choir) to learn the rhythms and tonalities of black gospel,"  Mosby said. "Black people have grown up with it."  </P> <P> One obstacle, according to Chambers, an experienced black gospel singer who is  St. John's minister of music, is that white people tend to clap on the downbeat  while blacks clap on the upbeat. Another, she said, is the general stiffness of  the whites as they attempt to perform in an unfamiliar style. And a third, she  said, is their customary dependence on sheet music as opposed to the  unstructured sing-it-from-the-heart style in which black gospel is generally  performed.  </P> <P> "It's difficult," conceded Jean Gebhart, a white singer from Wesley United  Methodist Church in Long Beach. "We're used to sticking to written music and  here we just learn as we go along."  </P> <P> Said Chambers: "I don't want it sung pretty. We're making a definite statement;  we're trying to get them to walk, clap and move their feet."  </P> <P> Most of the whites seem to be enjoying the effort.  </P> <P> "I think it's wonderful," Gebhart said. "It's a chance to get to know other  people and be part of something ecumenical."  </P> <P> Said Mabel Thomas, from First Christian Church of San Pedro: Black gospel  singers "sing it like they mean it. They really sing it like they're talking to  the Lord and we could use a little of that."  </P> <P> While the white singers have made remarkable strides, Chambers said, they still  have a way to go before becoming black gospel artists. "Everybody has it in  them," she said, "we just need to bring it out."  </P> <P> And what of the characteristic walking, clapping and swaying that usually  accompanies black gospel music and stems from something commonly referred to as  "soul?" Chambers smiled and shook her head slightly. "It could be better," she  said, "we're having a little rhythm problem, but I think rehearsal will take  care of that."  </P></p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Slow growth predicted for late this year SLOW economic growth should return to the UK later this year although the outlook remains uncertain, according to a gloomy assessment published yesterday by the Bank of England. In its latest quarterly bulletin the Bank suggests that the recovery is likely to be held back by the unwillingness of debt-laden consumers to increase spending, the fragile world economy and thin order books in industry. One hopeful sign is falling inflation and low wage settlements. These factors have aided manufacturing productivity and competitiveness, and were partly reflected in the small growth in manufacturing output in the first half of the year. But the Bank sounds a warning over the widening trade deficit, caused by increased import volumes. These have been 'surprisingly resilient given the weakness of domestic demand throughout the recession'. The assessment by the Bank, which was subject to vetting by the Treasury, draws a distinction between increased spending by companies and continued low consumer demand. Companies spent more on buildings, plant and machinery in the first quarter, apparently buoyed by hopes of stronger output later this year. This was the first quarterly rise in investment since early 1990. Companies also stopped reducing stocks of components and finished goods. Much of this activity benefited overseas suppliers, showing up in the rise in imports. But in the same three months consumer spending  - which accounts for two thirds of gross domestic product  - fell 0.7 per cent compared with the previous quarter. That was in spite of a 1 per cent rise in real disposable incomes. People's reluctance to increase spending is the main reason for the length and seriousness of this recession. Consumer spending has fallen3.5 per cent since mid-1990, compared with declines of less than 2 per cent in the recessions of 1974-75 and 1980-81. The Bank says 'significant numbers of people are saving more as they attempt to repay some of the large amounts of debt accumulated in the late 1980s' rather than increasing purchases of goods and services. Interest payments on this debt  - a large proportion of which has comprised mortgages  - have declined due to the 5 percentage-point fall in base rates over the past two years to 10 per cent. Even so, the Bank says, 'so far the personal sector has had only limited success in cutting the scale of its debt in relation to income'. The ratio of gross consumer debt to income fell by only 0.75 of a percentage point from its peak of 91 per cent early last year. Total personal sector borrowing as a proportion of assets  - the gearing ratio  - increased to nearly 15 per cent at the end of last year (see chart). Meanwhile, mortgage debt as a proportion of housing assets rose to 29 per cent. This figure has been pushed up by the decline in house prices over the past four years. According to the Bank, the fall in prices  - by about a quarter for some parts of Britain  - has led to up to 1m mortgage holders having a mortgage greater than the value of their home. The Bank says falling inflation 'may have altered individuals' expectations about the rate at which wage increases will enable households to outgrow their existing debt'. It adds: 'Highly geared households, which suffered a proportionately greater squeeze on their incomes from high interest rates, are now suffering a proportionately greater decline in their wealth as house prices fall.' The UK outlook has been worsened by the depressed state of the world economy 'which continues to cause concern'. Across western Europe  - where borrowing costs have been kept high due to high German interest rates  - the outlook for the rest of this year 'is still fairly bleak'. With the Japanese and US economies remaining subdued, growth this year among the Group of Seven industrial nations  - the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Canada and Britain  - is expected to be less than 2 per cent. Weakness in overseas markets has depressed export volumes, which are growing less strongly than a year ago. Between the second half of last year and the first half of this year non-oil export volumes rose 0.8 per cent. The equivalent growth in imports was 4.9 per cent. These changes have increased Britain's trade deficit on visible goods for each of the past four quarters. The Bank says the degree of import penetration partly reflects 'a sizeable turnround in imports of consumer goods following a sharp reduction in such imports earlier in the recession'. The Bank draws a contrast with the sharp fall in imports during the previous recession, when volumes fell 13 per cent between the beginning and the end of 1980. While the stronger activity by UK businesses this year  - some of which may reflect their success in paying off debts and restoring their balance sheets  - gives some grounds for optimism, the outlook for industry is patchy. Business confidence was highly volatile in the first six months of this year, leading to 'cautious hand-to-mouth ordering (which) has intensified the uncertainties facing many companies'. The Bank adds: 'Companies will continue to invest only if there is a prospect of sustained growth of consumption and export demand'. On the rapid recent increase in the public sector borrowing requirement, the Bank says 'the uncertainty about the degree of slack in the economy makes it difficult to judge the underlying fiscal position'. Meeting the Maastricht standards on public sector debt will, however, require strict control of public spending over the next few years.</p>

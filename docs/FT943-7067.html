			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Accountants face tough new monitoring rules Accountants in public practice would be subject to tough new monitoring and continuing education requirements, under sweeping proposals released yesterday by their leading professional bodies. All accountants in positions of influence holding a practising certificate would be required to continue to attend training every year if they were to retain their licence to operate. A small proportion of accountants outside the existing regulated areas would also become subject to monitoring for the first time. The proposals come in a document from the professional standards review working party, comprising members of the three professional chartered accountancy bodies covering England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Under existing regulations, accountants offering investment advice, auditing services and insolvency have become subject to regular examination by self-regulatory bodies. However, the proposals suggest introducing powers to allow accountancy institutes to examine members of firms outside these areas, and to inspect practices offering additional services such as tax advice. Those most likely to be inspected would be those handling clients' money. This would be to ensure their compliance with existing regulations. It might also include any other practices to which the institutes were alerted by complaints from the public. Mr Bruce Picking, director of practice regulation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, stressed that only a small proportion of firms would be subject to inspection - perhaps 3 per cent of the total. Every 'principal' in an accountancy practice - which ranges from the sole practitioner to any partner in a large firm - is presently required to hold a practising certificate. Under the present system, all requirements for continuing education cease once the certificate has been awarded. Accountants who qualified before 1974 are not even required to complete the education requirements, and others qualifying before 1978 can claim exemptions. The changes would allow certificates to be issued subject to certain potentially wide-ranging conditions. The institutes expect to conclude discussions on the proposals in January and begin implementation in early 1996. Role of auditing submerged by small print, Page 8</p>

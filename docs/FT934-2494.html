			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Mayhew offered to go in leak row Sir Patrick Mayhew was ready to resign over the mistakes in government papers giving details of secret exchanges with Sinn Fein leaders, it emerged yesterday. Friends of the Northern Ireland secretary say his 'sense of honour' led him to offer his resignation after the mistakes which gave the republicans a propaganda victory. They said the mistakes were not his fault and that the papers - published last month after the government admitted it had been in contact with Provisional leaders over an extended period - were not kept at the Northern Ireland Office. The government admitted to the errors in the papers, with Sir Patrick accepting 'full ministerial responsibility', late on the night of December 1  -two days after it published its version of the exchanges. It said the mistakes were made in transcription and typing and did not alter the sense. But the admission embarrassed the government because it confirmed that Sinn Fein's version of one key document was accurate. The mistakes in the government's version of this document were particularly unfortunate in the light of repeated denials by Sinn Fein that it initiated the messages - as claimed by the government. Neither Downing Street nor the Northern Ireland Office would comment last night. There were suggestions that the government's originally released version of the wording - now accepted as wrong - appeared to confirm Sinn Fein as the initiator of the exchanges, while the Sinn Fein version implied otherwise. Sir Patrick said the corrections cast 'no doubt whatsoever' upon the authenticity of the first message in the exchanges, said to have come from Mr Martin McGuinness in February, which said the conflict was over. Downing Street said after Sir Patrick's original admission of government contacts with the IRA leadership that there was no question of the Northern Ireland secretary being forced to resign. The government's acknowledgement of the contacts clouded the Dublin summit between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds on December 3. Nearly two years ago, Mr Major rejected an offer to resign from Mr Peter Brooke, Sir Patrick's predecessor, after he had been criticised for singing on a TV chat show within hours of an IRA bomb.</p>

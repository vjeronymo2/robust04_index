			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Shades dance on - Nureyev's version of La Bayadere in Paris A fascinating survival, or an elaborate fake? A profound drama, or an extended piece of re-heated and curried tosh? La Bayadere can be seen - and performed - as all and any of these. It is certainly a very odd ballet, its oddity compounded by excision, revision, misinterpretation. As created in Petersburg by Petipa in 1877, it was a by no means untypical spectacular, obeying all the dance-formulae evolved by Petipa himself. Here were strong drama - temple dancer loved by faithless hero; exotic locale - India , with a vision scene in the Himalayas; splendid roles for ballerinas, and a dazzling ballet blanc show-piece for the corps. Its history over the past century has been no less typical: edited and re-choreographed mercilessly in Russia; brought to the West, with further editing, by emigre stars - Makarova and Nureyev. Treasured in Russia as a classic, it has been adopted in the West on the same terms, its Shades scene recognised as a pinnacle of the old academic dance. It is, as we now know from several stagings (Makarova's version given in New York, London, Stockholm, Milan, Rio; Nureyev's, his last gift to the Paris Opera; the Kirov production in its home theatre, and now taken on tour; the Bolshoi also with a new presentation) a splendid, if suspect, affair. To make sense, it must have the resources of a great company, rich in stars and no less rich in a sense of style, with classic brilliance matched by dramatic conviction. These demands were not fully met when Nureyev, in his last months, mounted it at the Palais Garnier: the staging was grandiose, the performances were more about costume than drama. Returned to the repertory 18 months later, it now looks very well on the Opera's dancers. I saw it on Thursday with Elisabeth Platel (the original Paris Gamzatti) as Nikiya, and with Nicholas Le Riche making his house debut as Solor (he had earlier danced the role with Platel in Moscow). Visually the staging is on the far side of opulent: Ezio Frigerio's sets are tremendous caprices on Indian themes; Franca Squarciapino's clothes boast a rajah's ransom in gold thread alone. The generality of the dancing and playing is admirable - not least in the performances of the two stars. Elisabeth Platel is the purest and most aristocratic of the Opera's etoiles. Thus the Shade Nikiya passes with divine authority through the white motions of the fourth act, the dance luminous, the image poetic. But, as her Gamzatti (and her Giselle) have shown us, she is an actress in whom passion is both real and refined in expression. This Nikiya's confrontation with Gamzatti in the celebrated dialogue when the two women challenge each other over Solor's love, was a marvellously sustained phrase of feeling, well matched by Carole Arbo's proud Gamzatti. To everything Platel brought distinction of means - the shape of her dancing exquisite in proportion, truly classical - and sincerity of feeling. Nicholas Le Riche is the latest marvel among the Opera's men. Just 22 years old, his dancing has a quality of innocence, of sincere pleasure in prowess, of emotional directness, which wins the public wholly. Huge jumps, a luscious physicality - something Roland Petit used well in the recent Camera Obscura - mark his roles. The rectitude of Opera training also means that his dancing is noble. For Solor, the innocence and the power of his handsome presence are well found. The role is understood, the playing is honest. The character will never be much more than a variation on Giselle's Albrecht; Le Riche gives it a youthful credibility, and his dancing takes the breath away by its grand scale. Of the other performances, I found Carole Arbo more convincing - because more expansive - in the dramatic scenes than in the fireworks of the second act, and I deplore the way the staging still shows the Chief Brahman (who must be a dominating figure) as a cross between the last Manchu Empress and Julian Clary. In everything else, the company looked at its best. The production, it is good to report, has lately been recorded for television, with Nureyev's first cast: Elizabeth Guerin as Nikiya, Platel as Gamzatti, Laurent Hilaire as Solor.</p>

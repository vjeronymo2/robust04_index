[Sha'th] Yes, I do. If there is a breakthrough, it will be  thanks to the most recent round of talks in Taba, which I had  said would help us move forward on the security front. I  believe that the meeting in Oslo between President 'Arafat and  Foreign Minister Peres will be another contributing factor,  along with our contacts here with President Husni Mubarak,  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, and Dr. Usamah al-Baz, and there is  yet another meeting between 'Arafat and Minister Peres planned  for next Saturday [29 January] in Davos. These contacts and the  talks set to resume next Tuesday in Taba between ourselves and  General Shahaq and the Israeli delegation should help us  overcome the obstacles holding up an agreement. God willing, we  will arrive at an agreement in February and Israeli withdrawal  will get underway and the Declaration of Principles will be  implemented.    [Mu'addi] When will the talks resume and what are the items  on the agenda?    [Sha'th] The talks about the transfer of civilian  administration resume in Aba tomorrow, Monday. The points  agreed are now being drafted, and we are close to agreement. Of  course, the more intractable issues such as water, archaeology,  and regional planning will have to wait a bit. However, God  willing, we will also make progress on those fronts. The  security committee is scheduled to resume work on Tuesday with  both chief delegates' participation. I believe that in light of  the headway made in Oslo, we should not rule out fresh progress  on the area of the Jericho enclave and the crossings.    [Mu'addi] Is it fair to say that the crossings problem is  now behind us?    [Sha'th] We are close to a solution. Let's temper our  optimism with realism and reason.    [Mu'addi] Given recent developments, what were 'Arafat's  instructions to the Palestinian delegation?    [Sha'th] We are in constant touch with President 'Arafat.  We met this morning, and we are to meet this afternoon before  he travels to Saudi Arabia. We are in constant touch. He was  here three days ago and is being updated regularly. He is  asking that we work overtime to conclude the agreement.    [Mu'addi] Do you think that by the end of the month all  issues blocking the implementation of the Declaration of  Principles will have been sorted out?    [Sha'th] It is hard for me to set an exact date, since that  will be a matter for the political leaderships of both sides. I  think we are on the road to a solution. It is extremely hard  for me to be more specific.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Sha'th, thank you so much.    [Sha'th] Thank you, Sa'id.</p>

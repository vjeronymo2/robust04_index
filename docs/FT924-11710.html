			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major's growing pains 'A STRATEGY for growth is what we need; a strategy for growth is what we are going to have.' Thus did Mr John Major announce what looks like the most significant of the many U-turns made by his government since September 16, the day the pound and the government were found wanting. The prime minister wants an 'early, strong but sustainable' recovery, with particular emphasis on the 'early'. He is in exalted company. The leader of every leading country wants the same thing and Mr George Bush seems doomed to pay the ultimate price for his failure to achieve it. Will Mr Major be any more successful? Unhappily for him, recovery is likely to be slow in coming and be weak when it does. Many have recommended an independent Bank of England as part of the solution to the government's lack of long-term counter-inflationary credibility. Unfortunately, Lord Justice Bingham's devastating report on the Bank of England's supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has taken a bit of the gilt off this gingerbread. What are the remaining options? Many recommend still lower short-term rates of interest. But there is more of a conflict over fiscal policy. Some recommend further fiscal expansion, ignoring the fact that the public sector borrowing requirement is already some 5 to 6 per cent of gross domestic product. Others argue for fiscal consolidation. Few will be surprised to find the Treasury in the latter camp. But the Treasury may be out of touch with the government's policies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said policy was 'to go for growth and recovery out of this recession', while Mr Lamont denied that there is any U-turn. Next week's Mansion House speech by the chancellor and the following week's Autumn Statement on public spending should reveal more. They need to do so. Sterling's exit from the ERM and the volte face over the closure of the 31 coal pits have, taken together, made the government look decidedly silly. It must re-establish its authority once again. Another downturn Its own disarray is not the government's sole problem. At home, the recession may be entering another downturn. Abroad, the economies of continental Europe and Japan are slowing down rapidly, while the US is still struggling to mount a real recovery. Yet the plight of the global economy must not be exaggerated. This is not the Great Depression. The UK economy was the only one in the group of seven leading industrial countries to shrink over the latest 12 months, although it was joined by Germany in the latest quarter. It is little wonder that Mr Major's government is so unpopular. It is not likely to become less so very soon. This week's quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce argues that the UK fell into the 'second leg' of the recession in the third quarter, with confidence falling to levels last seen in the winter of 1990-91. The volume of imports (excluding the erratic items) continued to grow faster than that of exports between the second and third quarters. Sterling's devaluation - now 11 per cent on the nominal effective exchange rate, since Black Wednesday - will help, but its effects will not only be long delayed, but be offset by the gathering slow-down in continental Europe. Rate cut Lower interest rates should also assist the recovery, mainly because they would help financial intermediaries and borrowers to rebuild balance sheets. An annex to the latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF shows that the ratio of total private non-financial sector debt to gross domestic product in the UK more than doubled between 1980 and 1991. The task ahead is immense. Lower interest rates are not likely to encourage much borrowing, as both the US and Japan have discovered. One reason is the debt mountain. Another is the level of long-term interest rates. At around 9 per cent, these reflect both the high real rate of interest and the persistence of inflationary expectations. It was those expectations that encouraged the huge borrowings of the 1980s. The self-same expectations are keeping long-term rates of interest up during the recession. Given these worries, the stimulatory effects of further increases in fiscal deficits are at least uncertain. The problems are not unique to the UK, though they are particularly severe there. What is also not unique is concern about the international economy. Beggar-my-neighbour policies are coming back into fashion. The worst example is not the recent changes in exchange rates, which can be justified, but trade, where a complete collapse of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations now seems likely. Debt and inflationary expectations at home, deflation and protectionism abroad all threaten Mr Major's 'early' recovery. Recovery will take time. It will also need the preservation of a stable and open international economy. Even if Mr Major adopts the right policies, he will remain at the mercy of events.</p>

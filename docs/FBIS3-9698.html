			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The political committee of the Civic Democratic  Party met in Prague today. The party chairman, Vaclav Klaus,  told Czech radio about the meeting:    [Begin Klaus recording] Today's meeting discussed the  outcome  of the talks of the Coalition Four held yesterday and confirmed,  more or less, our basic positions. As far as election laws are  concerned, we have still not managed to reach a compromise, or  what could be termed its essence. We repeat that our current  positions on this issue are still valid. These positions have  been voiced on many occasions, and, as far as this case is  concerned, they happen to be identical with those contained in  the government's proposal, which is already in parliament.    To pursue any further talks in this respect, our party's  political committee has authorized the chairman to negotiate  possible compromises with the coalition partners. That is one  thing.    As for the other topics, a consultation on the next course  of  action to be taken with regard to Jewish property is to take  place later today. Several of our ministers will attend. I  think these are the main matters we are currently interested in.  [end recording]</p>

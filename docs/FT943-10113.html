			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Sport: Dirty tricks - Cricket Michael Atherton may keep his hands clean at Headingley this weekend as he leads England against South Africa, but bowlers on both sides will be working at the ball in search of the elusive movement which makes deliveries much more dangerous. Hardly anyone understands how the bowler makes a ball move. Some find swing and dip, others cut and jag. The important thing for a medium-pace bowler is to get the ball to do something. Straight-up-and-down merchants do not make much progress unless they bowl at 100mph. Mike Hendrick, the former England bowler, and a master at making the ball nip about off the pitch, said he expected to land the ball on the seam every time but confessed he never knew which way it would deviate. This is not the case with swing which the bowler can control. A through-the-air, rather than off-the-pitch, movement is achieved by positioning the shiny side of the ball a particular way and propelling it with a round-arm action, a supple wrist and plenty of hip swivel. Each individual has his own method. Angus Fraser is too rigid and high to generate swing. He jams the ball into the pitch searching for crannies, occasionally tweaking his wrist on release to encourage cut. Philip DeFreitas's deliveries are fuller and kiss the surface, enhancing away swing. A proud seam, acting as a rudder, helps this process (which is why some artificially raise it). The reduction of the seam may be one reason why bowlers do not swing the ball as much as they once did - except on certain days, that is. There are many theories to explain swing. Scientists have suggested it equals barometric pressure, divided by wind resistance, multiplied by the price of beer. High humidity and cloud cover exaggerate swing, wind enhances or inhibits it, depending on the direction, and a moderate beer belly gives the bowler momentum, or it did once. Today, pacemen are sleek, sculpted athletes, but they are finding new ways to make the ball move in an era when most advances (bigger bats, lifeless covered wickets, protective equipment, one bouncer per over) favour batsmen. One method is reverse swing. Instead of polishing the ball to keep it pristine, you want one side to deteriorate so that there is a weight imbalance. This only happens on certain dry, cracked pitches - Lord's, the Oval and many in Asia - where the ball soon looks as if it has been in contact with sandpaper. By moistening and rubbing one side, and allowing the other to become gnarled, you can make the ball behave in the opposite way to one at a lush place such as Headingley or Trent Bridge. Bowlers hold the ball for a normal outswinger, and it goes the other way. Even some bowlers become confused and have to be reminded how to grip the ball. Reverse swing moves more and is easier to obtain. The issue of ball-tampering enters the story here. A few bowlers do not wait until the ball becomes naturally ragged, and they surreptitiously scratch it. One overseas player can mimic the blemishes and abrasions caused by different surfaces so his handiwork is impossible to detect. There is a recent school of thought that believes that rubbing dirt into cuts on the dry, scuffed side exaggerates the difference between wet and dry and creates air pockets. A problem is that the laws are woolly. Law 42.5 permits polishing but forbids any action to 'alter the condition of the ball', this includes applying soil but could also include bowling or hitting the ball. Movement is only effective if the ball is put in a dangerous area. The advantage of swing is that it can turn a bad ball - say a half-volley - into a good one as it curves away late. What the administrators forget is that cricket is a contest between bat and ball, not leather paying homage to willow. If you try to clip a bowler's wings he will find another way to fly.</p>

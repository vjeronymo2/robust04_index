			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Moody's to review GM debt GENERAL Motors, the troubled US automobile company, suffered blows on two fronts yesterday when workers went on strike at one of its assembly plants and Moody's, the credit rating agency, said it was reviewing its debt for possible down-grading. Moody's review includes the company's commercial paper, which is an important source of cheap funding for General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), the largest non-bank finance house in the US. GM's commercial paper currently has the top rating, Prime-1, and a downgrade would lose the company many institutions whose investment guidelines preclude them from buying paper lower than P-1. GM would then have to find alternative sources of short-term funding. Analysts speculated yesterday that it would probably turn more to the asset-backed securities market. Meanwhile, 4,200 workers at the GM plant in Lansing, Michigan, which assembles the popular Pontiac Grand Am, went on strike yesterday morning in a long-simmering dispute over job cuts. The stoppage immediately closed down an adjacent chassis plant. The two sides will meet to discuss the issue today. Little more than two weeks ago GM suffered a 10-day strike at its Lordstown, Ohio, stamping plant which idled eight more factories. While the disputes are not ostensibly connected, analysts believe the United Auto Workers union is trying to soften GM up as the company seeks to shut down 21 plants and sharply cut its manpower in an attempt to restore its loss-making North American operations to profit. Moody's cited the danger of further union disruption as one of the factors prompting its review. It said this would focus on 'GM's ability to turn round its US automotive operations and rebuild its financial flexibility given the mild recovery in auto demand, GM's relative weakness in certain product categories, and potential impediments to the timely implementation of cost reduction programmes in the company's North American operations.' GM shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 32 in a generally falling market.</p>

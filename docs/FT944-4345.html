			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Integrated farming groups to link up Five British groups promoting sustainable agriculture are expected to band together this week in an informal alliance to pursue less-intensive production methods. The umbrella group, to be called the Integrated Arable Crop Production Alliance, will enable the groups to work more closely together, spread resources more effectively and achieve better publicity for the results of their studies. Integrated farming aims to reduce the application of artificial inputs such as herbicides and pesticides while maintaining profitability. Most of the current research projects are investigating the environmental benefits of cutting inputs and how far they can be reduced without hurting profits. The new group will include: Life, a project funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and part of a European network of integrated farm research; Link, which is looking at integrated farm systems on different soil types; and Leaf, which promotes farm practices where care for the environment is combined with modern methods. The other two members will be Focus on Farming Practice, a study conducted by the Co-op's farm branch in Leicestershire, and the Farm and Wildlife Advisory Group, which works with farmers to minimise their impact on the environment.</p>

Slovenia will become the first part of the former Yugoslavia  to sign up to the NATO programme. Bosnia-Hercegovina and  Croatia have also expressed interest in joining the Partnership,  although no decision has been taken on it, the official said.    The Partnership for Peace programme allows for joint  manoeuvres, military planning and peacekeeping operations with  the existing NATO members.    NATO has already decided that four other countries can join  the programme if they wish -- Austria, Finland, Sweden and  Switzerland.    Russia is expected to sign up to the programme before the  end  of April. Georgia signed Wednesday, joining Albania, Bulgaria,  the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,  Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine.    Among the former Soviet republics, only Tajikistan has said  it is not interested in joining the programme, the official  added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From the three FD&amp;C wastewater samples collected, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following three constituents were observed that are attributable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to FD&amp;C colorant production: Aniline, 3-hydroxyphenol, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phenol. During the risk assessment screening, the Agency found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the three constituents present in the waste ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  aniline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3-hydroxyphenol, and phenol) do not pose a risk at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations detected. In fact, the ratios of maximum measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration in the wastestream to the HBL were less than 1 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aniline and phenol. Since there currently is no HBL available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 3-hydroxyphenol, the concentration of 3-hydroxyphenol was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to that of a surrogate. 3-Hydroxyphenol is not expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be a potential carcinogen. Furthermore, the Agency selected a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrogate compound that is structurally similar to the compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected in the waste, and is estimated, by means of structural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than the subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound. Therefore, phenol was selected as a surrogate for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3-hydroxyphenol, and the resulting ratio of concentration to HBL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was also less than 1. This indicates that if the contaminant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations found in the waste were actually present in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water, the risks posed by ingesting the drinking water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be insignificant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, because the constituents in this wastestream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were observed at concentrations that present insignificant risks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and no other hazardous constituents attributed to FD&amp;C colorant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production were detected, the Agency is proposing not to list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters from the manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants as hazardous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Dusts and dust collector fines from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of dyes and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is proposing not to list dusts and dust collector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fines from the manufacture of dyes and pigments because, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an evaluation of current management and plausible management,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this waste does not pose a substantial potential hazard to human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dusts and dust collector fines are generated during drying,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grinding, and blending operations that occur during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of dyes and pigments. Dust collectors and baghouses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally are used to capture and collect the dust. The total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume of this wastestream reported in response to the 1991 RCRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3007 Questionnaire is 143 metric tons. According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionnaire data, some of the dusts and fines reported by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry are recovered and recycled back to the manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process or sold to shoe-polish manufacturers as a raw material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information on the percentage handled in this manner is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included at the present time due to business confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns. There is a distinct economic incentive for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities to continue reusing or selling dusts and fines in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way. This handling of dusts and fines is not expected to present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any significant risk to human health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seventeen percent of the reported waste volume is generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a facility that currently manages dusts and fines in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle C landfill and the Agency believes that this facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to manage dusts and fines in such a manner. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dusts and fines generated at this facility from organic pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by this listing determination are mixed with dusts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fines from inorganic pigments that contain lead and chromium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entire volume of dusts and fines, comprised of the commingled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic and inorganic products dusts and fines, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristically toxic for both lead and chromium and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, is a hazardous waste as defined by 40 CFR 261.24. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is impractical for the facility to separate the dusts and fines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by this listing determination from these characteristic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inorganic dusts and fines and, thus, the facility manages the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dusts and fines covered by this listing determination in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle C landfill. Analysis of existing plant design shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that dusts and fines are comingled in ductwork that is structured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such that these wastes are mixed. Without significant re-design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and construction, segregation of the wastes is impossible. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency does not believe that it is plausible for the facility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinue the practice of combining all of its dusts and fines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes and disposing of such wastes at a Subtitle C facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the physical arrangement of this facility. Management of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this waste in a Subtitle C landfill is not expected to pose any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant level of risk to human health or the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information on the volume and the percentage of total volume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed of in Subtitle D landfills is not included at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present time due to business confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes the potential risks posed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plausible management practices for this volume do not warrant a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste listing for dusts and fines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although, due to resource constraints, the Agency was unable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to collect information on the characteristics of these dusts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fines, the Agency estimated a worst-case risk by estimating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk associated with disposal of dusts and fines in a Subtitle D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landfill based on the physical/chemical properties of a mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dye product and the toxicological properties of a dye constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to be one of the most toxic and mobile dye or pigment waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents. This analysis demonstrated that the risk is below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial level of concern associated with disposal of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste in a Subtitle D landfill. Management of this waste in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-site monofill was determined to be not plausible because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes generated would not justify an on-site monofill. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further information see the background document on risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment, available in the public docket for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests comment on the approach used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine risk posed by plausible management of the wastes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the proposed determination not to list this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that paragraph (a) should clearly state that the year referred to means assessment year. This amendment has been made in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that the phrase ``ownership records'' in paragraph (b) should be changed to ``BLM records'' to underscore that BLM is not the official repository of mining claim ownership records. The BLM does not consider itself the keeper of the definitive record of ownership, and this paragraph in the proposed rule is not intended to imply that it is.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment said that the phrase ``record title'' in paragraph (c) should be changed to ``BLM records'' in order to avoid suggesting that the BLM ownership records are the official legal title records. The paragraph has been amended to remove this misleading implication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal authors of this final rule are Frank Bruno and Roger Haskins of the Division of Solid Minerals, assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The BLM has determined that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual, Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The fee may represent an economic consideration for a small, marginal operation that does not qualify for an exemption under the rule. However, most small operations would qualify. A small entity that holds a valuable mining claim will not be deterred by the annual fee, and many of them will qualify for an exemption. Most marginal claims were already abandoned in 1993 upon promulgation of the regulations implementing the Act of October 5, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a taking of private property. The requirement that a modest fee be paid to hold or maintain an existing unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site constitutes a reasonable regulatory burden, and it will have no effect on a claimant's use of his or her claim or site as long as he or she complies with the requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions for collection of information contained at 43 CFR Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850, and subpart 3809 have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance numbers 1004&hyph;0104, 1004&hyph;0110, and 1004&hyph;0114. Information collections for Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850 were consolidated under clearance number 1004&hyph;0114 in the July 15, 1993, rule (58 FR 38186). As this rule removes obsolete or inoperative sections of Title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, and extends the information collection-related effect of the previously enacted Act of October 5, 1992, and implementing regulations published on July 15, 1993, this rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR Part 3720  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coal, Mineral royalties, Mines, Public lands_mineral resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR Part 3730  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Mines, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surety bonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR Part 3800  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental protection, Intergovernmental relations, Mines, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surety bonds, Wilderness areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR Part 3810  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mines, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR Part 3820  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mines, Monuments and memorials, National forests, National parks, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surety bonds, Wilderness areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR 3830  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mineral royalties, Fees, Mines, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 43 CFR 3850  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assessment work, Mines, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dated: August 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> Bob Armstrong, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=3 --> Assistant Secretary of the Interior. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

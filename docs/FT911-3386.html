The Korean companies, Kolon Industries and Nahmae Chemical, will hold a combined 50 per cent stake in the joint venture, with DSM owning the rest. The venture, Hanhwa Lactam, will be based in South Korea's Yeochun region. Commercial output is due to begin in 1994, with an initial annual capacity of 70,000 tonnes, doubling to 140,000 tonnes. Korean companies used about 240,000 tonnes of caprolactum last year. At present, two-thirds of the country's caprolactum is imported from Japan and Europe.</p>

Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> COLTS SIGN KICKER MAX ZENDEJAS  </P> <P> The Indianapolis Colts, guarding against the possibility of a contract holdout  by veteran Dean Biasucci, have signed place-kicker Max Zendejas.  </P> <P> Biasucci, fifth in Colts' career scoring with 391 points in five seasons, is  one of the team's eight unsigned veterans. He is not expected to be in camp  when the veterans report to the Anderson University training facility on  Thursday.  </P> <P> Zendejas, whose brief NFL career includes previous stops in Washington and  Green Bay, signed a two-year contract Tuesday and said he regards it as a good  opportunity to get back into football.  </P> <P> "I'm just here for myself and to see if I can get in and help this team in any  way this year," Zendejas said.  </P></p>

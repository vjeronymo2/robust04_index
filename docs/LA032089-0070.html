			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAF NEEDS THREE SETS TO BEAT EVERT IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> Though she lost a set for the first time this year, top-seeded Steffi Graf  rallied to defeat Chris Evert, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, Sunday in the final of a $300,000  Virginia Slims tennis tournament.  </P> <P> "It's disappointing," said Evert, 34, who was seeded third. "I had a point for  4-4 in the third set, and I realized she was very beatable today.  </P> <P> "Whenever you get to 3-3 in the third set, the chances are there. The last few  games, probably age was a factor. I didn't feel tired, but maybe I lost a step  or two."  </P> <P> Evert, playing before family and friends at the Polo Club of Boca Raton, won  the first set by breaking the 19-year-old West German's serve in the seventh  game.  </P> <P> Graf recovered quickly, taking a 3-0 lead in the second set and going on to  even the match at one set apiece.  </P> <P> In the third set, the players remained on serve through seven games. In the  eighth, Evert was serving with a 40-15 lead when she lost four consecutive  points and the game. In that run, Evert first missed the baseline, then Graf  whipped a sideline winner to reach deuce and broke service when Evert hit the  next two into the net.  </P> <P> With a 5-3 lead, Graf held service at love to end the 1-hour 52-minute match.  </P> <P> It was the fourth consecutive tournament title for Graf, ranked No. 1 in the  world.  </P> <P> "I'm satisfied with winning but not with the way I was playing," she said. "I  didn't have the range on the court."  </P> <P> Graf was awarded $60,000, bringing her tournament singles earnings to $295,000  since January. Evert earned $24,000 as runner-up.  </P></p>

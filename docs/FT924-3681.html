			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: Saxophonists par excellence - David Sanborn and Joe Henderson live up to their reputations WHAT WITH his coiffed hair, designer zoot suit and smoothy alto technique, David Sanborn is every inch the beer commercial saxophonist. Since his early days with fellow crossover jazzers, the Brecker Brothers, he has coolly cultivated a saleable image based on almost conversational licks and hummable tunes. For the latest of many big selling albums, Upfront (Elektra 7559-61272-2), however, he has struck a more aggressive pose. Like the Brecker Bros he now deals in hard, no holds barred shrieking funk. (If I had been told a year ago that Sanborn would soon be covering Ornette Coleman I would have replied that, 'Yes and the Spontaneous Music Ensemble will do Christmas carols.') Surprising as it is, the change of direction seems to have worked and on the strength of Upfront, Sanborn fans have filled the cavernous North London Town &amp; Country Club for three consecutive nights. The group here, on the road for the best part of the year, is a more portable version of the album's and as tight as they come. It features a genuine Hammond B3 organ among the synth keyboards, knee knocking long haired guitarist, electric bass, drums, plus a mountain of timbale and conga drums. But if the first lazy tear of Sanborn's alto into the simple funky backbeat recalls familiar ground, the material is harder and rougher. This is the same user-friendly Sanborn but with an edge. A series of abrasively catchy phrases is developed into a searing, crowd teasing crescendo before he hands over to guitarist Dean Brown (who clearly divides his time between watching Wayne's World and listening to Mike Stern records). The excitement is sustained by feisty percussion from Don Alias and the stick twirling antics of drummer, Sonny Emory and the whole circus is held together by Ricky Peterson's swirling keyboards. 'Benny' and 'Alcazar', delicious cuts from the new album were beautifully paced and then wrung for all they were worth by each of the personnel. 'Soul Serenade', a blues as comfortable as an old shoe, was turned inside out by Sanborn before being handed on to Brown for a sub-George Benson scat-along and climax in a duet. Mooching around the stage the while, appearing to be in complete control, a sanguine Sanborn announced to roars of approval, 'I have officially lost control.' He hadn't; sections of his audience had. ***** It is a fitting that in a year when tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson produces one of the finest interpretations of Duke Ellington's music with his album Lush Life (Verve), he should stand alongside the great composer in being the only other artist to ever receive three Downbeat awards in the same year - in Henderson's case, 1992 Musician of the Year; Tenor Sax Player of the Year; and Album of the Year. Starting his five day residency at Yoshi's Club in Oakland, California, he celebrated his achievements with a customarily daunting command of his instrument. Henderson is a classic player and a reliable guardian of the traditional jazz formula. In a short set of standards he explored every angle with a mischievous skill - his warm, penetrating tone jack-knifing around the musical alleyways with fragile screams, scurrying patterns and invigorating unexpected low notes. He was in fine company - Al Foster chased his every move with precise and inventive drumming, bassman Larry Grenadier offered lovely, flowing basslines and pianist Larry Willis provided a solid harmonic backdrop. Unexpectedly presented with his trio of awards by vibes player Bobby Hutcherson, Henderson ended the set with 'Take the A Train', taking a captivating introductory duet with Foster and rounding it off with humorous aplomb with the rest of the band. In turn his audience gave him a standing ovation and Hutcherson pointed out: 'He should have got this back in the Sixties.' Never a moment too late.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOUNDS THAT HEAL, TIES THAT BIND;  </P> <P> ROAD SONG; A MEMOIR BY NATALIE KUSZ (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $18.95; 216  PP.)  </P> <P> "Road Song: A Memoir" is a riveting first book. Writing in a prose so clear  that you can see to the very bottom of her startling experience, Natalie Kusz  tells the story of her family's migration from Los Angeles to Alaska 21 years  ago, when she was 6 years old.  </P> <P> It is a vivid account of pioneer living on America's last frontier, but at the  center of the story is an event so shocking that even the power and beauty of  the Alaskan wilderness turns to wallpaper. On a freezing winter afternoon, soon  after her seventh birthday, Natalie falls prey to a pack of starving dogs,  losing chunks of her face and head. That night her mother prays for her to die.  </P> <P> Of the children's hospital where Natalie lives at first, among a changing  circle of doomed children, she writes: "For most of us, it became clear that  horror can last only a little while, and then it becomes commonplace." Though  far from commonplace, Kusz's writing is compellingly matter-of-fact. Her memory  is purified of brooding, self-pity and blame.  </P> <P> With crystalline precision, she relives the progression of her bone grafts, her  friendships, her enemies. At 11, she pulls away from her pacifist parents  because they allow her younger siblings to be tortured by schoolyard bullies.  After her father finally teaches her to fight, she begins to take revenge --  eventually going beyond revenge to draw blood for its own sake.  </P> <P> By the time she reaches high school, Natalie is a large, overweight girl with a  patch over one missing eye, an outcast who has learned to command respect from  her peers through violence. Now she starts on drugs, alcohol and sex, lying all  the while to her concerned but overworked parents: "I grew so accustomed to the  racing fear in my belly that in time I almost did not notice it."  </P> <P> Even at her most unrepentant, she can't shake her attachment to her family, and  in the reliving of her delinquency, Kusz is mindful of the theme that runs  through her whole memoir: the strength derived first from family. The issues  that Kusz confronts are timely ones. As a voice from a new generation, she  enters the hot debate on family values with innocent force. From the outset,  and for their own reasons, Natalie's parents believed in solidarity.  </P> <P> Although Natalie often chafed under her parents' vigilance -- heightened by the  accident -- she was unable to ward off its benefits. When her best friend Marcy  asks her what her parents would do if they found out about her secret high  school behavior, Natalie says: "They'd go on and on forever about trust and  betrayal, and how a family is supposed to be all one fortress, no spies, no  traitors."  </P> <P> "You mean your mom and dad like you?" her friend asks, "Jeez, if your parents  like you, I don't see why you're here and not there."  </P> <P> It is Natalie's pregnancy that finally brings the family together, as in the  early years of her accident. "We were once again an alliance, once again  defensible from the world."  </P> <P> As much as their memoir records suffering, it also recalls delights, midnight  suns, and hard work. Natalie's family is courageously, desperately supportive,  and the book bears witness to all the emotional states that such a family  fosters, and then must withstand. The Kuszes lived together for years in just  one room lit by kerosene lamps, telling stories, singing songs, planning  houses. "Our sense of humor was our father's -- absurd puns and loud, ungainly  laughter -- and our quickness to befriend other misfits was Mom's."  </P> <P> Natalie is nourished by stories, and she tells the histories of her own  remarkable parents: Her father had escaped from Nazi Poland during the war, and  her endlessly energetic mother turns out to have been driven by fears of her  own mother's schizophrenia. These stories, like the less articulate ones she  teases out of her younger brother and sisters, form and re-form for her,  dissolving anger and rebellion into sympathy.  </P> <P> Some wounds don't heal; others do, leaving scars. "Road Song" is Natalie Kusz's  effort to commemorate not her bodily injury -- we never do get to see what, in  fact, she looks like -- but its spiritual cost. Her gifts as a writer, her  original voice and sparkling perceptions, give this memoir the literary  precision of a novel.  </P> <P> Kusz lets us into her life, and it is both a privilege and a pleasure to be  there.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khabarovsk, May 6, RIA -- Speaking at a press  conference in Khabarovsk, Viktor Ishayev, head of the Khabarovsk  territory's government, said that the government agreement  between Russia and China, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and his  foreign minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh in 1991, must be  abrogated. Mr. Ishayev said that the agreement harmed the far  eastern regions of Russia and the country as a whole and accused  its authors of having failed to take into account many economic  and historical factors.    Taking advantage of that agreement, the Chinese authorities  want their civilian and military ships to be given free passage  in the Russian waters along the Rivers Ussuri and Amur and  demand that Russia cede to China a number of islands in the Amur.    "We want to trade and improve relations with China, but in  doing so we shouldn't harm our own interests," Mr. Ishayev said.</p>

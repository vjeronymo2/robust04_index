			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Belgian chemicals group falls to BFr6bn NET profits at Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals group, slipped by 13.5 per cent in the first half of this year, with income down on the first half of 1991 in all three of its principal operating sectors. The group yesterday announced a consolidated interim profit of BFr5.88bn, (Dollars 192m) against BFr6.8bn in the first half of last year. It pointed out that the comparative figure was lifted by speculative pricing - particularly of plastics - during the Gulf war. Turnover in the first half dropped by 3.3 per cent to BFr132.5bn from BFr137.1bn although volumes increased. Solvay said it expected its full-year results to be generally comparable with 1991, when the group made consolidated net profits of BFr12.44bn, or BFr10.6bn before extraordinary items. Baron Daniel Janssen, the group's chairman, said the plastics sector in particular was still 'a very grim picture', although it had improved since the second half of last year. PVC prices and demand improved in the first months of 1992, but were still under pressure from east European and US imports. Prices continued to fall in the high density polyethylene and polypropylene markets, eroding margins. In the circumstances, Baron Janssen said Solvay was surprised that the European Commission had decided, earlier this month, to open another inquiry into an alleged PVC cartel among EC manufacturers. 'If there's one market which is heavily competitive, it's PVC,' he said yesterday. He added that Solvay was pursuing discussions with Cefic, the EC chemical companies' trade association, and the Commission over suspicions that east European PVC makers might be dumping their product at artificially low prices in the EC market. Baron Janssen warned east European manufacturers earlier this year that Solvay would be prepared to lodge a formal complaint with the Commission if the practice persisted.</p>

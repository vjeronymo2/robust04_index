			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with NATO Secretary Manfred Woerner by </F> Udo van Kampen, in Brussels on 11 April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Van Kampen] NATO headquarters in Brussels  this afternoon after the air raids [on Serbian positions near  Gorazde] is visibly calm. Even though NATO headquarters does  not want to reveal any details about the exact route of  information, the command structure is clear. The endangered UN  soldiers in Gorazde had asked for air support. The UN special  envoy gave the go-ahead; a few minutes later the warplanes took  off from Italy. The legal situation is clear: Last June the UN  Security Council passed a resolution that precisely set down the  procedure. At that time, Russia, too, agreed. [Woerner]  First of all, if you ask for air support to protect troops  under attack, you have to act quickly. If you start protracted  consultations, you will be too late. This is quite certain.  Second, we are acting on the basis of UN resolutions to which  the Russians agreed. Third, the representative of the UN  Secretary General is on site and he agreed. Thus, the demands  made by the Russians have been fulfilled. [passage omitted]    [Van Kampen] Is there the risk now that NATO will be dragged  into a protracted conflict?    [Woerner] We are trying to prevent that. So far, our  actions have been limited. There are three different actions:  first, close air support; second, the enforcement of the no-fly  zone; third, some kind of ultimatum as in Sarajevo. All these  are strictly limited actions. So far, we do not have any ground  forces there, and there is no inclination to send ground forces  there, unless a peace agreement can be enforced. This means, we  will probably stick to the kind of force that we have chosen,  namely providing air support for UNPROFOR. [passage omitted]</p>

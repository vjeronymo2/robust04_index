Addressing a  crowded news conference in Muscat before her departure for home  at the conclusion of her three-day visit to Oman, she said the  problem should be resolved in accordance with international law  and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Bhutto said she  also briefed Sultan Qabus on the situation that has arisen on  the Indian subcontinent as a result of the Jammu and Kashmir  problem. She also informed Sultan Qabus of the selective  tyranny and oppression carried out against the people during the  struggle in occupied Kashmir.    The prime minister thanked Oman for its support to Pakistan  on the Kashmir problem and also requested Sultan Qabus to assist  in lessening tension in the subcontinent because Oman has good  relations with India. She urged the Sultan to persuade India to  stop human rights violations and strive for a political  settlement of this issue. Bhutto added it is regrettable that  India is not only criticizing her government but also attacking  her personally, which reflects that the present government has  perturbed India on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, which was not  done by any previous Government of Pakistan. The prime minister  said she held negotiations on Jammu and Kashmir with complete  firmness, because Pakistan is really interested in the  establishment of peace and stability in Jammu and Kashmir and  believes that the time is ripe for settling this issue in  accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. She  said we have struggled for human rights in Pakistan, and, hence,  we cannot overlook the developments taking place in Jammu and  Kashmir. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that 600,000  Indian troops are stationed in Jammu and Kashmir. India has  increased its defense budget by 20 percent within a span of one  year, which is directly related to the attempts to crush the  struggle going on in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan cannot also  ignore the fact that women are being molested in occupied  Kashmir.    The prime minister described her visit to Oman as very  fruitful and expressed the hope that her visit will lead to  exchange of visits at the ministerial levels. The two countries  have the potential to work together to meet the requirements of  the Pakistani markets and of the Gulf and Central Asian markets.    Benazir Bhutto apprised the Omani Sultan of Pakistan's  defense capabilities and said the two countries can find new  avenues of cooperation in this field. She announced a gift of  three Mashshaq trainer aircraft to Oman as an expression of the  gesture of friendship. Later, addressing a large number of  leading businessmen, the prime minister said Oman is the closest  neighbor of Pakistan which offers vast opportunities for  investment. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mladen Bosnjak on a news conference by Douglas </F> Hogg, Minister of State at the British Foreign Office, in  Sarajevo on 3 May -- recorded; Hogg speaks in English with  superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation]    [Text] [Bosnjak] My visit has focused on the  implementation of the Washington Agreement and the work of the  contact group, Douglas Hogg said. I am encouraged by the  pragmatic views expressed by Mr. Silajdzic. From what I heard  in Zagreb yesterday and in Sarajevo today, I can see that there  is commitment to the implementation of the agreement. My  impression is that the most important thing is to have a clear  geographic delineation between the cantons.    There is no doubt that the Serb side is to be blamed for the  current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina but, despite that, it  cannot be excluded from the negotiations. From my talks with  Prime Minister Silajdzic I gathered that there are limits beyond  which one cannot go, and the most important one concerns the  external borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those must not be  touched, but there is still room for a much looser agreement on  the relations between the Serbs on the one hand and the  Muslim-Croat federation on the other.    It is important to stress that the contact group consists of  those countries that have so far played the most significant  role, and will continue to play it in the future. It is also  important that Russia is also included, Hogg said, and added:    [Hogg] The contact group is engaged in two main tasks. The  first is to achieve a cease-fire for a limited period, and the  second is to try to find an agreement between the Bosniaks, the  Croats, and the Serbs. I think that the engagement of the  contact group is a big step ahead.</p>

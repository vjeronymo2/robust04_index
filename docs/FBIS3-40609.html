In  Pakistan, that is what happened to General Ziaul Haq, to Ghulam  Ishaq Khan and to Mohammed Nawaz Sharif. Nawaz Sharif is a  classical example of this practice. All the assumptions he made  about his power proved to be wrong. Opposed to all the talks  about his being an iron man, he proved to be made of wax.  Situations and events threw him wherever they wanted to. He is  not a statue that can be kept in Madam Tassaud's Wax Works. His  political personality has many potentials. However, these  potentials will be realized only if it can proved that he is a  man of bones and flesh, and not the one of steel nerves. What we  mean is that we have to see how many changes he makes in his  perceived personality. He will have to make a major overhaul in  his personality and image. Without it, his political prospects  could change into apprehension.    The major tendency in Pakistani politics until now was for  various political parties and persons, especially those who had  the potential to rise to power, to have considered the  weaknesses of the opposition party or person as a cause of his  strength. It rarely happened when a political party or  personality gained strength in the real sense instead of  depending on the weakness of the opponents. Madam Benazir  Bhutto's lengthy political efforts have also hovered around this  negative tendency. Mr. Nawaz Sharif has also done the same in  the past and is doing so now. However, the polarization in our  society has reached to such a level that the weakness of a  political party will not benefit its opponents; it will, instead  benefit several people. The campaign that Madam Bhutto had  started against Nawaz Sharif was the last one. She will not be  able to run a similar campaign again.    The greatest danger to Nawaz Sharif's political future is  the  lack of a "real problem" in his agenda. He does not have a  separate identity either. Even Z. A. Saleiri, one of his  sympathizers, admits that there is very little difference  between Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto and the PPP [Pakistan  People's Party] and Muslim League's Nawaz Group. He has said  that in his recent article. Nawaz Sharif's lack of issues is  also evident from his total focus on the problems of the Bhutto  family. He was hurt instead of benefitting by starting talk on  the nuclear issue. He makes statements on the Kashmir issue;  however, he knows he cannot get much mileage from it. He will  end up making the United States his adversary which he cannot  afford. There are two reasons for it. One, it is not politically  beneficial to him. Second, he does not see any possibility in  this issue. His statements on economic issues are also hurting  him. For example, when he says that Madam Bhutto has no economic  agenda and she is following his government's economic policies,  he appears to be criticizing Benazir Bhutto. At the same time,  he is also confirming the opinion of people who say that there  is no difference between him and Benazir Bhutto. Both of them  are willing to follow the agenda prepared by the World Bank and  the IMF. We do not know if Nawaz Sharif and his associates are  aware of it.    Becoming a prisoner of one's political image is a common  tendency in politics. Mr. Nawaz Sharif is imprisoned by his  political image to a dangerous level. This could be perilous for  his political future. It is true that his political image is his  greatest political asset, however, this asset could push him  towards political insolvency. This image is as bad as it looks  good from the outside. However, he does not think it necessary  to make any change in or addition to his image. Although, his  political image does not have any elements of dictatorial  practices, he is still showing dictatorial tendencies even after  losing his seat of power. He has not admitted, not even hinted,  that he has made mistakes in the past. He has disappointed his  supporters by constantly saying that he was right and everyone  else was wrong. It is not only difficult, but may be impossible  for him to return to power with this frozen political image.    The fact that Benazir Bhutto is demonstrating political  adaptability merits attention. Even her political opponents are  forced to change their opinion of her. Opposed to her, Nawaz  Sharif who is known for adaptability seems to be a prisoner of  his frozen image and the conventions that go with it. This will  be a major hurdle in his political mobility and efforts for  political penetration.    Madam Bhutto's long campaign against Ghulam Ishaq Khan and  later her compromise with him may have helped her to return to  power, however, it hurt her total image very badly. This harm  could not be measured correctly as she came to power soon after  that. The campaign that Mr. Nawaz Sharif was running against  Benazir Bhutto, instead of against the PPP, could harm him if  there is an occasion where he may have to cooperate (even  temporarily) with Benazir Bhutto. This could become a problem  for Nawaz Sharif's image.    Mr. Mohammed Nawaz Sharif's political future depends on all  these factors. Let us see how much attention will he give to  these facts. At present, he does not seem to be attending to  these.</p>

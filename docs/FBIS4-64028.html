			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Podlipskiy report: "The Government Does Not Want </F> to Have An `Island Of The Far East"]    [Text] Perhaps for the first time in its history the  governmental Commission on Operational Matters has discussed  purely economic problems. The first item on the agenda of the  Soskovets commission's session yesterday was worded in a fairly  all-embracing manner: On the Development Prospects of Maritime  Kray Taking Into Account Russia's Geostrategic and Economic  Interests in the Asian-Pacific Region. The government reacted  seriously to the threat of the Far East's economic split from  European Russia.    A central subject in the discussion of Far Eastern problems  at the commission's session was the growing threat of Russia's  economic disintegration. There are several reasons for such a  threat. First of all Maritime Kray's remoteness. This results  in sharp increases in transportation and energy costs for the  local enterprises, so making them absolutely uncompetitive on  the domestic market (even compared to enterprises located in  European Russia). At the same time Far Eastern ports and  railroad networks ensure 50 percent of Russia's export  infrastructure.    According to First Deputy Economy Minister Andrey  Shapovalyants, keeping Maritime Kray basically viable calls for  approximately $5 billion and 4.5 trillion rubles a year.  Furthermore, the federal government is seriously worried about  China's expansion in this region: At present there are  approximately 150,000 Chinese citizens living in the region  (many of them illegally). The half-hearted measures taken in  the past (fixed coal prices, limited subsidies, and so forth)  alleviated the region's economic burdens only to an extent,  without resolving the problem in principle.    Virtually all the speakers stressed that today there is a  real threat of Maritime Kray's economy breaking away and  integrating into the economic system of the Pacific Rim  countries as a "junior brother" -- a supplier of raw materials.  The gist of the government's reaction to this threat was summed  up by Mr. Shapovalyants. In his opinion, it is necessary to  talk about eventually establishing a "special economic regime"  in the Far East.    It is clear however that spelling out the specific content  of  this term is not a matter for the immediate future (a special  working group will deal with this). Yet even now the main  features of such a "special zone" can be outlined. According to  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, the government  should create conditions for using the raw materials potential  of the Russian Far East precisely in the Far East.    The implementation of this concept could lead to the  formation of a kind of economic enclave -- a part effectively  independent from European Russia and oriented mainly toward the  economically most promising region -- the Pacific Rim. In this  event the main task for the federal government in this region  will be to retain the military and export infrastructure as well  as the local administration's political loyalty.    Also noteworthy is the idea of establishing a "location  rent"  for the Russian/European enterprises, which, although not  discussed at the session, is contained in a memorandum by the  State Industry Committee. This means that the situation of Far  Eastern enterprises is deemed "normal" for Russia's economy  while the others have to pay a kind of tax compensating for  their more favorable geographic position.    True, as the session's results show, far less radical steps  should be expected from the federal government in the near  future. In all likelihood, preferential transport tariffs will  be established for Maritime Kray (the participants were  impressed with the experience of the tsarist government which  used such measures to invigorate economic activity in areas far  away from Moscow). It is also likely that the sum of budget  subsidies for the Maritime region will also be revised.</p>

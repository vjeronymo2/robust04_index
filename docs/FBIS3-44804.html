More than 20 Russian newspapers decided yesterday to stop  publishing from January 11 to 17 when the new parliament opens  its first session and U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Russia.    The move was designed to protest against a November 25  government decree which would raise the printing costs by five  times.    To avert the press revolt, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin  today held talks with the editors-in-chief of these newspapers  and decided to suspend the decree.</p>

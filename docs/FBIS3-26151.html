			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Economic and  Trade Commission will provide training for the nation's cadres  working at enterprises and cadres involved in economic work on  the basic knowledge of socialist market economy. The training  will focus mainly on reform of the fiscal and taxation, finance,  foreign trade, and investment systems and on establishing a  modern enterprise system. Chen Qingtai, vice minister of the  State Economic and Trade Commission, announced this in Beijing  at the ongoing National Work Conference on Training Cadres at  Enterprises.    Chen Qingtai said, as this year is a critical year for  promoting the establishment of a socialist market economic  system and as the reform is approaching the homestretch, there  is a need to train a contingent of entrepreneurs who are adapted  to the socialist market economy and to greatly raise their  political and professional quality to enable them to contribute  to the reform and development of the economy and enterprises.  Main points of the current training program include: stepping  up training of plant directors and managerial personnel to lay a  good foundation for forming a contingent of socialist  entrepreneurs and for raising industrial and economic levels;  helping cadres involved in economic management to gain a better  understanding of the socialist market economy and to bring about  transformation of functions at government departments and to  effect changes in enterprises' operation mechanisms;  strengthening study of existing reform measures so that the  broad mass of cadres involved in economic work and cadres  working at enterprises will understand and support reform and  promote the smooth progress of reform.    Chen Qingtai said the commission plans to basically complete  training of major leading cadres at state-owned large and  mid-sized enterprises: 20,000 by the end of February and 100,000  by the end of May; the commission will strive to basically  complete training of major leading cadres at the nation's  enterprises by end October.    Chen Qingtai pointed out: It is necessary to step up  enacting laws for training of cadres involved in economic work  and cadres working at enterprises; with macroguidance, to  gradually establish mechanisms for training whereby enterprises  will voluntarily offer their own training programs; to conduct  bold experiments; and to constantly promote the development of  training work for cadres working at enterprises amid reform.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (5): Leos go anywhere - Satellites CELLULAR mobile telephones have become a common sight in recent years. They make the user much more accessible than he or she could possibly be using fixed phone networks. But they have one disadvantage. There are parts of the world - considerable parts in fact - that mobile phone networks simply do not reach, writes Paul Chambers. Recently, several companies have come up with ambitious proposals to put this right. They have decided it is technically feasible to turn the typical cellular telephone network on its head. Literally. Instead of having radio transmitters on the ground, put them on board satellites in low earth orbit (Leos for short). The idea is: put enough satellites up there and you will be able to get in touch with a mobile phone anywhere. There are five companies proposing Leo systems: Motorola Satellite Communications of Chandler, Arizona has a system called Iridium, Loral Qualcomm Satellite Services of New York (Globalstar) TRW Space Technology Group of Redondo Beach, California (Odyssey), Constellation Communications of Herndon, Virginia (Aries) and Ellipsat of New York (Ellipso). London-based Inmarsat (International Maritime Satellite Organisation) proposes a service called Inmarsat-P (for portable) which could use a combination of low earth orbit satellites and its existing geostationary satellites. Inmarsat has pioneered voice data and facsimile communications with small terminals. But, to date, they are no smaller than a briefcase, something on which Inmarsat-P and the other systems should improve. The number of satellites proposed varies. Motorola's Iridium will have 66, Globalstar 48, Odyssey 12, Aries 48 and Ellipso 24. All will use circular orbits except Ellipso, whose satellites will use elliptical orbits, hanging high over the parts of the world to be served, before swooping low around the back of the earth. Ellipsat claims this will offer longer coverage of key markets for less satellites and a more cost-effective system. Investment costs will be high. Estimates in alphabetical order are: Aries Dollars 192m, Ellipsat Dollars 230m, Globalstar Dollars 1.2bn, Odyssey Dollars 1.3bn, Iridium Dollars 3.4bn. The cost of offering Inmarsat-P is undisclosed. Competition for investment money is keen. Nearly all the operators had hoped earlier this year to be granted 'pioneer's preference'. This designation, in the gift of the US regulatory body, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would have recognised one company as the pioneer of the low earth orbit idea. Pioneer's preference could have meant the selected operator getting first choice on spectrum, making it easier to get investors on board, explains Mr Joe Tedino, of Loral Qualcomm Satellite Services. In the event, the FCC decided all operators had done equal research on Leos and declined last month to award any operator pioneer's preference. Mr Tedino expresses relief. This 'substantial decision means all operators are on an equal footing to compete for services,' he says. Behind the anxiety over who might or might not get pioneer's preference, there was particular concern about whether Motorola would perhaps corner the market. This led to a move in April by TRW and Loral Qualcomm to get the FCC to deny Motorola permission to launch an experimental version of Iridium. At the time they said they feared launch of an experimental system could 'prejudice the results of licensing' and 'predispose the FCC to choose Motorola'. The FCC later granted Motorola, Constellation, Globalstar and Ellipsat permission to launch experimental satellites. TRW was allowed to simulate service using equipment on aircraft and balloons. But wider anxieties remain. One concern is about how to regulate Leo operators. The European Commission and the US State Department have been in touch about this question. One problem is that licences issued through the US could be taken 'by implication if not necessarily by desire be taken to have validity in Europe,' explains Mr Paul Verhoef of the European Commission. Another concern is about whether the market will support everyone who wants a share of it. 'If the US were to license two systems and if we in Europe would want to license two more, all four could go down the drain,' Mr Verhoef says. Organising frequency is not in itself likely to prove difficult. An international conference in Malaga this year agreed on broad frequency bands for global mobile systems. Now a frequency co-ordination body of the International Telecommunications Union will circulate individual frequency requests to its 172 members and sort out any clashes with existing users on national territories. Day-to-day running and regulation of operators will remain in the hands of national regulatory bodies. At the World Administrative Radio Conference, the idea of creating a kind of Intelsat (International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation) or Inmarsat to regulate the operators of global mobile systems was mooted. But, says Mr Gerald Helman, vice-chairman of the US delegation, there was a 'singular lack of enthusiasm' for the idea. National regulators such as the UK Department of Trade and Industry are happy to retain day-to-day control. Mr Colin Cross of the DTI says: 'We don't feel there is a need for a European regulatory body, let alone a worldwide regulator.' Leos could get off the ground fairly soon. Optimistic estimates see the first satellites going into orbit in 1996 or 1997. Market estimates vary. Mr Roger Rusch of TRW says Odyssey could handle up to 16m subscribers, but the company is doing price calculations on the basis of 0.9m. Motorola says there could be 1.1m voice and data subscribers on Iridium by the year 2001 and 0.7m subscribers for data only. There might be 3.2m subscribers overall by the year 2006. Ellipsat is significantly more ambitious, basing its optimism on the alleged cost effectiveness of its system. 'We confidently expect between 25m and 50m subscribers in the first year alone,' says Mr Scott MacEnearney of Ellipsat. Handsets will not be cheap. Motorola says it could charge Dollars 3,000. At the other end of the spectrum, Ellipsat users will pay Dollars 300 for a so-called Ellipcell which they will install in the boot of their car to boost their car telephone to use the Ellipsat satellites. Airtime prices will also vary. Globalstar users will pay 30 cents a minute for use of space segment (the link between the hand-held terminal and the satellite and back down again), says Mr Tedino. Mr Rusch of TRW says Odyssey users will pay 65 cents a minute. Ellipsat estimates its service will cost 50 cents a minute, while Motorola expects Iridium to cost Dollars 3. No doubt the manoeuvring is not yet over. In August Globalstar backers were reported to have made a bold approach to Inmarsat to drop Inmarsat-P in favour of marketing the Globalstar service. This was not the first time Inmarsat had received such an approach. In February, Motorola made much of an idea to lease Inmarsat capacity on Iridium. Inmarsat never formally admitted that it had received an approach. What is certain is that the US-based operators and the FCC are to get together between November and March next year to make the rules which will govern the operators of Leos. When the rules are clear, no doubt play will start in earnest.</p>

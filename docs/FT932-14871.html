			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Wilde's 'Happy Prince' to music - Theatre Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900) also wrote short stories. The Happy Prince is the subject of an enchanting musical at the Old Fire Station, Oxford. A cast of four, a small band, minimal scenery, it is the quintessence of Wilde's apercu that art should aim to conceal the artist while revealing itself. It makes a fine evening: no sex, no violence, no reality. Sue Casson's light score loosely follows Wilde's story. A statue prince and a migrating swallow help relieve the poverty of a town outside a regal palace; the swallow distributes fragments of gold and gems from the statue, pecks out its sapphire eyes to give away, and the two fall in love as the swallow freezes to death in winter. Wilde left the moral open. The musical flickers between Wilde's fable and musical-verite, of the City of Angels type, where the show draws attention to its own construction. The first number, 'Warm-Up', and the later 'The Tricks of the Trade' are about theatrical illusion; and since Wilde has been modernised, there are sharp contemporary jokes, including Dorothy Parker's line about running the whole gamut of emotions from A to B. Director Tom Blackmore and the cast (John Herriman, Mina Anwar, Andrew Bolton, Sue Casson) produce strong performances, but the voices sometimes fail to meet the demands of Casson's wordy, witty score. The finest numbers are the lulling 'Twilight City' where the swallow circles down en route to warmer climes, and the beautiful soaring 'Swallow's Lament' duet between the statue and the bird. Act two opens with a superb 'The Crowd Scene' which peoples the theatre musically rather than bodily, four different melodies making the stage teem with life. The Old Fire Station, Oxford until April 24 (0865 794494)</p>

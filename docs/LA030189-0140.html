			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BUSH 'DISRESPECTFUL' IN INVITING DISSIDENT TO DINNER, CHINA SAYS  </P> <P> China, in a sharp new rebuke to President Bush, said today that the President  was disrespectful in inviting a leading dissident to a weekend dinner and it  dismissed U.S criticism as "irresponsible remarks."  </P> <P> It was the second time in three days China criticized the United States for the  incident last Sunday when police blocked Fang Lizhi, China's leading dissident,  from attending the farewell dinner given by Bush after his first trip as  President to Beijing.  </P> <P> "Before the banquet, without consulting the Chinese side, the U.S. side sent an  invitation, bypassing the normal channel, to a certain individual unacceptable  to the Chinese side," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement to  reporters. "This act of imposing one's own will on others can only be  interpreted as support for this kind of people and disrespect for the host  country," the statement said.  </P></p>

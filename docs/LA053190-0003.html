			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: PUBLISHING WITH MEAGER RESOURCES  </P> <P> Desktop publishing is a notorious resource hog. The leading programs for IBM PC  compatibles and Macintoshes need fast computers, lots of memory and disk  storage and top-end laser printers to produce superb documents.  </P> <P> A new entrant in the field, Avagio Publishing System, $300, from Unison World  of Alameda, Calif., distinguishes itself by generating remarkably high quality  with modest -- even meager -- resources.  </P> <P> It runs fine on IBM compatibles as old-fashioned as an XT equipped with a small  hard disk and low-resolution CGA graphics. It prints beautifully on a  Hewlett-Packard LaserJet and even acceptably on a nine-pin dot matrix printer.  </P> <P> It comes with its own set of fonts, which can be scaled to any size between six  and 500 points. That's a range from 1/12th inch to nearly 7 inches high, two to  four times what you get from programs costing twice as much or more, such as  PageMaker and Xerox Ventura Publisher.  </P> <P> In addition to producing smooth-edged characters, the scalable fonts take  little storage room on your hard disk. Contrast that with the "downloadable"  fonts that are typical of other programs. They must be created and stored as  font libraries, gobbling up many megabytes of disk space if you want a full  selection.  </P> <P> Avagio also comes with a library of 150 graphic images with which to dress up  publications. (They do take up a lot of space, about 2.2 megabytes of storage.)  </P> <P> The heart of a document usually is the text. With Avagio there are two ways to  enter text. You can type it in, as you would with a word processing program. Or  you can import it.  </P> <P> It is handy to be able to type in the words, but it isn't much fun. There is a  noticeable lag between the time you hit the keys and when your words appear on  screen. (It might be better on a fast machine; I used Avagio on a mediocre  8-megahertz AT clone with an 80286 microprocessor.) Importing text is the best  way to go and easy to do. If you use WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, MultiMate or  WordStar, Avagio will maintain most of your formatting choices when it flows  the text onto the page. Of course, any standard text file, which virtually  every word processing program can create, can be imported. But you'll have to  do all of the formatting in Avagio when you do so.  </P> <P> Text flows into "frames" that you place on the page when you do the layout. You  have complete control over the number of columns on the page -- they can be of  unequal widths -- as well as how text will flow from one column to another.  </P> <P> You can set up frames that size themselves automatically to fit the amount of  text. Automatic flow of text from one page to another is an option.  </P> <P> Hyphenation can be applied to columns of text in two ways. One does it  automatically, based on an algorithm rather than a dictionary. I found a flaw  that the publisher said will be corrected in the next version. It was easy to  fix the improperly broken text that resulted, however. Manual hyphenation is  also available, but tedious. As long as the columns aren't too narrow, pages  are fine without hyphens.  </P> <P> A set of graphics tools allows you to draw boxes, circles and horizontal,  vertical and diagonal lines. It is possible to create a range of interesting  designs. Add some type and you've got a logo.  </P> <P> The program includes only four typefaces, imitations of the classic Times  Roman, Helvetica, Century and Bodoni. But considering the huge range over which  they can be sized and the ability to set bold face, italics, oblique, condensed  and expanded type, you have everything you need to make elegant layouts. In  fact, the absence of additional typefaces will keep pages from becoming garish.  However, a utility program allows soft fonts for Hewlett-Packard laser printers  to be converted for use with Avagio.  </P> <P> To make it easy to repeat document designs, Avagio uses master pages and style  sheets. Master pages can contain repeating elements, such as page numbers in a  header or footer or a company logo. Style sheets store specifications for the  layout and typography of each kind of text element that you will use, such as  for headlines and subheads.  </P> <P> A powerful graphics feature is called "mingle." It allows you to place one  image on top of another (text too) and determine which dominates. You do it by  defining whether the black or white portions of the image will be black, white,  clear or reversed when mingled with another image.  </P> <P> All in all, Avagio is a remarkably complete desktop publishing package that  comes ready to run on nearly any PC.  </P> <P> AVAGIO PUBLISHING SYSTEM  </P> <P> A $300 desktop publishing package that produces fine documents on modest  equipment.  </P> <P> Features: Scalable fonts in any size from 6 to 500 points, clip art collection  of 150 images, high-quality printing on dot matrix and laser printers and style  sheets and master pages to automate document design.  </P> <P> Requirements: IBM PC or compatible with 640 kilobytes of memory, a hard disk  and a graphics monitor.  </P> <P> Publisher: Unison World, Kyocera Unison Inc., 1321 Harbor Bay Parkway, Alameda,  Calif. 94501.

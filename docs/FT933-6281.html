			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rate cut hopes support Nikkei average RENEWED hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate bolstered futures trading, and share prices gained ground on arbitrage related buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average saw its fourth consecutive advance, rising 199.92 to 20,791.68, for a week's gain of 0.9 per cent. The index fell to the day's low of 20,579.56 soon after the opening, but gained ground during the day, hitting a high of 20,863.39 in the final 30 minutes. Volume was 330m shares, topping 300m shares for the first time since August 17. Brokers actively traded on their own accounts, on the first day for September delivery. Advances outnumbered declines by 827 to 169, with 160 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 16.18 to 1,670.54 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.60 to 1274.72. A fall in short-term interest rates encouraged investors. The three month certificates of deposit fell 0.03 percentage points to a record low of 2.85 per cent, while the unsecured overnight call rate, which is closely controlled by the Bank of Japan, also eased. Lower interest rates supported banks and Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y40 to Y3,440 and Bank of Tokyo gained Y40 to Y1,730. Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, rose Y37 to Y834, a new high of the year, on the telecommunications infrastructure theme. Traders also said that some investors were interested in the company's development of a device which calculates the total cost of grocery shopping without taking the goods out of the shopping basket. Enthusiasm toward telecom related stocks supported Oki Electric Industry, which gained Y13 to Y543 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which advanced Y4,000 to Y947,000. Showa Sangyo, a food processing company, rose Y3 to Y614 on hopes that deregulation in the food industry would allow the company to procure raw materials at lower prices. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 236.69 to 22,746.25 in volume of 33.7m shares. Roundup AFTER a week of record performances among the region's markets, many investors chose to take profits ahead of the weekend. HONG KONG saw late demand for blue chips help lift the index from early lows, but profit-taking was in evidence after Thursday's strong performance.

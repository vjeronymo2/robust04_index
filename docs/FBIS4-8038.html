			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stanislaw Cwik under the rubric "One Hundred </F> Words"]    [Text] The Sejm and the president have prepared an  unexpected experiment for the Polish economy. They decided that  decisions concerning wages would be made by company directors,  employees' councils, and trade unions. Thus, we partially  returned to socialism. The prime minister must again appeal to  work forces and to the responsibility of managers.    I believe that there are two solutions to this problem:  first, returning to a new popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] as soon as possible, and second, changing the system  of most state-run enterprises, establishing a one-person  Treasury partnership, and privatization.    The first method has proved itself. However, the fear of a  new popiwek law may result in wage panic today, not to mention  high inflation. The other method calls for some time. It may  also encounter political resistance because not everyone in  Poland supports privatization and modernization of oversized  economic companies.    Each of these scenarios is to a certain extent risky. It  seems, however, that safer is the "escape forward"--that is,  acceleration of the pace of economic reforms. This calls for  specific decisions already today. Also, the work forces of  state-owned companies should be told what they will go through  soon--for example, that there will be no popiwek, but there will  be bankruptcies. Or that not only the rights of various sectors  of our economy will be equalized, but also their duties toward  the Treasury.</p>

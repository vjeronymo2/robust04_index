			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHASE ENDS IN ARREST OF 3 AFTER LATEST JEWEL HEIST;  </P> <P> CRIME: SANTA ANA ROBBERY FITS A PATTERN OF NEARLY 100 SIMILAR THEFTS IN THE  WEST SINCE 1989. THE SUSPECTS MAY BE PART OF A LOS ANGELES COUNTY RING.  </P> <P> A freeway chase from Huntington Beach to Compton ended with the arrests of  three men who allegedly robbed a department store jewelry counter at gunpoint,  the latest in a series of Southland jewel heists, police said Thursday.  </P> <P> And although Orange County police were tight-lipped about investigations of two  similar robberies in the last month, Los Angeles police said the incidents fit  a pattern of nearly 100 similar thefts in the western United States since 1989  that may stem from a criminal network in southwest Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "This is a problem that's been going on for about 10 years in the Los Angeles  area," said Lou Boozell, a longtime investigator with the Los Angeles Police  Department's robbery and homicide bureau, who specializes in jewel thefts. "Now  these people are hitting places in Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties,  Northern California and other western states."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Virgil Kirkland Mahoney, 19, Jesse James Kirkland, 25, and  Michael Taylor, 33, all of Los Angeles, were arrested Wednesday night at the  Alondra Boulevard off-ramp of the Long Beach Freeway. Police said the car in  which the men were riding crashed during a chase that reached speeds in excess  of 100 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The three men were being held in Orange County Jail on $50,000 bail each on  charges of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Police said the suspects entered a Best Products Co. store on the 2800 block of  Bristol Street in Santa Ana at 8:40 p.m., brandished a .38-caliber revolver and  ordered employees not to move.  </P> <P> After failed attempts at breaking into plexiglass jewelry cases, the men kicked  in the backs of three cabinets and removed pieces set with precious gems, along  with gold and silver jewelry, said Ed Medina, district loss prevention manager  for Best Products Co. He did not know the value of the stolen merchandise.  </P> <P> The gun and an undisclosed amount of jewelry were found in the suspects' car,  which had been reported stolen, police said.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach police began the chase at 9 p.m. on the San Diego Freeway near  Beach Boulevard after an officer spotted a car traveling north that matched a  description of the suspects' vehicle.  </P> <P> Officers from Seal Beach and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department  assisted in the arrest, and the suspects were turned over to Santa Ana police.  </P> <P> "We're talking to other agencies that have had similar robberies," said Santa  Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. "It's not that often that the suspects  are arrested in these cases, so it's a break for us."  </P> <P> Hawthorne Police Detective Don Shrum, however, was not as optimistic that the  capture would help crack the growing number of jewelry store holdups.  </P> <P> Hawthorne has had three such thefts in the last six weeks, Shrum said. Two  nights ago, a Zales Jeweler in the Cerritos Mall was robbed in a similar  fashion, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said, and others have occurred  since November in Torrance and Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> In Orange County, three men escaped last Friday afternoon with $450,000 in  diamond jewelry from Black, Starr &amp; Frost jewelers in South Coast Plaza.  Last month, two men were arrested for a robbery at another Best Products store  in Huntington Beach, and in the last two years, more than a dozen jewel  robberies were reported.  </P> <P> "These people might have done this 25 times by the time they are caught," Shrum  said, adding that Los Angeles County police agencies have file photographs of  about 30 suspects arrested in jewel thefts, but that the charges against them  are often dropped because witnesses are unable to positively identify the  robbers.  </P> <P> Boozell said operators of the alleged criminal network hire thieves off the  streets in certain parts of Los Angeles. In most cases they hire men who wear  nondescript clothing and drive stolen cars, he said. "It's like day workers who  hang out waiting for somebody to come by and hire them to do landscaping or  work construction," Boozell explained. "Except these people do robberies. Most  don't know what job they are doing until 10 minutes before they do it."  </P> <P> Agreed Shrum: "They're subcontractors who get paid for doing a job and  delivering the take."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Police Detective Sgt. Ron Smith said authorities are investigating  the possibility that the suspects in the South Coast Plaza incident could be  the same as those in other robberies, or from the same ring of people.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Armenian Republic Supreme Council; place </F> and date not given--read by announcer]    [Text] Having violated the airspace of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic [NKR] on 10 April 1994, the Azerbaijani Republic's Air  Force then bombed a number of NKR communities far from the  fronts, including the capital Stepanakert. The main target of  the attack was the crowded market, where there was an enormous  amount of destruction and many casualties, mostly women and  children.    Regrettably, the international community has not yet paid  appropriate attention to the policy of bombing peaceful  communities that the Azerbaijanis have followed since 1992,  which has given the Azerbaijani authorities free rein to  continue such operations with impunity.    By such savage operations, Azerbaijan is reiterating that it  has not foregone its policy of state terrorism against the  people of the NKR, the aim of which is to annihilate the  civilian population in gross violation of international law,  particularly the Geneva Convention. This policy is designed to  expand the conflict and undermine the recently instituted peace  initiatives.    The Armenian Republic's Supreme Council declares that the  Azerbaijani side will bear full responsibility for any such  operations. It calls on the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the  CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the Europarliament, and the  parliaments of the world to strongly condemn these military  operations against civilians and to take effective and urgent  measures as envisaged by international law to prevent the  further bombing of communities and to end the unacceptable  behavior by the Azerbaijani Republic.</p>

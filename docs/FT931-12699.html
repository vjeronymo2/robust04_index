			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Italy likely to cut interest rates Lower Italian inflation figures made a cut in official interest rates likely in the near term, according to the industrial employers' federation Confindustria, Reuter reports from Rome. 'We expect a reduction in the discount rate relatively soon,' said Mr Innocenzo Cipolletta, head of research. Italian inflation fell to 4.3 to 4.4 per cent year-on-year in January from 4.8 per cent in December, according to data from the city of Bologna. The figures are unofficial but are taken as an accurate guide to consumer inflation. Official figures are released early next month. The discount rate now stands at 12 per cent. Meanwhile, the Italian budget minister, Mr Franco Reviglio, said yesterday that the forecast of 1.5 per cent GDP growth for 1993 was unrealistic and that the government now expected growth of between 0.5-0.9 per cent this year. 'A GDP growth of 1.5 per cent, as forecast, is now unrealistic. Today we expect a GDP growth for 1993 of between 0.5 and 0.9 per cent,' Mr Reviglio told journalists. 'Every one point fall in GDP adds L10 trillion lire to the budget deficit,' he added. The 1993 budget deficit target is L150 trillion.</p>

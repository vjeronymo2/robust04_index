			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> NESTING PLATFORMS: For more than 10 years, great blue herons have nested in  eucalyptus trees at the Santa Ana River Lakes in Anaheim. The "lakes," site of  a fishing concession, are recharge basins controlled by the Orange County Water  District near where Tustin Avenue crosses the Riverside Freeway.  </P> <P> Last year, 14 nests produced 12 great blue heron chicks. And once the herons  finished nesting, double-crested cormorants used the same nests and  successfully raised young. Five nests produced 11 cormorant chicks, the first  time the birds are known to have nested in the county.  </P> <P> Ironically, increased nesting activity and perhaps other environmental factors  have damaged the trees. In an effort to protect the bird habitat, artificial  nesting structures will be built at the site by the County Environmental  Management Agency, with advice from the state Fish and Game Department.  </P> <P> Erection of four nesting poles, each with three platforms, was to be completed  in February but was delayed by a paper-work mix-up, according to Dale Dillon of  the county environmental agency. His agency could put up the poles within two  weeks, but that may be too late: herons at the site have already started to  collect materials to reinforce nests from past seasons and will be laying eggs  in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> Esther Burkett, a biologist for Fish and Game who is advising on the project,  said erection of the poles may have to wait until next year if she decides the  project will disturb the nesting birds too much. Whether the poles go up or not  this year, the damaged trees will remain for the time being.  </P> <P> Burkett believes this is the first time in California that nesting structures  of this type will be tried for great blue herons, although they have been used  successfully in Minnesota.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana River Lakes site is the largest of several known great blue heron  rookeries in the county (the rookeries are small, with only 24 to 30 total  nests known in the county). Others include a few nests on an island in Anaheim  Lake, some at undeveloped Wagon Wheel Regional Park, and at Irvine Lake.  </P> <P> SPEAKING OF BIRDS: Among the rare bird-sightings reported in January by Doug  Willick, who compiles the sightings for American Bird magazine, is a pine  warbler spotted at Yorba Regional Park on Jan. 14 and presumed to be wintering  there. A common bird of the Eastern pine forests, this marks the first time the  pine warbler has been recorded in Orange County.  </P> <P> An immature bald eagle spotted flying through Upper Newport Bay on Jan. 29 was  only the second recorded sighting in the county in more than 10 years.  Historically, the bird wintered in the county in small numbers.  </P> <P> The American white pelicans that descended on the east Anaheim area in  unprecedented numbers (several hundred were counted) peaked in December and  have been gradually leaving the area. Several dozen of the impressive birds  remain and are often seen in the Santa Ana River Lakes area.  </P></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles in DM34.2m buy COURTAULDS TEXTILES has agreed to acquire the broad stretch fabric manufacturing operations of Gold-Zack Werke in Murg, Germany and Manila in the Philippines for an expected total of DM34.2m (Pounds 13.9m) cash. The businesses being acquired sell primarily to the international lingerie market and their purchase will strengthen and geographically expand Courtaulds Textiles' position in this market, particularly in the Far East. Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to various conditions including regulatory approval, Courtaulds Textiles will acquire selected trading assets in Germany and the entire share capital of Gold-Zack Philippines. Some DM17m of assets, net of a small amount of local debt in the Philippines, are being acquired. The combined businesses generated DM5.1m of operating profits last year on sales of DM65m. Mr Noel Jervis, managing director, said: 'This acquisition will enhance our established position in the German stretch fabric market and will provide an additional base from which to supply the large and rapidly growing market in the Far East. 'Our customers, which include the world's leading lingerie manufacturers, are spreading their businesses internationally and we are correspondingly developing our business so that we can meet their requirements on a local basis through our global network.' Courtaulds Textiles' existing stretch fabric businesses in Europe include Penn Nyla and Courtaulds Jersey in the UK, Penn Elastic in Germany, Penn Italia, Penn France and Penn Sedespa in Spain. In Asia the group's stretch fabric interests include the Penn Asia joint venture in Thailand.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Brazilians try to quell violence BRAZILIANS yesterday expressed outrage at news of the country's third reported massacre in five weeks, as government officials met in Rio de Janeiro to seek a solution to the outbreaks of violence, agencies report from Rio de Janeiro. Members of Congress have called for federal intervention in the city's militarised police, who are under investigation for alleged participation in the latest massacre, in which 21 slum-dwellers were gunned down on Sunday. Such federal intervention would have precedent. Last month, the army was brought in to tackle organised crime among the police of the north-eastern state of Alagoas. About 20 hooded gunmen armed with automatic weapons burst into the Vigario Geral shantytown in northern Rio on Sunday. That appeared to be revenge for the killings there of four police officers, possibly by drug traffickers, the night before.</p>

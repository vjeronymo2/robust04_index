However, taking inflation into account, the figure represents a  decrease in real terms, Francois Godet, deputy secretary general  of the Federal Military Department (DMF), told ATS.    Since 1987's record figure (Sf578.3 million), the amount of  arms exports has dropped each year. Mr. Godet says this  downward trend can be explained by increased arms sales by  "threshold countries," such as the former Communist countries in  East Europe.  <H5>  European Union as the Main Customer </H5>   In 1993, Switzerland's biggest individual customer was  Malaysia, with sales amounting to Sf50.7 million. Germany  ranked second (Sf41.5 million), followed by Saudi Arabia (Sf36.9  million). From a geographical point of view, the European Union  is the main purchaser of Swiss arms at Sf79.1 million, followed  by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both totaling Sf45  million.    Other major customers include Sweden and Singapore (Sf16  million each), Canada (11.9 million), the United States (Sf8.6  million), Austria (Sf7.6 million), the Philippines (Sf4.1  million), the Netherlands (Sf3.8 million), and Brazil (Sf1.4  million). The smallest customer was Estonia, which spent Sf21  [as received] for explosives and chemicals for civil use.</p>

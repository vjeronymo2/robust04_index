			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (1): Technology for a second take-off - Diversification and broader regional development are the challenges facing Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees, writes John Ridding, introducing this three-page survey of France's biggest region Toulouse, one of Europe's oldest university cities, has bet its future on brain power. So far, the bet has paid dividends. Since the 1960s, the capital city of the Midi-Pyrenees has confirmed its position as a centre of high technology manufacturing and France's second university city and research centre. From Aerospatiale to Alcatel and from Motorola to Matra Marconi, many leading French and international groups have put down roots in the city and its environs. They have done so partly because of the policies of the government in Paris, which has sought to reverse the concentration of economic activity in the capital. The decision in the 1960s to locate France's space and aeronautics research centres in Toulouse, followed by the later transfer of engineering schools and state-owned industry, laid the foundation for private sector investment in aerospace, electronics and related sectors. Spared the burden of declining smokestack industries and blessed with an enticing environment, the city has proved a magnet for many of the leading industries of the next century. But the success of the Toulouse experiment is not yet secure. Recession has shaken the aerospace sector and many of the city's other main industries, applying the brakes to its headlong expansion over the past three decades. Beyond the city limits, it is a similar story. From Tarbes, near the border with Spain, to Rodez in the north-east, the Midi-Pyrenees, France's largest region, is being forced to adjust to the harsher economic environment that is confronting traditional industry and agriculture. The continued development of Toulouse now depends on the strategies being employed to ensure a rebound from recession. Equally important is the need to redress an imbalance between the development of the city and the rest of the region. 'Our biggest problem is a problem of two worlds,' says Mr Robert Marconis, professor of geography at Toulouse University. 'Growth has not been diffused from Toulouse in the way that had been expected.' On the first count, the rebound from recession, Toulouse officials are confident. Mr Dominique Baudis, the mayor, points out that the decline in the aerospace sector, one of the city's largest employers, is a cyclical rather than a structural phenomenon. He believes, along with the management of Aerospatiale and Airbus, that recovery in the sector should be under way by 1996. More important, perhaps, is Mr Baudis' argument that the Toulouse economy is increasingly less dependent on the aerospace sector. 'Aerospace is an important engine for the economy,' he says. 'But we have a powerful electronics industry and have seen a promising diversification into new activities such as medical equipment and biotechnology.' Toulouse should also continue to benefit from an inflow of foreign investment. Storagetek, the US data storage group, is the most recent arrival and has pushed the number of foreign investors to almost 300 since Motorola built its first European plant in the city in 1967. Like many other international investors, Storagetek says it was drawn by the close links between industry and research centres such as Laas, the robotics and automation institute. The strength of Toulouse's research base is vital. Not only does it draw investment from existing companies, it encourages the creation of indigenous small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Jean-Pierre Gilly, director of Lerep, the economic research institute, says that a number of new companies have sprung up around the larger aeronautic groups. The process has been stunted by recession and the region's relatively weak venture capital base. But it provides a source of growth. For Mr Baudis, the research and technology base in Toulouse is also essential to compete with rival European business centres, from Montpellier to Milan. 'If you look at European cities we are 50th in terms of size. Our strategy has to be to create a pool of excellence,' he says. 'We are in a difficult part of the cycle, but there is much more future in high technology and aerospace than in steel or cars.' If Toulouse has the capacity to rebound with a more diversified and high technology industrial base, however, the problems facing the rest of the Midi-Pyrenees are more complex. 'The key problem at the moment is how to make the rest of the region dynamic,' says Mr Marconis of Toulouse University. For many officials in towns outside Toulouse, the rise of the regional capital has led to a concentration of resources and a vexing imbalance. 'We need to have a more equal growth,' says Mr Raymond Erracaret, the pragmatic Communist mayor of Tarbes, and a critic of what he calls 'Toulousain imperialism'. Tarbes, like other towns in the Midi-Pyrenees, is attempting to adjust to the pressures facing traditional industry. Giat, the arms manufacturer, is just one example of an important local employer that is cutting jobs and reducing production. In Albi, to the north-east of Toulouse, the challenge is to replace the jobs and subcontractors removed by the decline of the mining sector. In most cases, the strategies being pursued are bearing fruit. Adirac, a public and private sector association which promotes industrial development in Albi, has created more than 2,000 jobs, partly through the support of a venture capital fund which targets small and medium-sized industry. The development of its tourist sector, a growth area for all of the region, has also strengthened Albi's resilience, while the transfer of some faculties from Toulouse University, including materials research, should encourage industrial investment. How far such transfers should go is a hotly debated topic. 'There is an important gap and we should reduce it,' says Mr Baudis, referring to the imbalance between Toulouse and other regional cities. But for him, as for most observers, the solution lies in providing the means for neighbouring towns to share in the growth of Toulouse rather than depriving the regional capital of resources. This could be facilitated, for example, through an improvement in communications and transport networks. The recently completed autoroutes to Albi and Tarbes are examples of this strategy. For Mr Baudis, there is a need to go further. In particular, he sees the potential for a high-speed railway link, bypassing Bordeaux on its way from northern France and heading on to Narbonne and Barcelona. Such a project would strengthen the close economic and social links with Spain and present Toulouse as the crossroads between northern Europe and the Iberian peninsula. Plans have long been on the drawing board for such a project, but are unlikely to be realised in the next 10 to 15 years. Of more immediate concern for many of the inhabitants of the region are the problems afflicting the agricultural sector. The biggest imbalance, however, lies between the towns and the countryside. The effects of the European Union's common agricultural policy and the production cuts demanded by the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations have added to the hardships of the farming community and fuelled the long-term trend of rural exodus. Mr Etienne Lapeze, vice-president of the FNSEA, the agricultural workers' organisation, estimates that 10,000 of the region's 80,000 farms could disappear as a result of the CAP and Gatt. The impact on the Midi-Pyrenees has been particularly hard because of the lack of agricultural processing industry in the region. 'We are mainly primary producers in areas such as cereals and oil products,' says Mr Lapeze. 'It is vital that we invest more in agriculture.' Also important, he argues, is the need to extend production in new sectors. He cites the seeds industry as one important area of development for the agricultural sector. Without such investment and the introduction of higher value added agro-industries, the gap between town and country, and particularly between the agrarian economy and Toulouse, seems set to widen.  -------------------------------------------        GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (FFR M)  ------------------------------------------- Year        Region         France  ------------------------------------------- 1987       187,790      5,336,652 1988       199,978      5,735,092 1989       222,929      6,159,080 1990       235,549      6,491,977  ------------------------------------------- GDP per capita (in FFr)  ------------------------------------------- 1990        96,894        114,671  ------------------------------------------- Sources: Atals des regions 1993, Insee  -------------------------------------------</p>

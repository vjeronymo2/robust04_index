			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / People: Computer speak Computers which understand spoken English and reply in kind have hitherto been the stuff of fantasy; now they are fast becoming a reality. Jeff Fishel is co-founder and managing director of a new UK firm - the Talking Computer Company - which markets a personal computer designed to appeal to executives who object to keyboards. Fishel and co-founder Len Palladino say there is powerful interest in their machine, a personal computer which accepts commands and gives responses in natural language. The Pounds 12,500 computer itself is comparatively orthodox, but a training session is necessary to accustom the computer to the voice of each individual user. Fishel (above left) has experience both of telecommunications and computing; he was country manager in Germany for a French computing services company and before founding the TCC he ran Intercom, a telecommunications software company. Palladino (above right), a US citizen, spent four years as European vice-president of Alpha Microsystems following senior positions with General Automation and Northern Telecom. TCC's director of technology, Kit Smith, is also technical director of Aptech, which is providing the technology behind TCC's speech recognition methods. ***** Jamie Minotto has been appointed md of PEGASUS SOFTWARE. ***** Roy Davis has been appointed operations director of TRICOM; he moves from Wyatts. Mike Burgess is promoted to product marketing director. ***** Jeff Barnes has been appointed md of NOVELL UK and its director north west Europe; he moves from International Software. ***** Roger Webb has been appointed a director of SHERWOOD COMPUTER SERVICES. ***** Roger Allen has been appointed to the board of NCR. ***** John Bateman, formerly md of SD-Scicon, has been appointed md of EDS-SCICON.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- New party Sakigake  [Harbinger Party] leader Masayoshi Takemura threatened Thursday  [14 April] to break away from the eight-month-old ruling  coalition.    Takemura, appearing on TV ASAHI's "News Station" program,  said, "nowadays, some politicians say the coalition should expel  Sakigake or the Social Democratic Party (SDP), so our party has  come to be regarded as fragile."    "Our party does not have an unconditional desire to remain  in  the government," whatever humiliation it may suffer, said  Takemura, who has exerted his influence as the chief cabinet  secretary under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced  last Friday he is resigning.    "Because we have that resolve (to splinter if necessary), we  are now speaking our mind," said Takemura, leader of a small  coalition component formed by 15 members of the 511-seat House  of Representatives.    But Takemura hinted that if the coalition's majority group  led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] stop trying to  marginalize him, Sakigake is ready to continue to put its weight  behind the coalition to keep it in power.    His comments came as the three-way caucus of Sakigake, the  SDP and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) is confronting the  Shinseito-led camp that includes Komeito [Clean Government  Party] and Hosokawa's Japan New Party over who should be the  next premier.    Takemura has reportedly been squabbling with Shinseito  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the  coalition's most influential politician, over who should take  the role of the behind-the-scenes fixer in deciding the course  of the coalition government.    "I believe neither our side nor their camp think we may  allow  the coalition to dissolve," Takemura said.    "I do not want to allow the current combination of coalition  parties to crumble, either," he said. "I do not dislike Mr.  Ozawa and I believe we can get along with each other."    "However, his repentance and readiness to restart is  necessary," Takemura said.</p>

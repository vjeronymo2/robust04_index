			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (22): Immigrants drawn to US in greater numbers MEXICAN migration to the US shows little sign of falling significantly, in spite of more border patrol agents, fences and other mechanisms to keep immigrants out. According to the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service, the number of immigrants apprehended along the border rose to 1,203,754 in the 12 months to October 1993, from 1,146,698 in the same period the year before. While such figures overstate the number of immigrants, since many will be caught crossing several times, the Colegio de la Frontera, a leading research institute in Tijuana, estimated around 300,000 immigrants illegally entered the US last year from the border. The picture shows would-be immigrants crossing the Rio Grande. President Carlos Salinas likes to argue that Nafta will provide Mexicans with jobs at home, and thus lower migration to the US. However, academic evidence is unclear. The restructuring in Mexico's economy that is likely to be wrought by Nafta may in the short term increase migration, especially from the rural sector.</p>

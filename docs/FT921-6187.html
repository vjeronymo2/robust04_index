			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Targets of pension trustees criticised TRUSTEES of pension funds should set more demanding targets for their investment managers, Mr Tim Congdon, economist at discount house Gerrard and National, said yesterday. Speaking at the National Association of Pension Funds annual investment conference in Eastbourne, he criticised trustees for typically expecting real long-term returns of only 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent, whereas the economic expectation was for 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent. 'It is not surprising that there has been a tendency for funds to throw up persistent surpluses,' he said. He was puzzled that companies had failed to provide inflation-proofed benefits during the 1980s even though investment returns had been very high. He was less optimistic about the near future. The ratio of dividends to gross domestic product was 'somewhat high', he said. The total return from equity market investment could be expected in the 1990s to be 'somewhat less' than the historic norm. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, called for the support of fund managers in implementing accounting reforms. 'There will be a backlash against what we are doing,' he warned, giving as an example protests by the banks against board proposals on accounting for the balance-sheet effects of securitisation of loans. He added that fund managers might value information in company accounts about staff and training, but companies would be very resistant. 'You will have to speak up if you want that,' he said.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (5): Will small be beautiful? - Lillehammer in context / There are already signs that these Games may avoid some of the problems associated with previous Winter Olympics The selection of a location for the Winter Olympics has always thrown up more dilemmas and anomalies than the summer counterpart. Few sites in the climate necessary for winter sports have the resources necessary to cope with the influx of contestants, officials, spectators and media, and, in particular, with the demands of television. The commercialisation of the Winter Olympics - and the professional status of some of the competitors - also appear in sharper relief against a background of snow-covered hills. Indeed, Avery Brundage, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1952 to 1972 believed the Winter Games had no place in the Olympic movement, a view which has long since given way under the subsequent regimes of Lord Killanin and Juan Antonio Samaranch to a new policy of accepting commercial realities while trying to avoid the worst excesses. The question, therefore, is whether the Lillehammer games, which take place only two years after the last games at Albertville in order to put summer and winter games on different four-year cycles, can resolve these dilemmas and create an event which will be both successful and fully in line with Olympic ideals. It does start with the advantage of a central Olympic Village based on a town of 23,000. Its predecessor in 1992, Albertville in France, was criticised as a Games wholly tailored to TV. To the athletes, Albertville was a set of disparate, mini world championships, not an Olympics where they could chat and pass time with people from other disciplines, a serious objective of any Games. In Norway, seven of the 12 sports, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies, will be staged in Lillehammer's Olympic Park - all its facilities merged carefully with the terrain in what must be the most environmentally sensitive Winter Games. The Birkebeineren Ski Stadium hosting the cross-country is a part of it, and within walking distance of the town centre. The free-style skiing stadium is also here, staging aerials for the first time as a full event, and the moguls (bumps) introduced at Albertville. The ski jumps are fashioned against a nearby hillside 'like a drop of liquid.' It is, we are told, an architectural solution to the problem of accommodating 120-metre and 90-metre jumps and 50,000 spectators. The Hakon Hall, housing the big ice hockey matches, is also designed to blend into the landscape as one of the many 'green goals' which the organising committee has set for itself. Fifty kilometres and about an hour's drive to the north, Kvitfjell will stage the men's and women's downhill and super giant slalom. Its style is more Canadian, even Scottish, than Alpine. The 3,150-metre downhill course falls 850 metres from the treeless heights of Norway's geologically ancient mountains through a belt of forest, pastures, then more conifers, to the valley floor. One big jump just before the finish will send racers flying over the Oslo-Trondheim railway line. Bernhard Russi, Switzerland's former Olympic and world downhill champion, has designed it with much more chance of approbation than was won by Val d'Isere's visually stunning but cliff-like course which had even the champion, Austria's Patrick Ortlieb, declaring he would never want to ski it again. The checks were so fierce that at one point near the end the racers almost ground to a halt. Slaloms are at Hafjell, down-valley from Kvitfjell, while on the other flank of Lake Mjosa, at the outpost of Hunderfossen, bobsleigh and luge are serviced by runs almost invisible except when floodlit at night. The southernmost venues, about an hour south of Lillehammer, are at Hamar, a small town where the ice rink will host figure skating, short-track skating and speed skating. Hamar's Olympic Hall resembles a massive Viking longship turned upside down. Equally striking is the nearby Gjovik ice rink. It is a massive underground cavern blasted out of the rock in the centre of the town and entered via a 150-metre tunnel. Some of the ice hockey will be staged there. Norway's pride is that it is the cradle of skiing. The Nordic Games long pre-dated the Olympics and the role of the melancholy but remarkable peasant, Sondre Norheim, in fashioning the modern ski shape and fixed binding, is as fetching as that of Fridtjof Nansen. The explorer's book By Ski Across Greenland, published in 1890 and translated into many languages, alerted the world outside Scandinavia to the pleasures of skiing. When the XVII Winter Olympic Games are completed on February 27, eight men will leave Lillehammer on the 16,000-kilometre journey to Nagano, Japan - hosts of the 1998 Games - using only man, dog and sail-power as they traverse the northern coastline of Russia and Siberia before crossing the Bering Strait to Alaska and thence by Aleutian Island hops to Japan. With all their modern contrivance, the Olympics retain a thread of community spirit. The Norwegian ski teams are raising what funds they can for the city of Sarajevo, where the ski hills now are used for shelling. Lillehammer's XVII Games will surely convey a better message to the world.</p>

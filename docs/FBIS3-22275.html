			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Approval of the latest  Beijing development blueprint by the Chinese State Council has  unveiled a vision of a new modern world metropolis at the end of  the century.    The State Council stressed the importance of Beijing as the  capital of the People's Republic of China and the country's  political and cultural center.    The blueprint, published together with the approval by the  municipal government last month, maps out the course of the  building of the city into a cultural and economic center with  first-class public utilities, infrastructure facilities and  living environment.    It also calls for important government buildings and  cultural  institutions to be located in downtown areas, such as along the  north-south axis of the city, Chang'an Boulevard and the second  ring road.    Buildings relegated to this class include the economic and  trade office of the State Council, the Ministries of Foreign  Affairs, Communications and Culture, the National Grand Theater  and National Women's Center.    According to the city's layout for 1991-2010, the future  urban construction will place emphasis on the characteristics of  the capital, and on the adjustment of the industrial structures  and the use of land.    Start-ups of new heavy industrial plants, especially big  power- consumers and those that may cause serious water and air  pollution, will no longer be allowed in urban districts.  Meanwhile, the existing ones would not be expanded.    The total population of permanent residents in the city will  be brought under stricter control, to a limit of 12.5 million by  the year 2010.    Air, water, garbage and noise pollution will be reduced  drastically in the coming 20 years, with the aim of making  Beijing a pollution-free city by the year 2010.    The document stipulates that all environmental quality  indices will reach the government's standard in that period.    The city will cut its use of coal greatly in the coming two  decades by piping natural gas in from Shaanxi and Gansu  Provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest  China.    In addition, several hydroelectric power stations will be  built to supply heat to most of the urban residents who still  use coal for heating.    The emission of exhaust gas will be put under control to  further reduce air pollution.    People in Beijing will also be drinking cleaner water, as  major reservoirs and underground water sources will be better  protected. The city also plans to build 16 new sewage-treatment  plants in the next 20 years.    Meanwhile, more trees will be planted, and ecological zones,  shelterbelts and parks will be built in the urban areas. By  2010 the total green land will climb to 6,400 ha [hectares] from  3,00 ha at present. The forest coverage will rise to 40 percent.    Officials say that Beijing has achieved major progress in  environmental protection over the past few years. So far, some  25 percent of urban sewage is treated before it is discharged  into rivers, and the forest coverage rate in the urban areas has  reached 30.7 percent.    The document also urges a quickening of the pace of the  urban  infrastructure modernization drive. The focus will be on the  expansion of the city's transportation, including subways, light  rail traffic and expressways.    As a city with a long history and serving as the capital of  several dynasties, the future construction will also be  integrated with the brilliant culture of the nation. Beijing's  cultural relics and scenic spots will be better protected,  according to the blueprint.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Bankers and small business RELATIONS BETWEEN Britain's high-street banks and its small and medium-sized businesses are under severe strain as the recession drags on. Talk of the renewal of a British 'enterprise culture' during the 1980s has rung increasingly hollow as the number of small company failures has grown. Their banks have been unable to get back overdrafts and short-term loans secured on property that has fallen in value. The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales rose from 9,400 in 1988 to some 22,000 in 1991. A continued attrition appears inevitable as banks burned by bad debts refuse loans to highly geared businesses. Nearly half of National Westminster's Pounds 1.3bn provision in UK branch banking last year was against loans of less than Pounds 50,000. In this unhappy climate, one bank chief executive has suggested that the system of financing small business should be fundamentally rethought. Mr Brian Pearse, of HSBC's Midland Bank, says that a 'partnership' of banks, businesses and the government is required to wean smaller companies from their addiction to short-term debt financing. Mr Pearse has a number of ideas. He thinks the government should provide tax breaks to individuals who invest in equity capital for local businesses. He also believes Britain should imitate the German KfW bank by providing a subsidy so that banks can provide medium and long-term loans at 1 percentage point above base rates, rather than the current 2 to 3 points. Mr Pearse does not absolve banks from blame. He thinks they need to improve risk assessment, and offer businesses new forms of debt finance. But many will sniff self-interest in his plan. The banks have weakened their capital by paying out uncovered dividends in the past few years. Although Midland's capital is now backed by that of its parent, UK banks would like to be eased over the awkward phase before retained profits recover. Shareholders who are unhappy at their record might well hesitate to subscribe to fresh rights issues. This suggests the government should exercise caution before offering even the Pounds 67m Mr Pearse believes his scheme would cost at most. This does not detract from the validity of his more general point, that British financing of small businesses requires a rethink. Many businesses have been tempted into accepting an excess of short-term debt from banks by the lack of equity alternatives. One recent study found that 58 per cent of debt held by small companies in Britain was in the form of overdrafts, compared with only 14 per cent in Germany. Midland is not alone in thinking incentives are needed to lessen this dependence. Several business organisations have called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to provide tax incentives to increase capital in his forthcoming budget. Corporation tax is biased against equity funding and capital gains tax is set at 40 per cent - the same as the top rate of personal income tax. Mr Lamont will be right to respond.</p>

These included  Jamal-al-Din Farghali, commander of the Islamic Group's military  wing in Upper Egypt; Muhammad al-'Abbasi; Husayn Mahmud; and 10  other group leaders.    AL-AHALI has obtained information proving that among the  12,000 employees of these private security firms, 400 are police  officers who receive monthly salaries ranging from 3,000 to  7,000 pounds and 1,500 are Islamic groups' members who were  formerly in Afghanistan. The Egyptian Afghans were employed on  the recommendation of Gulf princes who are major shareholders in  these security firms. According to our information, 87 of these  Egyptian Afghans have participated in terrorist operations since  1989.    The reports also say that many Arab figures suspected of  links to Egypt's terrorist groups own shares in these firms  valued at more than $5 million. The list of shareholders  includes 'Abd-al-Rahman Ladin's three sons. These are Usamah  Bin-Ladin, who founded a "base" as a way station for al-Jihad  leaders who formerly traveled to Afghanistan from Saudi Arabia,  and his brothers Badr and Tariq. Usamah Bin-Ladin visited Egypt  prior to the execution of several major terrorist operations.    The three brothers' shares in one private security firm are  worth $1.2 million.    Other shareholders include Zayd al-Mutawakkil from Yemen who  owns shares worth $250,000. Reports link him to training camps  for Arab Afghans in Yemen's Sa'dah District.    Two United Arab Emirates nationals, Fahd al-Qasim who owns  shares worth $350,000 and Sultan Bin-al-Muhyi who has $300,000  worth of shares, have connections with government circles in  Tehran.    The list of shareholders goes on: Hasan Fanjanri ($500,000),  Muhammad Ahmad Hasan ($400,000), Al-Mahdi Bin-Ibrahim Sultan  ($350,000), Nimr-al-Ward Zaki ($300,000), al-'Aris  Bin-al-Majdawi ($250,000), Fathi al-Fadl ($250,000), Zakariya  al-'Urabi ($200,000), Ahmad Bin-'Abd-al-Muta'ali al-Husayni  ($200,000), 'Abd-al-Rahim al- Mu'izz ($150,000), Bandar  al-Shihabi ($150,000), and Shaykh 'Abd-al- 'Aziz al-Fadl  (250,000 Egyptian pounds).    These security firms prepared 2,400 dossiers containing  important data about Egyptian public figures, including the  official's position, address, telephone numbers at home and  work, and the names and abilities of his bodyguards. Also  included were the routes followed by the motorcades of senior  officials and the places they frequently visited, in addition to  data on their wives and children.    Some private security firms were thus a major link in the  chain and supplied information and detailed maps of the  movements of senior officials who were the target of terrorist  operations in recent years.    According to information obtained by a major government  department, the terrorist groups sought to penetrate the  country's security agencies by offering private security jobs to  senior security officials. They aimed to establish a "parallel"  Interior Ministry but with objectives different from those of  the real ministry.    Based on this information, Major General Hasan al-Alfi  decided soon after he became interior minister and prior to the  unsuccessful attempt on his life, to rescind the private  security firms' licenses. He asked security officials employed  by them to leave those private jobs.</p>

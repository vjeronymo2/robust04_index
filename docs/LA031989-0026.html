			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: TONE LOC: TOO 'WILD' TO BE NO. 1?  </P> <P> Just how many records do you have to sell to go No. 1 in Billboard magazine?  </P> <P> Ask Tone Loc. The local rapper's raucous hit, "Wild Thing," sold 2.5 million  copies, making it the best-selling single since "We Are the World." (It's also  the cheapest mega-platinum single in years -- it cost $500 to make.)  </P> <P> But despite easily outselling its chart rivals -- some weeks by nearly 3-to-1  -- "Wild Thing" never made it past No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.  </P> <P> This odd milestone has caused a mini-uproar in the record industry. The loudest  complaints have come from the Loc people, who are now publicly criticizing the  respected industry trade publication's formula for determining its singles  chart rankings.  </P> <P> "When you sell 2.5 million singles -- more records, times two, than any single  in years -- how can you not call that a No. 1 record?" said Marty Schwartz,  Loc's manager and an Island Pictures consultant who helped bring Loc's label,  Delicious Vinyl, to Island Records. "We were beating our heads against the wall  -- I've gotten calls from people everywhere who can't believe we didn't make  it."  </P> <P> Schwartz's complaint focuses on Billboard's chart methodology. Unlike the  magazine's album charts, which are based solely on sales figures, the Hot 100  rankings are determined by a combination of record-store sales rankings and  airplay reports from 240 pop stations.  </P> <P> According to Billboard chart director Michael Ellis, 40 to 50 stations --  nearly 1/6 of all reporting radio outlets -- never played "Wild Thing," either  because the program directors dislike rap music or found the song sexually  suggestive. The song also suffered because Billboard's reporting record stores  only tally sales rankings, not actual sales figures. So while "Wild Thing" may  have clearly outsold its rivals, its sales ranking didn't necessarily reflect  the width of the margin.  </P> <P> Schwartz says Billboard needs to update its system. "I have nothing against the  chart guys, who've been very understanding," he said. "But 'Wild Thing' was a  genuine pop phenomenon -- and the system just didn't reflect the buying choices  of a new generation of pop fans. If Billboard's reporting stations won't play  such an enormous hit, then maybe Billboard shouldn't be using them as  indicators of what makes a No. 1 single."  </P> <P> Ellis responded: "I don't feel we're off base. Our charts simply showed we had  an outstanding selling record that wasn't as widespread a radio hit as other  songs it competed against. Call it a matter of regional differences in musical  tastes or whatever, but the single simply didn't get played in a lot of Midwest  and Bible Belt areas. Maybe some radio programmers are being stubborn or  prejudiced. But our job isn't to tell them what to play. We just report on the  tastes of the marketplace."  </P> <P> Ellis did acknowledge that it was "unusual" for a song with such phenomenal  sales to stop short of No. 1. "I would call it an aberration -- an odd  occurrence. But it isn't unprecedented. George Michael's 'I Want Your Sex' was  a huge seller -- and never went No. 1 either. A lot of stations in the South  never played it. Listen, we have stations that won't play Barbra Streisand  records. That doesn't mean they're bad reporting outlets."  </P> <P> Still, Ellis says Billboard is undergoing a "major re-evaluation" of its  charts. By next January, the publication will adopt a computerized system that  will allow it to monitor radio play in major markets and collect actual sales  figures from local stores.  </P> <P> "We do take these occurrences into account when we plan for the future," he  said. "It's still just a possibility, but with our new precise computer  information we could someday divide things up into a Hot 100 airplay chart and  a Hot 100 sales chart. We're always looking for ways to make our system more  responsive -- and more accurate."  </P></p>

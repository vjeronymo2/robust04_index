			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following is the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry  report for the 27 January battle situation: The Armenian units,  which are trying to aggravate the situation in the southwest of  our Republic, launched a new attack yesterday against Goradiz,  which is a communications hub. Our soldiers fought heroically  and brought the Armenians' efforts to naught. Having failed to  break through our Army's lines, the enemy withdrew after losing  nearly 200 men.    Our Armed Forces' units are continuing to consolidate the  new  positions they occupied in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. The  strategically important motor roads in this area are under the  control of our Army.</p>

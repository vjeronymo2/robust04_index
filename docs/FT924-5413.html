			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Management: Wooing the shareholders / A look at a shift in German attitudes When the 800 top managers at Veba, one of Germany's biggest industrial companies, got together for the group's bi-annual strategic conference last month, they heard what for a German company was an unusual message. Klaus Piltz, the group's chief executive and Ulrich Hartmann, finance director of the Dusseldorf-based group, both delivered speeches laying heavy emphasis on the importance of shareholders, the first time the topic had come up at one of these gatherings. In the UK or the US, there would be nothing exceptional about the theme: in the Anglo-American environment it is taken for granted that shareholders come first. Managers of publicly-quoted companies know that if they do not keep shareholders happy, they are likely to find themselves on the receiving end of a takeover bid and out of a job. In Germany - as in other countries in continental Europe - management has traditionally had different priorities. The interests of employees, customers, the tax authorities, politicians, local communities, and established bank and insurance contacts have all traditionally come before those of institutional investors - pension funds, insurance companies, investment trusts and other investors. But this is changing. More German companies, of which Veba is at the forefront, say that they are committed to enhancing 'shareholder value'  - managing the business for the benefit of the shareholder as measured in terms of an increased share price and higher dividends. This reflects the growing number of institutional shareholders in the German market: between 1980 and 1990, the proportion of freely traded shares owned by institutional investors rose from 58 to 68 per cent. There have also been a number of hostile takeover battles which have reminded managers that they can be displaced if they do not deliver sound financial performance. Veba, with turnover of nearly DM66bn (Pounds 27bn) this year and more than 1,000 subsidiaries in areas as various as energy, transport and chemicals, started its corporate existence more than 100 years ago as a department of the Prussian state. After the second world war, it was gradually privatised, the government selling its last 25 per cent stake in 1987. The last tranche of shares was placed deliberately with overseas institutional investors and the last shareholder survey (there are no share registers in Germany) found that foreign institutional shareholders own 43 per cent of the shares. With institutional investors came increased attention from Anglo-American investment analysts. Their assessment of the company has not always been complimentary: a particularly hard-hitting report from the London-based SG Warburg last year accused the management of failing to extract anything like full value from the group's highly diversified portfolio. The report suggested that the shares were trading at a big discount to the group's break-up value and that the company was vulnerable to a takeover bid. Hartmann rejects this assessment, but the judgment has on the face of it unsettled the group's management board. Since the report came out in May last year the company has taken a number of shareholder-friendly steps. It has become noticeably more willing to communicate with shareholders and the Anglo-American investment community. Board directors have made presentations to institutional investors outside Germany - a still rare move for German groups. Veba has also appointed its first director of investor relations. It has made an effort to disclose more financial information than is strictly required under Germany's notoriously opaque accounting rules. Veba was one of a handful of big Germany companies to increase its dividend for last year. The company has said it will maintain its dividend at DM12 per share for this year, despite a slump in profits. The dividend is hardly generous by Anglo-American standards, but the 'decoupling' of payout from profits performance is especially appreciated by overseas shareholders. It announced plans to introduce what it called a 'value-orientated controlling system' as a way of assessing the worth of the portfolio. Hartmann denies that the Warburg report - or pressure from the Anglo-American investment community - has led to a fundamental change in business strategy. 'I would like to make a distinction between our communications policies, which we have consciously strengthened since the Warburg report came out, and the way we run the business,' he says. The measures which do impinge on the way the company is managed, for example the introduction of the new controlling measures, were decided long before Warburg published its report, he says. He argues that the group has been run aggressively, in the interests of long-term wealth creation, for the past 30 years. This has involved both purchases and sales of large businesses - a highly active management of the portfolio. Perceptions have been otherwise, he acknowledges, and the new emphasis on communications is designed to correct the impression that Veba is a 'sleeping giant'. What Veba will not do is take conscious steps to unlock the value of its portfolio in the interests of shareholders: partial flotations are deemed to be a sign of weakness. This attitude, common among Germany's big companies, shows the gulf that still exists between German and UK-US management philosophy. No German conglomerate would go so far as to restructure itself purely for the sake of its shareholders, to sell off businesses in the recognition that the parts would have a greater value than the whole. ICI's current plan to split itself into two in order to maximise value for shareholders would be unthinkable in Germany.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- BREAKDOWN OF VEBA SHAREHOLDERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                          1986             1990                                     --------------   --------------                                     Numbers      %   Numbers      %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Private individuals                 474,624   92.7   493,780   90.9 Investment companies                  1,402    0.3     2,433    0.4 Insurance companies, banks, investment management companies         988    0.2     1,516    0.3 Industry, trading, transport companies                  12,004    2.3     9,784    1.8 Public authorities                      144    0.1       202    0.1 Other                                 1,232    0.3     1,752    0.3 Shares accounted for                490,394   95.9   509,467   93.8 of which: Domestic                            480,247   97.9   490,808   96.3 Foreign                              10,147    2.1    18,661    3.7 Not accounted for (eg self-custody)                  21,639    4.1    33,562    6.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                               512,033  100.0   543,029  100.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Veba  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

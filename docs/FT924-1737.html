			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Letter: Doubts over US aims in Somalia Sir, The declared objective of the massive US military intervention in the war-torn and starving Somalia is a humanitarian one. In the Gulf war the purpose of the US military intervention was that of protecting Saudi Arabia from 'Iraqi aggression' and it ended with the destruction of Iraq and the redrawing of its border with Kuwait. There is a real concern among the Somalis that what looks like a benevolent American occupation of Somalia is in fact the thin end of a wedge that will ultimately divide the country into north and south. It is advisable for the US to stick to its humanitarian intentions, and confine its military intervention to the areas where there is a need for them and not send troops north of Belet Weyne. Spreading troops into relatively peaceful northern and north-eastern regions will be seen as a sign that this is an army of occupation with more sinister objectives.

An agreement was also reached to bring a Georgian  mural artists to San Diego to paint a tribute to the festival.  </P> <P> "This visit was very productive in clarifying a number of details and in  initiating the educational component," said Sal Giametta, cultural aid to Mayor  Maureen O'Connor. "The educational component is one of the most important. The  plan is to involve San Diego-area children in the festival to the fullest  extent."  </P> <P> Giametta returned recently from a 10-day trip to the Soviet Union with a  delegation representing the "San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet  Union." Other delegates were festival artistic coordinator Bruce Joseph, Hal  Fischer of the Timken Art Gallery, festival education committee chairwoman Jess  Flemion and San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell.  </P> <P> Flemion took letters and mementoes to Georgian students from 24 San Diego  schools that are participating in "Young at 'Art," an innovative visual arts  training program. Flemion will be developing "curriculum packets" in social  studies and current affairs on Soviet Georgia for local elementary and  secondary-school classes, Giametta said. "It's the first leg of a  children-to-children component of the festival that will become more and more  important," he said.  </P> <P> Four Georgian film directors and a Georgian film critic will participate in a  cinema festival and symposium. The directors will be recommended by Eldar  Shegelaja, cinema director of the Georgian Cinematographic Union, Giametta  said. Either the Museum of Photographic Arts or the La Jolla Museum of  Contemporary Art or both will sponsor the festival locally.  </P></p>

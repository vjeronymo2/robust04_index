			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI SOLDIER SLAIN, 2ND INJURED IN GAZA AMBUSH  </P> <P> Palestinian gunmen ambushed Israeli soldiers riding in a jeep, killing one and  wounding another, in the first attack of its kind during the Arab uprising,  Israeli army officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The attack took place in the Gaza Strip, which has been racked by violence as  the Israeli army seeks to crush the nearly two-year-old Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> The entire Gaza Strip, home to about 700,000 Arabs, was closed off to  outsiders, and parts of it were put under curfew while the army looked for  suspects in the shooting.  </P> <P> "Automatic gunfire was directed at (an Israel Defense Forces) vehicle traveling  in the Sheikh Ajalin neighborhood in Gaza (City) in the evening," an army  spokesman said. "As a result of the gunfire, an IDF soldier was killed and  another was wounded."  </P> <P> The dead soldier was identified as Cpl. Saul Trechtenbroit. He was the fifth  Israeli soldier killed while on active duty in the occupied lands during the  uprising.  </P> <P> Two other uniformed soldiers were shot to death after being kidnaped while  hitchhiking inside Israel proper. An eighth off-duty soldier was stabbed to  death in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Military sources said the ambush was carried out by Muslim fundamentalists of  the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas. Several Hamas members were  arrested last week as suspects in the earlier kidnapings and slayings of the  two Israeli soldiers.  </P> <P> The use of firearms to carry out attacks on Israeli soldiers has been rare  during the uprising, with the weapons of choice commonly being knives or  stones. But due to mounting Palestinian casualties, the underground leadership  of the intifada, as the uprising is called by Arabs, had been warning of  escalation.  </P> <P> More than 600 Palestinians have died at the hands of Israeli soldiers, while 36  Israelis have been killed.  </P> <P> Rumors of efforts to kill more soldiers have been sweeping the West Bank and  Gaza for weeks. In the West Bank village of Al Birah, residents reported a  recent gasoline bomb attack on an army convoy that wounded a high-ranking  officer. The report could not be confirmed, but the town has been under curfew  for the past four days, with all entrances to it sealed off by large roadblocks  made of sandbags and stone.  </P> <P> The army clamped curfews on large parts of the West Bank today in anticipation  of Wednesday's anniversary of the Palestinian declaration of independence.  Schools were ordered shut in Gaza until Saturday; in the West Bank they were  ordered closed for two months.  </P> <P> In many towns and villages, outlawed Palestinian flags are flying from mosques  and electricity lines.  </P></p>

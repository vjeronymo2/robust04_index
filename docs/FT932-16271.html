			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Upbeat Nokia expects further German orders NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications group, expects further orders once a new DCS 1800 cellular phone network expands in Germany, Reuter reports from Helsinki. Mr Jorma Ollila, president and chief executive, said: 'We believe the order may bring significant orders in the future.' The company will begin discussions of further orders within the next few months. Nokia said it had won an order worth more than DM150m (Dollars 90m) to deliver phones and infrastructure for the first phase of a new, Germany-wide personal communications network to E-Plus, a German digital cellular operator. Hugo Boss, the menswear group, said it expected 1993 net profit to be lower than the previous year, Reuter reports from Metzingen. 'We will certainly not reach the record result from 1992,' Mr Peter Littman, the management board chairman, said yesterday. Boss net profit rose to DM44.2m (Dollars 26.6m) in 1992 from DM35.4 m a year earlier. Adidas, the German sports goods group, has confirmed it made a loss of DM149m (Dollars 89.7m) in 1992 after a profit of DM15m the year before, Reuter reports from Herzogenaurach.</p>

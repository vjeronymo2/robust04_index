			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Japan's coalition halves proposed party subsidy JAPAN'S new government is to scale back plans for public subsidies for political parties by half, to heal a potentially embarrassing rift with its largest coalition member. The seven coalition groups expect today to agree draft proposals for a Y300bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year public political subsidy, said officials. This would replace corporate donations and is equivalent to Y250 per taxpayer each year. Last month, the coalition partners provisionally agreed a Y600bn annual subsidy, only to be embarrassed when the defeated LDP counter-proposed Y300bn. This jeopardised the popular new government's image as the bringer of a change in political style from the LDP, whose downfall came partly due to public disgust at its dependence on large, sometimes corrupt, corporate donations. Ministers hurriedly explained that the Y600bn figure was only tentative, after objections from the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, whose chairman, Mr Sadao Yamahana, happens to be minister for political reform. The subsidy is part of a package of political reforms, including a new single-seat constituency electoral system, for debate at a special parliamentary session starting on September 17. Public subsidies would fill some of the gap left by corporate donations, to be phased out after three to five years, according to early drafts of the package. The aim is for parties to compete with equal financial backing, instead of on their ability to wring cash from companies in return for favours. In spite of the inevitable internal coalition wrangling to have emerged in the month since coming to power, public confidence in the government appears hardly shaken. Three opinion polls yesterday showed that the administration's popularity remains high, as do public expectations. A Kyodo news agency poll gave Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's administration a 79 per cent popularity rating, a post-war high for any Japanese government, while the Asahi Shimbun newspaper gave it 71 per cent. The Mainichi Daily News recorded a 10 percentage point drop in the government's popularity over the past month, to a still high 65 per cent. However, the real test of confidence in the the government will come when the public sees final details of the electoral reform plans as well as a hotly waited economic stimulus package.</p>

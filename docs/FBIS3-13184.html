The president of the union briefed the president on some of  the activities carried out by the union. She also reviewed some  of the accomplishments the union has made since its inception 25  years ago.    Then, the gift from the glorious Iraqi women was presented  to  the leader president. The gift was an artwork, an Arab shield  engraved in genuine Kufic calligraphy. On the shield is written  the invocation: In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most  Merciful. It is also engraved with the Iraqi flag and some of  the statements made by the leader president about Iraqi women.    With the presentation of the union's gift, the following  address was given: O most magnanimous person, and knight in  times of distress, you have always been the best loyal brother.  You have always demonstrated matchless compassion, care, and  guidance. You have always been the strongest shield and sword  defending the honor of his kinsfolk. You have never feared  censure or blame. Thanks to you, and to your jihad, Iraqi women  have continued to hold their heads high, and their principles  pertaining to right and faith have remained unshakable. Their  continued support for your blessed banner has remained the  epitome of the loyalty of honest sisters to their noble brother.    Afterward, the leader president left the premises of the  union. He was bidden farewell by Mrs. Manal Yunus  'Abd-al-Razzaq, comrade members of the Executive Bureau of the  General Union of Iraqi Women, as well as the glorious women who  happened to be on the union premises. They all demonstrated  jubilation and uttered trilling cries of joy.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Housing upturn confirmed Further evidence of recovery in the housing market came yesterday from a Law Society study showing a steady increase in the number of conveyancing transactions. The society said the number of transactions was likely to return this year to 1990 levels at about 1.4m. The number peaked in 1988 at 2.15m and fell to 1.1m in 1991. the number of solicitors' firms in business continued to rise during the recession while conveyancing prices and overall income from conveyancing fell sharply. Since 1986 the real cost of conveying an averagely-priced house in the Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 50,000 bracket has fallen 53 per cent and for houses in the Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 range 45 per cent. Last year the average price of conveying a Pounds 60,000 house for a buyer was Pounds 299 plus vat. Sixty-eight per cent of clients felt they received good or very good value for money. Next week the society will publish a working party report on conveyancing services.</p>

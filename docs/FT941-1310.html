			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mowlem to repair balance sheet - City Airport losses coincided with problems in other activities John Mowlem's problems with London City Airport emphasises the serious risks undertaken by construction companies investing large sums in expensive high profile privately financed infrastructure projects. These can cause intense balance sheet problems for investors like Mowlem - which owns 90 per cent of London City Airport - if traffic fails to live up to expectations and they are faced with repaying large borrowings and funding operational costs from reduced income. Government, bankers and construction industry executives examining ways of attracting more private money to pay for large scale roads and railway investments such as the Channel tunnel rail link, might do well to heed Mowlem's experience. The company's adventure in east London would have caused serious problems even if its main businesses of contracting and supply scaffolding and construction equipment had not gone into recession. A Pounds 33m provision imposed in 1992 to cover losses at the airport ran out two years ago and last year the airport lost a further Pounds 4.8m. Sir Philip Beck, chairman, is convinced the investment will eventually come right. Passenger figures in the last few weeks, he says, have been close to levels needed for break-even. The airport estimates it needs 500,000 passengers a year to break even compared with 245,000 last year, well below levels expected when it opened. Mowlem has previously announced that it plans to sell the airport and says the rights issue will enable it to achieve a better price without being forced to make a 'distressed sale.' Disposals during the past 18 months have raised about Pounds 100m. Even so Mowlem's net debt at end-February was Pounds 76m and is heading for a peak of about Pounds 100m this year compared with shareholders' funds, before the rights, of Pounds 91m. Its difficulties have been compounded by problems elsewhere in its business as UK construction output has fallen. The scaffold and access equipment contracting hire and sale companies, in hindsight, entered the recession carrying too much excess fat. This is evidenced by the surgery which Mr John Marshall, chief executive designate, has carried out in the last 18 months, reducing the division's workforce by more than a fifth and cutting overheads in the UK and continental Europe by more than Pounds 20m. The division made a Pounds 600,000 pre-tax loss last year but in better times was capable of achieving pre-tax margins of 10 per cent on annual sales of more than Pounds 300m. With costs under control it should be able to achieve that again as construction markets improved, Mr Marshall said. Capital expenditure, however, will need to increase. This has fallen from Pounds 40m in 1990 (perhaps not the best time to have been spending large sums with the UK construction industry in recession) to just Pounds 14m last year. Nonetheless, the group is starting to reap the benefit of previous cost reductions. Profits at SGB Youngman, the UK hire and sale business, have risen sharply recently. UK building and civil engineering has generally been resilient, achieving profits of Pounds 11.9m on a turnover of Pounds 703m last year - an operating margin of 1.7 per cent, which compares favourably with other large UK contractors. The division's performance, however, has been soured by difficulties over a couple of UK power station and chemical plant contracts as well as minor problems in Germany and the US which means that after provisions the division made a Pounds 4m trading loss. Mr Marshall said a stronger balance sheet would make potential large customers feel more comfortable and enable the company to tender for a wider and more profitable range of work - particularly if it was not having to incessantly chase cash - with the aim of restoring margins to at least 2 per cent on a turnover of Pounds 1bn. On this basis the group, with better management controls and properly targeted capital expenditure should be capable of returning pre-tax profits of Pounds 40m, said Mr Marshall. He did not expect this target to be achieved, however, before 1996. The extent to which some of Mowlem's wounds may have been self-inflicted may be gauged by the sweeping senior management changes which have occurred both at board and divisional level over the past 18 months. The company had little choice but to refinance with a rights chosen as the best solution after consultation with its institutional shareholders and bankers. The institutional shareholders are supporting the group by sub-underwriting the issue. Yesterday they seemed likely to get left with a sizeable tranche of shares. Their hope must be that the bottom has now been reached and things can only get better.</p>

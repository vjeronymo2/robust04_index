			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Ray of light on the road to Damascus / Review of US torch-bearing efforts between Israel and Syria More than two and a half years after the Madrid conference began the present Middle East process, Israel and Syria have finally reached a mutually acceptable way of negotiating their track of a regional peace through the Americans and, in particular, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. Mr Christopher said before leaving the region on Wednesday that he would be back if both sides felt it would be useful, and repeated the cautious leitmotiv of his second shuttle within a fortnight, that talks were at an 'early stage'. Few doubt he will be back within weeks or that what he is directing is the start of finely detailed negotiation which both sides appear determined should become a final agreement. There remain, as the state-owned Syria Times emphasised yesterday, 'wide and big' gaps between Israel which wants Syria to pledge a 'full peace' before it will commit itself to withdrawing from the Golan Heights, and Syria, which will do so only after an Israeli promise to pull its troops out from 'every inch' of the land it occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Mr Christopher's task is to produce the clever piece of diplomatic engineering which will resolve this chicken-and-egg situation that has been at the heart of the impasse from the outset. The crude architecture of a deal has long been apparent. It will include statements which each can interpret to their satisfaction: something from Israel which Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, can trumpet as a commitment that Israel will return all of the Golan to Syrian sovreignty; something from Syria which Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, can sell as the start of full diplomatic and economic relations. Any withdrawal from the Golan would be phased - a concession Syria hinted it is prepared to offer. Israel has offered an eight-year timetable, Syria apparently wants three years at most. Israeli settlements on the Golan will be dismantled, something Mr Rabin has already publicly addressed. There will be a host of mutual security arrangements, including a US monitoring force on the Golan to which Washington has in principle agreed. US officers will likely staff early warning stations on the Golan. Both sides are expected to create demilitarised zones either side of the Golan in their own territory. All this, of course, needs to be nailed down. But detailed work appears already under way. Diplomats in Damascus say position papers exchanged by the two sides this week already cover 'all the issues, addressed in a minute manner.' It also appears that, unlike the Israel-PLO or Israel-Jordan talks, there is no intention first to announce a 'declaration of principles' before negotiating the final deal. Syria, in particular, is deeply averse to discussing anything but a finely-argued agreement, having watched with distaste the PLO's problems in turning its vague declaration into an implementable agreement. This is Mr Christopher's chief achievement. His tight-lipped shuttling appears to have created a negotiating framework acceptable to both sides. Israel has long sought high-level, secret talks with Syria, something Syria has resisted because of distrustful fear of negotiating alone with the Israelis. Mr Christopher's intervention thus reassures the Syrians that the US will act as a guarantor, and perhaps arbiter, in any agreement. His radio silence satisfies Israel's desire for secrecy. The fact he is effectively conducting talks directly between Mr Assad and Mr Rabin answers the call for high level negotiations. Moreover, now that the Palestinians have gone it alone with Israel in reaching their Gaza-Jericho deal, Mr Assad no longer feels he need tie progress on his own negotiating track to progress in others - previously a totem of his desire to be seen the Arab champion of a 'comprehensive' peace. Indeed now, perversely, Mr Assad has some stake in seeing the PLO deal succeed - whatever his conviction of its flaws - since its failure might threaten Mr Rabin's ability to secure a separate peace with Damascus. Mr Christopher appears thus to have broken the stalemate into which bilateral Israeli-Syrian talks had lodged during the Washington peace talks. But given the desire to maintain secrecy, progress in the private exchanges is now more likely to be discernible through public signals than in revelations of the contents of further rounds of US-mediated talks. Mr Assad has already offered several peaceable gestures, including the issue of exit visas for Syrian Jews shortly before January's Geneva summit with President Bill Clinton. He co-operated with a US investigation into the fate of Israel soldiers missing in Lebanon, and recently allowed a delegation of Israeli Arabs to visit Syria. Further signs might include permission for a delegation of Jewish Israelis to visit, or Syria's agreement to participate in multilateral talks on regional issues which also began in Madrid. Most observers in Damascus believe both Mr Rabin and Mr Assad know what they need to deliver the other to achieve peace, however canny they are being in public. Mr Christopher's willingness to devote such time and resources to the talks, meanwhile, appears the clearest gauge of each sides' resolve to achieve progress. All three participants have good reason to press ahead. Mr Rabin must know that his best chance of reaching an cast-iron deal lies in forging it with Syria's present leadership. Mr Assad also knows the political climate may never be more propitious for a deal to return the Golan - perhaps his single greatest political ambition. He is also keen to reap the political and economic rewards which the US might bestow if peace is agreed - not least in removing Syria from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and perhaps encouraging economic assistance. For the US, there is the knowledge that real peace in the Middle East cannot be accomplished without Syria, with the associated belief that bringing Damascus on side will help further in its 'containment' of Iran. More to the immediate political point, however, for an administration bogged in such mires as Haiti and Bosnia, a Syrian-Israeli peace would be a rare foreign policy victory. Which is one of the best reasons to expect Mr Christopher's team to book two floors at the Damascus Sheraton before June is out.</p>

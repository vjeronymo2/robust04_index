			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Magnifying Glass"] </F>   [Text] Lula [Workers Party, PT, Chairman Luis Inacio da  Silva] usually says that disagreements within the PT are seen  like under a magnifying glass. He contends: "The problems are  not as serious as they are presented to be."    Lula believes that the fuss over the [PT] government program  stemmed from the disclosure of a draft program that had not even  been assessed by the party's Executive Board. The latter is  scheduled to meet on 17 February to approve the government  program.    The program then will be publicized so party members can  debate it at length until the PT national convention on 30 April  and 1 May, at which Lula will be officially nominated as  candidate for the presidency. Lula wants, at the same time, to  debate the program with other parties.    With regard to the disagreements with the PT bloc in  Congress, Lula said the party's Executive Board has not been so  hard on it as is being said. He recalled that the Executive  Board authorized the PT bloc to vote on the Social Emergency  Fund, which was badly needed by [Finance Minister] Fernando  Henrique Cardoso.    Lula notes: "The problem is that summary methods are being  used for the constitutional revision. There are important  issues in which our bloc should participate, but conservatives  have created a steamroller to pass everything they wish. There  is no way in which our bloc can endorse that, feigning it is  democratic."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 7 (CTK) -- Former Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will  not support the new government's manifesto because it does not  address its fundamental task -- preparations of early  parliamentary elections, deputy prime minister of Meciar's  shadow cabinet Sergej Kozlik said today.    The public statements by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita  Schmognerova and Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus that the  manifesto was to cover a period longer than what remained until  early elections (September 30-October 1) give rise to the  question whether the present coalition really counted on the  elections.    "There are also signals of further HZDS deputies'  departures," Kozlik said adding that this would give the  government parties further votes to assert the passage of a  constitutional law abrogating early elections.    Former Finance Minister Julius Toth (HZDS) criticized the  economic part of the manifesto. He dismissed the part calling  the preparation of the division of the Czechoslovak federation  unconceptual and the parts pointing to the vague taxation  system, double rate of inflation in 1993 compared with 1992  (25.1 percent) and neglect of writing-off enterprises' debts.    Toth said he had received "the Czech-language version of the  federation's split scenario in August. During the next two and  a half months we had to take such measures as to prevent  Slovakia's collapse after January 1, 1993 (when Czechoslovakia  split)."    Both Kozlik and Toth pointed out that the former opposition  called unfeasible considerations about a zero growth of the  gross domestic product, an approximately 12 percent inflation  and a maximum 17 percent unemployment, but now, when it is in  power it uses the same macroeconomic indicators.    Toth said that according to the latest statistical data,  industrial production in Slovakia rose by 17 percent against  January 1993. The GDP will grow in the first quarter of 1994 as  envisaged by the former government, he added.</p>

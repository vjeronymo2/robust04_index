The five research achievements  judged by the experts as meeting 1990s international standards  were all realized by the University of Electronic Science &amp;  Technology of China (UESTC). They are: a multichannel dynamic  parametric real-time processing system, a HTS microwave  resonator, a miniature HTS microstrip antenna and testing  technology, a HTS filter, and HTS thin-film microwave  surface-resistance high-accuracy measurement technology. The  other seven achievements are: digital storage oscilloscope (DSO)  technology developed by MEI's Institute 41, a 1.55-m  high-stability laser light source, a 1.5-m optical  time-domain reflectomer (OTDR), a HTS microstrip resonator  developed by MEI's Institute 55, MEI Institute 13's technology  for fabricating HTS thin-film-based microwave devices, [a  microwave broadband low-noise mixer,] and the LA64100 logic  analyzer developed by UESTC.</p>

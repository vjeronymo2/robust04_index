			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Price war cools but doubts remain over drugs division - Boots Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is expected to complete the latest round of retailers' results on Thursday with an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 406.7m to about Pounds 460m, before Pounds 35m exceptional charges for withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug. Boots' shares have enjoyed an easier ride this year than in 1993, when they lost their premium to the retail sector amid concerns over increasing price competition with rival Superdrug, and uncertainty over the future of both the pharmaceuticals business after Manoplax, and Do It All, the loss-making DIY joint venture with WH Smith. The price war with Superdrug has cooled somewhat, and uncertainty over Do It All ended this month when the venture partners said they had agreed to sell 40 stores and planned to sell 60 more, cutting the chain to 140. They expected it to return to profit in the financial year 1995-96. Doubt remains, however, about the pharmaceuticals division. Boots has confirmed that Credit Suisse First Boston is valuing the business, but insisted it was keeping all options open. Analysts believe Boots would be unlikely to be able to sell it without diluting earnings. For the year to March, Goldman Sachs is forecasting increases in operating profits at Boots the Chemists from Pounds 285m to Pounds 321m, in Boots Healthcare International from Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m, and Boots Contract Manufacturing from Pounds 13m to Pounds 16m. The pharmaceuticals division is expected to decline from Pounds 91m to Pounds 88m. Boots Opticians is also expected to fall from Pounds 7m to Pounds 5m, but Children's World is forecast to break even for the first time. Halfords is expected to improve from Pounds 5m to Pounds 13m. Boots' share of Do It All losses is forecast to increase from Pounds 14m to Pounds 15m.</p>

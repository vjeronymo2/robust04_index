			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON DANNEMEYER  </P> <P> How terrible it would be if this wonderful, multifarious country were governed  solely by the likes of William Dannemeyer, whose controlling vision encompasses  only what suits his own needs. Posed at his tidy desk with cold eyes crinkled,  Dannemeyer stares off into a vision of Utopian America born of an MGM back-lot  fantasy -- a Mickey Rooney world of malt shops, town squares and manicured  lawns that fronted perfect homes filled with well-fed, straight Caucasians.  </P> <P> It's a sentimental illusion that perhaps only a white heterosexual male could  get sentimental about. Meanwhile, the blacks, the gays, and all the others who  only appear as noisy, amusing extras in such fantasies, have a different view  of what's been lost and gained in this country. Dannemeyer says he sleeps at  night. Of course he does. Anyone so out of touch would no doubt sleep like a  baby.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS SOESBE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (3): Clear differences in health - Advertising is distracting the banks JAPANESE BANKS, struggling to overcome an increasing burden of bad loans, have recently been distracted by debate over a less serious threat - comparative advertising. This could highlight the differences between strong and weak institutions. The banks' acceptance of comparative advertising will not mean that television viewers will see, for example, a hard-sell on lower interest rates by Sakura Bank or a critique of competitors by Mitsubishi Bank, but it does reflect the Bank of Japan's belief that banks should be more distinctive. During the clean-up after the excesses of the late 1980s, the banking industry has insisted that the differences between the 'good' and 'bad' banks are minimal. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, has told banks to 'escape' from a collective mentality and 'follow the management policy best suited under the principle of self-responsibility.' The blurring of the lines between banks in the past may have served the purpose of leading public attention away from the most vulnerable institutions, but there are clear differences in the health of commercial, trust and regional banks, and in the level of their exposure to the property and stock markets. Japanese depositors appear to be making those distinctions, without the help of comparative advertising. Several regional banks with large non-performing property loans have seen a sharp downturn in deposits, including Hyogo Bank, based in the western Japan, which lost 16.5 per cent of its deposits in the first half, and whose short-term deposits have fallen by an estimated 50 per cent over the past year. Anxious to avoid fears of a 'run' on banks, the Bank of Japan has quietly pumped fresh funds into Hyogo Bank and asked three leading banks, Sumitomo Bank, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, and the Industrial Bank of Japan, to restructure the bank's operations. The central bank and the finance ministry have also sent managers to Hyogo, which is portrayed officially as an extreme case and not indicative of the industry. But the difficulty in accepting these reassurances is that it remains unclear how many other banks are receiving less publicised attention from the ministry and the Bank of Japan. In the first half, provisions or write-offs of non-performing loans by 13 regional banks around Tokyo rose 3.4 times, according to the district financial bureau. Calculating the exposure of banks is also made difficult by the unknown exposure of financial company affiliates, which were encouraged, during the late 1980s, to find customers outside the range normally dealt with by the parent bank. The parent may own only five per cent or less of these lenders, but Japanese customers tend to see the large name behind the small company. Nippon Credit Bank is having to bail out three leasing and credit companies which were large property-related lenders, whether directly to developers or indirectly in accepting property as collateral. The three affiliates are estimated to have non-performing loans totalling about 20 per cent of their outstanding loans. 'Japanese have always looked at who is the ultimate backer of a loan rather than at the hard collateral, so people thought we were backing these three companies, even though our links to them were not that great. People should look at more than a company's name in doing business,' an NCB manager said. But the name behind the name will remain important. Financiers providing funds to National Lease, a troubled affiliate of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics company, presumed that they were doing business with the Matsushita group. These understood relationships create a range of obligations whose long-term costs are difficult to estimate. A similar pattern is evident in the restructuring of Nippon Housing Loan, established by commercial banks to provide funds to home buyers, but a large lender to the property market during the late 1980s with the result that it has an estimated Y1,300bn in non-performing loans out of a loan portfolio of Y2,200bn. The finance ministry's attempts to organise a rescue of Nippon Housing have been complicated by farmer-run financial institutions wanting the nine founder banks and the ministry to take responsibility. However, the politically-influential farm institutions provided about 35 per cent of outstanding funds to Nippon Housing, and were pumping in money when the commercial banks were reducing their exposure. These large rescues typically involve a sharp cut in interest rates or even a suspension of interest repayments, though the exposure to Nippon Housing is unlikely to be counted in non-performing loan figures. Eight housing loan companies, which diversified into risky development projects, are in need of assistance, but these institutions have not been able to use the banking industry's Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC). The CCPC is supposed to salvage the banking system and revive the property market, though it has had little impact since its inauguration in late January. By valuing property collateral and buying loan credits, the CCPC will enable stronger banks to quicken the write-off of non-performing loans, but it will not provide much assistance to weaker institutions. Japanese banks are being encouraged by the Bank of Japan to take advantage of profits generated by favourable interest rate margins to make provisions for or write-off as much of their non-performing exposure as possible. The case of Sumitomo Bank is cited as a model, as it plans to write-off Y100bn of its exposure to Itoman, a collapsed trading house. But the Sumitomo case also highlights how much farther Japanese banks, large and small, must travel before they overcome their bad loan problems. Sumitomo's write-offs this year will not mark the end of its bubble era, nor even cover the exposure to the trading house, as it has an estimated Y500bn in loans to the Itoman group.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Choosing a personal pension - The Experts' Panel / Three views on how to make the most important investment of a lifetime IN EACH issue, the Quarterly Review asks a panel of experts to recommend products in a particular financial services field. The aim is to help readers through the complex, and often bewildering, choices they need to make when purchasing a financial product. This time, the subject is the always topical one of personal pensions. James Higgins, of fee-charging advisers Chamberlain de Broe, emphasises the need to cut through the gloss put on pension packages. The two really important aspects of a company's service, he says, are investment expertise and cost: 'The best sort of product pays no commission, and has a flat administration fee. In this way, you can keep the cost of advice separate from the cost of the plan. A product that we particularly like is Provident Life's self-invested pension. 'This allows you to build up your own investment portfolio within a pension fund, with all its attendant tax benefits. Basically, Provident Life provide the administrative framework, and the investors can either appoint their own fund managers or even manage the funds themselves. 'You can invest in equities, investment trusts, unit trusts, gilts, deposits and commercial property: the list is extensive. You have greater freedom by not being tied to one investment manager. Cautious investors might simply wish to select a few investment trusts and let the managers get on with the job. 'Provident Life charges Pounds 270 initially, with an annual administration charge of Pounds 270. This may sound high, but take the case of someone making a single-premium payment of Pounds 30,000 (including perhaps a transfer from a previous occupational pension scheme). Normally, on a packaged insurance company scheme, the initial charge would be about Pounds 1,500 - or even higher if the investor contracts to invest a given sum each year. A Pounds 540 first-year charge equates to under 2 per cent. Clearly, the bigger the fund, the lower the proportionate cost. 'Running investment charges can also be kept to a minimum by carefully selecting cost-effective investments, and by further ensuring that any further commissions generated are reinvested to your advantage. 'Many people, however, will prefer to save directly with one company, perhaps in the with-profits medium. There are a group of companies that we would recommend for those who feel that the self-invested route is not suitable. The top half-dozen perhaps are Standard Life, Scottish Amicable, Scottish Equitable, Scottish Widows, Clerical Medical and Norwich Union. 'They all have similar good, lengthy track records, investment expertise and charges. They tend to specialise in the fields of life assurance and investment, rather than being more widely involved in general insurance. 'These companies all pay commission to advisers. It is therefore important that they are able to reinvest all of this into your savings plan to your best advantage. 'Equitable Life is a company with a very high reputation, which does not pay commission to advisers. It does, however, have similar initial charges to other companies, because its own salesmen are paid commissions. Ongoing charges, though, tend to be comparatively low. 'However, Equitable Life has a particularly interesting annuity. Equitable Life's with-profits annuity allows you to continue to have with-profits investment, through your annuity, after you have retired. This means that you can have increases in your pension without having to pay the high costs of escalation at outset. 'Products that should be avoided are those sold by tied agents, as there is no choice on offer, and tied agents' commission tends to be considerably higher even than that paid to independent advisers.' John Edwards, a former FT journalist who now works for advisers Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says: 'Virtually every company claims that it has the best pension fund performance and can produce convincing-looking statistics as proof. In any event, past performance, as they say, does not guarantee future returns. 'There is little point in comparing projections of the future benefits, since, under the Financial Services Act, they all have to use the same annual growth rates and charges, laid down by Lautro. The presentation may differ, but basically the underlying figures are all the same. This prevents 'telephone figure' projections, of the kind seen in the past. However, it makes explaining why you have chosen a particular pension provider quite hard on occasions. 'In spite of these difficulties, it is fair to say that there are between 10 and 15 companies which have been good pension fund performers consistently over the years. This provides the basic framework, and after that it is very much a matter of individual choice. 'Another very important factor in making a recommendation is the quality of the service and administration. Some of the star investment performers, like Norwich Union, Standard Life and Scottish Widows, are avoided by some advisers as a result of alleged poor quality and slow service. 'For independent advisers, the level of service provided often depends on the efficiency of the local office of the different insurance companies. A good and helpful 'inspector', as they like to call their salesmen, can make all the difference. 'My number one choice is Scottish Equitable. It is a company which has traditionally specialised in selling the complete range of pension policies, primarily through financial advisers. It has a very creditable investment record in both with-profits and unit-linked pensions. 'You cannot, however, put all your eggs in one basket. On with-profits pension policies, particularly for older people, my alternative choice is Equity &amp; Law. It also has a good investment track-record in with-profits policies, and presents the projections in an easy-to-understand manner. 'For unit-linked policies, my alternative choice is M&amp;G. It is true that their unit trust investment record has sagged somewhat in recent years. Nevertheless, they remain a good and well-respected investment house with a reputation for straight dealing.' John Bridel, of financial advisers Towry Law, says that any comprehensive list of recommended personal pension policies is liable to be long. 'What is good for one client will be unsuitable for another,' he explains. 'I have chosen one single-premium and one regular-premium contract, which will be suitable in some circumstances. 'For a regular-premium policy, I choose Friends Provident's Pension Portfolio. Unit allocation rates are competitive; those paying Pounds 80 a month, or Pounds 960 per annum and over, will get 102 per cent in the first 10 years and 105 per cent thereafter. For premiums of Pounds 50 a month, allocation rates are 100 per cent in the first 10 years. In the first year, the money invested buys initial units which are subject to an additional annual management charge of 6 per cent. Thereafter, accumulation units are allocated. 'A policy charge of Pounds 2.50 per month is deducted, and the initial management charge is currently 5 per cent, with a rounding-up adjustment not exceeding 1 per cent for the investment funds, and 5 per cent of the offer price for the with-profits fund. The annual management charge is  3/4 per cent per annum, except for the Stewardship Fund where it is 1 1/2 per cent. 'The current annual bonus on the with-profits fund at 11 per cent (of which 4 per cent is guaranteed) is competitive, and there is a terminal bonus after three years. There is a wide fund choice and two free switches are allowed per annum; thereafter a charge of Pounds 15 per switch is made. 'On early retirement, the full bid value of accumulation units and a percentage of the initial is available, depending on the number of years outstanding to the original selected retirement date. For example, five years before the selected date 71.9 per cent of initial units are available, plus all accumulation units. 'Provided one full year's contributions have been paid and any increase in regular contributions maintained for one year, there is no penalty if one stops regular contributions. A transfer value can be taken at any time, and the basis of calculation is the same as that applicable for early retirement. 'Eagle Star's personal pension account is my chosen single-premium policy. Allocation rates vary, both with the amount of premium and the years to the selected retirement age. They range from 97 per cent, for contributions of Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000 for a period of less than 5 years, to 109 per cent for contributions over Pounds 25,000 and terms of 25 years and over. 'There is a management charge of 1 per cent per annum of the fund value (other than the with-profits fund), an initial charge of 5 per cent, plus rounding of up to 1 per cent, and a setting-up charge of Pounds 60. 'The current annual bonus rate on the unitised with-profits fund is 12 per cent (of which 4 per cent is guaranteed) plus a terminal bonus from commencement at the present time. 'There are 12 unit-linked funds, in addition to the with-profits fund, of which any eight can be used at any one time. One free switch is allowed per annum, and a charge of Pounds 12 made for additional switches. 'On earlier retirement than at the selected age, the allowance rate is adjusted to that which would have been applicable if that term had been selected at the outset and the same would apply to a transfer.'

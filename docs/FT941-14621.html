			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Sweden Dollars 2bn deal steals limelight The Eurobond sector saw another deluge of issues, absorbing some Dollars 2.4bn of US dollar floating-rate notes (FRNs), several sterling issues, and an assortment of other currencies. Grabbing the limelight in the dollar FRN sector was the Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 2bn issue of seven-year notes via CS First Boston and UBS. The notes pay a coupon of three-month Libor less 12.5 basis points, and were sold at a fixed re-offer price of 99.75 to yield some 8 basis points below Libor. While the lead managers reported demand from European and far eastern accounts, there was a general consensus that the deal was no 'blow-out,' and would take some time to place. Some syndicate managers attributed this to the pricing, which they said was on the tight side. 'It would have worked better around Libor minus six,' said one primary dealer in London. Another trader pointed out that most central banks, which tend to be keen buyers of sovereign FRNs, cannot buy paper with maturities exceeding five years, implying the deal would take some time to place. However, the deal's status as a new seven-year benchmark and its five-year call protection are seen to help, allowing the issue to be broadly placed in coming weeks. Meanwhile, a Dollars 150m 10-year floater for CS First Boston was one of the day's success stories. The notes, which have a 5 per cent floor and pay a coupon of six-month Libor less 12.5 basis points, were snapped up by continental European retail accounts and ended at 100 5/8 bid, well above their par issue price. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued Dollars 200m of one-year 'range-floaters' via Merrill Lynch. The notes are structured so that interest only accrues when three-month Libor falls within a specific range during certain dates. The day's two straight US dollar bonds were deemed to be aggressively priced and met with a lukewarm reception. General Electric Capital Corporation issued Dollars 250m of 6 per cent 10-year bonds via Deutsche Bank. At the re-offer price of 99.819, the bonds yielded 21 basis points over the relevant Treasury bond, which was considered too tight by most traders. 'Something in the high 20s would have been more appropriate,' said one trader. After the syndicate broke, the spread widened slightly. Another Dollars 250m of three-year bonds for DSL Bank via ABN Amro got a similarly cool reception, yielding only 13 basis points over the corresponding Treasury note at issue. Traders pointed out that the new US three-year notes, to be auctioned in February, will make the DSL paper look even more expensive as it will yield roughly the same as the new US notes. Meanwhile, British Gas launched the first-ever 50-year Eurosterling bond. It issued Pounds 200m of 7 1/8 per cent bonds due 2044 via CS First Boston. The bonds were priced to yield some 50 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 at issue. Buoyed by the gilt market rally, but also by strong investor demand, the bonds ended the day at 99.40 bid, yielding 49 basis points over the long gilt, the lead manager said. In the domestic sterling market, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council issued Pounds 100m of 25-year 7 per cent bonds via UBS. The bonds were priced to yield some 65 basis points over the long gilt due 2017. The deal follows recent issues by the City of Salford and Leicester City Council. The first-ever Swedish krone global bond will feature prominently on today's new issue calendar. Swedish Export Credit (SEK) is expected to launch SKr2.5bn of 7.4-year bonds via Merrill Lynch, yielding between 10 and 15 basis points over the 13 per cent Swedish government bonds due 2001.</p>

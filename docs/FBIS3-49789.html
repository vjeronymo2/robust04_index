			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Peeva: "Budget Envisages Almost 13 </F> Instead of 37 Billion Leva for Army"]    [Text] The National Security Commission of the National  Assembly has learned that the government-proposed military  budget is negligent. The commission met at the Bulgarian Army  General Staff on 13 January.    The military had requested 37 billion leva for 1994 and  indicated that they would be satisfied with 22 billion; however,  their draft budget only envisages 12.7 billion leva.    The National Assembly members learned that the Army  accumulated a debt of 1 billion leva last year. It was even  necessary to use a part of the emergency rations. The amount  needed for the Army's everyday operational needs in 1994 has not  been ensured.    If the budget is not amended, the parliament will have to  bear the responsibility for the consequences, the Army  leadership declared. An internal subcommission led by Dimitur  Yonchev will collect data on the situation in the Army and will  make specific proposals on resolving the problems.</p>

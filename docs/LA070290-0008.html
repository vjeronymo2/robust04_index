			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS 'OPINION DEFENSE' IN LIBEL CASES  </P> <P> Now The Supreme Court has ruled that the media, and even individuals, can be  sued for libel even when statements are made as opinion.  </P> <P> This is my opinion: This wrinkled pack of rabid fascist dogs have gone far  enough in trying to restrict our rights. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is  a prime candidate for euthanasia, although, even when dead, worms would avoid  his carcass like feminists avoid adult bookstores.  </P> <P> If Rehnquist, or one of his ancient cronies, wants to sue me for libel, then so  be it. As King Lear said, "Let it come down."  </P> <P> ANTHONY R. MUNROE  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): UK sugar beet shines out through the gloom - Sterling's devaluation is benefitting growers of one of Britain's few remaining profitable crops SEPTEMBER rain, which has caused so many problems for late-harvesting cereal growers, has been just right for sugar beet. Indeed the combination of a warm spring and a moist summer could hardly have been better for the crop and it is probable that the overall yield of UK sugar beet harvested this autumn will come close to the record set 10 years ago. The 'campaign' as the annual battle to lift and deliver the roots to processing factories is called in the trade, began in earnest last week with the seasonal opening of the last two of British Sugars' 10 factories. The other eight had opened for 'slicing' the previous week and the extraction process was already well under way. It will probably be the middle of next February before the campaign is completed. If early indications are a reliable guide, and they usually are, the UK seems set to produce over 1.3m tonnes of refined sugar from this year's crops. In 1982 1.4m tonnes was produced. The A and B quota, for which the European Community guarantees prices under the terms of its common agricultural policy, is set at 1.144m. The excess will be classified as C sugar and will be sold on to world markets next year without price support. The basis for the yield prediction is the root samples taken by British Sugar, the monopoly processor of all the UK's sugar beet. Last week's figures show that average root weight across the country was 703 grams, compared with a five-year average of 587 grams and last year's 532 grams. Average sugar content was a little down, as could have been expected because of the greater size of the roots, to 17.4 per cent, compared with the 17.43 per cent five year average and 18.96 per cent last year, which as you may remember was hot and dry. The all important figure for sugar per root, however, was well up at 122 grams, compared with 101 grams last year and the 102 grams five-year average. This appears to suggest that the yield of sugar from this year's crop may be about 20 per cent higher than last year's. Furthermore this British crop will almost certainly mean that for the first time for years the UK will be up among the highest yielders per hectare of sugar beet grown in the whole of the EC. Other member states that are expecting good yields are Holland and France, where the weather has been equally favourable. But for Germany, Denmark, Belgium and Ireland below average yields are forecast. The importance of a bumper sugar crop in the UK this year is not just a matter of pride, nor even of immediate profit. It also provides ammunition for the battle to persuade the CAP-reforming European Commission and the negotiators in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that Britain can reliably produce in excess of its quota and should be allocated at least as much, if not more, when those quotas are decided in coming months. Moreover British growers and processors are determined to fight for a fairer deal than they believe they have had in the past in any reform of the EC sugar regime. While readily conceding that there is a structural surplus of sugar in the community, they point out that whereas most other sugar beet growing states produce well in excess of their domestic requirements, the UK produces less than 50 per cent of its domestic sugar consumption in order to make way for imports of raw cane sugar produced in former colonies. They believe that the UK should remain exempt from any cuts in EC sugar beet quotas, which may well be necessary. Britain, the argument goes, is already worse off than other sugar beet-growing member states and if anything should have an increase in her quota. In furtherance of this claim and in order to improve the image of the UK as a sugar beet producer, British Sugar has even changed the basis of reporting farmers' yields. In times past the tonnage of sugar beet produced was simply divided by the area on which they were grown in order to arrive at an official average figure. This always left the UK at, or near, the bottom of the European league table. Growers assumed that was because of the superior soils to be found on the Continent. Then British Sugar discovered that most other countries subtracted those areas of fields which were not cropped, such as the hedges and strips between the field boundary and the first row of roots together with those parts of fields taken up by ditches. Depending on the size of a field these pieces of land can add up to 10 per cent or more of its total area. Now that British Sugar makes similar adjustments, UK beet farmers look like much better growers. It will be clear from all of the above that British sugar beet farmers, myself included, value the crop very highly. Among all the cuts and restrictions imposed on agriculture recently, sugar beet has so far escaped relatively unscathed and, given a reasonable season, it is still possible to grow it at a profit. This year as I have indicated, it will probably do better than average. Furthermore the devaluation of sterling will provide a bonus. Since the pound fell out of the ERM so-called 'green' currencies have re-emerged. They had almost disappeared during the period of relative currency stability but now they are needed again to make up the differences in value of guaranteed prices for farm commodities in different EC member countries. The effect of this is to increase the sterling value of UK sugar beet by about 30 pence for each percentage point the pound devalues. If sterling settles at say 10 per cent below its previous ERM floor, UK growers could receive an extra Pounds 3 a tonne for the sugar beet they deliver to their local factory. It will amount to a welcome addition to the Pounds 30 or so a tonne they thought they would get when they planted the crop. Meanwhile, overshadowing the UK sugar beet industry hangs the spectre of rhizomania, which literally means root madness and has been dubbed the rabies of root crops. It was first found in this country in 1987. But it has been creeping north across Europe from Italy, where it was first discovered, since the late 1940s. It is a serious soil-borne disease that stays active in soil for many years and in severe cases reduces both yield and sugar content to uneconomic levels. When it arrived in Britain, plant health authorities imposed strict measures to try to stop it from spreading; measures which were punitive and very expensive to the farmer victims. At first it seemed the restrictions were working. Only a few further cases were discovered over the next four years. But this year there has been an explosion of 13 cases so far and it is reported that several more possible cases are under investigation. My view is that, unwelcome as it may be, the time has come for the UK to declare rhizomania an endemic disease and to learn to live with it. Rhizomania-tolerant varieties of sugar beet have already been developed on the continent that yield virtually the same in the presence of the virus as conventional varieties do in clean soil. It is no longer acceptable to penalise a few farmers for something over which they have no control and for which they are not to blame. Informed sources suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture may be coming to the same conclusion.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally after early profit-taking SHARE PRICES in the London stock market were overshadowed yesterday by tonight's close of trading for the third quarter of the year and also by an uncertain response to the auction of Pounds 3.25bn in British government securities. Profit-takers held sway for most of the session but equities rallied towards the close as gilt-edged securities turned higher. Once again, international factors took a back seat in a stock market focused nearer home. Optimism on domestic interest rates receded somewhat as sterling eased and markets assessed prospects for the UK November budget and the season of annual conferences of political parties. Fund managers' attention was captured by two significant corporate developments, and rumours of at least one other big share placing on the engineering pitch, as well as by a Pounds 511m batch of rights issues. Stock index futures continued to affect equities, and some stock was sold in the afternoon when the December contract on the FT-SE Index challenged its Fair Value premium, effectively for the first time since the contract took over leadership of the derivatives sector. Strength in the future premium has given important support to this week's gains in equities. Although easier at first, shares tried to rally in early trading. But a 1.8 gain on the Footsie was quickly reversed as the time for the gilt-edged auction drew near. First reports from the auction were badly received in the stock market and the Footsie was soon down more than 14 points at 3,022.6. It was late in the session before shares began to rally on the back of gains in gilts and an initially firm start to the new Wall Street session. However, the recovery was checked when the Dow Industrial Average turned off and showed a fall of 1.12 in UK trading hours. The final reading of 3,030.1 gave the FT-SE Index a net loss on the day of 6.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was also subdued, closing 3.2 off at 3,434.4. The big news of the day came early and occupied the attention of many big institutions. Grand Metropolitan announced the sale for Pounds 736m of its Chef and Brewer subsidiary to Scottish and Newcastle, a rival brewing group; Scottish and Newcastle hit the market with a Pounds 405m rights call to help fund the deal. The expected placing of 54.8 per cent of Mirror Group newspapers for a total of Pounds 373m made further demands on fund managers' time and cash resources. While neither deal was unexpected, they helped distract attention from other sectors while also indicating the readingness of the institutions to accept to what are regarded as favourable corporate moves. Seaq trading volume dipped to 511.7m shares, the lowest so far this week, and contrasting with 603.3m on Tuesday; non-Footsie business made up around 60 per cent of the total. The reduced volume as the market fell suggested that profit-taking was modest. When the market was rising on Monday and Tuesday, retail or customer activity reached Pounds 1.25bn abd Pounds 1.69bn respectively, both indicating strong investment support from the institutions. At the close of trading, the stock market was enlivened by hints that more large corporate deals, or takeover moves, were in the pipeline.</p>

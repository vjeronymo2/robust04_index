			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said that it is not  only the question of access to Famagusta which constitutes an  obstacle to agreement on implementing the confidence-building  measures [CBM's]. There is a series of other questions, he  noted, which the Turkish side keeps putting forward and which,  if accepted, would lead to the pseudostate's recognition.  President Kliridhis made this statement to journalists who  visited him to greet him on his birthday today.    The president added that the Turks do not agree for  Famagusta  and the International Nicosia Airport to be placed under UN  administration. The Turks, he added, insist that there must be  a co-administration, not UN administration.</p>

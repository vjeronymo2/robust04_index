The Japanese Government pledged the loan at an international  conference on aid to Vietnam held in Paris last November.    Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Hiroyuki Yushita and  Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam exchanged documents  on the loan and the grant in Hanoi, the officials said.    The loan is for seven projects to improve infrastructure  related to power supply and transportation, and to pay for  equipment to repair roads and waterworks, they said.    The aid is to support Vietnam's efforts at economic reform  and to shift to a market-oriented economy under its policy of  "doi moi" or renovation, they said.    Japan will also grant 788 million yen for Can Tho University  in southern Vietnam to improve its agriculture department. The  money will be used to build facilities and to pay for equipment.    Another grant of 65 million yen will be used for a project  to  improve waterworks in northeastern Hanoi.</p>

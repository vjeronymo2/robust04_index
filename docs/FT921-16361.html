			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: No real purpose in continuing ban on Wagner Sir, When the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra announced that it would end a 53-year ban on Richard Wagner's music, I was delighted and filled with joy. Now, however, it appears ('World News in Brief: Vote on Wagner music', December 23) as if the ban will be in effect for a much longer period of time, as a result of the senseless outcry from radicals of the Jewish Community, and from the survivors of the Nazi holocaust, who wrongfully pretend that Wagner openly espoused anti-semitism throughout his life. True, Wagner was Hitler's favourite composer, but some obviously often forget, or refuse to admit, that Wagner was also one of the world's finest composers and a musical genius indeed. So, whether or not Wagner was anti-semitic, I think it is time for the Jewish community to realise that a continuing ban on Wagner and his work would accomplish no real purpose. One positive point: James Levine, main conductor of the Metropolitan Opera, and a Jew, has been playing several of Wagner's operas for a long time now.

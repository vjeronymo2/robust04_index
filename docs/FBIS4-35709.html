			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 2 (AFP) -- A missile fired by  northern Yemeni forces slammed into this southern stronghold on  Thursday [2 June] wounding 21 people and artillery duels raged  only hours after the UN Security Council called for a ceasefire.    One of two surface-to-surface missiles was intercepted by  south Yemeni anti-aircraft fire but the other exploded near a  mosque in the northern suburb of al-Shaykh 'Uthman, officials  said.    Sixteen worshipers were hurt inside the mosque when the  missile struck during dawn prayers. The raid left pools of  blood on the carpets and the courtyard, witnesses said. Five  people were injured in nearby dwellings.    Hundreds later gathered in the area to denounce "the killer  regime" of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner.    The missile attack came just hours after the United Nations  Security Council had adopted a resolution calling for a  ceasefire in the civil war in Yemen, which erupted May 5.    Heavy artillery duels on the war front just north of Aden  were so intense Thursday morning that buildings in the city  shook heavily.    Southern warplanes were constantly taking off and landing at  Aden Airport as they flew sorties against the northern forces of  Salih, who has strongly opposed any UN "interference" in the  conflict.    The presidential council of the breakaway southern state led  by 'Ali Salim al-Bid announced it would "unconditionally  respect" the Security Council resolution and assist a fact  finding mission being dispatched by the world body.    There was no immediate reaction from Sanaa, where the  government held a meeting to discuss the resolution. [passage  omitted]</p>

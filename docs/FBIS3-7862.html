			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F> republic, by Zeljko Avramovic at an unidentified airport on 28  February -- recorded]    [Text] [Avramovic] Mr. Karadzic, you are leaving for  Moscow to pay the first official visit after the triumphal  return of Russian diplomacy to the world political scene. What  aim does this visit have?    [Karadzic] This is an invitation, an official invitation to  our delegation to come to have talks mostly about the peace  process and the first visit will certainly pass mostly in  further examining the possibilities of reaching peace; both  peace in general and the one around Sarajevo, possibly around  Tuzla regarding the opening of the airport, and so on. In a  word, Russia is now much more present both in a diplomatic and a  military sense and we are very pleased to be going to Russia.    [Avramovic] Whom are you going to meet in Moscow?    [Karadzic] Our hosts are Churkin and Kozyrev. We are  certainly going to meet them and we shall see about the rest.  So far, we do not know the plan.</p>

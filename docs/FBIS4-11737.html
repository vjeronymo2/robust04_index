			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Was Responsible for the Crash of the C-130 </F> Plane?"]    [Text] Iran's experts looking into the cause of the crash  of the C-130 Hercules transport plane that killed 32 Iranians  have not found the black box and are leaving Karabakh for  Tbilisi and Baku where they hope to find clues from both  airports' towers. The Iranian pilot had contacted both towers  prior to the disaster.    This plane crash is still shrouded in mystery while Iranian  officials are under increasing public pressure to identify those  responsible for this atrocity which resulted in the martyrdom of  32 innocent Iranians returning home for the New Year. Iranians  are outraged at this savage terrorist act and demand cooperation  of all parties concerned in efforts to identify the culprits and  to bring them to justice.    The Armenians of Karabakh and the Azeris accuse each other  of  responsibility in this heinous crime against Iranian citizens.  However, the evidence so far points to the Armenians as the most  likely perpetrators of this cowardly act, therefore it is  incumbent upon the Armenian authorities to prove otherwise.    The C-130 tragedy along with the rampant and pointless  killings by both sides make it necessary to find a final and  comprehensive solution to this destructive armed conflict.  Despite political pressures from the Armenians and the Azeris  and their respective supporters on the international level,  Iran's mediating efforts so far have been based purely on the  Islamic Republic's desire for peace in the region and its  absolute impartiality in this dispute.    Iran believes that the ongoing Armenian-Azeri land dispute  has sapped both countries' economic and political energies which  will sooner or later result in the two countries' dependence on  big foreign powers.    International organizations' slow pace in resolving such  disputes make them ineffective in solving this particular  crisis. Only the bilateral political resolve of Armenians and  the Azeris together with the mediation of well intentioned  regional countries could put an end to this senseless mass  killing.    Both sides should also consider the fact that if such  flagrant acts of terrorism continue, neighboring countries such  as the Islamic Republic will have no choice but to react  accordingly in order to protect their citizens.</p>

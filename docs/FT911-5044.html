			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Observer: Stereotypes Rosalind Gilmore, the new building societies commissioner who has just taken over from Michael Bridgeman, has begun her reign by striking a small blow against feminist modernism. Unlike her predecessor who inspired terror in the shires, Mrs Gilmore has indicated that she favours informality. Even so, at her first commission meeting it turned out that some ground rules had to be established. 'People seemed uncertain what I should be called. Was it chair,chairwoman, chairperson or whatever?' she reports. Under the Building Societies Act it appears that it has to be chairman, and that's the way it will be, says Gilmore.</p>

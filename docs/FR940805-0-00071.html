			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since July 7, 1994, and continuing, the President has declared several areas as Major Disaster Areas in certain Alabama, Florida, and Georgia counties because of the extensive flooding that occurred and is continuing. The agencies believe that granting relief from the appraisal requirements for certain real estate transactions in all such areas affected by this flooding is consistent with the provisions of the DIDRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies have determined that the disruption of real estate markets in all such affected areas interferes with the ability of depository institutions to obtain appraisals that comply with statutory and regulatory requirements and, therefore, may impede institutions in making loans and engaging in other transactions that would aid in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the affected area. Accordingly, the agencies have determined that recovery from this major disaster would be facilitated by excepting transactions involving real estate located in the area directly affected by the flooding from the real estate appraisal requirements of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) as amended, 12 U.S.C. 3331  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and regulations promulgated thereto. This has the effect of excepting certain transactions from the definition of ``federally related transactions.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies have also determined that safety and soundness would not be adversely affected by such exceptions so long as the depository institution's records relating to any such excepted transaction clearly indicate either that the property involved was directly affected by the major disaster or that the transaction would facilitate recovery from the disaster and there is a binding commitment to fund the transaction within three years after the date the major disaster was declared. In addition, the transaction must continue to be subject to review by management and by the agencies in the course of examination of the institution under normal supervisory standards relating to safety and soundness, though the transactions need not comply with the specific requirements of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies' appraisal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Expiration Dates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any exceptions provided under the order shall expire not later than three years after the date on which the President determines, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170, that a major disaster exists in the area. Accordingly, exceptions for the major disasters declared due to the flooding expire on: July 8, 1997 for Alabama counties; July 10, 1997 for Florida counties; and July 7, 1997 for Georgia counties. Exceptions for any other counties in this area that have been declared major disasters by the President as a result of the flooding that began on or about July 7, 1994 expire 3 years after the date of such declaration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 2 of DIDRA, relief is hereby granted from the provisions of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies appraisal regulations for any real estate-related financial transaction that requires the services of an appraiser under those provisions, provided that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The transaction involves real estate located in an area that the President has determined, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Alternative Budget Will Repudiate Government </F> Claims"]    [Text] New Delhi, 23 January--Just like last year, an  alternative budget will be presented this year again. This  budget will nullify the government claim that there is no  alternative to the new economic policy which means dependence of  foreign debts. This can be called a citizens' budget. Through  this citizens' budget, they are trying to raise a national  movement against the government's economic policy. All  organizations are participating in it. This is a new dimension  of the alternative budget.    A citizens council is working to find an alternative to the  government's economic policies. Prof. Arun Kumar is its  organizer. This council has economists, political leaders,  social workers, and actors as its members. A preliminary efforts  was made by them last year. They had also presented model of an  alternative budget. This time, the concept of this alternative  budget is becoming a movement. Next month, on 13-14 February, a  conference will be held at Gandhi Shanti Pratisthan. The  alternative budget will be approved at that time.    The new economic policy of the government, meaning of  Finance  Minister Manmohan Singh, is pressured by all kind of  limitations. The dependence on foreign debts is known to all. It  has become a common knowledge that the government had written  the 1991 budget under pressure from the IMF and the World Bank.  Manmohan Singh is the creator of the new economic policy. He was  an economic advisor in the Chandra Shekhar government. A report  was sent by the World Bank during those days. This report was  kept hidden from Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar. It is a secret  as to who made that decision. Was the decision made because of  World Bank pressure? This new economic policy was born from that  report. Because of its dangerous aspects, the citizens council  was created in December 1992 and it is still working. Prof. Arun  Kumar says that the alternative budget will be able to solidly  refute the government claims. The government claims that the  path it has taken is the only alternative. He maintains that it  is not true.    The alternative budget will show that if the nation uses its  own resources properly, it will not need to borrow from abroad.  The government opposed to it says that foreign debts are  necessary and unavoidable. The decision to accept the Dunkel  proposal is part of this effort. The alternative budget will  show that. The alternative budget points to black money for  resource. Arun Kumar says that at least 30 percent of the total  economy is in black money, and it is not openly visible. Prof.  Surajbhan Gupta had estimated in 1987 that this portion was 47  percent. According to Prof. Surajbhan Gupta, there are over four  trillion rupees in black money in our economic system. Prof.  Arun Kumar estimates this amount to be 2.5 trillion rupees.    If we are successful to bring this portion under a taxation  system to the government treasury, it is estimated that the  government will earn 1.1 trillion rupees. At present the  government earns only 200 billion rupees in direct taxes. The  total budget deficit is 370 billion rupees. Even after paying  that deficit, the government will save 630 billion rupees. The  alternative budget emphasizes bringing the black money into the  taxation system. It pushes for expanding the sphere of direct  taxes. At present about six to seven million people are covered  by direct taxes.    If we change the meaning of this government looking after  the  interests of only three percent of the population, we will be  able to understand the philosophy behind the alternative budget.  They want to bring those three percent population under the  taxation system to protect the interests of the rest of the  population. Can strong political desire be changed in support of  it? This question is under discussion in this council. A  workshop was called in October 1993 to discuss the alternative  budget and the fact that our foreign currency deficit is related  to the black money was discussed at that time. The foreign  currency deficit is about 210 billion rupees. It is important to  know that foreign exchange of about 450 billion rupees goes out  of the country because of black money. In addition, political  leaders, businessmen, and industrialists are sending about 180  billion rupees abroad underreference' plan. According to one  estimate, between 1.8 trillion to 6 trillion rupees from our  economy are in other countries. The interest on it is about 180  billion rupees which does not come to our country.    The truth is that the effort to make an alternative economic  policy is a part of the swadeshi movement. More people are  joining it now. Representatives of other campaigns are also  joining it. The alternative budget will be an exercise.  Sub-committees on agriculture, imports-exports, employment,  institutional change, industries. taxation policy, and social  services are working for preparing the budget.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Professor Asrat Woldeyes has told an All-Amhara  People's Organization [AAPO] meeting in Addis Ababa that there  is no need of a government for a people who can administer  themselves in the absence of the rule of law and police.  Supporters of AAPO, who met yesterday to celebrate the second  anniversary of the organization, also were heard to say that a  nationality group capable of using its own language is a black  frenge [Amharic for "white man"], the inference of which means a  black as civilized as a white man.    Observers said that the supporters of AAPO's anniversary  meeting, presided over by its chairman Prof. Asrat, were at  first preoccupied with singing the songs of war. Prof. Asrat  said the day was the holiest of holidays and he wanted it to be  celebrated that way every year, adding that his organization  should wait for the outcome of the struggle beginning the day  after the transitional government continues to rule by means of  guns [as heard]. One of the points read out at the meeting  says: We should hold our flag high once these racists who  reduced our 3,000-year-old history to 100 years are annihilated.</p>

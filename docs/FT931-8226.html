			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Ireland and Norway cut rates NORWAY and Ireland both cut short term interest rates yesterday. Norway's central bank cut the key overnight lending rate to its lowest level since the rate was introduced in 1986. The cut in the benchmark rate, the third this month, was to 9.25 per cent from 9.50 per cent, from Monday. The move followed a period of strength in the krone and low money market rates. Norway uncoupled the krone from the European currency unit on December 10, and the currency has since fallen. The central bank also lowered the rate for overnight deposits, the credit rate, to 8.25 per cent from 8.50 per cent. The key rate reached 25 per cent last November during turbulence in the Scandinavian currency markets. Meanwhile in Ireland the central bank cut its short term lending facility (STF) by three quarters of a point to 13 per cent, its first reduction since it was raised by 3 points last September at the beginning of the ERM crisis. The STF was restored only two weeks ago at its suspension level of 13.75 per cent, having been withdrawn in November as the currency crisis deepened. It was temporarily replaced by an overnight lending facility which at times soared as high as 100 per cent, as the bank sought to ward off speculation on the punt. Commercial lending rates are pegged to the STF. However, financial institutions have been warning that unless interbank money rates fall, they may be obliged to increase their lending rates to businesses and mortgage holders. Since the punt was devalued last month, interbank money rates have remained stubbornly high.</p>

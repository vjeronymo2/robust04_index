			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jammu, February 19 (PTI)--The Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) President, Mr. L.K. Advani, said today India must convey a  "clear and loud message" to all concerned, including militants,  Pakistan and international community, that "Kashmir is an  inalienable part of the country and is non-negotiable."    Addressing a press conference here soon after his arrival  from New Delhi, Mr. Advani said "we must tell the United States,  which has been trying to pressurise India into making some  concession on Kashmir, that India regards accession of Jammu and  Kashmir to it as final and irrevocable.    He said the BJP was bringing a resolution in the Parliament  in this regard and expected unanimity of all members of the  Parliament on Kashmir issue.    The country as a whole has to dispel the impression of  international community that it could pressurise India on any  count with regard to Jammu and Kashmir and the countrymen have  to see that any compromise on Kashmir will have adverse effect  on the country's integrity and unity, he said.    The BJP leader criticised the Centre, particularly the  external affairs ministry, for its failure to present properly  the Indian case relating to Kashmir before world fora.    The United States, which favours the idea of independent  Kashmir for its own interests, has been making unfriendly  pronouncements and so there was no reason why the Centre should  not take them seriously, Mr. Advani said.    The external affairs ministry could not afford to ignore the  statement of United States' officials, including President Bill  Clinton, who has virtually endorsed Pakistan's viewpoint on  Kashmir, he said.    He said the biggest misnomer with the international  community  was the identity of Kashmir with a section of population in  Kashmir valley without realising that Jammu and Kashmir  comprises three regions with different religious and linguistics  groupings.    The Central government should have brought it to the  knowledge of the international community along the plight of  nearly 2.50 lakh [250,000 thousand] displaced Hindus from Valley  due to the proxy war waged by Pakistan.    "There cannot be greater case of suppression of human rights  that almost entire minority community of Hindus from Kashmir has  become refugees in their own country and still the Centre keeps  speaking on human rights in an apologetic way," he said.    Pakistan is responsible for violation of human rights in  Kashmir where so many thousands of people got killed due to  sponsored militancy from across the border and security forces  were fighting this proxy war with tight hands.    Mr. Advani said he met recently two British ambassadors to  India and Pakistan in New Delhi and explained them his party's  viewpoint on Kashmir.    Replying a question on Kashmir, the government, headed by  Mr.  Narasimha Rao, should quit in view of, what he called, its  failure on the Kashmir issue, Mr. Advani said.    However, he blamed the Centre for its policy on Kashmir from  the late 1989 when the first episode of kidnapping of Dr Rubiya  Sayeed, the daughter of the then home minister, Mr. Mufti  Mohammad Sayeed, took place.    He alleged even on the Hazratbal issue, the Centre acted  badly by releasing militants, including Pak officials.    Asked if Dr Farooq Abdullah could play a positive role in  the  present situation, Mr. Advani said "the basic issue is absence  of policy and perspective and not the individuals, bankruptcy of  policy could lead to more complications as it has been happening  all these years," he said.  *</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What About Consideration, </F> Gentlemen!"]    [Text] The Far Eastern Shipping Company [FESCO] has  stopped sending freight to Kamchatka. As of the beginning of  April the main sea route linking Kamchatka to the mainland is  totally closed.    The cable that the peninsula received from the FESCO says  that as of 1 April the sea port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy  owes Maritime Kray port workers over 1.5 billion rubles [R], as  a result of which the FESCO is forced to take "extreme, but  legal measures," namely the total banning of freight deliveries  to Kamchatka.    An cable in reply from Kamchatka Oblast Governor Vladimir  Biryukov to Vladivostok describes this measure as "not entirely  considerate toward the population of Kamchatka" since reciprocal  nonpayments are "not enterprises' fault, but their problem."  The port of Petropavlovsk is itself owed R5 billion by clients.</p>

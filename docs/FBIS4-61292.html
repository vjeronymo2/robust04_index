			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 4 May -- The Russian Federation's Foreign  Ministry expressed its willingness to cooperate with the new  democratic South Africa. A statement issued by the foreign  policy department voiced the hope that the good relations that  have taken shape between the two countries and their peoples  "will, in the period that lies ahead, be further developed in  the interests of world peace and prosperity."    In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, history's  first general election in the South Africa is an event "that has  fundamentally altered the course of historical development of  that country and of the region as a whole."    "The international community, which has for decades sought  persistently to bring about a restoration of racial and social  justice in South Africa, notes today that that goal has been  attained. For its part, Russia, which has invariably backed all  constructive efforts by the government, parties, and public  organizations in South Africa along the road of democratic  transformation, shares with everyone a sense of profound  satisfaction with the results of those efforts," the Foreign  Ministry statement stresses.</p>

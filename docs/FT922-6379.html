			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Smooth power change at the top for Renault - The group's new chairman It is a sign of how times have changed at Renault that the French state-owned car maker is expected in the next few days to put into effect the smoothest power change in its history. Mr Raymond Levy, chairman for the past six years, retired at midnight with the automatic expiry of his second three-year mandate. On Tuesday, the Renault board will nominate Mr Louis Schweitzer, 49, current managing director, who Mr Levy has been grooming as his successor for the past three years in the knowledge that he must retire by 65, which he reaches next month. The French cabinet has the final choice on public sector chairmanships and is expected to give approval on Wednesday. It cannot easily choose anybody else. Mr Schweitzer, one of the chief architects of Renault's alliance with Volvo, has the support of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Swedish group's president, who speaks for 20 per cent of the shares, the first time an outside investor has had an influence on a change of leadership at Renault. The principle of handing over power to someone inside the company has been rare in French state-owned industry, where appointments are set by central fiat, sometimes sensitive to political as much as business factors. However, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the new prime minister, has set the tone by declaring that he does not want to impose unnecessary management changes at the 45 or so other state companies whose chairmen come up for re-selection in the next few months. Trained in the oil and steel businesses, Mr Levy was parachuted into Renault from the top job at Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel group, after the previous car group chairman, Mr Georges Besse, was killed by terrorists in 1986. Mr Levy had little background in the car industry and so sensibly made it his mission to pursue the strategies initiated by Mr Besse of injecting more professionalism into management, cutting costs, modernising the organisation of work, improving quality and quickly renewing the model line. In 1987, Renault made its first profits for six years and earnings more than doubled last year to FFr3.08bn (Dollars 567m) net, helped by a sharp rise in sales to Germany, where Renault is the biggest selling foreign marque. The alliance with Volvo, pushed hard by Mr Levy, has proved more successful than either side expected and they both hint that it could develop into a full merger. Mr Levy says his only regret is that he could not have moved faster. Renault's old and new chairmen are very different people. Mr Levy is outgoing, with a reputation for either charming or upsetting his colleagues. On arriving at Renault, he made no bones about complaining that his Belgian-bought Renault 25 needed repairing every month and refused to accept sloppily written memos. As an economic liberal, he gets on badly with Mr Jacques Calvet, the chairman of Peugeot. Relations between the companies have sunk to an unprecedented low in recent years. Mr Schweitzer, a distinguished member of the left-wing establishment, is an unflappable intellectual. He comes from a family of intellectuals, as son of a former head of the International Monetary Fund and a great-nephew of Dr Albert Schweitzer, the Nobel prize winning missionary. He has a reputation for avoiding surface confrontation at all costs, but is at the same time stubborn - a mix of qualities that might appeal to his Swedish partners, and which might also permit better relations with Peugeot. Just how he managed to get on so well with Mr Levy is a mystery, especially since Mr Schweitzer once had the unenviable task of telling Mr Levy that his services were no longer needed as the head of Usinor, the state-owned steel group. At the time, Mr Schweitzer was senior adviser to Mr Laurent Fabius, when the current Socialist party leader was prime minister. Mr Schweitzer was appointed to the general management of Renault, his first industrial job, just after the Socialists lost the 1986 election and just before the death of Mr Besse. Mr Levy forgot old grudges fast after his unexpected arrival at Renault and soon appointed Mr Schweitzer to deputy managing director and then managing director in 1990. The two men do have one thing in common in that they are both products of the prestigious civil service colleges which prepare the French elite for power. Mr Schweitzer went to the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, founded after the war to regenerate the civil service, and including among its alumni several public sector chairmen and three prime ministers. He graduated to become an Inspecteur des Finances, the qualification to join the fast track at the treasury, awarded only to the top couple of dozen people of each generation. As Mr Schweitzer's career shows, Inspecteurs des Finances are also astonishingly adaptable.</p>

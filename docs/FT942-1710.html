			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Monklands Labour candidate slams council spending 'bias' Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate in the Monklands East by-election caused by the death of John Smith, said yesterday she would fight to rectify the bias in the allocation of spending by the district council towards one part of the district. She confronted the most explosive issue of the campaign for Labour - the long-standing allegation that Labour-controlled Monklands district council favours the town of Coatbridge at the expense of next-door Airdrie in its capital spending. Airdrie is at the centre of Monklands East constituency, near Glasgow, where polling takes place next Thursday. The issue, sometimes known as Monklandsgate, has been simmering since late 1992. Newspapers and dissident Labour councillors allege that a clique on the council - the 'Monklands Mafia' - favours predominantly Roman Catholic Coatbridge over Protestant Airdrie. It is also alleged that over several years a dominant group of Labour councillors, who are mainly Catholic, allocated 40 council jobs to their relatives. Mrs Liddell, having initially tried to stay aloof from the issue, wrote to the council on Tuesday asking for a breakdown of capital spending between Coatbridge and Airdrie, which are of similar size. After receiving the figures she said they proved that spending was concentrated on Coatbridge. They showed that between 1982 and 1992 Coatbridge received Pounds 18.8m on 'strategic projects', while Airdrie received nothing. Other capital spending was Pounds 49.8m on Airdrie and Pounds 51m on Coatbridge. Strategic projects include a leisure centre, country park, heritage park and council offices, all located in Coatbridge. Mrs Liddell said yesterday she wanted an explanation of the discrepancy between the council's figures and those collected by four dissident Labour councillors for the years 1989 to 1992, which showed 'a more marked difference' between the two towns in non-strategic spending. On this analysis Airdrie received Pounds 2.2m and Coatbridge Pounds 3.7m. She said: 'I'm determined to make sure that Airdrie, the outlying villages and the Coatbridge parts of the constituency are receiving their fair share of spending.' The acknowledgement by Mrs Liddell, who is a former secretary of the Scottish Labour party and was a close associate of John Smith, of shortcomings in the local council was seized on by the other candidates. Mrs Kay Ullrich, the Scottish National party candidate, said the electorate would not be duped by Mrs Liddell's 'amazing conversion'. Mrs Susan Bell, the Conservative candidate, said Mrs Liddell's words vindicated what the Tories had been saying.</p>

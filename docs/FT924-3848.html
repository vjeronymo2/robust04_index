			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Sugar faces resistance to Amstrad buy-out THE TIDE of shareholder opinion is flowing strongly against Mr Alan Sugar's controversial 30p-a-share bid to take Amstrad private, according to figures on proxy votes released by the consumer electronics group yesterday. Last night Mr Sugar said he was 'disappointed' by the poll so far and acknowledged that 'at the moment we are losing'. He appealed to shareholders who back his bid to 'wake up and get out their proxies'. In an attempt to swing small shareholders behind the buy-out bid, Amstrad has hired an outside polling firm to call shareholders at home. The practice is common in the US but unusual in Britain. If the trend revealed by the proxies already voted continues, Mr Sugar's proposal to pay Pounds 113m for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does not already own will be solidly defeated at the company's extraordinary general meeting next Thursday. Based on the 9,443 proxies received by the close of business on Thursday, 5,511, or almost 60 per cent, were against Mr Sugar's proposed 'scheme of arrangement'. However, it is open to shareholders to withdraw or reverse their proxy votes. Amstrad has 31,000 individual shareholders and, under one test of support, Mr Sugar needs to win a simple majority of those voting in person or by proxy to proceed with his plan to take the company he founded private again. This means that the vote of an individual shareholder, perhaps only holding a few shares, is as crucial as the vote of a big institutional investor holding millions of Amstrad shares. With almost a third of Amstrad's shareholders voting by Thursday, the proxy poll so far shows an unusually high shareholder interest in the outcome. Under a second test of support, Mr Sugar must also win the support of three-quarters of the shares he does not already own. Amstrad has 581.2m shares in issue, including 375.6m which Mr Sugar does not own. His bid would also fail this test on the basis of the proxies received. So far, just over 34m shares have been cast in favour of the scheme and 32.8m against. A separate resolution has won the backing of 45.9m shares against 33.1m, but both of these votes need to exceed 282m if Mr Sugar is to succeed. Mr Sugar said: 'I have been telling them all along, 30p is all I have got to offer. It is my opinion that if it is rejected they will never get the chance again.' He added that if his bid was defeated, 'I don't know what will happen'. But he said, 'one thing that will be cast in concrete in the City is that I once offered 30p'. Lex, Page 22</p>

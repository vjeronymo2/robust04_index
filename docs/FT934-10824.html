			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler fails to put brake on Dax rally GERMANY was the story of the day, but some other markets dropped back on individual news, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had a phenomenal session, a surge of 33.46 in the DAX index to 2,095.58 taking its gain to nearly 36 per cent on the year so far, turnover soaring from DM4.1bn to DM11.1bn and the Ibis-indicated DAX breaking 2,100 at one point in the afternoon before edging back to 2,086.40 at the post-bourse close. Mr Bernd Pinnicke, equity analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, forecast that the DAX would rise to between 2,400 and 2,500 in the next three to six months. Liquidity from abroad was still flowing in and many domestic investors, he said, were still underinvested in equities. The fundamental news was not good. Daimler indicated that it might be considering a reduction in its 1993 dividend and this merely cost it a below par share price rise of DM4.50 to DM752. Mr Harry Jaarsma, of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, observed that the DB Research forecasts would put the market on a prospective 1994 p/e of between 22.6 and 23.6. Mr Jaarsma noted outperformance among second liners like AEG, up DM7.30 to DM174.50 for a two-day gain of DM11.50, and among engineers where Linde rose DM34 to DM874 and Mannesmann by DM10.90 to DM354.20. PARIS drifted lower and the CAC-40 index settled just above the day's low, down 12.24 at 2,169.71. BZW's European equity strategists have recently upgraded their weighting in France to overweight, arguing that the market's recent underperformance 'has been driven by a deterioration of relative sentiment rather than fundamentals'. This positive attitude was echoed by Kleinwort Benson's research team. Maintaining an overweight position in France against Germany, they suggested that when the switch into equities does come - probably triggered by a further easing in interest rates - it will be domestically driven and therefore less vulnerable to US profit-taking. Peugeot slipped FFr8 to FFr646 ahead of reporting an 8.5 per cent fall in third quarter turnover. STOCKHOLM declined on worries over Volvo's proposed merger with Renault of France and a downgrade by Morgan Stanley of Astra, the pharmaceutical company. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 11.9 to 1,425.9. Volvo closed off SKr14 to SKr427 as it announced a one month postponment of a shareholders meeting to discuss the merger proposals. Astra lost SKr8 to SKr163 on the downgrade. Mr James McKean, pharmaceuticals analyst at Morgan Stanley, reduced his estimate for earnings growth to 20 per cent from 25 per cent given 'the more difficult environment for healthcare companies in the 1990s.' MILAN focused attention on developments involving Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, and the Comit index eased 3.66 to 579.75, also reflecting political concerns after the budget minister warned that the government's proposals might not win parliamentary approval before the year-end deadline. Olivetti was marked down 4.8 per cent before paring the loss to finish L49 or 2.7 per cent lower at L1,752 as the chairman surrendered to police in response to an arrest warrant issued by Rome magistrates, investigating alleged corruption. ZURICH remained in record territory, with the firm dollar and interest rate outlook again providing the conditions for a 15.8 rise in the SMI index to 2,742.9. Winterthur bearers added SFr31 to SFr849 as the insurer forecast higher profits in 1993. The positive tone helped Zurich Insurance, up SFr29 to SFr1,387 and Swiss Re, up SFr50 to SFr3,820. AMSTERDAM remained on the upward track with the CBS Tendency index adding a further 1.3 to 137.7, although off the day's high of 138.5. VNU was a strong riser in low volume, adding Fl 5.50 to Fl 154.00. BRUSSELS recorded a new year's high with a substantial amount of foreign buying being seen. The Bel-20 index rose 4.32 to 1,385.70 in turnover of some BFr1.9bn. MADRID's US quoted stocks reflected mid-morning weakness on Wall Street, Repsol falling Pta40 to Pta3,995 as the general index closed 1.03 lower at 307.17. ATHENS lost a further 1.6 per cent after Monday's decline of 1.5 per cent as many investors continued to take profits. The general index fell 13.42 to 807.37. ISTANBUL settled down 1.9 per cent on fears that the coalition might split. The composite index tumbled 267.1 to 13,668.1.

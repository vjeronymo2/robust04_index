			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AVON SLAMS DOOR ON ANOTHER SUITOR, MARY KAY COSMETICS  </P> <P> Avon Products Inc. today snubbed a merger overture by Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.,  a rival door-to-door cosmetics company, with Avon's chairman -- in a now  familiar refrain -- stating the company is not for sale.  </P> <P> "We see no advantage to combining our operations through some form of leveraged  buyout or other arrangement," Avon Chairman James E. Preston said in a letter  to Mary Kay's vice chairman, John Rochon.  </P> <P> Rochon wrote to Avon last week on behalf of an investment group expressing an  interest in acquiring Avon, although a price was not named.  </P> <P> "Avon's board has said that the company is not for sale and that this would be  the worst time to sell -- just when Avon is in a strong turnaround," Preston  said in the letter released by Avon.  </P> <P> Senior managers of Avon, which rejected a $2.1-billion proposal from Amway  Corp. two weeks ago, unveiled a plan May 19 to boost earnings per share by 20%  a year over the next few years.  </P></p>

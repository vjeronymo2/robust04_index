			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Leading Article: The case for work-sharing The renewed interest in work-sharing among European governments, some larger employers, and the European Commission, does not deserve the brush off it has received from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor. Some of Mr Clarke's suspicions are well-founded. Work-sharing has become associated with anti-competitive reductions in working time, as proposed in a recent European Socialist manifesto. Supporters of work-sharing also sometimes make the elementary mistake of assuming a static economy with a fixed amount of labour to share out and so overstate its potential contribution to reducing unemployment. But there are, equally, a number of economic and political trends that are making work-sharing a more practical proposition. First, there is a much more realistic acceptance on the part of employees, and even some unions, that work-sharing means pay-sharing and must not be allowed to increase unit labour costs. Second, a decade of growing incomes for most of those in employment in Europe has increased the number of employees who are sufficiently well paid to countenance a trade-off between pay and working time. Third, opinion polls suggest that work-sharing is popular because it goes with the grain of more flexible and family-friendly working hours. Indeed, on the same day that Mr Clarke was dismissing work-sharing in Brussels, Ms Ann Widdicombe, the Employment Minister, was praising it in London, at a seminar organised by a group called New Ways to Work. Prejudice and inertia Standing in the way of the spread of work-sharing is prejudice and inertia on the part of both employers and employees, along with an array of tax, employment law, benefit and pension rules which create disincentives to cutting hours and pay. To cite just one example, a large number of older workers who might be attracted to work-sharing as they approach retirement are put off by final salary pensions, which link their pension level to their final rates of pay. Many employers, too, point out that even if workers take corresponding cuts in pay the outcome is not neutral for unit labour costs as there are extra head-count costs relating to such things as recruitment and training. One idea would be for governments to provide modest incentives for employers to off-set the disincentives to companies of a larger headcount. But many employers should not require subsidies. Service organisations, especially, can get a better relative contribution from part-time or four-day-week staff. By offering flexible working time packages, they can recruit from a larger base and retain valued staff. The main role for government should, therefore, be in removing disincentives which work against flexible working hours. Reduction in hours Government can also set an example in the public sector. The Netherlands example, where all new posts in the public sector are limited to a maximum 32 hour week, would probably not be appropriate in the UK. But the Netherlands did experience a 30 per cent rise in employment between 1983 and 1991, along with a 13 per cent reduction in hours worked per person. The economics of work-sharing is more complex than that equation suggests, and work-sharing does not deal with the root causes of unemployment. But if the effect on both demand and competitiveness is neutral, there is no reason why it should not have some small positive impact on employment over the medium-term. For many workers, however, especially those on middle or lower incomes, cutting working time and pay remains unattractive. Nissan car workers in Sunderland, faced with a downturn in production recently, chose to stick to normal working hours for the majority and voluntary redundancy for a small minority. And even relatively well-off Volkswagen workers have been complaining that the loss of one day's pay per week will leave them struggling. The message that there is no such thing as a 'normal' working week, working day or working lifetime will take years to sink in. That applies as much in Brussels as in governments and businesses across Europe.</p>

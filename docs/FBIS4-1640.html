			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, has  been barred from seeing foreign journalists for the next three  years.    Sources in the dissident community said last night that  because of intensified pressure from security officials, a  number of dissidents were considering leaving the country  temporarily.    The ban was slapped on Mr Wei in spite of the fact that he  completed his 15-year prison sentence this week.    "Wei Jingsheng has been deprived of his political rights for  three years and is not allowed to meet foreign journalists  during that time," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement  yesterday.    However, ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, was unable to  specify the legal basis for such a statement.    Deprivation of political rights usually refers to the right  to vote, stand for public office or join the Communist Party.    There does not appear to be any specific provision banning  those deprived of their rights from meeting journalists.    The Foreign Ministry also refused to say whether the ban  extended to foreign diplomats and government officials.    China severely criticised United States Assistant Secretary  of State, John Shattuck, for meeting Mr Wei in February,  claiming he had violated Article 75 of the criminal code since  at that time Mr Wei was a "criminal on parole".    Since Mr Wei completed his period of parole on Tuesday,  Article 75 can no longer be cited as a reason not to meet  foreigners.    Analysts said the only way a ban on meetings could be  justified was if it were deemed that by talking to foreign  reporters, Mr Wei was "engaging in political activities".    The Foreign Ministry statement reflects the determination of  the Government to keep China's "No 1 trouble maker" under  control for the foreseeable future.    Mr Wei, who was pressured into leaving Beijing prior to the  arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, has still  not returned to the capital and there is no indication of when  he might come back.    The leader of the Democracy Wall movement originally said he  was just going out of town for a "few days" for reasons of poor  health but most analysts believe he has been ordered to take an  extended vacation.    There is speculation Mr Wei might be kept out of the way for  a few more months given the upcoming 75th anniversary of the May  4th movement and the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre,  both highly sensitive dates in the Chinese political calendar.    Dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai faced stepped-up  harassment by police and state-security agents. A source said  several blacklisted dissidents were considering heading towards  the south-east coast, the traditional springboard for fleeing  the country.    It is understood these pro-democracy elements feared being  taken into custody in the run-up to June 4.    "Security agents hauled in scores of `trouble-makers' in  Shanghai, Beijing, and other cities in May and June in 1992 and  1993, and some of these detainees are still behind bars," the  source said.    Sources in Beijing said authorities in the industrial city  of  Tangshan were investigating the escape late last month of  activist Wang Jiaqi, a 34-year-old postgraduate law student at  Beijing University.    Together with law lecturer Yuan Hongbing and underground  labour unionist Zhou Guoqiang, Wang was detained on March 2 for  allegedly organising a petition on political reform.</p>

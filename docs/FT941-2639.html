			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Goal Petroleum falls 27% Lower production and higher tax provisions hit net profits at Goal Petroleum, the North Sea oil and gas explorer which yesterday announced a 27 per cent drop to Pounds 5.1m for the year to December 31. Turnover fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 42.4m, due to maintenance work on two fields - Buchan and Wytch Farm. Tax rose 40 per cent to Pounds 2.8m because of changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax. Mr David Boyd, managing director, said Goal was confident of a recovery in production. He was particularly optimistic given the 5 per cent rise in proven and probable reserves to 41.6m barrels of oil equivalent, following recent acquisitions. The group was keeping an eye on opportunities abroad, Mr Boyd said. Although Goal remained committed to the North Sea, eventually it would 'have to go further afield'. Areas of particular interest were Venezuela and Australia. Goal spent some Pounds 15m on exploration, largely to appraise previous discoveries. The group expected to spend about half that this year, with more investment in developing assets. 'We are reflecting industry pressures,' said Mr Boyd. 'Money is being spent on investments that are likely to make earlier returns.' Such trends become more common at times of weak oil prices. Goal finished the year with net debt of Pounds 13m, or 14 per cent of shareholders' funds. This compared with net debt of Pounds 18.7m and gearing of 21 per cent. The dividend was increased from 1.4p to 1.45p. Earnings fell from 5.23p to 3.79p.</p>

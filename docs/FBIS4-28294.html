			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Blast of War Fanatic" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense Secretary  Perry appeared on NBC television recently and let out the  dangerous blast that "a preemptive strike against North Korea  remains an option", according to a foreign press report.    The reckless war blast of Perry came at a time when the  United States and its followers were seeking openly to impose  "sanctions" on the DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear issue".  This is an unpardonable criminal act of driving the situation  to the brink of war.    Recently, Perry put the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea  in "a round-the-clock alert posture" and brought the extra-large  carrier Independence to the waters where it could enter into war  exercises against the North within a few days, and planned a  large-scale naval war exercise in the waters around the Korean  peninsula, inciting a war fever.    Judging from the fact that Perry threatened a "preemptive  attack" on the extension line of these military moves, it is  only too clear that it was not a mere threat but a war blast  signalling the green light to the actually provocation of a  second Korean war.    It is a gross miscalculation if the U.S. hardline  conservative force think they can overpower the North through a  "surprise attack" by force of arms, without the least intention  to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    We are fully prepared to cope with any case.</p>

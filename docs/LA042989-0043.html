			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CASE OF TWO PLAYERS IN THE WRONG PLACE WITH THE WRONG SKIN?  </P> <P> The NFL's recent snubbing of USC's talented quarterback, Rodney Peete, during  its draft was compounded by the Raiders' questionable sixth-round selection of  the immortal Jeff Francis of Tennessee (one pick before Detroit selected  Peete).  </P> <P> I know Al Davis was burned in his previous attempt to turn a sixth-rounder into  a competent quarterback (see Rusty Hilger), but Peete's no sixth-rounder.  </P> <P> DONNIE G. WALLACE  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> COMMITTEE BEGINS STUDY OF CHILD CARE  </P> <P> An ad hoc committee began work last week on its assignment from the City  Council to study child-care needs and make suggestions.  </P> <P> The group will inventory current programs, public policies and needs; project  future needs; examine model programs, and define the role of public agencies,  private nonprofit agencies and local businesses, said Randy Westrick,  recreation supervisor for Tustin.  </P> <P> City officials began considering the subject of child care earlier this year  after discussing issues surrounding the city-sponsored preschool.  </P> <P> "I think people realize there are gaps," Westrick said. "The idea of the  (committee's) report is to quantify and correct where those gaps are."  </P> <P> The 28-member committee includes a cross section of city and school district  officials, child-care providers and parents.  </P> <P> "I was very impressed with the caliber and the range of knowledge of people (at  last week's meeting)," said Councilwoman Leslie Anne Pontious. "I'm delighted  to see it off the ground and on its way."  </P> <P> New members are welcome to join the committee, which is scheduled to meet again  at 7 p.m. Aug. 28 in the senior center.  </P> <P> "But if people come to the meeting, they're going to get put to work," Westrick  warned.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Rossana Alves] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- During a breakfast with foreign  correspondents, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso used  the occasion to send a tough message to Congress: The  government is not willing to negotiate the terms of the  provisional measure creating the Real Value Unit (URV) with the  legislative branch because the program must be fully maintained.  According to the minister, if the legislative branch approves  the measure, the possibility of running for president will be  more remote. If the legislative branch rejects the measure, it  would pave the way for his departure from the government and his  involvement in the campaign.    Already anticipating that the PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party] would strongly press him to become the party's  presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique noted: "If Congress  says no to my proposals, it would be the best way of making me a  candidate. If Congress says yes, it would bind me. By saying  no, Congress would liberate me. If Congress makes a drastic  decision against my proposals, it is not necessary for me to  remain in the government."    The minister noted that it would not be viable to implement  the new currency by 2 April when the deadline for the ministers  who are also candidates to leave the government expires.  Nevertheless, he cautioned that if prices run out of control,  the government might advance the implementation of the new  currency because the measure allows for the creation of the real  at any time.  <H5>  Rates </H5>   The provisional measure restores to the finance minister the  power to establish rate increases in electricity, fuels,  telecommunications, and postal services, among other services.  According to Fernando Henrique, the governors may not increase  the energy rates, for example, without previous approval by the  ministry. The previous rules will be maintained: Once or twice  a month the rates will be adjusted using the average rates of  the past four months.  <H5>  Oligopolies </H5>   The Finance Ministry has listed the prices for 470 products  sold by oligopolies during the past three years. If there are  any abusive increases, the minister noted, entrepreneurs will be  summoned to give explanations. Fernando Henrique admitted that  it will not be easy to negotiate with these sectors, which are  responsible for 30 percent of the products included in the  inflation rate. Nevertheless, he announced that the government  might reduce import tariffs as a way of preventing excessive  increases. The minister cautioned that it is not easy to  negotiate with oligopolies "in Brazil or the United States."  <H5>  Minimum Wages </H5>   Despite the fact that the government has formed a commission  to study a way of increasing the minimum wage's purchasing power  by 50 percent by the end of year, Fernando Henrique described  this possibility as not viable. In his opinion, the commission  will study if minimum wages can be increased, guaranteeing  economic stability. Fernando Henrique noted that the decree  forming the commission "is a sign that the government is not  satisfied with minimum wages, that they are low." He used the  occasion to satirize the trade unions that announced strikes  against the losses caused by the conversion to the URV system.  <H5>  Public Deficit </H5>   The minister guaranteed that the government managed to bring  the public deficit to zero last year -- both the primary deficit  (revenues less expenditures, not including interest) and the  operational deficit (including expenditures and interest) -- at  the expense of strongly curbing expenditures. He reported that  the government now wants to guarantee a zero deficit without  withholding the release of appropriations and without using the  so-called inflationary tax that totaled about $12 billion last  year. The minister hinted that the declining inflation rate  will cause problems for state banks, which will have to  introduce a strong adjustment to survive in a stabilized  economy. He said: "There will be a shower of marches and  protests by bank employees, especially Bank of Brazil employees,  because the banks will have to streamline."  <H5>  Foreign Exchange Rate </H5>   Despite the substantial entry of dollars, which causes  problems in the management of the quantity of real cruzeiros  circulating in the economy, the minister ruled out the  possibility of implementing measures to restrict the entry of  foreign capital into Brazil. According to the minister, the  government has not officially put our national currency at par  with the dollar, like in Argentina, in order to allow more  leeway in establishing the foreign exchange rate. The goal is  to prevent an overvaluation of real cruzeiros against dollars,  which would discourage exports.  <H5>  Privatizations </H5>   The minister announced that the government plans to sell its  minority stock in public and private enterprises, including the  National Iron and Steel Company, this week. Through  privatizations, the government hopes to collect $900 million  this year.</p>

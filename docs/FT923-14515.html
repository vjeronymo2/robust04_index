			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Fighter tamed by friendly skies: Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister, explains his government's decision on the EFA to David Marsh and Edward Mortimer Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has always considered himself an Anglophile. It is a matter of regret to him that his first important decision as defence minister, to end German participation in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, is one that causes problems between Germany and Britain. But he is quite firm about it, quite clear about his reasons for it, and philosophical about the unkind things the British press has had to say - though he does resent suggestions that Germany has shown itself an unreliable partner. 'My relationship with Britain started with Shakespeare,' he declares, 'and it's not going to end with EFA.' One point he was anxious to get across in London yesterday, both to his opposite number Mr Malcolm Rifkind and to Conservative back-benchers, was that Germany never committed itself to production of the aircraft. The commitment was to research and develop it, and Germany is still willing to pay its share of the development costs if its partners decide to go ahead. Mr Ruhe would prefer, however, to redirect the money not yet spent (which he estimates at DM 3bn (Pounds 1bn) - 50 per cent of the total) to the development of a new, 'drastically cheaper' aircraft, corresponding to the requirements of a strategic context which has changed out of recognition since the original decision to develop EFA was taken in 1984. Mr Ruhe argues that the present EFA cannot be slimmed down any further. He says it has already been cut to a point where it no longer makes sense, by cutting out a number of crucial features such as friend-foe identification - savings he regards as illusory, since both manufacturers and the purchasing air forces would certainly argue for the reinstatement of such features later in the programme. With his penchant for plain speaking, Mr Ruhe brings a touch of populism to his job entirely absent from the desiccated tones of his predecessor, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg. Whereas Mr Stoltenberg could sound like a somewhat academic pastor, Mr Ruhe peppers his conversations with phrases such as: 'When the earth changes, shouldn't the plane change too?' Perhaps most irritating to his British interlocutors is Mr Ruhe's relaxed position on the timing of any decision on the production of a new aircraft. He would be happy to leave it till 1996, since Germany is modernising the American Phantom fighters it already has in service, and will not need replacements before 2000 or even 2001. The British and Italian air forces are in much more of a hurry. Yet Mr Ruhe believes his worries about cost overruns are shared by Germany's partners. His semi-ironic message, repeated incessantly in London yesterday, was that 'Germany is not the only poor country in Europe'. The Spaniards, he believes, are already close to his position, and the Italians for budgetary reasons will almost certainly not be able to take up their full quota of aircraft. And if his partners do agree, he would very much like to bring in the French as well. There is always the obvious fall-back option of buying American, but this has been ruled out by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Ruhe refuses to discuss it publicly. Mr Waigel's Christian Social Union, based in Bavaria, home to much of the German aerospace industry, has argued strongly in favour of the EFA. Mr Ruhe points out that the economics of the EFA have been undermined by the increased number of arms manufacturers (including Russians) jostling for position on a much reduced export market for sophisticated weapons systems. The vital position, he agrees, is that of the UK, but he believes the debate there is only beginning, in contrast to the intense political argument which has raged in Germany over the aircraft's future ever since it was first mooted. Mr Ruhe would like to end this 'religious warfare over weapons systems' by starting a dialogue with the 'constructive forces' in the Social Democratic opposition. A similar dialogue is necessary in another controversial aspect of German defence policy - whether German troops are to be deployed outside the Nato area, either as 'blue helmet' peacekeepers or in a more active 'peacemaking' role. Mr Ruhe has already stretched the consensus to its limit by despatching a 150-man medical corps to Cambodia, and three 'humanitarian' aircraft to Sarajevo. He has argued that combat units could be sent on peacekeeping operations without amending the German constitution, but on this point both his Free Democrat partners and the Social Democrat opposition disagree. He makes no bones of the fact that his motives for dropping the EFA are political as well as budgetary. Traditionally in post-war Germany the defence ministry has been a graveyard for political careers. Mr Ruhe - a foreign policy spokesman and adviser before Mr Kohl made him general secretary of the CDU in 1989 - would certainly have preferred to be foreign minister, had that post not been the preserve of the junior partner in the coalition, the Free Democratic Party. But Mr Ruhe, who clearly harbours ambitions to become chancellor himself one day, has skilfully exploited his new post by adopting the popular role of a cost-cutting defence minister - an option made available by the end of the Cold War - rather than the previously inescapable one of spokesman for the armed forces. He is also, more than some other west German politicians, acutely conscious of the need to cement the unification of the country. Born in 1942, he spent a few years of his early childhood in the east after the end of the war, and has lived with the knowledge that if his mother had stayed there, instead of returning to Hamburg, he would have grown up as an east German. As a result he was always sensitive to the consequences west German policy might have for the lives of ordinary people in the east, and when unification came he was quick to proclaim, as a north German Protestant, that the country as a whole must expect to change. Today, he justifies his decision on the EFA by pointing out that the aircraft was commissioned at a time when there were thousands of Soviet aircraft in east Germany. He argues that if the government went ahead with it now east Germans would see it as 'a symbol of west German business as usual' - exactly the wrong signal for the government to send at a time when there is talk of forming separate east German parties.</p>

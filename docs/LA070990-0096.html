			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> TRANSFER REQUESTS AT UCI INCREASE 18%  </P> <P> Encouraging high school students to complete introductory classes at a  community college before transferring to UC Irvine appears to be paying off.  </P> <P> As of last Monday, UCI has received 3,742 transfer applications from students  at community colleges and four-year universities, an 18% increase from the same  time last year, said Susan Wilbur, special assistant for enrollment management.  The increase probably will allow UCI to meet its fall goal of admitting 1,150  students with prior college experience. Last year, the campus fell below that  goal by about 200 students, she said.  </P> <P> Students transferring from other colleges are easier to accommodate because  they have completed beginning courses and are ready to enroll in more  specialized, less crowded classes, she said.  </P> <P> Overcrowding at UCI has forced the university to reject qualified high school  graduates because not enough freshman seats were available. Introductory  courses at UCI typically are full, with students sometimes spilling into the  aisles during the fall quarter.  </P> <P> In response, the university has been encouraging qualified freshmen to complete  one or two years at a community college, after which time they are guaranteed  acceptance by UCI.  </P> <P> The higher number of transfer students this summer may reflect the success of  that program, said Juel Lee, director of transfer student services. The  increase probably also is due to UCI's effort to work with local community  colleges to create an easy bridge between those schools and UCI, he said. Not  only has UCI been encouraging qualified students to attend a community college  first but UCI and community college counselors have also instituted formal  programs to guide students intending to transfer, Lee said.  </P> <P> "We don't want to lose those people," he said.  </P> <P> Eight of 10 community colleges serving UCI have set up Transfer Centers to  provide information and counseling about the University of California and  California State University campuses, Lee said. UCI also set up its ZOT!  program -- Zero-in On Transferring -- last year to provide counseling to  community colleges students. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

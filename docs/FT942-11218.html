			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: MEPC pays Pounds 67m for Midlands properties MEPC, the quoted property company, has bought a Pounds 67m portfolio of office and industrial properties in the Midlands from the Richardson Group, a private property company. It is also negotiating with John Laing, the construction company, about acquiring Castlecourt, a Belfast shopping centre. The 14 properties being acquired from Richardson total 1.75m sq ft of space and range from industrial estates to newly erected government offices at the Waterfront, Merry Hill, West Midlands. The overall yield was 9.5 per cent. Two properties in the portfolio are under construction, namely the St Chads office development in Birmingham and the Waterfront Business Park at Merry Hill. The final price will be determined by the letting of these properties. MEPC said the acquisitions gave it an interesting mixed portfolio to which it believed it could add value. Richardson said it intended to sell more investments this year, to 'take full advantage of the current buying interest in investment properties'. In a separate announcement, John Laing said it had received a number of unsolicited offers for Castlecourt. It is pursuing exclusive negotiations with MEPC. Hanson Properties has sold a portfolio of properties for Pounds 85m to O&amp;H Properties, a subsidiary of O&amp;H Holdings, a privately-owned development company, based in Hammersmith, west London. The portfolio, which is spread across England, Scotland and Wales, is composed of office buildings (57 per cent) and shopping centres (38 per cent) together with some warehouses (5 per cent). Hanson said it was disposing of the portfolio as part of its general strategy of selling properties that had been acquired with large acquisitions. About Pounds 30m of the initial consideration - which represents the approximate net asset value of the properties - is in guaranteed deferred notes. The deal was funded by GE Capital, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, which has provided structured finance that included a share in the equity appreciation of the properties.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> ARMENIA SISTER CITY STUDIED  </P> <P> A city formerly closed to foreigners in Soviet Armenia could become the city's  fourth Sister City under a recommendation from the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> Byurakan, Armenia, a town of 25,000 people that was previously not even listed  on maps, was proposed Tuesday by the board. The town is in the Caucasus  Mountains and is well known as a scientific center and for its observatory,  said Charles Papas, a professor of electrical engineering at Caltech.  </P> <P> The Armenian city would join the ranks of Ludwigshafen in West Germany, Mishima  in Japan and Jarvenpaa in Finland, if the city's Sister City Committee approves  the choice. Director Bill Paparian suggested that the decision be made by May.  </P> <P> But Anthony Anderson, head of the city's Sister City Committee, said approval  must also be received from Soviet officials in Moscow, who have approved 36  Soviet cities previously.  </P> <P> Committee members also said that the Armenian city may not be an appropriate  choice for the program, because of the possible lack of cultural and  educational institutions through which visitors are exchanged. But Mayor  William Thomson suggested that the relationship with Byurakan might be  different -- more technical and practical -- than previous Sister City  exchanges.  </P></p>

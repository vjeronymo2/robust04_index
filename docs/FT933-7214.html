			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: English &amp; Scottish asset value jumps At the end of July the net asset value per share of English &amp; Scottish Investors stood at 118.6p. This showed a signifi-cant advance on previous levels. At January 31 1993 it came to 106.7p and six months prior to that it was 81.6p. In the half year ended July 31 1993 gross income improved from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 3.62m. Net revenue, however, fell from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 939,000, mainly because of higher interest charges. Earnings per share dropped to 0.57p (0.74p) but the in-terim dividend is maintained at 0.5p, payable on October 19.</p>

He told a press conference in Pretoria that Johannesburg's  street battles represented an intensification of the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP]/African National Congress [ANC] war. The  clashes occurred because the government and ANC were pressing on  with the constitutional process and elections while Zulus, like  the Afrikaners, had not yet been politically accommodated. He  hoped the election would be postponed.    Gen Viljoen added there was "no hope" of the police and the  defence force solving the problem unless there was solidarity in  the security forces. One could not break down the morale of the  police and that of South Africans, as had happened, and still  think one could control security.    The defence force was already experiencing problems because  of the low response rate, as little as five per cent, to call-up  orders. In this type of war there could be no military  solution, but only a political solution.    -- There had been much progress in negotiations with the  government and the ANC on the establishement of an Afrikaner  "volkstaat" [homeland], and Gen Viljoen said he had asked  President F. W. de Klerk on Monday for a further round of  trilateral talks to obtain clarity on the concept of  self-determination so that people voting for the FF knew what  they were voting for.    The FF released its election manifesto at the conference. It  stated the FF rejected any notion of a unitary state subjugating  the Afrikaner people, or any form of communism.    The FF sought a confederal dispensation for South Africa.</p>

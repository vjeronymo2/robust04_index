			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Russia to press for more flexible approach to debt Russia will use the Naples summit to press for a new and more flexible approach among the developed capitalist economies towards the debt problem of all former communist states, according to Russian officials. In contrast with previous encounters between Russian leaders and the Group of Seven, Moscow will not this time be asking its partners for any more government-to-government credits. The country's balance of payments improved markedly last year, and Russian officials are confident of a spontaneous inflow of private capital, much of it Russian-controlled but currently held abroad, now that the first phase of a privatisation programme has been completed. 'It is the Russian capitalists we want to attract with favourable conditions,' Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, said before his departure for Naples. However, Russia does want as broad and long-term an understanding as possible with the G7 on terms of the repayment of its external debt, which Mr Shokhin estimated at around Dollars 72bn (Pounds 46.7bn). Western estimates are in excess of Dollars 80bn dollars. The deputy prime minister, who had several meetings in Naples yesterday with G7 officials, has called for a 'new mode of co-existence' between the leading capitalist countries and states in transition from communism. He also wants the G7 to take into account the fact that Russia is owed, in theory at least, up to Dollars 140bn by former client states of the Soviet Union. Moscow would like the help of western states in collecting some of this debt. The Russian team will also be pressing its support for plans by the International Monetary Fund to approve the issue of several billion dollars' worth of special drawing rights to ex-communist states.</p>

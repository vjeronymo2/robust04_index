			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Thailand reneges on Dollars 1bn contract - Motorway dispute A DECISION by the Thai government to renege on the terms of a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 636m) elevated motorway contract for Bangkok just as the road is due to open has angered foreign and local investors, and threatens to undermine efforts to finance future infrastructure projects in Thailand. Foreign and Thai banks which have committed the equivalent of Bt20bn (Pounds 513m) to Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the construction consortium led by Kumagai Gumi of Japan, are due to meet in Hong Kong today to discuss the increasingly bitter dispute. The banks have suspended loan disbursements to BECL since March. BECL consortium members and lenders accuse the Thai Rapid Transit Authority and the Thai government of breaching the contract on a number of counts - notably in refusing to charge the toll fees specified in the contract. The cabinet decided unilaterally last month to impose a Bt20 toll for cars using the expressway system, instead of the contracted Bt30 fee, because it feared political opposition. BECL signed the 30-year contract to build and operate the road in 1988. The expressway dispute is regarded as a test case by bankers and foreign investors because Thailand is expected to seek billions of dollars in credits in the next few years for much-needed infrastructure projects. Bangkok is probably the most traffic-congested capital in the world andthere are three elevated railway projects worth a total of about Dollars 7bn planned for the city . Eleven Thai banks agreed to provide up to Bt15bn in credit facilities for the new expressway and several of them also have equity; a group of 31 foreign banks, led by DKB Asia, LTCB Asia, Credit Lyonnais and National Westminster, agreed to lend the equivalent of Bt5bn; and the ADB provided Dollars 40m in long-term credit and equity.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Time to combat the rot: The initiatives of Stanley Kalms Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of the Dixons electrical goods retailer, is tired of headlines about crime and the disintegration of UK urban life, and has decided to do something about it. He is planning to sponsor a school in Yorkshire with Pounds 100,000 of his own money, and is thinking about setting up a private police force with other British store chains. These moves underline Mr Kalm's belief that business people should take on wider responsibilities to combat what he describes as the 'nasty infection' taking root in Britain's social fabric. Mr Kalms, a supporter of the Conservative party, is an unusual industrialist. While acknowledging the economic growth brought about by the unleashing of market forces in the 1980s, he stresses their role in helping to create conditions for high unemployment, a growing crime wave and a criminal justice system that he reckons has 'fallen asleep'. At times sounding like Mr Tony Blair, the Labour home affairs spokesman, Mr Kalms accuses the government of being slow to work out the link between inadequacies in the education system and poorly trained young people who turn to crime. He reckons industry has a vital job in helping schools produce adaptable youngsters who will find productive employment. The 61-year-old Mr Kalms points out that, ironically, many of the maxims of Baroness Thatcher's 'enterprise culture' are being applied to breaking the law. 'The crime industry is a major profession, turning out new products at a rate of knots,' he says. His interests in social regeneration have developed during a 45-year business career spent entirely with Dixons - which he has built up from one shop owned by his father to a 1,000-store business with annual sales of nearly Pounds 2bn. Among his attributes are a gift for plain speaking and good political connections: he is a member of the group of business executives occasionally invited to Downing Street for informal discussions with Mr John Major. His non-business interests are illustrated by his scheme to sponsor a school to help it specialise in science and computers. Dixons is already sponsoring a school in Bradford, Yorkshire, as part of the government's city technology college programme, designed to teach more youngsters about industry. Mr Kalms says there is a direct connection between education - or lack of it  -and crime. While he is keen to improve training for young people, he says industrialists should not sit on their hands while their businesses suffer through what he decribes as a breakdown of law and order. That explains why he is talking to other big retailers about setting up joint security squads to patrol high streets to protect property and shoppers from criminals. But he stresses this does not mean behaving irresponsibly. Mr Kalms has seconded one of his Dixons executives to the Home Office for six months to ensure any new action by the private sector on security squads is co-ordinated with the police. Mr Kalms welcomes the results of government action in the 1980s to privatise nationalised industries and reduce trade union power. But he links the free-market approach - involving greater competition and fewer restrictions on sacking people - to high unemployment. He reckons business has a role to play in tackling social problems, partly because 'industry rode the tiger and prospered' in the 1980s. He also reckons companies are in a good position to impart skills to young people by helping 'create a seamless system of education through to employment'. He is enthusisatic, for example, about how Dixons' college in Bradford asked its pupils to design a new plastic bag for the company's shops. 'The people who worked on this have got a total understanding of commercial culture. After they leave school they'll be snapped up.' With public policy looming large in Mr Kalms's arguments, what advice does he have for the chancellor ahead of the Budget due later this month? The Dixons chairman acknowledges Mr Kenneth Clarke's need to bring down the Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. But sounding emphatically unThatcherite, he suggests the government should consider tax rises to curb the deficit, on the grounds that public spending cuts could make social problems worse. 'The government's greatest priority should be safeguarding the community,' he says.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Balladur sees no easy fix on jobs CLASSIC ways of lifting France out of recession through a big boost in public spending and a sharp cut in interest rates would not work in an economy beset with such a high level of structural unemployment, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said yesterday. Addressing a conference organised by the International Herald Tribune, Mr Balladur was thus rejecting criticism, partly from within his own parliamentary majority but also often echoed in the foreign exchange markets, that his go-slow approach will prove politically untenable in the face of lengthening dole queues. Mr Balladur said that, given the openness of the French economy, the effect on employment of policies designed simply to stimulate demand 'would at best be negligible in the short term and unfavourable in the long term'. Spending in the 1994 budget is due to rise by 1.1 per cent, or at half the predicted inflation rate. Equally, Mr Balladur ruled out trying to 'force' interest rates down, not only because such a move would bring the franc down and inflation up, but also because 'with companies so uncertain about demand and with significant unused capacity . . . the impact on consumption and investment would be very weak'. In contrast to the government's first four months in office, in which French interest rates were cut eight times independently of the Bundesbank, French monetary policy now seems to be awaiting German action. Only half a million of the 3.2m French now out of work had lost their jobs due to the cycle of recession, Mr Balladur said. More than three quarters of France's unemployment was due to the high cost and low qualification of French labour, and to waste in the public sector.</p>

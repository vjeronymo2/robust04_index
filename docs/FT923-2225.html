			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (13): It's management as much as money - In Wales, the Swansea Valley typifies the way spoilt land is being reclaimed FORTY YEARS ago, the Lower Swansea Valley was the scene of probably the worst industrial dereliction in Britain, the result of two and a half centuries' despoliation that began with copper smelting and ended with steel production. Today the area may not be as green as the nearby Brecon Beacons, but a seal gambols in the river Tawe that runs through the valley, a sports stadium attracts large numbers of young people, one hotel has arrived and another is coming, and some 500 companies in the enterprise zone have brought more than 7,000 jobs. The transformation of this run-down sector of Wales's second city is just one part of a larger scene, in which the problem of land reclamation in Wales will soon have been solved, and the problem of urban regeneration will be well on the way to being resolved. It is a transformation in which the Welsh Development Agency has become one of Europe's leading urban renewal agencies. 'When the agency was set up in 1976,' says Mr David Farns-worth, executive director in charge of development projects, '30,000 acres of derelict land needed attention. So far, 22,000 have been cleared. 'By 1996 we should have cleared all the derelict land in Wales. The old steelworks in Ebbw Vale is now the site for this year's National Garden Festival, and after the festival closes its doors in October an urban village will be part of the further development of the site. 'In Merthyr, we have the largest coal recovery and land reclamation project being undertaken in Europe. On Deeside, we helped clear the site when the steelworks closed, a project that led to several thousand jobs being created.' Land reclamation, however, is only one aspect of the agency's work. There is also the question of urban regeneration. For several years, Wales has had an urban programme, and it is possible to see the setting up of the English regeneration agency as having been stimulated by its success. However, there are differences. In England, City Challenge is about selectivity and targeting projects, whereas the Welsh programme - the Urban Joint Venture Agreement - involves the agency joining forces with local authorities, training and enterprise councils, the tourist board and others to produce a programme. 'Integration of urban policy with land reclamation and assistance to business is part of the whole plan,' Mr Farns-worth says. Urban projects are chosen not just on the basis of the quality of local proposals, but according to the potential for economic growth for the region as a whole. 'We endeavour to ensure that 'hands on' help from central sources to local projects is designed not only to make public funds more cost effective, but also to give Wales an extra dimension in the market-place of the 1990s.' Some 20 towns, including Caernarfon, Holyhead, Merthyr Tydfil, Maesteg and Tredegar, have had help or have schemes under consideration. 'There is a real partnership about these schemes,' Mr Farnsworth says, 'this is the key to our success.' The Welsh approach is that town regeneration is as much to do with management as with money. Lack of co-operation among the various bodies has acted in the past as a brake on achieving desirable ends. The Welsh Development Agency has seen a route through this lack of co-operation - a route that the English agency may yet want to copy.</p>

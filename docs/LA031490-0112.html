			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS SURVEY RATES AMERICA AS 'UNFAIR PLAYER'  </P> <P> The United States, perhaps the most vocal champion of free trade, does not have  that image in foreign countries.  </P> <P> A survey of 1,800 business leaders in 34 countries published Tuesday ranked the  United States third among the world's most "unfair players" in international  markets.  </P> <P> The survey was conducted by the International Institute for Management  Development, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based business school, and the World  Economic Forum, which runs an annual businessmen's meeting in Davos.  </P> <P> Japan was perceived by 52.19% of those polled as the most unfair player,  followed by South Korea at 8.86% and the United States at 8%.  </P> <P> The only European country to fall into the unfair player category was France at  4.86%, which ranked fifth. It received almost as many votes as Taiwan, with  6.57%.  </P> <P> Brazil, with a reputation for aggressive export policy, placed sixth with 4%,  the survey showed.  </P> <P> Japan, despite being identified as the No. 1 unfair player, was not universally  vilified by the survey.  </P> <P> In ranking the three countries which are the best at turning innovations into  competitive products, those polled lauded the record of Japan by an even  greater margin, winning 73.99% of the vote.  </P> <P> The United States also redeemed itself by placing second with 10.33% while West  Germany took third place with 2.66%.  </P> <P> South Korea and Thailand were seen as the brightest rising stars of  international business, polling 34.21% and 10.02% of the vote, respectively.  </P> <P> Spain, the only non-Asian country to make the top of the list, was rated as the  fifth brightest of the rising stars, with 6.28%.  </P> <P> According to the survey, the United States, Switzerland, West Germany, Britain,  Japan and France, in that order, were perceived as resting on their laurels,  complacent with past accomplishments.  </P> <P> "All are seen to be relaxing at a time when competitiveness is becoming more  intense," the survey said.  </P></p>

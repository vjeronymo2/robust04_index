			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Bullish on sterling STERLING money market dealers continued to be bullish yesterday about the prospects for a cut in UK base rates before the end of the year, writes James Blitz. For much of the last few months, there had been an assumption that the UK authorities might keep interest rate policy on hold for the rest of 1993. Unemployment has fallen for four consecutive months and inflation is at historic lows. However, retail sales and manufacturing output have both remained sluggish, raising speculation that the government may need to stimulate the economy further. Sterling's strong perform-ance on the foreign exchanges is the immediate reason for the change in the market's view. With the currency touching DM2.5685 to the D-Mark yesterday, the way is open for the UK government to ease monetary policy without affecting the pound too much. However, the consensus appears to be that the cut will come towards the end of the year rather than in September. An easing in monetary policy would accompany the tough fiscal consolidation expected in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first budget. The December short sterling contract closed 2 basis points firmer at 94.48 yesterday, pricing three-month money at the end of the year at 5 1/2 per cent. The September contract finished 2 basis points up on the day at 94.30. A dealer suggested yesterday that the cut, when it comes, may be in the order of 1 per cent rather than  1/2 per cent. 'I cannot see the rationale for going to 5 1/2 per cent base rates,' he said. 'If the cut is to have an impact, it must be bigger than that.' The prospect of more rate reductions was enough to encourage some dealers not to offer bills to the Bank of England. There were diffic-ulties removing a Pounds 1bn short-age, pushing the overnight lending rate up to 9 per cent. Three-month sterling cash ended unaltered at 5 7/8 per cent. There was slightly more optimism yesterday about the prospect for more German interest rate cuts after the Bundesbank president said that German inflation could fall further before the year-end. The September Euromark contract closed 4 basis points up at 93.20, suggesting that three-month money will be some 56 basis points below yesterday's cash level of 7.36 per cent.</p>

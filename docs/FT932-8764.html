			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / OECD sees two more years of Icelandic gloom THE outlook for Iceland's economy in 1993 and 1994 is 'distinctly unfavourable', the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said yesterday . It forecasts a 1.8 per cent fall in the country's output this year, mainly because of problems in the fishing industry, which accounts for 75 per cent of exports. Weaker prices and sharply reduced cod supplies 'have produced a financial and social crisis in the fisheries sector', it noted. The report said Iceland was also being hit by poor demand for its two other big export products, aluminium and ferrosilicon. A third factor was the impact of rising unemployment and a tight government macroeconomic strategy on domestic demand. The report makes gloomy reading coming after last year's 3.25 per cent fall in GDP and 5 per cent drop in domestic demand. The OECD expects unemployment, which last year reached nearly 5 per cent, to rise to 5.3 per cent this year and 6.1 per cent in 1994. But it believes the country's prospects will begin to brighten next year thanks to the impact of lower taxes, the depreciation of the Icelandic krona, wage moderation, and the benefits of membership in the European Economic Area. '1994 will probably be a transition year, possibly benefiting from a recovery in export markets and early gains from European integration,' it said, predicting GDP growth of 1 per cent. The organisation says Iceland should benefit further if it goes ahead with the planned construction of an aluminium smelter. Estimates show the project will add 1.75 percentage points to GDP growth over the first three years of construction.</p>

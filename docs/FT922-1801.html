			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Season sans spice: This year's sober social calendar The champagne corks will be popping as usual at social events throughout the summer, but already it is clear that much of the fizz has gone out of the Season. The social whirl of summer balls, Ascot, Wimbledon, Henley, Glyndebourne, Glorious Goodwood and Cowes, which has entertained the idle rich for generations, has been unable to escape the recession. The signs of new social austerity are plentiful. Pembroke College, Cambridge, cancelled its summer ball this year and only five colleges at Oxford University are staging events, compared with twice that number a year ago. Paid attendance was down at the Epsom Derby. Black-market ticket prices at this week's Ascot race meeting are sharply lower than last year's. And even Glyndebourne has been unable to sell returned tickets for its opera season. Companies have cut entertainment expenses heavily, threatening the viability of some of the peripheral events and resulting in a rash of bankruptcies among corporate hospitality agencies. 'Every event has suffered a downturn in commercial sponsorship which is perfectly understandable in the current climate,' says Mr Richard Goddard, secretary of the Henley Royal Regatta. He explains: 'It is invidious to be seen to be conspicuously entertaining if your company is not doing terribly well. My view is that this will be the worst year for a long time. It will be a little worse than last year which in turn was a lot worse than the year before.' In spite of this gloom, true aficionados have remained loyal and ensured the Season has remained on its feet. As Mr Peter Wallis, a consultant at the SRU marketing group, says: 'Many of these events were on financial steroids in the 1980s. It is quite amazing that they have not fallen further.' The premier social and sporting events are reporting continued support from long-standing devotees. They, as opposed to beneficiaries of corporate hospitality tents, are likely to seem more prominent this year. It seems, perhaps, appropriate that after 12 years without success, the Queen returned to the winners' enclosure at Ascot when her horse, Colour Sergeant, won the Royal Hunt Cup this week. At Wimbledon, where the first serve is tossed up on Monday, supporters have also remained loyal. The All England tennis club reports that its 46 official hospitality marquees, which cost Pounds 12,500 for three days and include daily tickets for 35 to 40 guests, have been fully booked, mostly by long-established backers of the championship. By contrast, unofficial party bookings organised by outside agents are expected to suffer. There is a similar tale at Henley, which the corporate hospitality agents whisper is more vulnerable to recession than most events because of the lesser appeal of rowing. Mr Goddard says: 'Support from the core of people who are traditional supporters of the regatta has not diminished.' The regatta still boasts 6,000 members of its Stewards' Enclosure and has a waiting list of 1,000. Only 32 new members were admitted from the list last year. Its official corporate hospitality income is set at a fixed level with an outside agent. Mr Goddard suggests it was the host of peripheral events that emerged 'up the back alleys of Henley nowhere near the river' that have suffered most. 'There was a great swell of popular interest in the regatta and people came along because it was a jolly. That has gone and quite right too,' he says. While people such as Mr Goddard may welcome the retreat of fringe activities which threatened to swamp the Season during the 1980s, it was the influx of new money which forced improvements in the organisation of many of its events and may have ensured their preservation. Mr Wallis of SRU argues that the increasing influence of businessmen helped ensure the Season's financial viability. 'The truth is that new money is often more demanding and discriminating than old money. People want the latest and the best,' he says. In the process of modernising the management of the events, the Season largely changed from being a marriage market for debutantes to a sophisticated marketing exercise. A decade ago the Debrett's guide to the Season had already picked up on the trend, acerbically commenting: 'Debrett would be the first to agree that the Season as it is today exists only with the support of the non-traditional members of Society - it is the successful businessmen and industrialists, not the aristocracy, who set the pace.' Debrett may take heart from the mood prevailing in the current season. As one society columnist remarked this week: 'Now we are returning to restrained values. By grandeur and stealth, and by the simple fact of still being there, old money has seen off the brassy opposition.' The new money associated with the Season may have evaporated; but clearly the old snobberies are more durable.</p>

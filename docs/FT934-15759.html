			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: ICS set for reform - Changes to investor protection plan THE INVESTORS' Compensation Scheme is the safety net underpinning the Financial Services Act. It promises to compensate them for losses resulting from regulatory breaches if no one else is available to pay. The ICS has been particularly important for those who discover they have been conned but that those responsible have gone out of business or disappeared with the cash. Since its inception in August 1988, it has paid out Pounds 36.2m to 4,477 investors. It is funded (up to Pounds 48m) by a levy on members of each self-regulatory organisation, with individual assessments usually based on the volume of business conducted by each member. But heavy claims stemming particularly from excesses by one sector of the industry - independent financial advisers  -and the inability of regulators to secure insurance up to the desired level of Pounds 100m, has forced a re-think of how the ICS is to be run. Earlier this week, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog which oversees the ICS, prepared a discussion document on the scheme's future. This recommends several significant changes and asks for public comment by November 19. SIB intends to put the revisions into effect by April. The most significant change is to end what is known as 'cross-contribution.' This means that if losses incurred by one group of members exceed their contributions, then members of other self-regulating organisations must contribute as well. In each of the past three years, Fimbra members - who include the IFAs responsible for the bulk of claims - have been bailed out by the life insurance industry, which has volunteered to help pay for Fimbra's portion. The life insurers rely on IFAs to help sell their products, and it could be argued that they have good reason to help out. In the 1991/92 year, though, members of other SROs also had to contribute towards the Fimbra shortfall. SIB's preferred solution is that each SRO should have its own compensation scheme, although it is possible that the schemes could be managed centrally as a single unit to cut costs. Each scheme should have a 'cap' of Pounds 100m in claims, a level which has never as yet been approached. Some firms, particularly banks and building societies which sell insurance and pension products, do not belong to any of the SROs but have chosen to be regulated directly by SIB. But it is trying to extricate itself from direct regulation, and says in its paper that any firm it regulates will have to pay the same contribution to the scheme as any other. That appears to be a subtle way of encouraging banks and societies to join a proposed new SRO for all retail financial services firms, to be known as the Personal Investment Authority. Some banks and societies have baulked, however, saying they do not wish to have to pay for the antics of some less-responsible Fimbra members. Meanwhile, SIB proposes that if the schemes are to be managed separately, it will link the contribution each SRO makes to management costs to the number of times claims are made by their members. Thus, SROs with members making the fewest claims will bear the lowest management costs.

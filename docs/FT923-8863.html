			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Cookery: Around the globe GLOBE artichokes are flourishing in the garden while those imported from Brittany are excellent value in the shops just now. Broad beans - the beans of antiquity - are also plentiful, making beans and artichokes a timely twosome this weekend. The idea of teaming the vegetables in one dish is nothing new. The flavours are complementary, and good old beans help to make a more substantial dish of a few aristocratic globes. The partnership is, unsurprisingly, lightest and best when both vegetables are young, fresh and green. It becomes less refined as the vegetables grow more mature, but even coarse, elderly beans are worth consideration. Of course, broad beans are no fun to eat in their skins once the skins have turned to leather jerkins and the seam down the side of them is as black as a dirty thumbnail. If, however, you slip them out of their jerkins after boiling, they will emerge fresh, bright green and tender. Thus rejuvenated, broad beans can be processed to a puree with salt, pepper, chopped chives, a squeeze of lemon, a few knobs of butter, a little creme fraiche, and enough of the cooking liquor to make a sauce. A flavoursome low-fat alternative to butter- and egg-rich sauces, this thin bean puree is lovely for dipping the leaves of globe artichokes into and for spooning over artichoke bottoms when all the leaves have been pulled from them. Another fine way to serve artichokes and broad beans together (providing the beans are young enough not to need the treatment described above) is how Edouard de Pomiane, dietician and teacher, enjoyed them in a small Athenian tavern. The place was famous for its artichokes. Describing his visit to the inn, Pomiane recalls: 'I arrived and sat down on a wooden bench. Immediately, the proprietress called for the woman who served as cook and waitress, too: 'Aphrodite, Aphrodite.' She appeared, but what a disappointment. Aphrodite was blind in one eye and had a limp. She was more than 60. Venus had aged . . . but the artichokes were incomparable.' POMIANE'S GLOBE ARTICHOKES A LA GREQUE Serves four for lunch in the garden with cheese and fresh fruit to follow. 4 globe artichokes the size of a man's fist or 8 small ones; 1 1/4 lb shelled broad beans (allow 3 1/2 -4 lb in the pod); 6-8 oz finely chopped onions; a small handful of chopped parsley and half as much chopped green coriander or chervil;  1/4 pt olive oil; 1 lemon for preparing the artichokes and 1 lemon to serve with the finished dish. First prepare the artichoke cups, a regrettably tedious and time-consuming task but essential to the recipe. Trim the artichoke stalks, remove the coarse outer leaves and cut an inch or so off the tops of the rest of the leaves. Pull out the inner cluster of immature leaves and use a teaspoon to scoop out the hairy choke that lies underneath. Rub all cut surfaces with a halved lemon as you expose them. As soon as prepared, put each artichoke cup into a large bowl of water to which the juice of half a lemon has been added. Season the onions with salt, pepper and the herbs and anoint with a generous drizzle of olive oil. Drain the artichokes and put a tablespoonful of the fragrant mixture into each cup. Sit the artichokes shoulder to shoulder in a large flameproof casserole or sturdy pan. Stir the beans into the remaining onion mixture and pack it into the gaps. Pour on water barely to cover the artichoke cups and add the rest of the olive oil. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook gently until the vegetables are perfectly tender - about 45 minutes if the artichokes are large and the beans are beyond the first flush of youth, as they tend to be if bought in August. Lift out the artichokes and continue cooking - without a lid - until almost every drop of water is driven off, leaving the beans in spluttering oil. Return the artichokes to the pot and leave until barely tepid or cold. Check seasoning before serving with lemon wedges and good bread.</p>

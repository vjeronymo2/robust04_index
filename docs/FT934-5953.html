			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (11): Farming jobs wither - The Cotswolds face economic problems The economy of the Cotswolds, one of the most picturesque parts of England, has been hit in recent years by two factors: changes in the structure and needs of agriculture, and a decline in defence industries. To meet the growing problems, a Countryside Employment Programme (CEP) was set up 18 months ago, as one of three pilot schemes to help vulnerable farming areas cope with change in the 1990s. An assessment has now been made, and a package of measures proposed. It is estimated that accelerating changes in agriculture and defence could account for at least 600 job losses in the Cotswolds over the next three years. In an area with a relatively low rural population spread thinly through dozens of villages and small towns, this will have a devastating impact on the local economy if alternative employment is not found. The assessment, conducted for the CEP by Shankland Cox and Gould Consultants, estimates that 30 per cent of farms are likely to reduce staffing in response to changes in the common agricultural policy and other factors. These redundancies will occur mainly on large farms which are marginal for cereal production. Over the last 10 years, the numbers employed on farms have fallen by an average of 5 per cent a year. This is likely to continue, in addition to the impact of the EC reforms and the Gatt negotiations. The fall-out from defence restructuring on the CEP area, which covers Cotswold district council, in Gloucestershire, and West Oxfordshire district council, will be felt through the rundown and closure of Ministry of Defence establishments and reduced defence spending. In Gloucestershire, the impact will come largely from a drop in orders to defence manufacturing companies in Cheltenham and Gloucester. The area has experienced a sharp rise in unemployment over the last two years, and long-term unemployment is a particular problem, with 40 per cent out of work for more than six months. A third of the unemployed are in their twenties. The aims of the CEP, a three-year programme led by the Rural Development Commission in partnership with local councils, training and enterprise councils and other bodies, is to stimulate job creation, training and community development. This means that substantial economic adjustment is inevitable, involving the diversification of businesses, encouraging new ones, backing innovation development and expansion, and promoting inward investment. Much of the initiative will come from the private sector, but public sector organisations will be expected to facilitate the process of adaptation and growth. Mr Len Smith, project manager of the Cotswold CEP, says that, because there is a steady drip effect of job losses (rather than the sudden impact of a colliery or steelworks closure), few people have appreciated the scale of the local problem. He sees the answer in a package of proposals now being developed, including diversification by farmers away from agriculture, the development of tourism, and encouragement for existing local businesses to expand. 'Emphasis is usually placed on business start-ups, but that can be an expensive high-risk strategy,' says Mr Smith. 'I prefer to back existing businesses that already have a track record. Job creation is quicker, and you get stability of employment.' A pilot scheme is being launched this month to subsidise employer-led training groups. It is available to all rural businesses and pays up to 50 per cent of training needs assessment. There is also a proposal to employ a business adviser, who would pick 30 local small businesses as potential winners and give them financial, management and consultancy help. The scheme should be launched in January. The greatest potential probably lies in the development of tourism, where the target is to create around 1,500 jobs over the next three years. The area is already a well known tourist attraction, and parts can get crowded in the summer; but research shows that most visitors pass through en route from London or Oxford to Stratford-upon-Avon, the Midlands and the north, and that very few stay. The intention is to encourage development of good quality accommodation, to ensure that more visitors stay in the area and spend more. Mr Smith believes there are good prospects for combined part-time jobs in tourism and agriculture. 'I find that farmers can cram more cars in per acre than an NCP attendant ever can.' The plan is to extend the network of walks, cycle tracks and bridle paths, and to concentrate on short breaks and activity holidays. Plans are also in hand for the provision of better bus services, to encourage mobility, more creches to enable women with young children to return to work, and the development of teleworking, so that more people can work from home or in their own village.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Yeltsin seeks to heal Katyn wounds PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday became the first Russian leader to lay a wreath at a monument to 20,000 Polish officers and civilians murdered in 1940 by the Soviet secret police. Relatives of the victims praised Mr Yeltsin for the gesture intended to heal wounds over the massacre at Katyn forest near Smolensk. Until 1990 Moscow blamed their deaths on the Germans. Polish officers and civilians, interned in 1939 in the Soviet Union, were murdered on Stalin's orders. The site of the monument in a wooded Warsaw cemetery was long regarded by Poles as the symbolic grave of the men murdered at Katyn and elsewhere. However, the relatives urged Russia to release all documents about the crime and to build a cemetery for the victims. Earlier Mr Yeltsin told Mr Lech Walesa, the Polish president, that the Russians would bring forward the withdrawal of 1,000 troops stationed in Poland by three months to the end of October. The two leaders also signed a trade agreement regulating customs procedures and comitting both countries to Gatt rules. Last year Poland had a Dollars 640m trade deficit with Russia. The first half of this year saw Poland's deficit narrow to Dollars 94m. The talks have, however, left unresolved the question of debts expressed both in the now defunct 'convertible' rouble and US dollars.</p>

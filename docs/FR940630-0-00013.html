			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of this information, paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to include paragraph (b)(1), which contains the requirement for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature that was specified in the proposed rule, and paragraph (b)(2), which provides for installation of a revised thrust reverser sync-lock as an acceptable alternative to paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. Accomplishment of the revised installation specified in paragraph (b)(2) requires no additional work hours beyond the 514 work hours specified in the economic impact information, below, for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, it should be noted that Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 as an additional source of service information for airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211&hyph;535C engines. Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725 as an additional source of service information. However, the appropriate revision levels for these service bulletins are not specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035 or in any of the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 2'' to paragraph (b) of the final rule to specify that the appropriate revision levels for Rolls-Royce Service Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822, are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated October 1, 1993; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated January 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 40 Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. Currently, there are no Model 757 series airplanes of the affected design on the U.S. Register. However, should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required auto restow and integrity tests, 514 work hours per airplane to accomplish either modification specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this AD, and 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required operational checks; at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts are currently planned to be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD is estimated to be $28,380 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

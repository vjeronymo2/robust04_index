			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: SA group sells 80% of catering arm Tongaat-Hulett, the South African food and industrial group, has sold an 80 per cent stake in Supervision Food Services, its catering arm, to a consortium of black investors for R53m (Dollars 13m). Mr Cedric Savage, Tongaat-Hulett chairman, said yesterday the company had for some time felt that SFS did not fit into its focus on branded products. 'The move is a major step in the group's black economic empowerment programme, which is to facilitate participation of black entrepreneurs and managers in businesses complementary to our core activities,' he said. The new investors include the Kagiso Trust Investment Company, the business arm of the Kagiso Trust, a non-profit body that helps finance urban and rural development schemes; Khulani Holdings, a private black company; FirstCorp Capital Investors, the investment arm of merchant bankers FirstCorp; and Supervision's senior management, each of which have taken 20 per cent in the company.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> GULF COMBAT PAY MAY END  </P> <P> The general in charge of the U.S. Central Command has recommended the  suspension of combat pay for sailors in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources say.  The request by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, under review by the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, is the strongest indication yet that U.S. defense officials believe the  truce in the Iran-Iraq War will hold. The bonuses are worth $110 a month and  have been paid to military personnel working in the Persian Gulf since August,  1987. The United States now has 14 ships in the gulf, including six  minesweepers, and Navy officials estimate that 4,000 sailors are receiving the  payments.  </P></p>

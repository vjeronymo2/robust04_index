			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons It is hard to take the bid speculation around Fisons seriously, not least because there is no clear reason why anyone should want to buy the company. Contested takeovers are rare in pharmaceuticals. Hanson's dry run at ICI might be considered an exception, but that was predicated on the idea that Zeneca would be sold off. Even if an adrenalin-charged predator overcame the current aversion to hostile bids, he would find it difficult to unlock extra value. The scientific instruments operations and remaining drug interests would not be worth much more than the current market capitalisation. Suggestions that Fisons is a recovery stock should also be treated with caution. The scientific instruments business will be dogged by slow growth in the US and no growth elsewhere in Europe. Drug prospects are dependent on the launch of the Tilade asthma treatment in the US. The company has a niche in respiratory drugs, but its existing products are starting to run out of puff and there is little coming along to give a second wind. A yield 50 per cent above the market average is a better support, especially since the dividend looks secure. The unkind might suggest that is because Fisons has nothing better to spend its money on. The company, meanwhile, is presumably trying to licence compounds which will give it a shot in the arm.</p>

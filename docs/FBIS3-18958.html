			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adolfo Garrido: "People's Party Attributes New </F> Nationalist Demands to Government Weakness"]    [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party believes that the  government's concessions to the nationalist forces made to  ensure continued power have reopened the autonomy issue. This  became clear during the meeting of the party's standing  committee, comprised of members of its Executive Committee and  regional leaders. It was also decided during the meeting to set  up a committee to study the process of implementing autonomy.    The People's Party also advocates discontinuing the  negotiations on the so-called "democratic impetus" in all the  institutions, according to what national party Chairman Jose  Maria Aznar told the committee members.    Although the state of the negotiations on each of the  institutions was not addressed at that meeting, People's Party  Secretary General Francisco Alvarez Cascos will set out today  the results of the negotiations with the Socialist Party,  Information Office Director Miguel Angel Rodriguez announced.    Nevertheless, the standing committee devoted much of the  time  to studying in depth the document on the definition of the model  of the state of the autonomous communities. The People's Party  members believe that the government's weakness has caused a  flood of new autonomy demands.  <H5>  Government's Weakness </H5>   "The Socialists have opened the window for concessions, and  now they do not know how to shut it," Rodriguez stated.  According to the People's Party, the government's weakness has  caused the transfer of powers to certain autonomous communities  with the sole aim of ensuring parliamentary support.    The party led by Aznar also deems "problematic" some  aspirations attributed to the Generalitat [autonomous  government] of Catalonia which "could exceed what is envisaged  by the Constitution," and which took shape in an unofficial  document which became known several weeks ago.    The aim of the People's Party proposal is to determine  clearly the kind of state and powers which each administrations  should have.    The chief opposition force's intention is to debate with  other political and social forces the document presented by  Aznar in Barcelona last month, although no contact has been made  for the present.    The People's Party will give priority to the problems of  funding the autonomous communities, the communities'  participation in European bodies, and the single administration  principle in the committee on autonomous communities. The  committee will soon be set up and will be chaired by party  Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy.    The People's Party believes that the "cafe for everybody"  formula should not be applied, and will insist on a debate on  how the autonomous communities are to be funded and how the  single administration principle proposed by Manuel Fraga is to  be carried out.    In addition, at the standing committee meeting Aznar  referred  to the European building process, and supported the European  Union's enlargement, but not at the cost of harming Spain's  interests. The possible harm to Spanish fishing should be taken  into account in the negotiations on the entry of Austria,  Sweden, Finland, and Norway.</p>

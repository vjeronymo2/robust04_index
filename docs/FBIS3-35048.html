Dr.  Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to President Yasir 'Arafat, and  General Amnon Shahaq, Israel's deputy chief of staff, led the  talks that are trying to find a formula for the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    MENA learned that the Security Committee was divided into  two  subcommittees. The first subcommittee is examining some details  on the size of the Palestinian police force, the number of  vehicles it will be using, and the nature of its tasks in Gaza  and Jericho.    The other subcommittee is discussing the issue of  Palestinian  detainees in Israeli jails. Muhammad Dahlan, Palestinian  security official in Gaza, and David Agmon, deputy security  chief of the West Bank, head this subcommittee.    Dr. Sha'th last night met a delegation of the International  Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] operating in Israel and the  occupied territories and reviewed with them a list of the  Palestinian detainees.    An ICRC official said that he handed Dr. Sha'th a list of  the  Palestinian detainees and discussed with him humanitarian issues  concerning the detainees. The official declined to divulge the  number of Palestinian detainees.    Meanwhile, the Civilian Affairs Committee met for one hour  today to continue discussing issues pertaining to electricity,  historical sites, civil registration, and other unresolved  issues.    Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi said after the meeting that the  committee reviewed what has already been agreed upon, namely the  transfer of the electricity authority, civil registration,  postal services, and public works to the Palestinians. He  explained that issuing a postage stamp for local and  international use will be left for the two leaderships in Tunis  and Jerusalem to agree on.    Al-Tarifi added that progress has been made and the talks  were conducted in a very positive atmosphere. He said  communications, land registry, water resources, and historical  sites will be discussed at the next round of talks, for which  preparations were made during today's meeting.    The Security Committee is expected to end its meeting this  afternoon. It will reconvene in Taba next Monday.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / International Company News: ANL slides into red and omits dividend ANL, the Australian government-owned shipping line, slumped into the red in 1991-1992, turning a ADollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.3m) profit into an ADollars 8.9m loss. The company, which is restructuring ahead of probable privatisation, is omitting its dividend after sales fell to ADollars 592m from ADollars 619m. Mr Bill Bolitho, chairman, said the company's lacklustre trading profits were exacerbated by the recession, undercapitalisation, high interest charges and substantial costs incurred in preparing for privatisation.</p>

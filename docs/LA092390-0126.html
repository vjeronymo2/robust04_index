			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'REGRESSIVE POLITICS IN A PROGRESSIVE CITY' -- IRVINE'S JUST RESPONDING TO ITS  CITIZENS  </P> <P> I believe that all sides have a right to be heard. The Times (editorial,  "Regressive Politics in a Progressive City," Sept. 16) apparently believes only  certain sides have those rights.  </P> <P> You say our City Council wasted four hours debating Christmas tress and a  proposal for an invocation. You ask, "When does the healing begin?" Do you mean  to ask, "When will we silence those who hold opinions different from yours?"  </P> <P> No member of the current council placed those items on the agenda. This council  simply responded to Irvine residents requesting their legal opportunity to  propose something to their City Council. In the past, residents of Irvine  wanted to discuss the issues of a Christmas tree and an invocation, but were  silenced by Mayor Larry Agran. We listened to four hours of testimony from both  sides, including confronting, angry and insulting tirades from those claiming  to be "sensitive."  </P> <P> How should our council act in order to comply with the ideals The Times might  find acceptable? Should we listen only to one side of an issue? Should we  refuse to place certain items on our agenda? How should we select those sides  and items? Should we form an Issues Selection Committee of those  "extra-sensitive people" who speak only in the most melodramatic, excessive and  hostile expletives? Would that begin the healing?  </P> <P> The Times deplores the fact that Mary Ann Gaido is not seated, in spite of  petitions to hold an election. The Times laments that we appealed Judge Eileen  Moore's decision. Does The Times prefer to ignore more than 4,000 people who  signed a petition asking for an election. Do you prefer appointed, instead of  elected, officials?  </P> <P> As you know, I had no objection to seating Ms. Gaido. I also have no objection  to completing the process of making certain that if the people prefer to elect,  that they may have an election.  </P> <P> When I talk about healing, I mean that every point of view in this community  will have access to local government. I mean that every opinion will have an  equal opportunity to be heard. The limitation on time for speakers is not  intended to limit speech. It is intended to provide an equal opportunity for  everyone to speak.  </P> <P> In this country, opinions do not become unacceptable because a few people  decide they are unacceptable. Someone who simply claims to be more sensitive is  not given special rights or opportunities. The intolerance of the  self-proclaimed, progressive elite is alarming. Fascism is always frightening.  </P> <P> Please don't overestimate the motives of those who screech loudest about  freedom of speech and religion in Irvine. When we think about healing, we  should also consider that there are those who will refuse the healing process  because they have their own political ambitions.  </P> <P> I hope you will consider that those who spoke most passionately against the  Christmas tree were also the leadership core of Larry Agran's political  campaign. They just lost a close election and want to set the stage to win the  next. They have a politically motivated agenda, and they have a right to it.  They do not have the right to possess the only legitimate opinions in our  community.  </P> <P> SALLY ANNE SHERIDAN  </P> <P> Mayor of Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Food: All white on the night - Cookery SUMMER brings its own problems for the cook. The sun shines and menus cruise merrily on a greedy wave of simple foods sauced with such classics as mayonnaise, hollandaise and avgolemono, before you wake up to the fact that the fridge is filling up with leftover egg whites. Why is it, I wonder, that the discovery of them acts as an instant memory wipe? The mind goes as blank as a computer screen when the electricity is cut. All recollection of recipes that use more egg whites than yolks is deleted, and the cook is left grappling feebly with the temptation to chuck all that slippery albumen down the sink. For such occasions here is an aide memoire to pin on to the kitchen noticeboard, a reminder of a few good ways to employ a leftover egg white - or two, or three - and a recipe that makes such enthusiastic use of egg whites that it will probably not only swallow up your entire nest egg of accumulated whites but make you crack into fresh eggs as well - and so enable you to revert to the mayonnaise, hollandaise and avgolemono cycle . . . Egg whites will keep in the fridge for three days providing the eggs are very fresh, providing your fridge is as cold as it should be (0` to 5`C), and providing small airtight containers are used. If a lot of air is trapped in the container along with the egg white, staling will be rapid. Egg whites can also be frozen for up to six months. If you cannot remember how many egg whites you put into a container, measure the contents: two tablespoons equal one egg white. Egg whites are essential to coeur a la creme, apple (or apricot or damson) snow, pavlovas and meringues of all kinds. They give sorbets good texture, can be used to frost grapes and other fruits prettily, and will clarify consommes and fruit jellies. Whisked egg whites added to batters make the lightest of pancakes and fritters. Whipped egg whites used instead of cream make fresher tasting sweet and savoury mousses, and the more egg whites a souffle contains, the higher it towers. ANGELCAKE This looks very pretty lightly dusted with icing sugar and garlanded with sweet geranium leaves. Serve with it a bowl piled high with fresh berries and a sauce jug of sieved and lightly sweetened berry puree - say a mixture of blackberries and blueberries, or mulberries when they come into season. A featherlight angelcake depends on handling the ingredients very lightly and quickly. 1 oz cornflour; 3 oz plain flour; a good pinch of salt; 10 egg whites; 1/2 lb vanilla or caster sugar; the finely grated zest of 3 oranges; 1 tablespoon lemon juice; 1 tablespoon hot water; 1 teaspoon cream of tartar. You will need an angelcake pan* or similar mould about 8 1/2 in diameter across the base, 10 in across the top and 4 in deep with a central funnel and removeable base. Be sure it is absolutely greaseless. Sift both flours into a bowl. Add the salt and about one-third of the sugar and sift the combined ingredients at least twice more, lifting the sieve high above the bowl to aerate the mixture as much as possible. Divide the egg whites, lemon juice and water between your two largest mixing bowls. Whisk the contents of one until foamy, add half the cream of tartar and whisk again until the egg whites stand in stiff peaks. Use a balloon or rotary whisk, not an electric one, for maximum volume. Whisk the contents of the second bowl in the same way, then tip the contents of the first bowl into the second. Sift and whisk in the remaining sugar, a spoonful at a time, adding the citrus zest at the end. Then sift and fold in the flour mixture delicately yet thoroughly, a little at a time. Turn the mixture into the mould. Draw a knife through the mixture to release any large air pockets, and level the surface. Bake at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 for 45 minutes or until the surface of the cake feels firm and springs back when lightly pressed. Invert the tin on to a cooling rack and leave for 1 1/2 hours or until the cake is completely cold before lifting off the mould. *Angelcake pans are usually available from Copperstones, 42a High Street, Marlborough, Wilts SN8 1HQ (tel: 0672-515074, fax: 0672-512960).

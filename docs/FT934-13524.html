			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Observer: Cosy compound Who said there's no such thing as a true corporate merger, only takeovers in disguise? Two years after New York banks Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover agreed a union of equals (even if the Manny Hanny name went), this week's senior management reshuffle continues to reflect an unusual degree of cosiness. Walter Shipley, who headed Chemical before the merger, steps up from president to become chairman and chief executive at the end of the year on the retirement of John McGillicuddy (previous boss of Manufacturers Hanover). Preserving the symmetry, the new president is former Manny Hanny retail banking head, 52-year-old Edward Miller. Miller was chosen over William Harrison, 50, a former Chemical man and now head of corporate and institutional banking. But do not assume Miller automatically becomes top dog one day. Shipley, who deems himself a 'young 57', warns that it is too early to talk of succession. Also, Harrison's position in the triumvirate is deftly cemented by his inclusion in the inner-most cabinet, known as the Office of the Chairman.</p>

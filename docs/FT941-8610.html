			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Thirst quencher with a European appetite - Cott Corporation is bringing its private-label colas across the Atlantic European shoppers will soon be able to slake their thirst with new private-label colas from the supermarkets, courtesy of Cott Corporation, a Canadian group which has taken the North American market by storm. Its soft-drink brands are likely to be cheaper than Coca-Cola or Pepsi and offer retailers a more generous profit margin. The products mark the European debut of Cott, a Toronto-based company whose private-label drinks have been enthusiastically received in Australia and South Africa as well as North America. Cott has gained a toe-hold in Europe through two recent deals. Cadbury-Schweppes, hitherto a sworn enemy of private labels, surprised the industry by making capacity available to Cott at under-utilised bottling plants on the Continent. In the UK, Cott has bought control of the canning operations of Benjamin Shaw &amp; Sons, the soft-drinks subsidiary of Rutland Trust. Mr Simon Lester, a former Schweppes consultant who now heads Cott's European operations, hopes Cott products will win a 5 per cent to 10 per cent share of the UK market within two years. Talks with one supermarket chain, rumoured to be J. Sainsbury, are at an 'advanced stage'. 'Once we get to the market,' he says, 'they will make more money on their private labels and they'll make more money from the national brands.' He predicts that Coke, Pepsi and other brand-name bottlers will be forced to offer wider margins to retailers if they want to keep their shelf space. To its fans, Cott is clear proof the new generation of retailer-controlled grocery brands has the established brand names on the run. The company's sales have rocketed from CDollars 43m (USDollars 32m) in the fiscal year to January 27 1990 to around CDollars 700m in the past 12 months. Cott's market value is CDollars 2.3bn, and its shares are trading at more than 80 times projected 1994 earnings. A CDollars 1,000 investment in Cott shares just three years ago would now be worth a tidy CDollars 119,000, including a 12-fold stock split. 'Among beverages, cola was most sheltered from imitators because they never solved the problem of taste,' says Mr George Rosenbaum, president of Leo Shapiro &amp; Associates, a Chicago-based market research company. 'Cott has succeeded in doing this much better than anyone else.' Buoyed by its success in the soft drinks market, Cott has expanded into private-label beer and snack foods. Mr Howard Penney, analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, forecasts Cott's earnings will jump from 47 cents per share in fiscal 1994 to 92 cents next year. 'There's still significant growth in the US and tremendous potential internationally,' he says. But there are also sceptics. Ms Jennifer Solomon, analyst at Mabon Securities in New York, last month advised her clients to take profits. Coke and Pepsi are fighting back, especially in Cott's key Ontario market, by boosting retailers' margins and offering other incentives. Ms Solomon says Cott has nudged analysts several times in recent months to lower their earnings estimates. Cott's critics are also unsettled by aspects of the company's background. Its chairman, Mr Gerry Pencer, is an entrepreneur whose last venture - a Canadian trust and loan company - ended in a messy failure. Some analysts question Cott's aggressive accounting practices, and, according to reports to the Ontario Securities Commission, senior Cott executives have been heavy sellers of the company's shares in recent months. Cott's products, most of which appear under names chosen by its retailer customers, are now sold in more than half of North America's top 100 supermarket chains, including Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer. But Cott is more a marketer than a manufacturer. Although it owns a handful of factories in North America, most of its output is contracted out to about 50 independent bottlers with spare capacity. Cott's skill lies in working with retailers to produce a low-cost, high-quality product tailored to their specific markets. For example, the Cott cola sold through Wal-Mart carries the name Sam's American Choice Cola; the label used for the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores is Classic Selection. A design subsidiary produces names and packaging for Cott beverages, as well as for a variety of other retailer-controlled brands. Ms Heather Reisman, Cott's president, says ebulliently the biggest risk is that Cott will over-stretch by chasing too many of the opportunities now available to it. 'A lot of people have seen what we're doing and want to be involved in it,' she says. But other threats cannot be overlooked. Ms Solomon notes that companies such as Coke and Pepsi have dramatically narrowed the gap between brand-name and private-label retail margins. She says store owners now have less incentive than before to promote private-label products at the expense of national brands. Ms Reisman disagrees. 'I don't believe that (the brand-name companies) can sustain some of the more aggressive activity on a long-term basis with the cost structures that they have,' she says.</p>

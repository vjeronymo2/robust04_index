The edict says:    In order to improve a grave situation in the supply of  petroleum products to Georgia, to ensure fuel supplies to areas  of strategic importance, and to ease budget payments, a tax on  petroleum products imported to the Republic of Georgia by legal  and physical persons--except the state company  Saknavtobprodukti--will be paid temporarily in 1994 in kind and  will be fixed at 10 percent of the total amount of the imported  products, replacing a customs duty, an excise, a value-added  tax, an environmental tax, and a profit tax.    The products will be sold by the state company  Saknavtobprodukti, taking into consideration branch and regional  priorities determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of the  Republic of Georgia.    Railway, maritime transport, and customs departments of the  Republic of Georgia will ensure the delivery of the imported  petroleum products to their destination only in accordance with  papers issued by the aforementioned company.    The republic's Ministry of the Internal Affairs will render  assistance to the concern in receiving, moving, and guarding the  petroleum products.    The edict will take effect on 15 March of the current year.  The complete text of the edict will be published in the press.</p>

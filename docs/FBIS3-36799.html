He said that President Yeltsin, elected the CIS's first  chairman during the Ashgabat summit, was going to use his status  to the best advantage. "There is no talk about Russia's special  role," he said. "However, in view of its colossal intellectual  and organizational potential Russia can give the necessary  impetus to the CIS's development," he added.    Russia continues drafting documents on several aspects of  interaction between the CIS countries. In the first place, the  declaration on economic union must be implemented, and this  document must be supplemented with agreements on free trade,  customs union, and the payment of the debts.    Every effort must be made to ensure the transparency of the  CIS borders and to protect the CIS's external borders jointly.    He said a concept of the CIS's collective security must be  drafted, based on the principles of voluntariness and equality.  The state possessing the largest resources might provide a  basis for military cooperation, he said.    In the humanitarian sphere, a covenant of human rights might  be created to ensure the observance of political, social and  property rights throughout the CIS, said Ryurikov.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 14, 1994, APHIS received a petition (APHIS Petition No. 94&hyph;257&hyph;01p) from the Monsanto Company (Monsanto) of St. Louis, MO, requesting a determination of nonregulated status under 7 CFR part 340 for seven Russet Burbank potato lines (BT6, BT10, BT12, BT16, BT17, BT18, and BT23) genetically engineered with the plasmid vector PV&hyph;STBT02, which confers resistance to the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leptinotarsa decemlineata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The Monsanto petition states that the subject potato lines should not be regulated by APHIS because they do not present a plant pest risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As described in the petition, the subject potato lines were genetically engineered to produce an insect control protein derived from the common soil bacterium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bacillus thuringiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  subsp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> tenebrionis (Btt). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This insect control protein is identical in amino acid sequence to one of the proteins (band 3 protein encoded by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cryIIIA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene) naturally produced by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Btt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and found in commercial microbial  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Btt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  formulations registered as pesticides with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). According to Monsanto, the protein is highly selective in controlling CPB and is expressed at a consistently effective level in the potato foliage throughout the growing season. The expression of this insect control protein in the subject lines is regulated by an enhanced 35S promoter derived from the plant pathogen Cauliflower mosaic virus, and by the nontranslated region of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase referred to as E9 3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; derived from pea. The subject potato lines also express an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> nptII  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> gene derived from the prokaryotic transposon Tn5 encoding the enzyme neomycin phosphotransferase II. The expression of this gene in the subject potato lines is regulated by the 35S promoter (as described above) and the nontranslated 3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; region of the nopaline synthase gene derived from the plant pathogen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agrobacterium. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The expression of neomycin phosphotransferase II in the subject potato lines allows for selective growth of transgenic plant cells on the antibiotic kanamycin during plant tissue culture. These genes were stably transferred into the genome of potato plants through an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agrobacterium tumefaciens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -mediated transformation utilizing a binary, double-border plant expression vector, PV&hyph;STBT02.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Monsanto's subject CPB-resistant potato lines are currently considered regulated articles under the regulations in 7 CFR part 340 because they contain gene sequences (vectors, promoters, and terminators) derived from plant pathogenic sources. The subject potato lines were evaluated at a total of 34 locations under nine APHIS permits issued between 1991 and 1993. In the process of reviewing Monsanto's permit applications for field trials of the subject potato lines, APHIS determined that the vectors and other elements were disarmed and that the trials, which were conducted under conditions of reproductive and physical containment or isolation, would not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In the Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), ``plant pest'' is defined as ``any living stage of: Any insects, mites, nematodes, slugs, snails, protozoa, or other invertebrate animals, bacteria, fungi, other parasitic plants or reproductive parts thereof, viruses, or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing, or any infectious substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured or other products of plants.'' APHIS views this definition very broadly. The definition covers direct or indirect injury, disease or damage not just to agricultural crops, but also to plants in general, for example, native species, as well as to organisms that may be beneficial to plants, for example, honeybees, rhizobia, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  These genetically engineered potato lines are also currently subject to regulation by other agencies. The EPA is responsible for the regulation of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (7 U.S.C. 136  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). FIFRA requires that all pesticides, including insecticides, be registered prior to distribution or sale, unless exempt by EPA regulation. Accordingly, Monsanto has submitted to EPA an application to register this plant-pesticide, i.e. the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Btt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CPB control protein as produced by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cryIIIA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and its controlling sequences in these genetically engineered potato lines. On December 8, 1993, EPA announced receipt of this application (EPA File Symbol 524&hyph;UTU) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 64582&hyph;64583). This is the first application for registration of a transgenic plant pesticide under section 3(c) of FIFRA, as amended, in which a plant has been genetically altered to produce a pesticide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

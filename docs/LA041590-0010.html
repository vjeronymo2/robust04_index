			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: VELOCITY BY KRISTINE MCCLOY (WASHINGTON SQUARE: $7.95)  </P> <P> A promising first novel about learning to accept love and loss. Kristine McCloy  writes well when she describes women confronting their emotions.  </P> <P> Ellie must come to grips with the death of her mother: The memories and the  loss of her reassuring presence have become an almost intolerable burden. She  turns for support to Sandra, a local waitress and self-described casuality in  the war between the sexes. But Ellie, who's lived in New York's grubby East  Village, also is the daughter of a small-town Southern sheriff. Her naive  pursuit of a dope-dealing biker seems more than a little improbable. Nor is  Jesse, the lean, mean monosyllabic dream stud, much of a character. He's  supposed to be a freewheeling outlaw, working at the fringes of the Hell's  Angels, but these bikers are decidedly tame -- the Blue Meanies in "Yellow  Submarine" were more threatening. McCloy is reportedly at work on a second  novel, and it will be interesting to watch her talent develop.  </P></p>

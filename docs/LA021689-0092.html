			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL THAT MAY HAVE PERFUMED KINGS IS FOUND  </P> <P> Near the site where the Dead Sea scrolls were found, archeologists have dug up  a 2,000-year-old clay flask filled with an oil that might have been used to  anoint the ancient Israelite kings.  </P> <P> Joseph Patrich of Hebrew University unveiled the flask Wednesday and said the  honey-like oil may be the only surviving sample of a balsam oil used as an  aromatic body cream or perfume and famous throughout the Roman Empire.  </P> <P> The oil matches a description of an expensive perfume mentioned by the Roman  historian Pliny. Known as persimmon oil, it was distilled from a bush-like  plant now believed to be extinct.  </P> <P> The 5-inch-tall flask contains about 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 ounces of the  well-preserved reddish oil, which dates to the 1st Century BC. It was wrapped  in palm leaves and carefully concealed.  </P> <P> The persimmon plant, which was different from the modern tree of the same name,  grew only in the Dead Sea oasis of En Gedi and around Jericho. The ancient  Israelites guarded the secret formula for making the oil and tried to destroy  the orchards when Roman legions approached. Pliny's writings indicate the  Romans took over production, archeologists say.  </P> <P> The flask, buried in a 3-foot-deep pit in the caves at Qumran, 50 miles  southeast of Jerusalem, was found last year by an archeology team that includes  an American group of volunteers from the Institute of Judaic-Christian Research  in Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> Hebrew University chemist Zeev Aizenshtat said whatever fragrance the oil once  had had evaporated in the desert cave, where summer temperatures hover over 104  degrees.  </P></p>

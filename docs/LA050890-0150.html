			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY CHANGES STAND, OKS CAR SWAP MEET  </P> <P> Six months after the City Council closed an automobile swap meet at Fullerton  College, the council has reversed its decision, despite opposition from  Fullerton car dealers.  </P> <P> Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin changed his vote; he no longer thinks that the car  sales will compete unfairly with established used-car dealers in the city or  that using a public college for a non-educational purpose is inappropriate.  </P> <P> In November, Catlin had sided with the 3-2 council majority to stop  Irvine-based CarFaire Inc. from organizing private-party auto sales on the  college's parking lot. Last week, the council voted 3 to 2 to let CarFaire  reopen.  </P> <P> CarFaire opened at the college in October, charging car owners $15 a day or $25  a weekend to display their cars for sale. The company leased the parking lot  space for $500 a weekend, advertised the sales and assisted buyers and sellers  with ownership transfer forms and other information.  </P> <P> The operation competed unfairly with established automobile dealers who must  pay overhead and comply with the regulations of several government agencies,  said James Miller, general manager of McCoy &amp; Mills Ford in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The council voted to close CarFaire last year after a city code-enforcement  officer determined that the business required council approval and a business  license, which CarFaire had not purchased.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

"At present, when political extremism is rearing its head  with increasing brazenness all over the world, it is  particularly important that we should remember the victims and  not forget the guilty. We are bowing are heads before the  tragedy of the people against which Fascism perpetrated one of  the most hideous crimes.    "On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the great victory, we  are paying tribute to the exploits of the liberating army that  saved European Jews from total extermination.    "We are bowing low to thousands of our compatriots who were  risking their own lives by sheltering Jews, their neighbors.    "I wish the participants in the congress success in their  work."</p>

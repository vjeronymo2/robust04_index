			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Observer: Global view Jean-Loup Chretien? - ah yes, he's Canada's new prime minister, isn't he? Wrong. That's Jean Chretien. His near namesake was the first west European astronaut. Jean-Loup, a French Air Force general, became a by-word for savoir faire in his two cosmic jaunts aboard Soviet rockets in 1982 and 1988. He astounded his Russian hosts by taking along meals of jellied salmon, quail meat and crystallised fruit, and on his second trip not only did he enter the record books by surviving for several hours on a space walk outside the Mir space station, he also managed to fight off a tax demand from the French government by saying he was away in orbit. The new Canadian PM may feel he is walking on air, but his officials are unlikely to be palmed off with such dizzy excuses.</p>

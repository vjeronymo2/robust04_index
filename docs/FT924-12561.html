			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Liffe holds talks with CBOT over futures trade link THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) are discussing a link which would allow some bond and debt futures to be traded interchangeably in London and Chicago. This would be only the second link of its kind, after the agreement between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, on their Eurodollar contracts. In a letter to members, Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the exchange was discussing with the CBOT 'the possible establishment of a mutual offset arrangement for certain products'. The products involved are the CBOT's 10-year US Treasury note futures and options, and Liffe's German bund and Italian BTP futures and options. 'This approach is consistent with your board's long-held view that the trading of identical products in different time zones is best achieved by exchange linkages,' he added. The CBOT also wrote to its members last week to inform them that its board of directors had unanimously approved the proposal to set up a mutual offset arrangement with Liffe. 'Such an arrangement could form the centrepiece of a major floor-traded, foreign debt complex at this exchange,' it said. Co-operation between the exchanges would allow trades made on one exchange to be closed, or matched, on the partner exchange, increasing traders' flexibility. The CBOT's jealously-guarded long-bond contract has not been included in the discussions, it said. Liffe is also in negotiations with Globex, the electronic after-hours trading system developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Reuters and the CBOT. If the bilateral Liffe/CBOT agreement goes ahead, Liffe's potential membership of Globex could take a different shape, with London's debt contracts traded on the CBOT floor during the US day and evening, and then on Globex screens for a gap of a few hours between the Chicago evening close and Liffe's morning opening. The CBOT outlined its position on the plan in a letter to Mr Durlacher. Staff from the two exchanges are expected to discuss the arrangement this week in Chicago. Mr Durlacher's letter to Liffe members pointed out that discussions regarding both Globex and the linkage with the CBOT were 'at an early stage'. Among conditions for joining Globex is that Liffe products should trade on the system outside the European trading day of 7am to 7pm London time. During that period, Liffe products would continue to operate through floor-trading and after-hours screen trading on the exchange's APT system. At last Thursday's Liffe board meeting, a Pounds 1.25m investment in Liffe's APT after-hours trading system was authorised, to ensure that the system would be able to cope as volume increased. Other stumbling blocks to an agreement with Globex include the length of the contract: Liffe wants a short initial commitment to the system. The CBOT has also held talks with Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), which trades a rival German bund contract. However, an arrangement with Liffe would forestall any agreement with the DTB. No decision has yet been made, and, according to a CBOT official: 'All doors are open.' The DTB said: 'Nothing is decided but discussions with the CBOT are slowing.' It is also pursuing other channels, the official added. Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE), says he plans to conclude negotiations this week with Globex which may see the SFE joining the global after-hours electronic futures and options trading system by Christmas, Reuter reports from Sydney.</p>

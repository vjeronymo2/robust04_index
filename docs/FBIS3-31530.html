			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lajos Fur, the new chairman of the MDF [Hungarian  Democratic Forum], has pledged to continue the policy of Joszef  Antall. In the Sunday Newspaper radio program, he stressed that  there must be reconciliation between the churches and various  strata of society.    Evaluating the government party's economic policy, Fur said  that it has been possible to squeeze back inflation. He  mentioned by way of example that in January price increases were  barely above 3 percent, although they had themselves been  reckoning with inflation of around 6 percent. Economic growth  had already begun last year, he said, mentioning the building  industry as an example.    Lajos Fur spoke about the situation that has evolved along  our southern borders. The Hungarian Government's position is  unequivocal: It does not wish to get mixed up in the conflict  and it also declared that when it stated that in the event of  conflict, NATO planes would not be allowed into Hungary's  airspace. The MDF chairman is of the view that there will  probably not be any need for NATO air strikes, because the  warring sides in Bosnia will hopefully see reason.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Prestwick shares dive on profits warning PRESTWICK Holdings, the printed circuit board manufacturer, warned yesterday that it would incur a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 3.7m for the year to July 31 and would be forced to pass the dividend on its cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares. The company's ordinary shares fell sharply after the warning and closed 12p lower at 29p while the preference shares lost 35p to close at 58p. The warning follows the resignation early last month of Mr Wayne Osman, the group's former chief executive who had run Prestwick since 1990. Mr John Gilhooly, a senior figure in the electronics industry and deputy chairman of Albacom, became acting chief executive and deputy chairman. Mr Gilhooly instigated a 'major strategic review' of the business against the background of erratic customer demand, price pressures and increased raw material costs which have continued to affect trading. The review highlighted the problems Prestwick has had with a number of small acquisitions it had made over the past 2 1/2 years. 'We have suffered very badly from not digesting the small acquisitions we have made,' said Mr Alastair McKie, executive director, yesterday. 'Not only did they not contribute, they incurred losses.' A projected Pounds 3m operating loss for the current year comes after Pounds 2.1m in provisions for non-recurring items including obsolete fixed assets. Mr McKie said all of the operating losses are attributable to these 'smaller business units'. In addition interest costs are expected to total about Pounds 700,000. Because the loss will eliminate distributable reserves the company will be unable to declare a further dividend in respect of its 7.25 per cent preference shares. However, the group intends to restore dividend payments 'at the earliest possible date,' probably following a capital reorganisation. The company said that as a result of the strategic review 'vigorous management action' is being taken to reduce costs, implement profit improvement programmes and strenghthen financial controls. As part of this process Mr McKie said the group was being organised into three operating companies, one comprising the smaller business units and the other two based on the group's Ayr and Irving plants. The group emphasised that the trading prospects of the core business remain sound and that it continued to enjoy the support of its principal bankers. The preliminary results are expected to be released at the end of September.</p>

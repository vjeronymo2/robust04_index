			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Contract trading on Eurotrack forced to close FUTURES and options contracts on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index of the top 100 continental European companies will stop trading next month due to lack of demand, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) said yesterday. Liffe said the derivative products would be suspended indefinitely following the expiry of the June 1992 contracts on June 17. 'Clearly we are disappointed by the current lack of demand for these products, but we recognised prior to the launch that they may be ahead of their time,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe. The suspension of futures and options based on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index follows a decision by Soffex, the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange, to halt trading in futures and options based on the Eurotop 100 stock index due to poor demand. Volumes for pan-European index derivative products have proved disappointing; for example, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 Index futures contract, which was launched in June 1991, had a daily average volume of 13 contracts and has traded a total of 2,802 contracts. By comparison, the FT-SE 100 index future contract, based on the top 100 UK companies, had an average daily volume of 9,200 contracts in April. The London Stock Exchange has signed agreements with US exchanges - including NYSE, CBOT and CBOE - allowing them to create derivative products based on the Eurotrack 100 Index, but so far none of the US exchanges has done so. Mr Jenkins said Liffe would 'continue to monitor the need for pan-European stock index derivative contracts, with a view to launching suitable products once demand is judged sufficient to ensure a reasonable level of liquidity'.</p>

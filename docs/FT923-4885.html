			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Campaigning doctors outrage Bonn THE German health minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, yesterday publicly snubbed the country's medical profession as a result of a virulent campaign against his plans for reforming the health service. He withdrew his acceptance of invitations to special meetings in Bonn and Cologne, saying in a letter to the heads of two leading medical associations, that his opponents had broken the basic rules of decency and overstepped the limits of good taste in a series of newspaper advertisements. These included charges that the scheme amounted to 'disguised euthanasia', and a copy-line: 'Die early, cost less.' He would examine the factual evidence submitted by the profession, he wrote, but attending the meetings in the 'emotionally heated' climate would be 'meaningless'. Mr Seehofer's plan - approved by the cabinet in July - to reduce annual federal contributions to the state-subsidised health service by DM11bn (Pounds 3.9bn), has been strongly criticised by doctors and dentists. The main targets are proposals to limit the number of doctors in the national health service, cuts in fees, prescription limits and increased charges for patients. Several medical groups yesterday dissociated themselves from the advertisements, published at the end of last month and paid for by a Berlin doctors' organisation, and asked for the dialogue to start again as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Hartmannbund, representing 50,000 practising doctors and 10,000 students, yesterday launched a new protest campaign, and started raising a petition signed by patients. The drugs industry, which will have to contribute to the economy drive through a 5 per cent cut in drugs prices, has run a low-key campaign and offered alternative reductions designed to achieve the same budgetary effect as Mr Seehofer's across-the-board cuts. The health insurance groups, which claim their outgoings are increasing at double the rate of their income from contributions, have welcomed the reforms. There has been no significant protest from patients.</p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Spring warns against N Ireland select committee MR DICK SPRING, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday warned that the UK government should not set up a select committee on Northern Ireland. His comments came amid continuing speculation that the understanding forged last week between the government and the Ulster Unionist party would lead to the creation of a cross-party committee of MPs. The party's nine MPs backed Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the critical Commons votes on the social chapter, having made clear that they expected changes to restore 'accountable democracy' to Northern Ireland. Mr Spring said the Irish government had to take notice of the assurances from Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the British government had not reached a deal with the Ulster Unionist party. He underlined, however, the need to ensure that events at Westminster over the past few days 'should not cause any further difficulties for Anglo-Irish relations'. Mr Spring said: 'At this stage it would be unwise to start addressing this problem on a bit-by-bit basis. The only way is by bringing about an overall agreement acceptable to both communities.' He added: 'This will involve compromise, hard decisions and hard choices. And I don't think anything should be done in the meantime, like, for example, setting up a select committee.' The terms of the understanding between the UUP and the government are clouded. Both say there has been no formal agreement, but the UUP sees longer-term benefits from its backing for the government. The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist Party leader, last night accused Mr Spring of an unwarranted interference in the affairs of a sovereign state. He said: 'If John Major has any integrity at all he must demand that Dick Spring and the Irish government desist from this intolerable interference.'</p>

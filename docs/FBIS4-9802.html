			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gustavo Lomelin and Georgina Howard; quotation </F> marks as published]    [Text] Miguel Mancera Aguayo set aside his bluntness -- he  seems more cordial -- but does not lose his seriousness when he  says the new economic strategy is "appropriate for the times  through which the country is going. He rejected the notion  there might be risks of currency instability, saying the central  bank's independence will strengthen states' initiatives.    With only a few hours remaining before leaving to occupy the  new post of governor of the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), Mancera  admits: "It is a great challenge and an enormous responsibility  that we will have to face." Now, as of 1 April, "no state agency  or institution will be able to pressure the central bank into  approving credit "without the government board's approval," and  that, he insisted, "is very healthy for the economy."    In brief statements to this newspaper after being sworn-in  before the congressional Permanent Commission of the Union as  new Banxico governor, Mancera weighs the experience of deputy  governors Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Francisco Gil Diaz, Ariel  Buira, and Jesus Marcos Yacaman. He adds these are people who  are very familiar with the country's financial system.    Franciso Gil Diaz, also interviewed by EL FINANCIERO, said:  Banxico's greatest challenge, starting with this new legal  framework, will lie in each of us getting to know what will be  our responsibilities. "I have been with the bank for 25 years,  and, nevertheless, I still have to get used to the institution,  its new provisions, as well as its financial operations."    Gil Diaz added he believes Banxico officials, who will be  assuming this responsibility, will have to do a little more of  the same and "exert a little more effort" because we all have  had specific duties; some even had operational obligations in  addition to local obligations.  <H5>  The Key: Budget Independence </H5>   When asked how there can be budget independence within an  official structure, the up until now under secretary of revenues  of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP)  explained: New legislation allows the bank to handle its own  budget.    Wages, for example, are established with a stipulation that  could subordinate the bank due to the higher wages its officials  earn. Bank supervision is included in the law, but under a  different agency in order to prevent "supervisory" elements from  being used to apply any pressures; "in other words, everything  is well established."    Mancera agreed this operation is in accordance with legal  provisions included in Banxico's new legal framework. Gil Diaz  recalled a new bank organization law had been enacted starting  from the constitutional reforms. The new law includes  stipulations on the central bank's activities.  <H5>  Strengthening of Currency Exchange </H5>   Mancera had to wait more than two hours to take his oath of  office because the legislators could not see eye to eye on  whether to appoint Miguel Montes. He did not reject any of the  questions. Instead he tried to be as precise as possible. "The  national bank's autonomy will aid in correcting the financial  situation and strengthening the currency." He did not evade any  questions either. The situation the country is facing, he  added, will not affect the peso's stability in the least. The  bank has had no reason to intervene because exchange rate  activity has stayed within normal boundaries.    He predicted the activity surrounding the dollar-peso  exchange rate will not affect the economic outlook, as they will  tend to level off. Proof of this is that Mexico has not needed  to use any of the $6 billion the Clinton administration has  offered. He said the central bank's new autonomous nature will  help to strengthen the national currency. He denied it would  create division between the state and the people, as a Popular  Socialist Party legislator has charged. The draft bill, now  approved, is clear about this issue and is consistent with the  state's authority.    The basic issue here, he added, is there will no longer be  indiscriminate credit for any agency. This is, he commented,  consistent with the country's process of economic opening and  modernization.  <H5>  Foreign Approval </H5>   According to several analysts, local and foreign banks alike  have welcomed the appointment because "Miguel Mancera Aguayo's  experience and dedication within the Mexican financial system is  well proven." They also said he has the international financial  community's recognition, support, prestige, and respect.  Analysts from the Deutsche Bank, Banamex, Bancomer, and the  Swiss Bank agree it is precisely he who "knows Mexican financial  policy inside out."    Directors at Banpais have said the new structure of the Bank  of Mexico plus Miguel Mancera Aguayo at the helm are a guarantee  that the financial policy will not drift off course, financial  reorganization will continue, the corporation's resources will  be safeguarded, and investor confidence will grow.    Analysts from Deutsche Bank, the Bank of Montreal, and the  National Bank of Paris have said the central financial agency  must continue its clear and efficient performance in order to  protect the peso. They say the current challenge will be to  maintain and consolidate Mexico's economic, social, political,  financial, and monetary stability.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 24 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal  Kovac's Office today described ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's  allegation that the head of state violated his constitutional  duty and civil rights by refusing to call a referendum as a  distortion of the facts.    Meciar made the claim last Saturday [21 May] that in early  March Kovac refused to call a referendum on early elections and  on the abolition of the mandates of "turncoat" deputies and on  the origin of the money used in privatization although more than  350.000 signatures required by the constitution were collected  on the petition for a referendum. Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) intends to lodge a complaint in  parliament, the Council of European and at international human  rights organizations.    "The intention to submit the fabricated affair to  international organization could only be aimed at casting doubt  about Slovak Republic being a democratic country if its  president allegedly violated the constitution. The HZDS  leadership has placed its partial interests above the interests  of the republics and its good name abroad," says a statement  issued by the Presidential Office and given to CTK today.    The statement points out that because of the lack of some  data on the petition lists, required by the law, the number of  valid signatures decreased to less than 325,000, less than  legally required for a referendum. The statement says that the  petition rolls are still at everybody's disposal to check the  correctness of the Presidential Office's decision.    These facts confirm that the president could not call a  referendum and that he did not violate the constitution. On the  contrary, by calling a referendum he would have violated the  constitution, which the president would not do, the statement  says.</p>

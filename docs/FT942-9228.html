			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Barclays Bank Having ploughed headlong into the commercial property slump, Barclays is trying to manage its way out. By issuing property-linked bonds to investors, the bank has created a useful hedge against its outstanding loans to property companies. If Barclays has done its sums right, pain caused by any worsening of the commercial property market will be offset by the pleasure of repaying the bonds at less than face value. But the Pounds 150m Barclays hopes to raise is only a drop in the ocean when set against its Pounds 4bn outstanding property loans. Nor does yesterday's issue transfer credit risk off the bank's balance sheet, so no additional capital is released. Were that its aim, Barclays might securitise some of its property assets or sell troubled loans in the secondary market. Both techniques have been used extensively by US banks. But securitisation is more expensive to arrange than yesterday's index-linked bond, while the secondary market price for troubled debt is unattractive. With property loans down to around 7 per cent of UK assets from 9 per cent at the peak, Barclays' over-exposure to property certainly looks less acute. Commercial property bulls might even question the decision to reduce exposure going into the upturn. Still, fund managers of that persuasion could always back their judgment by selling Barclays shares and buying its new bonds instead.</p>

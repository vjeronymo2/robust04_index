			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA has determined that the very ambitious January 1, 1994, compliance deadline was unrealistic. Despite the extraordinary efforts by both the FAA and operators of part 139 certificated airports, full compliance has not been possible. An extensive survey by the FAA in the fall of 1993 indicates that approximately 60% of certificated airports will be in compliance with &sect;139.311(a)(3) on January 1, 1994. The other 40% of certificated airports are working hard towards compliance. The first step that an airport must do is develop a sign plan in conjunction with airport users and submit it to the FAA for review and approval. This process has been completed and all certificated airports now have approved signs plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has concluded that a combination of factors has prevented airports from full compliance. First, there are only a handful of manufacturers of airport signs. As a result, these manufacturers have order backlogs. Once the signs are ordered, it takes approximately 12&hyph;16 weeks for sign delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, implementing the new sign system requirements typically involves much more than just ordering and erecting the new signs. Installation at many of the certificated airports requires electrically rewiring circuits for the runways, taxiways, and signs because the existing systems cannot handle the increased electrical loads. In some cases new electrical vaults need to be constructed. In other cases, electric lines have to be installed where none now exist. This wiring can encompass significant construction; frequently the wires have to be installed across runways, taxiways, and other paved areas. This signage and electrical work is further complicated by the need to keep the runways and taxiways operational during construction to the maximum extent possible. An additional factor is the varying construction seasons from region to region. In some areas the traditional construction season has been affected by unusual weather disasters, such as the major flooding that occurred during the summer of 1993 in the midwest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, many airports have had to redesignate taxiways that previously had nonstandard designations. All taxiways on airports certificated under part 139 will now be designated by a letter(s) of the alphabet or alpha numeric(s). The process of renaming taxiways increases the scope of the signage work and requires additional time to phase in to assure that users have adequate time to familiarize themselves with the new designations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has concluded that a further extension until January 1, 1995, for compliance with the sign installation requirements of &sect;139.311(a)(3) is necessary and reasonable. The time extension will obviate the need for numerous exemptions to airport operators. This extension is not expected or intended to delay the date by which the actual signage work will be completed. The FAA does not intend to grant any further extension to the rule deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Joint Aviation Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA has determined that a review of the Convention on International Civil Aviation Standards and Recommended Practices is not warranted because this rule merely extends the compliance date of an earlier final rule that incorporated the recommendations and standards proposed by ICAO for new sign systems through Advisory Circular 150/5340&hyph;18C entitled ``Standards for Airport Sign Systems.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Approval <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This final rule will not change the reporting requirements. Therefore, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), there are no additional requirements for information collection associated with this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Economic Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA has determined that this rule is not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the economic and technical feasibility of this final rule, which is summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule amendment would amend the compliance date for certain airport signs required by the FAA from January 1, 1995. The current rule has a deadline of January 1, 1994. Approximately 40% of the certificated airports are still not able to comply for reasons beyond their control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule will not impose any costs on society by extending the compliance date. There will be no incremental costs associated with this final rule since only the date for compliance is being extended. The FAA has concluded that there will be no degradation of safety as all certificated airports have installed the more critical safety-related signs required under part 139. In addition, the 40% of certificated airports that have not yet installed the remaining required signs are working on an expedited basis to remedy the situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has concluded that the rule change will be cost beneficial because unquantifiable benefits in the form of less disruption and more opportunities for minimizing compliance costs for airport operators can be achieved without compromising airport safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> International Trade Impact Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule will affect domestic airport operators, primarily. The rule will have no impact on trade for U.S. firms doing business overseas or for foreign firms doing business in the United States. There are no expected additional annual costs associated with this rule and, therefore, it should not create an economic disadvantage to either domestic or foreign air carriers operating in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a rule has a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA's criterion for a ``substantial number'' is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one third of the small entities subject to the rule. The size threshold annualized cost level in December 1983 dollars is $5,400 for airports. Using the GNP Price deflator and adjusting to 1990 values, this threshold becomes $7,387. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule is of a cost-relieving nature and would therefore afford cost savings to small airport sponsors. The impact of the cost of complying with the sign requirements are expected to be quite small, however, since operators will still be expected to meet the same requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

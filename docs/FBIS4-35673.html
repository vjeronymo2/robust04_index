			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 28 (AFP) -- Iran on Saturday banned all  importers from buying hard currency on the open market in a bid  to cut demand for the dollar and halt the slide of the rial.    The new measure, which caps a series of efforts to curb  imports, requires all foreign purchases to be ordered instead  through the country's state banking system, the Central Bank  said.    It also requires importers to register their orders at the  Commerce Ministry and present a certificate of exchange from the  banks before being able to release their goods from the customs  office, it said.    In the past two months, the ministry has been authorizing  the  release of imported goods only if the owner deposited an equal  amount of cash at the bank.    These restrictions, often costly and time-consuming, had so  far applied only to state companies, while private importers  could still turn to the open market for their hard currency.    The latest measure is designed to further tighten imports,  which have dropped from 23 billion dollars in 1992 to seven  billion dollars last year, according to official figures.    The restrictions on imports have been adopted to cut private  demand for hard currency and enable the government to repay some  30 billion dollars in short and medium-term foreign debts.    The fall in imports also came as Iran's trade partners  refused to honor Iranian letters of credit after the country  came up with a payment arrears of some 13 billion dollars.    Iran has since managed to reschedule or refinance some seven  billion dollars of its debts, but it will have to pay the trade  partners from four to five billion dollars by the year 2000.    Tehran earned about 14 billion dollars in hard currency in  1993, mainly through oil sales, according to Western economic  experts in Tehran.    Another aim of the new measure is to curb the activities of  the open currency market, which is often blamed for the rial  losing about 50 percent of its value against foreign currencies  since November.    Several certificated money-changers in the capital have  stopped their operations, with many others expected to follow  suit.    Speaking to AFP on Saturday, one money-changer said the  government was running the risk of creating a black market by  cracking down on authorised dealers.</p>

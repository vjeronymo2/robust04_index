			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming increases profits by 59% ROBERT FLEMING Holdings, the privately-owned merchant banking group, yesterday reported a 59 per cent increase, to Pounds 76.6m, in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March. The sharp rise came after minority interests and transfers to inner reserves and marks the first time the group has reported at a pre-tax level. Mr John Manser, chief executive, said that the year had been 'satisfactory without being brilliant'. Earnings per share rose from 68p to 116.1p and a final dividend of 23p gives a 33p total, up 20 per cent. Asset management again provided the bulk of earnings from the Pounds 27bn of investments under management worldwide. Banking, including the loan book, foreign exchange trading and leasing had a good year. The capital markets and corporate finance area were also 'active', Mr Manser said. Securities broking was the one area of weakness, largely due to the group's involvement in Japan, Mr Manser said. In Europe, improvements in the UK stockbroking were offset by a decline in European operations. Jardine Fleming, the Hong Kong-based investment bank jointly owned by Robert Fleming and Jardine Matheson, increased post-tax profit by 14 per cent to Dollars 84m (Pounds 45m) and shareholders funds by 21 per cent to Dollars 191m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic by </F> Marko Winter in Belgrade; date not given: "Serbia Hopes for  Stabilization Despite Sanctions"]    [Text] Serbia now has the fifth government since the first  multiparty elections in 1990. Mirko Marjanovic, who has been  prime minister since March, was a well-known business manager  before. He took office in a complicated political and --  notably -- economic situation. The program of stabilization,  which has been implemented since the end of January 1994, has,  however, already yielded the first positive results. Marko  Winter talked to the 56-year-old government head in Belgrade.    [Winter] You were trying to set up a government of national  unity, but the majority of the opposition did not participate.    [Marjanovic] My main target was a government that would  implement the program of financial reform and economic recovery  of the country as successfully as possible, for that is in the  interest of all citizens, regardless of their political  orientation. This explains my desire to get people from all the  parties represented in parliament into the government. At the  same time, I also insisted in personalities that were not linked  to any party, but have expert knowledge, and are clearly  committed to the program of the modern market economy. The  deputy prime minister and other ministers are, therefore, not  members of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS].    It was a mistake for the most important parties of the  opposition not to have accepted the offer. Particularly since  the majority of the population supports the program.    [Winter] What are the consequences of the sanctions against  Yugoslavia in your country so far?    [Marjanovic] The direct economic damage currently stands at  $20-30 billion. Almost 1 million men and women of the total  work force of 2.2 million are without work. Capacity  utilization in the industry only stands at 30-40 percent. The  gross per-capita national product has been halved within a  period of two years. We have lost many markets in the world and  on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The standard of  living, particularly of low- income earners and pensioners, has  fallen dramatically. Considerable disturbances have been created  in the spheres of education and social insurance. We had to  spend a lot of money on taking care of more than 600,000  refugees.    [Winter] And the political effects?    [Marjanovic] Despite the severe economic and social  consequences, the sanctions have not been able to destabilize  the country politically. In principle, the great majority of  citizens sticks to its support for that part of the Serbian  people that now live outside the borders of the FRY. Since the  beginning of the "Yugoslav crisis" we have struggled for a fair  and peaceful solution that protects the interests of the Serbs  in the same way as it protects that of the Croats and Muslims.  The sanctions have become useless, anyway, because we have  fulfilled all UN demands. In Serbia and Yugoslavia we are  creating a democratic society and a modern market economy, which  is why we have the right to be a member of the international  community with equal rights.    [Winter] What does your program of stabilization focus on?    [Marjanovic] Our main objective is to overcome  hyperinflation and restore trust in the dinar. In addition,  stable conditions should be created for an increase in  production and for more jobs. In the first three months we  managed to put a halt to the increase in prices. Our foreign  currency reserves are sufficient to guarantee the convertibility  of the dinar. The state budget is again fed by real revenues,  and there are first signs for a recovery of production. These  are encouraging results and great changes compared to 1993.    [Winter] What is most important for you now?    [Marjanovic] Well, now it is most important to maintain  discipline in the state budget and to reduce last year's deficit  radically. The austere financial policy must continue to  guarantee the stability of the dinar. Third, we will practice  active social policy to help those that are temporarily without  work as a result of the sanctions and the transition to the  market economy. I am primarily thinking of programs of  reeducation and support for a rapid development of small- and  medium-sized enterprises. I am an optimist in this connection,  and expect that we will conclude the year 1994 under  considerably more stable conditions, with economic growth, and a  higher standard of living.</p>

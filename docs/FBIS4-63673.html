			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 20, BNS -- Cabinet members from the  Estonian Rural Centrist Party [ERCP], Reform Minister Liia Hanni  and Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar, announced today after a  party council meeting that they will not quit.    Ministers from the National Independence Party and the  Social  Democratic Party announced their decision to continue in the  government earlier.    The ERCP council didn't regard the situation in the Cabinet  as a government crisis, but blamed it on personality clashes not  rooted in differences over policy.    "The survival of the coalition in the parliament confirms  that this isn't a government crisis," the party council  maintained.    "Regarding Laar as the reason behind the disagreements,  several younger ministers want to solve the conflict through  replacing the prime minister. We think it's politically  shortsighted to use the premier's guarantee to the Lekto  company's loan as a pretext to replace the head of the  government," the ERCP council statement reads.    The party council holds the opinion that, in the interests  of  democratic development, the Pro Patria congress must be given an  opportunity to discuss and resolve the differences of opinion  between its ministers.    Justice Minister Kaido Kama, who resigned on Thursday [19  May], claimed in an interview to BNS that several other Cabinet  members from the National Independence Party and the Rural  Centrist Party were considering stepping down.    Hanni said at a news conference today that she continuously  discussed the situation with the ERCP council, but that she  never considered leaving the government.    "We mustn't attach overmuch importance to what happened, but  seek solutions and spend more thought on the future. Pro Patria  must itself solve its differences, since a quick stabilization  of the situation is necessary with a view to the upcoming  elections," Hanni told BNS.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Warning on police reforms NO SIGNIFICANT structural or constitutional changes should be made to the police service without a Royal Commission or independent inquiry, police authority members said yesterday. About 200 representatives from county councils and metropolitan authorities met at the House of Commons to discuss reform proposals. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, has indicated he is considering radical changes that could include reducing the number of forces in England and Wales from 43 to about 25, centralising funding and replacing locally elected councillors on police authorities with nominees. But Mr John Smith, vice-president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said elected members should remain a 'significant' proportion of authorities.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE: OFFICE BUILDINGS STEPPING UP SECURITY SERVICES;  </P> <P> CRIME: THESE DAYS, EMPLOYEES WHO WORK LATE WANT ASSURANCE THEY WON'T MEET  STRANGERS IN THE CORRIDORS AND MAY EXPECT AN ESCORT TO THEIR CARS.  </P> <P> It's 2 a.m., and you are finally ready to leave work.  </P> <P> The office feels like a cavern. The corridors are dim. The elevator seems to  take forever. And the parking garage is barren.  </P> <P> Maybe it's time to start shopping for new office space.  </P> <P> Today, building security is a topic sure to come up in lease negotiations.  Buildings without a comprehensive plan are increasingly shunned by businesses  looking to relocate. Tenants are demanding more attention to their safety, and  commercial landlords are offering a wide range of security services.  </P> <P> Instead of living with fear, a simple call to the building's security station  can summon an escort to the car. Specially programmed elevators and  credit-card-controlled door locks help ensure that unwelcome guests don't get  access to offices.  </P> <P> And cameras watch every exit and corridor for any suspicious activities.  </P> <P> All this technology also presents what a few critics consider a more ominous  side.  </P> <P> Some companies have gone so far as to install retina scanners that use an  infrared light to "read" a person's eyes and determine if they are one of the  people allowed to enter a particular area.  </P> <P> Every move can be tracked by computer. With doors and elevators that require  access codes or cards, it's easy for building managers and bosses to get a  computer printout of who has been where and when. The computer tracks entrances  and exits, elevator rides and even trips to the toilet.  </P> <P> Whatever the technology's implications, demand keeps growing. Last year, the  security industry raked in somewhere between $9 billion and $17 billion. About  60% of that was spent on commercial security systems and services, according to  the Security Industry Assn. An estimated 1.1 million people are employed in  private security.  </P> <P> "It's playing an ever-increasing role in the leasing of properties," said  Christopher Galante, director of public safety for Heitman Properties Ltd. in  Beverly Hills. "Tenants are more aware of it than ever."  </P> <P> Landlords are required by law to protect tenants from reasonably foreseeable  harms. This, said William L. Rinehart, director of corporate security at  Tishman West Cos., "has created a burden on property owners to create a secure  environment for tenants and visitors."  </P> <P> Rinehart's company manages about 30 office buildings, all of which have some  sort of security program.  </P> <P> "We deal with very sophisticated tenants, and they're very conscious of  security and safety," he said. In fact, Rinehart added, he often sits in on  lease negotiations so that tenants can query him on the details of how they  would be protected if they leased in the building.  </P> <P> Tenants want to know: What systems are in place? How is access controlled? How  do guards handle a person's walking out of a building with office equipment?  What kind of training do the guards get? How are the security personnel  dressed?  </P> <P> When it comes to deciding on where to move, noted Rinehart, no detail is  considered too small.  </P> <P> "Anybody can gain access to the building with a business suit and create  mischief," warned Aydin (Turk) Bircan, president and chief executive officer of  ISS Security Services Inc. in downtown Los Angeles. "In the daytime, the office  buildings are quite vulnerable."  </P> <P> Some of the buildings served by ISS include the recently built First Interstate  World Center, the garment district's Cooper Building and Burbank's Fine Arts  Building.  </P> <P> Tenants seek protection from a wide range of undesirables such as disgruntled  ex-employees, crazed clients, dishonest office workers and organized groups of  thieves, known as "office creepers," who make their way through whole  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> There is a limit, however, to the scope of protection offered by most landlords  and the security companies they hire.  </P> <P> Most guards are instructed never to use physical force -- that's left to the  law enforcement officers. The guards also very rarely carry guns. Arming the  guards is too great a liability for most landlords and security companies.  </P> <P> Besides, said Bircan, "we don't want a shoot-out at the building." Instead,  most guards walk their rounds unarmed and log their scheduled stops either on  paper or with a computerized system.  </P> <P> Mark Hazan, vice president of operations at Trizec Properties Inc. in Encino,  doesn't believe in guns either.  </P> <P> "We would never confront an armed robber," said Hazan. The role of security is  primarily to help protect tenants in case of a fire or earthquake. And, he  said, "we don't want to give the impression of being a maximum security  building."  </P> <P> "You want to develop a tough reputation," noted Fred Dickey, operations manager  for United Security Industries in Santa Monica. Still, he said, his guards do  not use force but summon the police.  </P> <P> Tenants in many of Dickey's buildings have card-key access that automatically  keeps track of their comings and goings. Each card is programmed in such a way  as to allow access to certain areas at certain times of the day. Employees who  are not supposed to be at the office over the weekend, for example, are  automatically denied access as soon as they try to use their cards.  </P> <P> Some employees have also been known to arrive at work only to find they have  been fired when their access codes to elevators and offices have been  deactivated. It has become an increasingly popular strategy with employers who  want to make sure a fired employee doesn't get a chance to steal anything from  the company or tamper with computer data. Instead, fired employees make it only  as far as a reception desk, where they find their personal belongings packed  along with a paycheck.  </P> <P> As sophisticated as these systems get, though, "security can't be everywhere at  once," said Dickey. "We expect the tenants to tell us when something suspicious  is going on."  </P> <P> Sophisticated equipment also requires sophisticated staff to manage it. Many  guards are paid about $8 an hour and have only minimal training. It takes about  six to eight hours to prepare for California's guard exam, reported Dickey.  Though most security companies provide more than one day's training, the limit  is about a week.  </P> <P> Finding qualified personnel is a constant problem. "The labor market is bad,"  Dickey said. Then, too, most office towers only have a few guards. First  Interstate World Center -- with about 60 to 70 cameras and 20 guards working  the day shift -- is a notable exception.  </P> <P> "All the monitoring systems in the world are useless unless people understand  what to do," said Michael R. Collins, executive director of management services  for Metropolitan Structures West Inc., the managing partner of California Plaza  at Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We teach our people to notice if behavior is unusual," he said. "All our staff  is part of our security system."  </P> <P> 'It's really more of a concierge service," conceded Collins, adding: "It's not  been demonstrated that there's much real danger to working in an office  building. There are perceived fears, but they're not as real as people think  they are." Cal Plaza's six daytime and eight nighttime guards, he said, serve  more as a deterrent than anything else.  </P> <P> Businesses that occupy a whole building have long taken responsibility for  their own security. Now, businesses in office buildings with many tenants are  doing the same. The law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom has 65  security people protecting its various offices, reported John Van Valkenburg,  the firm's chief of security.  </P> <P> Attorneys and secretaries alike can be escorted to their cars at late hours;  somebody watches the premises over the weekends; computer rooms are guarded,  and computer systems are monitored to avoid penetration by hackers.  </P> <P> Skadden, Arps tries to keep its security services very low-key, Van Valkenburg  said. "We don't want a prison environment."  </P> <P> Tenants -- especially lawyers -- can't be too careful these days, advised Bob  A. Ortiz, executive vice president at Cushman Realty in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Among other precautions, he advised, computer and file rooms should be designed  and built in such a way that nobody can enter through ventilation ducts or drop  ceilings. Companies that don't take such preventive measures to secure their  operations, he said, may be found liable to clients who suffer as a result.  </P> <P> Cushman's clients are demanding more and more security from the buildings they  occupy, Ortiz said. But, he said, "the best security is security you don't know  is there."  </P> <P> Only in Hollywood would 300 people show up at 8 a.m. on a Friday for the  private movie screening of Dick Tracy courtesy of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. It  was all part of a June 15 gimmick orchestrated by these commercial brokers to  woo some of their clients and raise money for the West Valley Area Police  Activity League's support of the Haven Hills battered women's shelter in Canoga  Park.  </P> <P> "We wanted to do something different from the corporate cocktail party," said  event organizer and Cushman &amp; Wakefield branch manager Bruce Arden.  "They're so boring, don't you think?"  </P> <P> Last year, the company entertained its prime clients and their families with a  screening of Batman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEVELOPMENTS  </P> <P> Centerpointe La Palma Project Completed  </P> <P> Birtcher of Laguna Niguel and Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York recently  completed the $40-million third and final phase of Centerpointe La Palma -- a  42-acre mixed-use project on the border of Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> Included in the 850,000-square-foot development are four free-standing  restaurants, two retail complexes, seven-office/R&amp;D buildings, a 162-room  Days Inn hotel and four office buildings ranging from three stories to seven  stories in height. The $110-million project was started in 1985 and, according  to Birtcher, occupies more than two-thirds of the city of La Palma's  commercially zoned land.  </P> <P> Bowers Perez Associates of Irvine announced the opening of its $25-million  Raymond Commerce Center at a 18.7-acre site in Anaheim that once served as a  plant for Laura Scudder potato chip operations.  </P> <P> Located at 1525 N. Raymond Ave., the project's first phase includes 17  buildings that total 235,000 square feet of office and industrial space for  sale. A second phase is set to include another 60,000 square feet of small  space to be sold as industrial condominiums.  </P> <P> In Corona, developer Nathan J. Leanse of Beverly Hills is completing a 12-acre,  $11.8-million light-manufacturing and distribution business park within the  Corona Spectrum. The business park includes three buildings totaling 234,460  square feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SALES  </P> <P> Japanese Pay Top Price for Retail Center  </P> <P> Kowa Real Estate Investment Co. and Sogo Co. Ltd. have agreed to pay what's  probably the highest price per square foot for retail space ever in Southern  California.  </P> <P> The Japan-based companies plan to buy an approximately 90% stake in the  soon-to-be-completed Two Rodeo Drive Project in Beverly Hills for what the  sellers described as "well over $200 million."  </P> <P> The 135,000-square-foot retail complex is to be sold in two stages by a group  of investors that includes San Francisco developer Douglas L. Stitzel,  Berisford International of Britain and developer Scott Malkin of New York. Kowa  is a subsidiary of the Industrial Bank of Japan; Sogo is said to be Japan's  biggest department store chain.  </P> <P> Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan has agreed to acquire half of Laguna Niguel-based  developer Birtcher for more than $100 million.  </P></p>

Beginning in 1996,  the system of guaranteed rice procurement prices will be  changed, whereby only the year's first rice crop will be  procured. Instead of growing a second crop, farmers will be  encouraged to grow green manure or let the land lay fallow. The  government will make up the price difference or offer farmers  subsidies for fallow land. The Council of Agriculture stressed  that this change in the guaranteed rice procurement price is  necessary to soften the impact on agriculture of our country's  accession to GATT. The council also noted that it hopes  farmers' interests will not be affected by this change. Shen  Wei-Kuo has filed the following report:    [Begin Wei-kuo recording] The Council of Agriculture  convened a meeting on rice procurement and marketing on 13  January. (Fu Le-yeh), head of the Agriculture and Food Grain  Department, noted that beginning in 1996 the present system of  guaranteed rice procurement prices will be changed, whereby only  the first rice crop will be procured. As regards the second  crop, the government will encourage farmers to grow green manure  to enrich the soil or let the land lay fallow. The government  will provide a subsidy of NT [New Taiwan] $27,000 yuan for every  hectare of fallow land. If the farmers want to grow a second  crop of rice instead of switching to food grain, then the  government will continue procuring the rice in an appropriate  manner and help them adapt. [passage omitted]    (Fu Le-yeh) stressed that balancing production and  consumption as well as maintaining self-sufficiency remains the  government rice policy. The rice acreage will still be 400,000  hectares, and the annual output target will still be 1.6 million  metric tons [end recording].</p>

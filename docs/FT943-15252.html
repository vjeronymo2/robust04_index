			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Italy ride luck and history to see off Spain  -For the Azzurri, results are mattering more than how they are playing The way things are going, Italy will win this World Cup: not because the Azzurri are the best team - charitably, on current form, they would barely scrape into the top 10 of the 24 who qualified - but because they have a winning formula. It works like this. Play like drains; be savagely criticised back home for performance; and allow one or other Baggio to score the necessary minimum of goals. It worked against Spain in the quarter-finals on Saturday, as it had against Norway and Nigeria. For much of the match, the presumed contest between Italian offence and Spanish defence leavened by speedy counter-attack never materialised. Spain controlled most of the game and rarely used their fleetness while Italy, competent defence apart, showed all the inspiration of soggy, over-cooked penne. But the Italian defence held - tenuously - and the Baggios did their bit. In the 26th minute, Dino, the game-winner against Norway, found himself with a bit of room 25 yards out and bent a right-footed out-swinger past Zubizarreta in the Spanish goal. Roberto's fake run across the middle may have momentarily screened the Spaniard from a clear view. Spain drew level after 58 minutes on a deflected shot from Caminero and proceeded to dominate. More than that, Salinas, a second-half substitute, should have disposed of the increasingly tired Italians after 82 minutes when set free alone in front of Pagliuca 10 yards out. He mis-kicked embarrassingly. That set the stage for Roberto Baggio; previously, an early blocked shot excepted, he had been a mostly marginal performer. After 87 minutes, an instinctive flick from Signori, only introduced after the break, set him loose on the right of the area. Checking the scoreboard clock for dramatic effect - his equaliser against Nigeria came a minute later - Baggio deftly rounded Zubizarreta and right-footed it under the covering Abelarde from an acute angle. Spain, quietly impressive throughout the tournament, with as many goals (nine before Saturday) as anyone, must wonder why they lost a match they played well enough to win. There was less down the flanks than in previous matches from Ferrer and Sergi, who was withdrawn after an hour and less than a minute after helping to set up Caminero's goal. But otherwise few feet were put wrong, and particularly not Caminero's. The answer can only lie in history and familiarity. Spain have never gone beyond the quarter-finals, and 16 of the players on the pitch on Saturday had taken part in the European Cup final not so long ago between AC Milan and Barcelona. AC's 4-0 victory was a lot more convincing than Italy's 2-1, but the result was the same. For the Azzurri, these days, it matters less how they play the game than how it turns out. And history is on their side. In 1982, in Spain no less, their early matches were also undistinguished, but then Paolo Rossi got untracked. Two Baggios may yet equal one Rossi.</p>

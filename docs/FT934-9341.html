			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Unions seek GCHQ meeting CIVIL SERVICE union leaders are stepping up their campaign for union membership at GCHQ with demands to see Mr John Major, the prime minister, in an effort to break a deadlock in talks. Two hours of discussions between the five leading civil service unions and Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, on the possibility of ending the nine-year ban on union membership at the Cheltenham eavesdropping centre, ended in impasse yesterday. Union leaders said they were disappointed but not surprised at the outcome which they said hinged on the government's fears over the possibility of conflicting loyalties among union members. The Cabinet Office said that the request to see the prime minister was being considered.</p>

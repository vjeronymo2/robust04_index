			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Management: Successful to a degree - Critics are forcing business schools to re-think the way they approach the MBA qualification The Master of Business Administration qualification, once seen as the indispensable element in senior managers' and companies' development plans, is no longer the only way ahead for ambitious executives. The harsh international business climate has prompted some companies to ask why business schools continue to turn out highly numerate and analytically able graduates - 'quant-jocks' - who seem unable to exercise the arts of management and dealing with people. Part of the problem stems from the way MBA courses are structured in the US, where the degree originated. Its business schools now produce more than 70,000 graduates every year. US business schools vie with one another for official accreditation. The previously rigid criteria imposed by the main US accrediting body had led to undifferentiated programmes. Critics of the MBA system in the US have raised a number of questions: Why do business schools persist in emphasising case studies (made famous by the Harvard Business School) which analyse yesterday's issues? How can the MBA adapt to the demands of a complex global business environment instead of a stable home market? Will the schools produce chief executives capable of leading businesses which can meet society's higher standards on ethical and environmental matters? Where are the leaders capable of negotiating complex joint ventures with foreign companies and of motivating increasingly diverse, multi-cultural workforces in the US? The situation in the UK is different because British MBAs were essentially an unknown quantity until the early 1980s. British business schools also have more diverse curricula. Nevertheless, some employers are disillusioned. A survey by Her Majesty's lnspectorate last year of 52 companies and those business schools in the former polytechnic and college sector uncovered widespread doubts about course quality, language and information technology training, and personal skills development. The MBA provision received support from only a minority of employers. Most saw it as irrelevant to the needs of their companies. There was concern about the growing number of institutions which offer the qualification. It was felt that some teaching staff lacked relevant business experience. Doubts were also expressed about the quality of some courses. The lack of an accreditation body, such as the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, leaves UK providers vulnerable to such charges. Only 27 UK business schools are recognised by the Association of MBA's. But there are 116 institutions offering MBA programmes, in spite of the difficulties in recruiting teaching and research faculty in subjects such as accounting and marketing. A shake out is a real possibility. The recession is held responsible for a recent fall-off in applications. Students paying full fees favour the leading business schools, but even these have placed expansion plans on hold. Smaller, less well-known providers may have to withdraw from the MBA market altogether. It is a common misunderstanding that the MBA is a quick-fix conversion course, allowing students to tick off the acquisition of knowledge in functional areas - marketing, accounting, finance, production - and then graft on a strategic management component derived from prepared case studies. Some second-rate programmes may achieve little more. The better programmes, however, provide education rather than training, personal development rather than technical expertise. They recognise that, in the time available, it is impossible to teach advanced specialist knowledge of the functional areas: this is the preserve of a few of the leading graduate schools. Instead they ensure that students receive adequate grounding in finding ways of crossing artificial corporate internal barriers and of identifying strategic solutions. Most programmes culminate in a consultancy project in which students participate either individually or in small teams. Managers taking part-time MBA programmes are likely to work in their employing organisation on a problem which would otherwise be neglected or handed to consultants. Business schools can produce powerful evidence of the value of MBA programmes - and not just in terms of the salaries their graduates are likely to receive. Managers taking a full-time course are often career-shifters, seeking to move into different functions or organisations. Those sponsored by their employer are often seen as potential high-fliers. They study while remaining in their jobs, moving in new career directions during or after completion of the MBA. Recent changes in MBA programmes promise greater relevance to corporate needs. Flexibility of provision has become the watchword. In addition to the traditional 21-month programmes of the London and Manchester Business Schools and 12-month programmes offered by most providers, there are modular courses for a consortium of companies or for a single company (such as Lancaster University Management School's MBAs for British Airways and VSEL). There are also distance learning programmes, some with world-wide student participation. Most significantly the leading business schools can point to their graduates who embody the knowledge and skills required in modern management. There have been advances in teaching the management of information technology as well as in the availability of hardware. The curriculum is constantly reviewed in most schools. Again the American parallel is instructive: most leading US schools have recently completed a fundamental review of their curriculum. De-regulation of the curriculum in the US, together with successful innovation in European business schools, is creating a competitive international environment. Leading US schools recruit European students and some European schools reciprocate, while both look to Asia for highly-motivated students. Perhaps the most encouraging trend is away from injections of knowledge and facts towards integrated study based on practical projects requiring the student to analyse, reflect and develop rounded management aptitude. Some desirable attributes - leadership ability, motivation, breadth of vision, global awareness, coping with ambiguity - cannot readily be taught; but the best business schools have demonstrated that they can facilitate their development. These trends suggest that the MBA will continue to serve as the standard international qualification for those intent on becoming senior managers. The threat, however, is that some corporations are developing their own management education programmes without a commitment to specific business schools. Top business schools not only need to offer quality MBA courses, but they must also include pre-MBA and post-MBA provision.

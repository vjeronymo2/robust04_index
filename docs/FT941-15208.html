			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Nationalist leads in Crimean election Ukraine's Crimean peninsula yesterday held presidential elections, which were dominated by issues of nationalism, Reuter reports from Simferopol. Early returns last night showed Mr Yuri Meshkov, a communist lawyer, to be well ahead of Mr Nikolai Bagrov, who backs continued Ukrainian jurisdiction over the autonomous republic and is the only one among the six candidates to do so. However, Mr Meshkov, who says Crimea can only prosper if it rejoins Russia, appeared short of the 50 per cent of the vote required to achieve victory in the first round. Ethnic Russians make up about 70 per cent of the 2.5m residents in Crimea, where a lengthy election campaign has been punctuated by three murders and allegations of dirty tricks. Crimea was transferred from Russia to Ukraine as a gift in 1954. Officials in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, had hoped that Mr Bagrov, head of the regional parliament, would pick up late support from people fearing chaos were a nationalist to win.</p>

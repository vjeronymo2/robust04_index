			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Taxation Office of Russia, the Central  Bank of Russia and the Finance Ministry have issued a ruling  making it possible to tax and fine the hard currency accounts of  factories and organizations if their ruble accounts have been  exhausted.    Deputy head of the Taxation Office Nikolay Ivanov told the  Financial Information Agency that as the payment crisis was  raging in the country, numerous factories, organizations and  commercial banks failed to pay taxes or tried to delay the  payments by keeping their cash in hard currency accounts.    This step will enable the Taxation Office to collect  significant amounts. As of April 1 various organizations owed  the budget about 5.5 trillion rubles.    Ivanov emphasized that the ruling provided for very strict  penalties for bank officers who failed to carry out the  procedure.    He also said that the Finance Ministry, the Taxation Office  and the CBR have submitted to the government proposals on  tighter controls over bank and factory managers as far as rules  of storing, using and transferring cash were concerned.</p>

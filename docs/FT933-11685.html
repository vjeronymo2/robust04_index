			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hambros shares jump as Norwegian claim settled SHARES IN Hambros gained 15p to close at a five-year high of 360p yesterday after the merchant bank announced that it had settled one of the two large Norwegian claims against it relating to the collapse of the late Hilmar Reksten's shipping empire in the 1970s. Hambros was being sued for Pounds 200m, plus interest on that amount since 1989, by the Norwegian Guarantee Institute, which had guaranteed Mr Reksten's loans, and by the trustees of Mr Reksten's estate. Mr Reksten died in 1980. Yesterday Hambros said it had reached a settlement with the trustees under which they had withdrawn all their allegations in the proceedings and future litigation by them was prohibited. In return Hambros Bank has made a Norwegian Kroner payment equivalent to about Pounds 7.25m. However, the company emphasised that the payment had been made 'with no admission of liability.' Hambros, which has always considered the trustees' claim to have been ill-founded and in breach of a settlement made more than 12 years ago, said it had agreed to the settlement 'in order to avoid substantial legal costs and demands on senior management time.' The negotiations which led to the settlement were instigated by the trustees and began in May after Hambros won a court case in Oslo. In the other Reksten-related case brought by the Norwegian Guarantee Institute the court did not award costs in its judgment in February.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Salwa al-Ustuwani and "news agencies": "Tehran </F> Reaffirms Support for Palestinian Opposition Factions"]    [Text] Damascus -- An Iranian Majles delegation headed by  Deputy Speaker Hasan Ruhani has started talks in Damascus with  Syrian People's Assembly and other senior Syrian officials.    In Damascus yesterday, a highly placed Iranian official  reaffirmed Tehran's support for the 10 Palestinian factions  opposed to the PLO-Israel Gaza-Jericho autonomy agreement.    A Palestinian spokesman said that Iranian Deputy Majles  Speaker Hasan Ruhani emphasized that position when he met with  the leaders of the 10 factions at the Iranian Embassy in  Damascus yesterday.    The spokesman said that the talks covered the situation in  the region after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and that the  Iranian official reaffirmed his country's support for the  Palestinian intifadah against the Israeli forces in the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip. He added that the discussions also  covered means and ways of providing aid for the intifadah and  the 10 factions.    Ruhani, who leads a high-ranking delegation, told reporters  on his arrival in Damascus the day before yesterday that he was  carrying two messages for Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad from  'Ali Khamene'i and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani on the issues of  peace, the Gulf region, and bilateral relations between the two  countries.    Some observers in Damascus believe that the two messages  also  deal with President al-Asad's forthcoming visit to Tehran  scheduled to take place in the second half of this month.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOMB DAMAGES TRUCK AT GRAVEL COMPANY  </P> <P> A homemade bomb damaged a tractor-trailer truck at a Canyon Country gravel  company Wednesday night, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The explosion occurred at 7:40 p.m. at the P.W. Gillibrand Co. in the 13000  block of Lang Station Road, said Deputy Hal Grant.  </P> <P> The company was closed at the time, and there were no injuries.  </P> <P> The bomb had been placed between the engine and the cab and caused "moderate to  extensive" damage, Grant said.  </P> <P> A dispatcher for Gillibrand said the company had not received any threats and  that the vehicle belonged to a Palmdale man. "He parks his truck here at  night," said dispatcher Jo May, adding six trucks are normally parked in the  lot.  </P> <P> Last week a pipe bomb was found at the California Highway Patrol scales on the  northbound Antelope Valley Freeway near Via Princessa. The bomb was removed and  there were no injuries. "There doesn't appear to be any relation between the  two," said Sheriff's Department investigator Gary Stuart.  </P></p>

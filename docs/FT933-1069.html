			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian banks post advances in run-up to privatisations BANCA Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, the two big Italian banks about to be moved fully into the private sector, yesterday both reported substantially higher first-half earnings. The figures were announced as the Rome government approved legislation for privatisations. The changes allow for the introduction of 'golden shares' and abolish the previous ban on the state lowering its stake in public-sector banks below 51 per cent of the capital. BCI, the bigger of the two banks, said that pre-tax profits reached L387.1bn (Dollars 243m), net of L325bn in loan loss provisions, unrealised losses on securities and depreciation. No comparable figure was released for the first half of 1992. Earnings before taxes, depreciation and provisions, but after extraordinary items - the only figure allowing a direct year-on-year comparison - showed a strong improvement. Profits amounted to L866.8bn for the six months, against L601.5bn. BCI said earnings had been boosted by a 10.9 per cent rise in interest margins to L1,423bn and rapidly expanding fee-related business, which jumped 56.5 per cent to L824.4bn. Operating costs, however, continued to rise at well above inflation, with an increase of almost 9 per cent to L1,312.6bn. Credito Italiano's first-half profits amounted to L133bn after tax and provisions. As with BCI, no comparable half-year figure for 1992 was given. Credito Italiano made net profits of L208bn for the whole of 1992. Gross operating profits jumped 55 per cent to L632bn from L405.5bn in the first half of last year. The improvement was driven by a 17 per cent rise in interest margins to L1,203bn and a 55 per cent leap in fee-based income to L532bn. At BCI the ratio of bad loans to total lending rose to 2.3 per cent from 2 per cent. At Credito Italiano the ratio reached 2.56 per cent. The Italian government is to extend the suspension of capital gains tax until June 30 1994. The cabinet approved a decree on the extension yesterday. The suspension, which was warmly welcomed by the Milan bourse when it was implemented after long delays, has been seen as one of the most important factors stimulating Italian share prices this year.</p>

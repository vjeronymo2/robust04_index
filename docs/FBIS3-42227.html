The troops, including women soldiers, opened fire from two  cars at a group of Fatah Hawks sitting on the road in the Rafah  refugee camp. Salim Muwafi, the Hawks leader for the camp, was  killed and another Palestinian wounded.    The Hawks fired back, wounding two members of the army's  undercover unit, the sources said. The army sent in  reinforcements and imposed a curfew as explosions were heard in  the camp.    The armed wing of Fatah agreed to a ceasefire after the  Israeli-PLO autonomy accord was signed on September 13.    But dissidents took up arms again after the army shot dead a  leading Hawk, Ahmad Abu-Rish, in November shortly after he had  been pardoned. The dissidents said earlier this week they had  mounted seven anti-Israeli operations.    Muwafi was the 1,173rd Palestinian killed by Israeli gunfire  in the six years of the intifada against Israel's rule of Gaza  and the West Bank, according to an AFP toll.</p>

These clashes resulted in the death of four Republican  Guards  personnel in the Baghdad International Fair area.    These clashes came on the heels of sweeping arrests and the  confiscation of some $2 million from the ranks of foreign  currency dealers.    AL-BILAD has also learned that foot patrols have been  deployed in areas suspected of being used for foreign currency  dealings. Stringent instructions have been issued to the Iraqi  customs officials along the borders in the Tirbil area, asking  them to institute several measures, including body searches of  departing travelers. They were ordered to search for and  confiscate any kind of currencies, and to refer to court anyone  found in possession of undeclared currencies. The Iraqi customs  officials were also instructed to search incoming and outgoing  vehicles and confiscate anything that looks to be excess  luggage, even if it is cigarettes, personal effects, and leather  jackets, in particular.    The Iraqi border officials were also instructed to enforce  certain measures regarding Arab travelers leaving Iraq.  Foremost among these measures is that Arab residents who want  to leave Iraq must obtain departure permits from the Arab  Citizens Affairs Department, regardless of the time they have  spent in Iraq, even if it is only 24 hours. This supersedes an  earlier regulation which stipulated that only those who stayed  in Iraq for one month or longer were required to obtain  departure permits.    Also, all Iraqi hotels of the first, second, and third  classes have been ordered to obtain boarding charges from Arabs  in dollars. This regulation applied only to first and second  class hotels in the past.</p>

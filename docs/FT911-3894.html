			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Kuwaiti politics shows dark side THE LIGHTS may be on again in Kuwait City, but not, it seems, for the fledgling opposition parties. Their attempt yesterday to hold a press conference to comment on the composition of the new government, just hours before the visit of Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, left everyone literally in the dark as the plug was pulled on the lighting system of the ballroom at the International Hotel. 'Things are really going to get hot here now. We can already see what this new government is going to be like,' said one opposition leader as his colleagues, journalists, television crews, the hotel management - and the wife of a US senator, dressed in medical garb - milled in confusion around the ballroom. The seven main opposition groups had called their press conference for 10am. The management of the hotel then claimed that no booking had been made, therefore no press conference could be held. On to the scene came Mrs Cindy McCain, whose every second sentence reminded the listener that her husband is Senator John McCain (Republican, Arizona). Senator McCain's political career has, apparently, not been prospering of late. Mrs McCain was also due to give a press conference in the ballroom about the work of her American Voluntary Medical Team, which she founded five years ago and which explained her attire. Sadly for Mrs McCain, who travels with her own television team, she failed to grasp the attention of the audience, and, after a few minutes, offered to donate the rest of her allotted time to the gentlemen from the opposition. At this point, the hotel management had to come clean. There was not going to be an opposition press conference in the hotel now, or perhaps at any time. To emphasise the point, the ballroom was plunged into darkness. Questions about the origin of the order met no response. 'It's obvious what is behind this,' said Dr Sami al-Katrash, an economist from the University of Kuwait, carefully avoiding greater precision. Mr Mohammed al-Kabiri, a former ambassador who in the last eight months had the unusual distinction of being jailed in Kuwait by both his own government and Iraq, was less cautious. As the press conference informally reassembled in the open air, Mr al-Kabiri said the newly constituted government was not representative of anyone. The occupation and liberation of Kuwait had changed nothing, he asserted, except that the opposition was now stronger and was determined to see the introduction of democracy, especially freedom of speech.</p>

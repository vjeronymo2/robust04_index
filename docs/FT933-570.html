			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery nerves Troubled Brent Walker, reporting increased losses and warning of continued caution over current trading, was said to have prompted a large seller of Allied-Lyons on nervousness regarding the pub leasing arrangement between the two companies. Allied has leased Brent Walker more than 730 pubs as part of the government's Beer Orders, and the poor Walker figures combined with warnings from the group over its hefty interest charges led some to speculate that Walker may wish to terminate the arrangement. Allied fell 12 but rallied to close just 3 off at 560p. Turnover was an average 2.5m. Walker edged up to 7p. Speculation that Allied is about to sell its Grant of St James spirits business to Matthew Clark intensified after the latter was suspended at 470p. However, Clark would have to raise close to its market capitalisation of around Pounds 60m to secure the business. Analysts said the move would be seen favourably for Allied.</p>

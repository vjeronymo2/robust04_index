			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / People: International Business Communications Lord Rees-Mogg, editor of The Times between 1967-1981 and recently making his own headlines with his critique of prime minister John Major's performance, is going onto the board of International Business Communications as a non-executive director. IBC, which runs conferences and publishes newsletters, saw its shares dive to 1.6p at the end of 1990. 'We are quite pleased that the price has now climbed to 8 1/2 p' says chief executive Peter Rigby. But why should Lord Rees-Mogg, who sits on the board of GEC, be interested? 'He runs his own newsletter (Strategic Investment)' Rigby replies 'and he takes an interest in newsletter subscription publishing'. IBC's chairman was Sir Roy Watts, the former chairman of Thames Water who died suddenly last month. The company says it is looking for a new chairman, but that Rigby will assume the position temporarily.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Chinese revolutionary leader dies: First death among the eight 'elders' VETERAN Chinese leader Li Xiannan has died in Beijing at the age of 83. Li was president for a five-year term from 1983, and is the first of China's eight 'revolutionary elders' to die. His death was announced yesterday by the official Xinhua news agency. He had been in poor health for some time. In March illness kept him from the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely powerless body, of which he was chairman. Li was one of the first Chinese leaders to appear on national television after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in June 1989, to defend the army's handling of 'the turmoil'. A self-taught economist who favoured central planning, he supported China's modernisation process after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution but became increasingly concerned about the economic liberalism of the reformers. Li championed a more orthodox economic approach in the traditional Marxist mould, identifying himself with the leftist economic policies of the post-Mao period which are now under official criticism. His death removes another obstacle to the reform process favoured by the most powerful revolutionary elder, Deng Xiaoping. Born in 1909 to a peasant family in Hubei province, Li worked as a carpenter, joining the communist party at the age of 22. A veteran of the Long March, he became governor of his native province after the Communist victory, moving to Beijing where he became finance minister and a member of the politburo. Of all China's senior politicians he was alone in weathering the political storms that have afflicted China since 1949, surviving even the Cultural Revolution as a supporter of Premier Zhou Enlai when almost all Zhou's colleagues were purged. After that, Li played an important role in arresting the Gang of Four in 1976, among them Mao's widow Jiang Qing. In the largely ceremonial post of president, Li travelled the world, and in Beijing played host to national leaders, among them the Queen and Mr Ronald Reagan.</p>

A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Appeals requests that A submit certain documents as substantiation for the tax matters at issue. Although A complies with this request, the information is misdirected and not considered by Appeals. Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency. A does not file a petition with the Tax Court. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A convinces Appeals that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. Appeals then closes the case showing a zero deficiency and mails A a notice to this effect. Assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied, A may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date). To recover these costs, A must file a request for costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled A's tax matter, or if that person is unknown to A, with the District Director of the district which considered the underlying matter, within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that A owes no tax. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume the same facts as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> except that after receipt of the notice of deficiency, A meets with an Appeals officer, but no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. A then files a petition with the Tax Court and prevails. Since the underlying tax issues have been determined by a court, the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for recovery of the reasonable administrative costs incurred by A. To recover reasonable administrative costs, A must file a claim with the Tax Court as prescribed under the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;301.7430&hyph;3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative proceeding and administrative proceeding date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative proceeding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of section 7430, an administrative proceeding generally means any procedure or other action before the Internal Revenue Service that is commenced after November 10, 1988. However, an administrative proceeding does not include_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Proceedings involving matters of general application, including hearings on regulations, comments on forms, or proceedings involving revenue rulings or revenue procedures; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Proceedings involving requests for private letter rulings or similar determinations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Proceedings involving technical advice memoranda, except those submitted after the administrative proceeding date (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Proceedings in connection with collection actions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), including proceedings under sections 7432 or 7433. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Collection action.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A collection action generally includes any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax (or any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax) or any action taken by a taxpayer in response to the Internal Revenue Service's act or failure to act in connection with the collection of a tax (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax). For example, a collection action for purposes of section 7430 and this section includes any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service under Chapter 64 of Subtitle F to collect a tax. Collection actions also include those actions taken by a taxpayer to remedy the Internal Revenue Service's failure to release a lien under section 6325 and to remedy any unauthorized collection action as defined by section 7433. However, an action or procedure directly relating to a claim for refund filed with the Service Center's Collection Branch or District Director's Collection Division after payment of an assessed tax is not a collection action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative proceeding date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, the term administrative proceeding date means the earlier of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The date of the notice of deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals is the final written document, mailed or delivered to the taxpayer, that is signed by an individual in the Office of Appeals who has been delegated the authority to settle the dispute on behalf of the Commissioner, and states or indicates that the notice is the final determination of the entire case. A notice of claim disallowance issued by the Office of Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. Solely for purposes of determining the administrative proceeding date, a notice of deficiency issued by the Office of Appeals is not a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of deficiency.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A notice of deficiency is a notice described in section 6212(a), including a notice rescinded pursuant to section 6212(d). For purposes of determining reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment described in section 6223(a)(2) will be treated as a notice of deficiency. A notice of final S corporation administrative adjustment issued pursuant to section 6223(a)(2) as made applicable to subchapter S items by section 6244 will also be treated as a notice of deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals office conference. At the conference, an agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. A cannot recover any costs because they were not incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date, which is the earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, or the date of the notice of deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

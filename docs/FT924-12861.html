			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Economics Notebook: Questions over the transfer of western skills SINCE the fall of the Berlin Wall, the transfer of western expertise has been seen as vitally important for the creation of democratic, market-based economies in former communist states. But in the case of the newly-independent states of the former Soviet Union, efforts to provide policy advice and economic know-how are running into trouble. 'Technical assistance' is the catch-all term used to describe the provision of such advice and expertise by the industrialised nations to countries such as Russia, the other former communist states and countries in the developing world. For the former Soviet republics, which are having to build their market economies and democracies from scratch, it covers a wide spectrum of activities. Earlier this year two international conferences - at Washington in January and Lisbon in May - identified 12 priority areas for technical assistance to the former Soviet Union. These ranged from support for the creation of democratic systems to micro-economic goals such as the restructuring of small and medium-sized enterprises, the development of financial services and the conversion of defence industries to peaceful uses and social policy issues such as the provision of adequate health, housing and social security. On October 29 and 30, a follow-up conference of ministers and senior officials from some 70 donor and recipient countries and from interested international organisations will gather in Tokyo. It is likely to face calls for a big shake-up in the present system of transferring expertise. Ahead of the meeting, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been assessing the provision of technical assistance and humanitarian aid to the former USSR and found it wanting. The OECD is in a unique position to judge because since July 1 it has been operating a computerised electronic data system, known as the 'register', which enables it to act as a clearing house of information on technical assistance and humanitarian aid to the region. The register contains information on about 750 requests from the republics for assistance and on 2,600 activities that donors have undertaken or offered. Although the OECD admits that it is not yet perfect, the register has exposed gaps in the donors' aid efforts and mis-matches between what the republics want and what the industrialised countries are prepared to offer. In the field of humanitarian aid, insufficient help has been given in the areas of shelter, housing and construction. On the other hand, there have been cases of duplication in the provision of food and medicine to Russia. The OECD says there are significant gaps in the provision of technical assistance to tackle environmental problems. The number of projects aimed at supporting democratic institutions is also small. The recipient countries would like more advice on how to run their health services and how to convert their defence industries to peaceful uses. They are less interested than the donors in offers of assistance to develop management skills or comprehensive economic reform plans. Both recipients and donors seem unhappy about aspects of the delivery of the assistance. The newly-independent states complain about being overrun by consultants and self-styled experts in missions that lead to no results. Western capitals have come to dread the arrival of visitors from the former Soviet Union who seem more intent on shopping than securing expertise. Beyond these irritants, there is a bigger question over whether the strategy for delivering technical assistance is correct. The Washington and Lisbon conferences adopted a 'horizontal' approach of providing a large amount of advice and expertise across the former Soviet Union as a whole. It is now generally recognised that this was a mistake. The break-up of the Soviet Union into independent republics demands a more country-specific, case-by-case approach. There are signs that the Tokyo conference will go down this route. The Group of Seven nations' economic summit in July agreed that 'country consultative groups' should be set up for the new states. The idea is that the groups would bring interested international organisations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the European Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and big donor countries such as the US, Germany, France and Britain into close relationships with the individual republics to encourage structural reforms and co-ordinate technical assistance. The European Commission, which is the biggest single provider of a technical assistance to the former Soviet Union, is going down the country-specific route. It is opening national co-ordinating units in each of the republics to review the requests for technical assistance locally before submitting them to Brussels. But nobody is pretending that the future will be easy. Plans to create a technical assistance support group for Russia under the guidance of the World Bank have run into difficulties. Although the bank has more experience than other bodies in handling transfers of expertise, the Russian authorities feel insulted that they will be overseen by what they perceive as a development aid agency. According to aid experts, technical assistance is the most staff-intensive type of aid provision. Matching supply to demand is extremely difficult and programmes are usually 'underdesigned'. Past experience in providing technical assistance to other regions is not encouraging and may explain the rapid onset of disenchantment in the case of the former Soviet states. In 1990, a World Bank study found that many years' efforts to transfer expertise to Africa had been 'highly frustrating' for donors and recipients alike. The efforts in sub-Saharan Africa were 'not resulting in the expected improvement of skills and abilities of individuals or in the enhanced capacity of institutions', it said.</p>

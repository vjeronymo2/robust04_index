			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STRAPPED DISTRIBUTED LOGIC SELLS ITS SERVICE OPERATIONS  </P> <P> Under pressure from its lenders, financially troubled Distributed Logic Corp.  said Wednesday that it has sold its computer service operations in the United  States to Santa Ana-based Novadyne for an undisclosed price.  </P> <P> The cash-hungry company also sold its computer service operations in the United  Kingdom, to British computer firm Sorbus Ltd. The purchase price was not  disclosed.  </P> <P> Distributed Logic also said it expects to report a loss from operations for its  fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Oct. 31.  </P> <P> The service business "has been distracting and the company has been under cash  pressure," said Thomas R. Anderson, chief financial officer.  </P> <P> The Anaheim firm supplies data storage and communications equipment, primarily  for minicomputers manufactured by Digital Equipment Corp. The minicomputer  market has been in a slump in recent years, caught in a squeeze between  low-cost mainframe computers and increasingly powerful personal computers.  </P> <P> Distributed Logic's competitors include two Orange County firms -- Emulex Corp.  in Costa Mesa and Micro Technology Inc. in Anaheim -- and Digital Equipment  itself, which has been slashing prices on peripheral products that boost the  performance of its computers.  </P> <P> For the nine months ended July 31, Distributed Logic lost $2.2 million on  revenue of $33.4 million, contrasted with earnings of $34,315 on revenue of  $37.9 million for the year-earlier period.  </P> <P> The company, in its quarterly statement for the period ending July 31,  disclosed that the losses had drained the company's cash and that it was in  danger of defaulting on its loan agreements if the losses continued. During  1990, the statement said, the company has cut its work force and renegotiated  its long-term debt.  </P> <P> John Wilson, Distributed Logic's president, confirmed the job cuts Wednesday  but declined to say how many people have been laid off in 1990. The company  currently employs 190 people, he said.  </P> <P> Pat Dwight, a spokeswoman for Novadyne, said the computer service company is  "already in the DEC market, so this alliance is good for us." Novadyne was  known as McDonnell Douglas Field Systems Co., a unit of McDonnell Douglas  Corp., until a management-led buyout earlier this year.  </P></p>

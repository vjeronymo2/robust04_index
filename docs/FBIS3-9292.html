			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Omer Ibrahimovic] </F>   [Text] At its 20 March session, the Serbian Consultative  Council decided to propose to the Croatian Coordination  Committee and the Council of the Congress of the Bosnian Muslim  Intellectuals to hold a joint convention of reconciliation  between the Bosniaks, the Serbs, and the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a commentary by Omer Ibrahimovic:    [Ibrahimovic] I do not doubt the good intentions of those  proposing this convention. However, it is obvious that this  proposal was not a result of more elaborate thinking. I suspect  that it was someone's hasty idea that was instantly turned into  a conclusion of this important body. The initial reaction to  this proposal must be a question: Why should these three people  seek reconciliation when they have not been involved in a  conflict against one another?    Even the birds know the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the  consequence of a dispute between three peoples living there, as  the aggressor has been trying to present to the world all this  time. This is a classical aggression by three neighboring states  -- Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia -- over territorial  integrity, independence, and state sovereignty of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was also confirmed by the  international community.    The fact that the aggression was joined by the collaborators  and members of the fifth column from the ranks of its own  citizens, members of all three peoples, which were led by  Karadzic, Boban, and Abdic, does not mean that the peoples were  in the conflict themselves and that they should now seek  reconciliation. With their thesis on the conflict among the  peoples, the authors of the convention for reconciliation, even  though they did not intend it, are, objectively speaking,  marginalizing the aggression and minimizing the responsibility  for aggression.    If anyone should seek reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  then it would make more sense that the Bosnian Serbs, who  remained on the free territory and suffered the burden of the  war together with the other two peoples, establish the  conditions at their upcoming convention under which they would  reconcile with their compatriots who, by joining the aggressor,  fired at them and their children, held them under a siege  without elementary conditions for living, tortured them with all  kinds of blockades, and kept them under the psychological  pressure of their propaganda machinery.    The same applies to the Bosnian Croats and their extremists,  who worked against the interests of their people and their  country, like the Bosnian Serb extremists did by taking part in  the realization of the policy of territorial partition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, trading with its territory, and the  so-called human exchanges of their people, committing at the  same time the crime of genocide against the other two nations  through the so-called ethnic cleansing of their national  territories.    Even after two years of human suffering, all types of  fascism  that emerged in this region are referred to in general terms, as  if the term fascism could not be bear the name of the people who  promoted it.    Therefore, the primary question today is not the  reconciliation of these three peoples. They continued to live  on the free territories, as was the case in the past. The  primary question is under what conditions will the Bosnian Serbs  and the Bosnian Croats reconcile with their compatriots who were  killing their children and destroying their houses and property.    The Bosnian Muslims have already taken their stand by  directly confronting the supporters of [Fikret] Abdic, since all  appeals to reason were understood as the weakness of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, instead of calling for a  convention of reconciliation among the three peoples, it would  be more sensible to ask one's own people on the occupied  territories, as patriots of their homeland of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, to turn their rifles against the fascist  leaders and their followers, who have committed so many crimes  against their own people.    Everyone must understand that, regardless of whether this  convention of reconciliation was held, there will be no peace in  Bosnian until the last refugee returns to his home, even if this  home was burned down, and until the last criminal, regardless of  his nationality, is punished for his crimes.    I would, therefore, recommend to those who proposed the  convention and setting up of various commissions for building  confidence among different peoples to keep clear of bad  business, but to direct their political energy and influence in  the people on the mobilization of people to stand against  fascism and its executors in their own ranks.    Clinton himself recently said that Serbian fascism is the  most responsible for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although one  should not exonerate the Muslim and Croat fascists either. Our  people do not need new illusions and political fog in the form  of reconciliation conventions but an active struggle against  fascism in one's own ranks.</p>

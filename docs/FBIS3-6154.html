Deputy Commerce Minister Churin  Lasanawisit, who is also the chairman of the committee in charge  of a crackdown on violators of intellectual property rights,  said the shop owners have failed to cooperate with the  Department of Internal Trade and Department of Commercial  Registration, thereby hindering the investigation.    The two departments under the Ministry suffered due to this  lack of cooperation since they were unable to get exact  information related to IP [intellectual property] rights  violation. As a result, the entire investigation process turned  into a fiasco. Churin said his committee has ordered the two  Departments to begin investigations once again, adding "If this  time they hesitate to cooperate, the Commerce Ministry will have  to take legal action against them."    The police crackdown last month resulted in the arrest of  130  people. That is a 27 pct [percent] drop from the number of  similar arrests in January. The Department of Commercial  Registration investigated 68 violators of which five faced legal  action, and seven were subjected to a 10,000-baht-fine.  Similarly, the Revenue Department is currently running  tax-related investigations on more than 30 people.</p>

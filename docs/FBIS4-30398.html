			<p>BFN     [Text] At a 22 June session of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs of the House of Representatives, Takashi Kosugi of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party asked Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa how he planned to deal with the issue of North Korea's  past nuclear development and the stalled Japan-North Korea  normalization talks. Answering the question, the foreign  minister said: "Japan has not made it a condition for resuming  the stalled Japan-North Korea normalization talks to clear up  suspicions about North Korea's past nuclear development. It is,  however, important to clear up suspicions about that country's  nuclear development during the bilateral normalization talks  before Japan and North Korea normalize their relations." In this  way, he showed a positive position on resuming the stalled  Japan-North Korea normalization talks.    During the session, Kosugi also proposed that Makoto Tanabe,  former chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, and  former prime ministers be sent to North Korea for  behind-the-scenes negotiations with North Korean officials. In  response, Foreign Minister Kakizawa implicitly welcomed Kosugo's  proposal, saying, "If they want to take the trouble to visit  North Korea, we hope they will do so."</p>
